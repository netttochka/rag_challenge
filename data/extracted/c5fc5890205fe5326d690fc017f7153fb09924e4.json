      "text": "Preface to Beazley 2022 Annual Report and \nAccounts\nA version of Beazley's Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 was originally approved by The Board \non 1 March 2023 and Beazley announced its final results for the year ended 31 December 2022 on 2 March 2023. The final \nresults reported an alternative performance measure of net assets per share that had been calculated using the weighted \naverage of shares for the year. This alternative performance measure was used by Beazley to determine the LTIP awards for \nAdrian Cox and Sally Lake that were initially approved by the Remuneration Committee and included in the Directors \nRemuneration Report.\nIt had been intended that the alternative performance measure would be calculated using the number of shares at 31 \nDecember 2022, rather than using the weighted average of shares for the year. On 7 March 2023, Beazley published an RNS \nentitled ‘Alternative performance measure correction NAVps’, which provided updated information on the net asset value per \nshare calculation. On 8 March 2023, Beazley published an RNS entitled ‘Alternative performance measure correction NAVps – \nupdate', which provided updated information on the LTIP awards for Adrian Cox and Sally Lake once the Board had considered \nthe updated net asset value per share calculation.   \nThe Company, having taken advice, has determined that the annual report and accounts as initially approved by the Board on 1 \nMarch 2023 were neither sent or supplied to shareholders in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, nor \nwere such accounts as a matter of fact, laid before a general meeting of the Company or filed with Companies House. The \nBoard therefore rescinded its approval of the version of the accounts that were approved on 1 March 2023 and, in their place, \napproved this version of the accounts as the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts on 12 March 2023. As a result, this final \nversion of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts reflects the updated figures set out in the RNSs published on 7 and 8 March \n2023. Other than as described in those RNSs and the related changes, no changes have been made to the annual report and \naccounts as initially approved by The Board on 1 March 2023.\nThe Company acknowledges that a hyperlink was contained in the announcement of its final results to the version of the \naccounts that were approved on 1 March 2023 which appeared temporarily on the Company's website. No reliance should be \nplaced on that document which was removed as soon as the error came to light.  \nThe updated information announced by Beazley on 8 March 2023 (which is reflected on page 121 in this 2022 Annual Report \nand Accounts) is set out below:  \n£\nFixed pay\nPay for performance\nSalary\nBenefits\nPension\nTotal fixed \npay\nTotal annual \nbonus \nLong term \nincentives\n(LTI)1 \nTotal\nvariable pay\nTotal\nremuneration\nAdrian P \nCox \nRevised\n2022\n525,250 \n19,760 \n65,656\n 610,666\n787,875\n106,663\n894,538\n1,505,204\nOriginal\n2022\n525,250 \n19,760 \n65,656\n 610,666\n787,875\n245,127 1,033,002\n1,643,668\nAdjustment\n2022\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n-138,464\n-138,464\n-138,464\nSally M \nLake\nRevised\n2022\n414,000\n2,938\n45,960 \n462,898 \n621,000\n71,190\n692,190\n1,155,088\nOriginal\n2022\n414,000\n2,938\n45,960 \n462,898 \n621,000\n179,310\n800,310\n1,263,208\nAdjustment\n2022\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n-108,120\n-108,120\n-108,120\n1  The LTI figures for 2022 have been calculated using the average share price in the last three months of 2022 of 630.7p."

      "text": "Statement of the Chair\nBeazley posted a pre-tax profit in 2022 of $191.0m (2021: $369.2m), and an impressive \n89% (2021: 93%) combined ratio, a result that demonstrates the impact of our disciplined \nunderwriting. I am also pleased to confirm that The Board has declared a dividend of \n13.5p. Our business is grateful for the support of our shareholders, partners and \ncustomers during a challenging year of geopolitical uncertainty. I am particularly proud \nof the confidence our investors placed in us during our equity raise in November 2022, \nwhich will help us further invest in the sustainable growth of our business. \nA specialty insurer that delivers sustainable growth\nOur deepest sympathy is with all the people suffering from the \ndevastation in Turkey and Syria, and those impacted by the \nhuman tragedy of the war in Ukraine. These events have made \nus acutely aware of this kind of geopolitical uncertainty. This \nuncertainty is compounded by the pervasive economic stress \nof high inflation and the cost of living challenges it creates for \nso many. In this environment our role, as a sustainable, \nspecialty insurer, is to support clients and broker partners to \nmanage the additional risks as we all adapt and deliver value \nfor our shareholders. Beazley adds tangible value when things \nare complex, volatile and changing in areas such as Cyber, \nSpecialty, Marine and Political Risk, where we have \nconsistently demonstrated our ability to help our clients grow, \nwhile allowing our insureds to explore, create and build.\nWe believe growth is driven by our ability to assess external \nrealities and use our platforms, people and geographical \nstrengths to lean into emerging opportunities as conditions \nchange, rather than just be dictated by hard or soft market \nconditions. I like to think of this as anticipatory competence. \nDuring 2022 the rating environment in Property insurance and \nreinsurance reached a transition point, as the market \nunderstood that it was unsustainable to continue to \nunderwrite this business in a commoditised way, in the face of \noverwhelming evidence about the impact of climate change. \nThis is a moment where our market expertise and underwriting \ncompetence becomes a differentiating factor and where we \nare able to add real value to our brokers and clients. We are \nexcited about the opportunity these changes offer to grow and \ndevelop our Property portfolio as we move through 2023. \nThis enthusiasm is based on the long-term approach we have \ntaken to Property, which saw our exposure, on both our \nProperty and Reinsurance books within our Property Risks \ndivision, reduce as rates were depressed and the impact of \nclimate change began to be felt. During this time, we invested \nin expertise and modelling tools to explore how the changing \nclimate is impacting Property Risks. The knowledge gained is \nnow allowing us to grow our share of the Property market as \nthe underwriting environment significantly improves.\nOur successful equity raise in November 2022, puts us in an \nexcellent position to take up the opportunity in Property and \nalso deliver against our Cyber ambitions, while extending our \nmarket share across our classes of business, delivering \nsustainable, diversified growth for shareholders across a \nbalanced portfolio. Focusing on sustainable growth has \nresulted in our gross premiums written doubling between \n2018 and 2022 - and saw our US platform reach a significant \nmilestone as it passed gross premiums written of $2bn.\n \n08\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "Strong culture guides us through change \nIn autumn 2022, I assumed the role of Interim Chair of \nBeazley, I was previously the Senior Independent Director and \nChair of the Remuneration Committee. The role of Chair has \noffered a fresh perspective on our business and I have been \nenergised by the exciting future our fast changing and growing \nbusiness has ahead of it.\nOn 25 April, at the conclusion of the 2023 Annual General \nMeeting, I will relinquish this role to our outstanding new \nChair, Clive Bannister and I will return to my previous role. \nClive is currently the Chair of the Rathbones Group plc and the \nMuseum of London. He was previously the CEO of the Phoenix \nGroup plc. He will bring deep strategic, commercial and \ntransformational experience to The Board.\nIn the selection process we drew on our corporate values and \nfounding principles, which have propelled Beazley to be the \nbusiness it is today. We are a value driven, growth minded \nand disciplined company which has created a respectful and \ninclusive workplace and I believe that in Clive, we have a \nleader who embodies these values and who will be an \noutstanding advocate for Beazley.\nOn behalf of The Board, I would like to thank David Roberts for \nhis leadership as we faced the challenges of COVID-19, for \nthe transformation of our executive management team and for \nhis genuine conviction that by creating a diverse environment \nthat is respectful and open, you achieve better outcomes. He \nhas left us a stronger business and we wish him well as he \ntakes up the challenge as Chair of the Court of the Bank of \nEngland.\nI would also like to thank Robert Stuchbery for assuming the \nrole of the Senior Independent Director and Nicola Hodson for \nchairing the Remuneration Committee, while I undertook the \nInterim Chair role. Nicola will remain Interim Chair of the \nRemuneration Committee following the 2023 AGM. \nOn behalf of The Board, I would also like to recognise \nCatherine Woods for her excellent service as a Non-Executive \nDirector, having stepped down following the conclusion of two \nthree-year terms in March 2022. On 31 May 2022, The Board \nappointed two new Non-Executive Directors, Fiona Muldoon \nand Cecilia Reyes Leuzinger. Fiona is a member of the Audit \nand Risk Committees and Cecilia the Audit, Risk and \nRemuneration Committees. They both bring insight and offer \nexperience-led advice to The Board. \nA talented team that champions diverse thinking \nOur company has thrived because our people can thrive. \nPeople are the bedrock on which we continue to build and \ngrow our business. They are a vital asset and one that \nbecomes more valuable over time. Understanding this leads \nus to commit to creating a market leading workplace. \nBuilding a highly differentiated, talented, cross functional \nteam means recruiting and retaining the best people. In 2022 \nwe recruited 410 new joiners and our turnover rate was 10%.\nWe give our people the tools, support and create a learning \nenvironment where they are able to grow in their roles, make \ndecisions and execute with autonomy. By remaining a mostly \nflat organisation, our team knows that they are making \nindividual contributions to the collective success of the \ncompany. This approach results in positive behaviours and \noutcomes and a willingness to seize opportunities - which I \nbelieve is not just what makes Beazley a market leading \nworkplace, but is also the key to our ongoing success as a \nbusiness.\nWe are able to attract and keep top talent because of this \ncompelling culture and the inviting workplace we have created, \nwhich resonates with both new and long-standing staff, as is \nreflected in our annual employee survey. Our engagement \nscore, which measures whether colleagues are willing to go \nabove and beyond for the organisation, was 85% and we \nremain above the global benchmark for both favourability and \nengagement. We continue to see parity in the demographics \nof respondents such as gender, ethnicity, age and length of \nservice to the employee survey.\nOnly with a team that embraces the purpose of our business \nto explore, create and build will we deliver the innovation that \nour clients and broker partners expect. It is no surprise, \ntherefore that during 2022 innovation remained at our core. \nWe collaborated with the market to explore and create new \ninsurance solutions to the emerging or changing risk \nlandscape and in 2022 these included the build out of Carbon \nOffset Invalidation and specialist parametric property \nproducts, and building on our long-standing expertise in space \nunderwriting by offering the first commercial insurance for \nvehicles on the moon. We are constantly looking to the risk \nhorizon to identify where our specialist underwriting can add \nvalue. \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n09"

The overall result, a profit before tax of $191.0m (2021: $369.2m), consisted of a \nstrong underwriting performance, offset by a reduced investment performance, driven by \nmark to market losses as a result of the volatile interest rate environment.\nI am proud of Beazley’s progress throughout 2022. We \ndelivered a strong underwriting result, raised capital that will \nenable us to make the most of a structural change in the \nProperty insurance and reinsurance markets, realigned our \nunderwriting teams to better deliver for clients and launched \nLloyd's first ESG syndicate. All against a backdrop of high \ninflation, an energy price crunch and the overhang of war in \nEurope.\nSpecialty insurance in a time of geopolitical turmoil\nThe war in Ukraine has shaken us all, causing real human \nsuffering; and, as we all take stock, it is right to reflect on the \nimpact it has had on our business. Firstly, the conflict resulted \nin us provisioning for claims directly from the war itself, for \nwhich our estimate of loss remains unchanged since our \n2022 interim report. Secondly, the energy price spike and \nrising inflation caused central banks to increase interest \nrates, leading to mark to market losses in our fixed income \nportfolio resulting in an $179.7m investment loss. Finally, the \nwar has reinforced the value a specialty insurer like Beazley \nbrings in complex situations. From our claims team’s support \nfor mariners injured by missiles in the conflict zone, or \nenabling shipments of grain needed by some of the world’s \npoorest people, to offering clients reassurance as they \nnavigate a complex sanctions regime - the innovation and \nresponsiveness of the Beazley team has shone through and \nI’d like to thank everyone for their hard work and focus on \nsupporting clients.\nSustainable growth \nOur business received a strong endorsement from the capital \nmarkets in November 2022 as we raised $404m in new \nequity capital to support our exciting growth agenda. We see a \nmulti-dimensional opportunity to show our agility and grow in \nresponse to changes in market conditions whilst continuing to \npursue our sustainable long-term growth strategy, which this \nadditional capital will further support.\nThe market dislocation in Property is a signal of structural \nchange as it adjusts to the increased exposure climate \nchange brings. This gives us a strategic opportunity to \naccelerate rather than simply re-grow our Property franchise \n(which used to be a significantly larger proportion of the \nbusiness than it is now) but also to retain more of our Cyber \nand Specialty Risks business.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n11"

      "text": "Chief Executive Officer’s\nstatement continued\nFirm foundations\nOur ability to pivot our business to take up new opportunities \nas they emerge is part of our DNA. Platform strength, product \nand geographical diversity are cornerstones of this. Our \nstrategy is to achieve the successful intersection of platforms \nand products to offer our brokers and clients access to our \nexpertise and specialist underwriting capacity where and when \nthey do business. We believe that a mix of international, \nwholesale and domestic platforms delivers straightforward \naccess to us and adds real value.\nPeople are, of course, Beazley’s most important asset and \nin October 2022 we had to say goodbye to one of the best, \nDavid Roberts, our Chair of five years, who left to become \nChair of the Court of the Bank of England. We are grateful for \nDavid’s leadership and I would like to thank him personally for \nhis counsel and wisdom over his time with us, but particularly \nwhen I transitioned to CEO last year. David’s calm presence \nduring COVID-19 and his personal drive and commitment to \ndiversity and inclusion have had a profound impact on \nBeazley. Christine LaSala has ably assumed the role of \nInterim Chair and returns to her role as Senior Independent \nDirector and Chair of the Remuneration Committee with our \nsincere thanks. I look forward to working with our incoming \nChair, Clive Bannister, who brings a wealth of experience with \nhim which will aid us as we enter the next phase of Beazley's \njourney.\nDeveloping and supporting our employees is crucial to our \nsuccess and in June 2022 we reflected the cost-of-living \nchallenges we are all facing by making a one-off payment of \nup to £3,000 (or equivalent currency) to the people in the \ncompany most impacted. As we approached the end of year \nsalary and bonus cycle this was also upper most in our minds \nand we awarded eligible staff an additional 2% cost of living \npay rise in addition to an average company wide annual uplift \nof 5%. \nWhat we say is what we do \nBeazley believes that fundamentally we must deliver what we \npromise; and in 2022, we did just that with the launch of the \nESG consortium and Syndicate 4321, Lloyd’s first ESG \nsyndicate. Since its launch on 1 January 2022 the new \nsyndicate has offered additional capacity to clients who \nachieve high scores on ESG metrics, the syndicate is also \nhelping Beazley to understand more about how high scoring \nbusinesses operate and test our hypothesis that companies \nwhich do well on ESG criteria are also likely to be less risky. \nWe are using the lessons learnt as part of a wider effort, \nwhich got fully underway in 2022, to embed ESG thinking into \nall our underwriting.\nWe also know that what gets measured, gets done and that is \nwhy in 2019 we set robust and challenging targets for our own \nESG efforts. Specific highlights include targets of 45% of \nsenior leadership roles being held by women, 25% of our team \nbeing people of colour and a 50% drop in carbon emissions, \nfrom 2019 levels; all to be achieved by the end of 2023. \nI believe we are firmly on track to deliver our target on senior \nleadership roles held by women, having reached 43% by the \nend of 2022, and I am delighted to have already hit our 25% \npeople of colour target and reached a 55% reduction in carbon \nemissions (for more information please see pages 21 to 28) \nand I look forward to reporting our progress in next year’s \nannual report, when we will recommit ourselves to additional \nand equally challenging targets for the next three year cycle.\nInsurance. Just different \nBeazley’s Cyber team took a leading role in the market this \nyear on the issue of systemic Cyber risk. If the Cyber \ninsurance industry is to achieve its potential and play its role \nin managing and mitigating Cyber risk, it needs to define and \nbuild parameters that will allow insurers to manage their \nbalance sheet prudently, whilst encouraging more capital to \ncome into the sector. We are fully committed to supporting \nthis adjustment to happen. Innovation has come right across \nour business, from insuring the first commercial moon rover \nvehicle to providing an insurance solution for e-sports events. \nIn early 2023 we launched the market's first cyber \ncatastrophe bond, an innovation that will see new capital \ncome into a cyber market that needs to grow at pace in the \nnext decade to meet business demand. All have the same \ncharacteristics in common - they require a specialist approach \nto insurance as the issues raised are complex; but with the \nright investment they offer significant long-term potential.\nAs you can see from our digital version of this annual report; \nbeazley.com/2022-annual-report, in 2022 we refreshed our \nbrand identity to better reflect the age in which we live. Our \nfresh look and feel retains the essential qualities for which \nBeazley is well known, reflects our three corporate values of \nbeing bold, striving for better and doing the right thing, but \nintroduces a more engaging and forward-looking approach to \ncommunication which better represents how our business is \ngrowing and changing.\nThe support of all our stakeholders is key. Brokers are our \nfirst, vital link in the chain, but the purpose of our business is \nto help our clients explore, create and build their businesses. \nTo better achieve this in 2022 we established our client \nengagement team which will actively ensure clients have \naccess to our full product range and our research and \nexpertise. We see this a two-way process that will allow us to \ndevelop more relevant products and insurance solutions that \nbetter meet the needs of our clients going forward.\nAs we start 2023, and we see positive market conditions, \nBeazley is able to look at that opportunity from a strong \ncapital position, with a talented and committed team and the \nplatform strength and product range to deliver for our clients, \nbrokers and shareholders. For 2023 our growth expectations \nare for higher net premium growth than gross premium growth, \nwith net growing in the mid 20s while gross is at mid teens.  \nThe difference is caused by us no longer writing portfolio \nunderwriting through the Group in 2023 (as syndicate 5623 \nbecame a standalone syndicate and no longer requires the \nGroup to cede the majority of the business written to it), \nalongside our reduction in purchased reinsurance on both \nCyber Risks and Specialty Risks.  These changes have the \nimpact of increasing the net premium growth compared to the \ngross premium growth. Taking the above into account, we \nexpect to deliver a high-80s combined ratio for 2023 \nassuming average claims experience. Although significant \ngeopolitical headwinds remain, I believe we are in an excellent \nposition to sustainably grow our company and I am looking \nforward to all we will achieve together in 2023.\nAdrian Cox\nChief Executive Officer\n \n12\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

We delivered this impressive underwriting result by executing \nagainst our underwriting strategy of deploying specialist products in markets that value \nexpertise and are demand driven, combined with an agility to pivot in new directions as \nopportunities from changing market conditions emerge.\nBalanced underwriting combined with agility \n2022 was a year of global dislocation and complexity, but \nthroughout we remained true to our core values, executing our \nambitious strategy to deliver profitable growth across all lines. \nWe achieved this by underwriting a balanced book of business \nacross multiple platforms, with the agility to respond to \nchanging market conditions. Innovation also remained at our \ncore with the development of new insurance solutions such as \nCryptoGuard and Carbon Offset Invalidation. We also continue \nto evaluate and support various parametric Property products \nto provide the market with solutions beyond traditional \ninsurance. \nMarket conditions moved markedly during 2022. The Directors \nand Officers insurance (D&O) market saw competition emerge \nand a slow down in IPOs and SPACs, resulting in an over \nsupply of capacity and lack of demand driving rates down. \nCyber rates continued an upward path, albeit at a more \nconservative pace following the much needed price correction \nof the previous two years. In Property Risks we have reached a \nmarket turning point, and we anticipate significant rate \nincreases in Treaty reinsurance and the direct Property market \nin 2023. However as the market changes, our approach to \nunderwriting remains consistent – our focus is on underlying \npricing and risk dynamics, market knowledge and experience, \nand standing by our clients.\nNew structure – more specialism\nIn March 2022 we restructured our underwriting teams to \nimprove interconnectivity and achieve synergies. We now have \nan underwriting structure of four more equally sized divisions, \nwhich ensures a balanced book of business and is better able \nto manage short and long tail drivers of risk and reward.\nBringing together the Property insurance and Reinsurance \nteams to form Property Risks, and the Executive Risk and \nSpeciality Lines teams to create Specialty Risks, has given us \naccess to deep and broad insights into market dynamics, \nallowing us to better anticipate trends, identify opportunities \nor raise the alarm if risks are rising. \nMAP Risks underwriters are experts in their specialist \nproducts and segments and while the specifics of risk differ \nbetween classes, their clients are sometimes the same and \noften face similar challenges, making for an ideal environment \nfor cross fertilisation of ideas and growth of our underwriting \nvia our international platforms.\nCyber Risks has exciting growth opportunities ahead as \ndigitalisation sees demand for Cyber insurance protection \ngrow exponentially. As a Cyber market leader, we have the \nexperts in-house who continue to build our comprehensive \nCyber ecosystem and in 2022 led the market wide debate on \ncatastrophic Cyber, to protect our clients, the market and \nshareholders from the growing threat of a Cyber catastrophe. \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n13"

Our SME brokers and clients can now access our \nexpert underwriting team via multiple channels, ensuring ease \nof doing business. In its first full year of trading the new \ndivision has experienced significant increased demand.\nData driven specialists\nTo ensure we continue to add greater insight and build \nknowledge and expertise in exposure management and the \nuse of data, we are actively investing further and adding \nspecialists to our team. Beazley hired its first Chief Data \nOfficer in 2022, appointed a Senior Financial Climate Risk \nSpecialist, and we are focused on building our pricing and \nexposure management team. As we make a concurrent \ninvestment into modelling tools, we will continue to need \nhighly skilled specialists who can turn data into useful tools \nand benchmarks for underwriting action. \nAgility in action \nNew structures, platform strength and a high-quality team are \nthe firm foundations from which we can respond and change \nas market conditions move. In the second half of 2022 we \nsaw movement in Property markets and as rates began to \nharden, we were able to optimise our Property portfolio as \nboth a seller and buyer of reinsurance. Our Property Risks \ndivision will take advantage of this excellent opportunity for \ngrowth as the market is rapidly hardening into 2023. However, \nit will do so in the certain knowledge that the ongoing work we \nare doing to manage climate risk will mean we are not just \nhere for short-term gain but to sustainably underwrite this core \nclass of business.\nD&O, long one of our key areas of specialism, has seen \ncompetition come into the market at a point where our \nassessment is that the risk landscape remains extremely \nhigh. As a result, when we do not believe the rate justifies the \nrisk we have pulled back, reduced our appetite as we continue \nour disciplined approach to underwriting D&O. This is a \ncaution we will maintain in 2023, although we believe the \nmarket will likely stabilise with supply and demand coming \nmore in line. \nOur US business continues to grow, and we hit our goal of \n$2bn gross premiums written through the platform in \nDecember 2022. Beazley’s ‘Insurance. Just different.’ \nmessage resonates strongly in the thoughtful way we \nunderwrite and the client centric approach we take to claims \nin the world’s largest insurance market. Growth also continues \nat pace in Europe, where we see significant opportunities and \nwhere we are investing in underwriting expertise. Our Lloyd’s \nwholesale platform sees our underwriters leading global \nthinking on the challenges our client and brokers face. In \nparticular, we can be proud of innovations that come from our \nspecialist teams in this market, such as underwriting the first \ncommercial insurance policy for projects on the moon.\nWe underpin our strategy by flexing our reinsurance \npurchasing and choosing to retain risk or share it based on \nthe pricing dynamic. This thinking came to the fore in the \nsecond half of 2022 as we anticipated dramatic changes to \nProperty Treaty reinsurance rates, and with our November \nequity raise, we are well placed to retain more risk and profits \non our own balance sheet rather than extend our use of \noutwards reinsurance. \nUnderwriting year\nRate change\nRate change graph 2017-2022 (%)\nCyber Risks\nDigital\nMAP Risks\nProperty Risks\nSpecialty Risks\nAll divisions\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nSuccessful strategy\nI joined Beazley just over a year ago because I was impressed \nby the quality of the underwriting team and the effective and \nconsidered way in which they execute our underwriting \nstrategy. In 2022, it was testament to this approach that we \nhave delivered a 89% combined ratio and seen growth of 14% \ndespite perhaps the most challenging geopolitical situation in \na generation.\nUnderwriting focused on rigorous attention to detail and \ndelivered by a team of experts who question decision making \nand actively value challenge and follow up have been key to \nthis result.\nThis is combined with an agile approach to seizing \nopportunities as they emerge, whilst always keeping the \ninterests of our shareholders and clients at the forefront of \nour minds. These will remain our defining principles \nthroughout 2023. \nCyber Risks\nCyber Risks continued to see strong rate increases of 40% \n(2021: 88%) leading to an increase in gross premiums written \nto $1,156.1m (2021: $814.3m).\nA successful year\nNew business was strong across all geographies with our \nbusiness outside of our core US client base growing \nexponentially. In the US, we are seeing strong demand from \nthe mid-market segment which is driving ongoing growth. \nOutside of the US, demand came from Europe, Asia, Australia \nand beyond and we expect this trend to continue as business \nbecomes increasingly aware of and keen to protect itself from \nthe Cyber threat. The substantial rate increases we have seen \nover the last two years, did begin to moderate during 2022, \nbut they remained at very significant levels, reflecting the \nscale of the challenge that Cyber poses.\nOur positive result reflects the good work we have done since \nOctober 2020, to build our Cyber ecosystem, which focuses \non pre-underwriting and post-loss mitigation efforts. In 2022 \nwe also added our threat intelligence and Beazley Cyber \nCouncil to this offering. \n \n14\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

We also made specific investments into \nthreat and intelligence pilots during 2022, of which, the \nsuccessful ones, will become operational during 2023.\nAdapting now, to grow tomorrow\nWe are a market leader in Cyber and we believe we need to \nuse that position to address the challenges the market faces. \nIn 2022 this saw us tackle the issue of Cyber catastrophes. \nTo date no Cyber attack has been big enough to create a \nwidespread breakdown in essential services; however, we \nhave modelled the possible scenarios and believe now is the \ntime to actively build market awareness and the capital \nneeded to address the threat as the market grows.\nLooking ahead, we believe that the flattening of rate increases \nwill continue through 2023, but we expect that to be a \nmoderation in what have been substantial, but required, rate \nincreases over the last two to three years. We expect to see \ncontinued strong new business demand, particularly outside \nof the US, where we see the mid-market as the largest area of \ngrowth for our Cyber products and services. In Europe and \nacross the globe, we are seeing large corporations seek \ngreater Cyber protection and expect the level of demand to \ncontinue. Our continued focus is on maintaining and \nadvancing our knowledge and understanding of the Cyber \nthreat, and maintaining vigilance about the threat actors and \ntheir changing methods of operation as we move forward.\nIn January 2023 we launched the market's first cyber \ncatastrophe bond and with strong demand from investors we \nexpect to be able to launch additional tranches through 2023 \nand beyond.\nThrough the equity raise in 2022, we are also looking to retain \nmore of the business which we write, and capitalise on future \nprofitability in this division. \n \nDigital\nOur profit before tax of $14.4m (2021: $40.6m), reflects the \nsuccessful build out of our small business proposition across \nour key territories. Demand for our digital underwriting and \ndistribution capabilities continues to grow and our delivery of \n$204.9m (2021: $190.8m) in gross premiums written for our \nfirst year of full operation and combined ratio of 87% (2021: \n76%), demonstrate our success.\nIt is testament to the outstanding work of our team, that in \nour first year of operating as a separate division we have \ndelivered a strong performance. Throughout the year we have \nmade considerable progress in technology innovation and are \nseeing the benefits of a multi-skilled team working across all \nlines of business. \nDigital started underwriting as a separate division in January \n2022. It was created to build on the success of our myBeazley \nportal and to respond to demand from clients and brokers for \naccessible Digital insurance placement for small to medium \nsized risks. Digital gives brokers one Beazley point of contact, \nsupported by a cross functional team, to access multiple \nproduct lines and digital services via their preferred platform \nor channel.\nBy committing to our strategy of meeting the client where they \nwant to be met, we are seeing success across all access \npoints: the myBeazley portal, APIs, on digital market hubs and \nour artificial intelligence enhanced email submission \ncapabilities.\nTake up of each channel differs depending on location. In the \nUS, the prevalent method of placement remains via email, but \nthrough 2022 we have seen a shift to engagement via APIs \nand market hubs. In Europe and the UK, myBeazley has \nestablished itself as a key link in the insurance chain, while \nfor our German business, market hubs or ‘broker pools’ are \nincreasing in use.\nSpecialist insurance for small business\nWe recognise that not all small businesses are the same and \nneither are the risks they face. A small manufacturing \nbusiness has very different exposures to business interruption \nrisk than a small financial consultancy. By leveraging the \ndeep-seated specialist knowledge that we are known for and \nthat is prevalent across our organisation, we are able to \neffectively design and price relevant cover for a myriad of \norganisation types and sizes, which can be accessed at the \ntouch of a button and delivered digitally. \nAt our core, we have a broad Specialist Lines portfolio, \nfocused on lines such as Professional Indemnity, \nManagement Liability, Tech Professions Errors and Omissions, \nMedical Malpractice for small scale health and care services \nproviders, Event Cancellation and Pleasure Craft. During \n2022, we have also matured the way we underwrite flagship \nproducts like Cyber for small business, where we are seeing \nsignificant demand and there is an opportunity to grow at \npace.\nGrowth going forward\nWe remain confident about our growth trajectory going into \n2023 and expect to see moderate rate increases across the \nportfolio.\nService is key, and we continue to invest in the people and \ntechnology of our customer success team who support our \nbrokers with client queries, providing product information, and \ntransacting business. Similarly, our dedicated territory \nmanager sales team continues to grow and expand our \ndistribution by region and by digital channel.\nIn the year ahead, we are targeting growth in all regions. We \nsee plenty of opportunity to expand our digital distribution in \nthe US, and Europe. In 2023, we will also launch the \nmyBeazley portal in Canada, with the support of our well \nestablish specialist teams in Toronto, Montreal and \nVancouver. \nAlthough Digital is tailored for the small to medium business \nsegment, looking ahead, we see opportunities to direct more \ndigitally placed larger risk business to our complex risk \nunderwriting teams via channels such as APIs. \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n15"

Despite \nthis, MAP Risks delivered a profit for 2022, which is a credit \nto the expertise and hard work of our team, who have been \nfocusing on helping clients as they have faced extraordinary \ndifficulties.\nBringing together Beazley’s Marine division with the Political, \nAccident and Contingency division and Portfolio Underwriting \nhas brought synergies and opportunities for cross selling. Our \nspecialist underwriting teams are leading members of the \nLloyd’s market and we see positive opportunities to expand \naccess to their technical skill and sector knowledge by \nleveraging our domestic underwriting platforms: in the US and \nEurope alongside Asia via our Singapore operation, where \nbusiness comes into our Lloyd’s syndicates.\nValue of expert underwriting reflected in rates\nThe rating environment remains buoyant, with an overall rate \nincrease of 4%, although we are now seeing pressure in some \nlines, including Aviation where capacity has returned after \nCOVID-19. The war in Ukraine has impacted a range of \nclasses and as a result we have seen significant uplifts in the \nrating environment in some of these areas. As a responsible \nbusiness we are mindful of the importance of Ukraine as an \nexporter of grain, and the negative impact the conflict is \nhaving on world food supplies, and are supportive of market \nefforts to assist in facilitating the flow of these vital global \ncommodities.\n2022 saw our Contingency underwriting recover from the \nimpact of COVID-19 with positive premium growth and, despite \nrecessionary fears, we expect that trend to continue into \n2023.\nThe value of our Political Risk cover has been fully \ndemonstrated by the geopolitical turmoil of the past 12 \nmonths and we are seeing heightened interest from \nbusinesses looking to protect overseas assets, and the rating \nenvironment remains robust for this class.\nOur Portfolio Underwriting business, which is primarily \nreinsured to an external special purpose Syndicate 5623, has \ndelivered three consecutive years of profit. In January 2023, \nSyndicate 5623 became a full stand alone syndicate, writing \nall Portfolio Underwriting business directly. Beazley will be \nproviding circa 18% of the capacity for the 2023 year of \naccount for this syndicate.\nESG Syndicate 4321 launched in the year and wrote $10.5m \nof premium which the Group has a 10% share of. The \nsyndicate provides additional follow capacity across several \ndifferent classes of business to over 250 Beazley clients with \na strong ESG rating since January 2022, building momentum \nthrough the year. A unique offering, the ESG consortium has \nbeen particularly successful for clients actively seeking to \ninclude ESG within their insurance programme and we have \nregistered strong take up for both Financial Lines and Cyber \nclients in particular, and we are exploring growth opportunities \nin Europe. \nOur specialist underwriters continue to innovate in established \nlines, be it on Marine, Cyber, embedding ESG principles and \nhelping clients transition to net zero, or in underwriting the \nfirst commercial insurance on the moon and acting as the \nleader in the development of insurance for commercial space \nports.\nWhile there are rating pressures beginning to be felt in some \nclasses, the geopolitical turbulence of the last 12 months only \nserves to demonstrate the importance of the specialist \ninsurance and sector expertise that our underwriters \nconsistently deliver. \nProperty Risks \n2022 saw the combining of our Property insurance and \nReinsurance business. Non-catastrophe exposed business \nperformed well contributing to an increase in gross premiums \nwritten to $859.8m (2021: $812.6m). Hurricane Ian has, in \nline with expectations for such a large event, dampened our \noverall result, which nevertheless saw the combined ratio \nimprove to 98% (2021: 106%). \nThe success of work painstakingly done in recent years to \naddress the impact of climate events and refine our risk \nselection, has seen the book progressively improve. With \nmarket conditions reaching a pivot point during 2022, we are \nnow in a great position to reap the rewards. While Hurricane \nIan will see a claims burden in the range of a $120m net loss \nand has undoubtedly had an impact on the 2022 result, we \ncomprehensively plan for events of this size, and it falls within \nour expectations for such an event. \nReady for the future\nThe combined expertise of our Property insurance and \nReinsurance teams is allowing us to look across our portfolio \nstrategically and benefit from both detailed site level insights \nand high-level trends, giving us a bird’s eye view of market \ndynamics. Over time we believe this bottom up and top down \napproach will deliver competitive advantages as we address \nthe sector’s challenges of which climate change is perhaps \nthe most urgent.\nThroughout 2022 we continued to further our understanding of \nand implement enhancements to our underwriting approach \nand analysis around climate risk. We believe we are ahead of \nthe curve, having actively invested in modelling tools and \ntaking steps to embed the learnings into our underwriting \nprocesses. We are also making strides in regards to the \nimpact of climate change on non-modelled perils such as \nwildfire, flood, and severe convective storm. \nOur non-catastrophe business continues to benefit from the \nwork we’ve done in the last few years to improve risk \nselection.

Through \n2022 we achieved synergies and gained insights as we \nbrought together our Executive Risk and Specialty Lines \nteams. \nSpecialty Risks offers scale and diversification over 27 \ndifferent product lines, across global geographies, serving \ninsureds from SME’s to the world’s largest companies. Our \ndistribution methods are equally diverse and include; broker \npartners along the insurance value chain, coverholders, \ndelegated authority arrangements and reinsurance. This not \nonly creates a truly diversified book of casualty business but \nactively offers diversification benefits to Beazley as whole.\nThe newly combined division leverages its expertise and \ninterconnected broker relationships to deliver strong and \neffective cycle management across our diverse book, by \npushing and pulling the relevant levers of geographies, \nplatforms and products and moving our focus as market \nconditions evolve and change. \nActive cycle management\nOur focus on active cycle management lets us see where risks \nare growing, or the rating environment is becoming \nunattractive and move swiftly to protect that business area.\nA good example of how this works is in the current D&O \nmarket cycle. We avoided growing in the depth of the soft D&O \nmarket by methodical underwriting, and when the market \nchanged direction in 2020/21 we stepped up and seized the \nopportunity. As conditions have moderated since the second \nquarter of 2022, we’ve become more selective on rate and in \nsome instances, reduced our appetite. We are hopeful that \nconditions will stabilise during this year and we will adjust our \nunderwriting as opportunity emerges. \nThis year we’ve seen growth across areas where innovation \nplays a key role, such as our Safeguard Product and Beazley \nProduct Solutions embedded reinsurance segment. Here we \ntake a market leading position in these smaller or niche lines \nand invest significantly, giving them airtime to grow at pace. \nThis approach sees us able to move swiftly into new or \nemerging areas where growth potential and client demand is \nhigh for Beazley's unique solutions. Another new area for \n2022 was our geographic expansion of Product Recall to \nSingapore alongside our overall Specialty Risks growth in the \nAsia Pacific region.\nOutperformance is our focus\nDiscipline is the watch word of our approach to underwriting; \nwhile growth makes the headlines, profit is the real mark of \nsuccess. The current economic environment is challenging but \nthe hard de-risking work we undertook during the last \nrecession gives us confidence that we are well placed at the \nstart of 2023. \nOur underwriting capabilities are fully demonstrated by how we \nbehave at these moments and this includes leveraging our net \ngrowth and varying our reinsurance purchasing, to ensure we \ndeliver market share and a positive result in any given year, \nregardless of market conditions. Our November equity raise \nwill see us keep more of our carefully selected risk within our \nown business rather than purchase additional, more \nexpensive, reinsurance thus maintaining our outperformance.\nIt takes discipline to leave our egos at the door, invest in \nfuture business areas and to pull back on some of our most \nrespected classes of business if the rating environment is \nwrong.\nHowever, this mantra is key to our strategy of growing in a \nsmart, sustainable way.\nBob Quane\nChief Underwriting Officer\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n17"

Governance\n1.1 Board oversight on climate-related risks and opportunities\n1.1.1 plc Board oversight\nA summary of Beazley’s corporate governance structure, the general responsibilities of the plc Board and plc Board \nCommittees, on behalf of Beazley plc, are outlined on page 80 of this report. \nA description of how the plc Board, and supporting Committees, have oversight of climate-related issues, is set out in the table \nbelow. Board members are informed through a combination of Board papers, training and awareness. The corporate governance \nteam support the Chair of the relevant Board/Committee in putting in place a yearly agenda plan and agreeing the agenda for \neach meeting. \n \nBoard/ Committee\nDescription of how climate-related matters are considered\nPlc Board\nThe plc Board considers climate-related matters as part of the annual process to approve:\n• the risk framework;\n• the Group’s corporate business plan, including capital adequacy and the own risk and solvency assessment (ORSA); \n• updates to the Group's Responsible Business Strategy;\n• the Responsible Investment Policy;\n• the Investment strategy;\n• annual report and accounts, including the TCFD report\nThroughout the year the plc Board monitors progress against the goals and targets set to address climate-related issues, through \nupdate papers provided primarily from the following functions: responsible business, risk and underwriting. \nBeazley plc Audit and Risk \nCommittee\nThe plc Board has delegated oversight of the risk management framework to the Audit and Risk Committee. Committee \nresponsibilities include overseeing the effectiveness of the risk management framework at Beazley, of which climate-related risk is \none element. In 2022, the Committee reviewed the draft TCFD report and accompanying improvement report. A paper providing an \nupdate on the development of TCFD reporting was also reviewed. One audit on TCFD reporting was undertaken during the year, for \nwhich the audit findings were sent to the Committee for review. On 9 December 2022 The Board approved the proposal to replace the \nAudit and Risk Committee with a separate Audit Committee and Risk Committee from 1 January 2023. \nBeazley plc Nomination \nCommittee\nThe Committee considers the current and anticipated future needs of the organisation to operate effectively. Given the growing \nimportance of climate change, this is a consideration in assessing candidates for future Board and senior executive positions. The \nCommittee also recommends, for approval by the plc Board, the annual board knowledge and training plan. Climate-related matters \ncan form part of this plan.\nBeazley plc Remuneration \nCommittee\nThis Committee is responsible for ensuring climate-related risk is considered within executive remuneration. Evidence that this occurs \nis documented within each Executive Director’s remuneration scorecard, where climate-related risk matters are considered as part of \nBeazley’s wider approach to ESG. Remuneration is reviewed on an annual basis.\n1.1.2 Training and awareness\nThe culture and people team are responsible for maintaining \nboth board skill matrices and the annual board training plan. \nTo facilitate increased knowledge on climate-related matters, \nand thus enable The Board to make informed decisions, \nBoard members receive additional training and awareness \nthroughout the year. The scope of this training and awareness \nis shaped by a combination of emerging trends and market \ndevelopments, stakeholder expectations, progress against \nBeazley’s Responsible Business Strategy, and regulatory \ndemands. In 2022, The Board received an awareness raising \nsession on Beazley’s proposed expected future state \nscenario. Sessions on the impact the transition to net zero \nwill have on key sectors were included as part of the 2022 \nBoard away day.\n1.1.3 Subsidiary Board oversight\nBeazley has four key subsidiary entities: Beazley Furlonge Ltd \n(BFL), Beazley Insurance Designated Activity Company \n(BIDAC), Beazley Insurance Company, Inc. (BICI), and Beazley \nAmerica Insurance Company, Inc. (BAIC), each with their own \nboard and supporting committees. The responsibilities of \nthese Boards mirror those set out at a plc Board level, and \nensure the subsidiary company is operating in accordance \nwith both legal and regulatory requirements and relevant \nBeazley Group policies and procedures. These entities are \nmore insurance-risk-focused than the plc Board, and therefore \nthe impact of climate-related risk on underwriting is \nconsidered in greater detail at these Boards. \nThe subsidiary Boards consider climate-related matters as \npart of the annual process to approve the risk framework and \nORSA. Further updates on climate-related matters are also \nprovided throughout the year, via the Responsible Business \nreport.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n29"

      "text": "2. Strategy\n2.1 Climate-related risks and opportunities\n2.1.1 Definitions of time horizons \nBeazley considers risk across three broad time horizons for climate-related risks. These time horizons are reflective of Beazley’s \napproach to business planning, the type of products Beazley provides, and the investment decisions the company makes. \nThese time horizons are outlined in the table below, along with a summary of climate-related issues which could potentially \nhave a material financial impact on the company within each timeframe. The summary of climate-related issues is based on a \ngeneral review of external research and information. A more detailed review of how climate-related risks specifically apply to \nBeazley over the three time horizons will be developed in 2023.\n \nTime horizon\nDescription\nShort term\n(1 year)\nBeazley’s performance is evaluated on the results of each financial year and the business plan is developed on this basis. Most of \nBeazley’s underwriting business is in short-tail classes. The impact of physical climate-related events occurring through the year are \nreflected in Beazley’s approach to underwriting and pricing. Specific climate-related issues arising within this time horizon could \ninclude:\n• liability-related claims relating to greenwashing; \n• reputational incidents arising from the underwriting of, or investment in, companies which have a significant impact on climate \nchange; \n• impact of green technology;\n• failure of Beazley to act as a responsible business on these matters; and\nMedium term \n(1 to 5 years)\nSome of Beazley’s underwriting business is in medium-tail classes, whilst investment in larger projects and platform developments \nmay run over multiple years. Some emerging risks may crystallise over several years.\nThrough the medium term, the issues identified within the short term are likely to persist. The frequency and severity with which \nacute impacts of natural catastrophes are felt is expected to begin to increase. Liability related claims associated with a failure to \nprepare or adapt to climate change are expected to increase in severity and likelihood. Transitional issues are also expected to arise \nover the medium term, whether from policy intervention, market forces, or technology advances. Some of Beazley's strategic \nobjectives are typically set over the medium term to deliver the strategy.\nLong term\n(5+ years)\nBeazley’s strategy and strategic objectives are generally set over multiple years. Mega trends and slow-moving emerging risks may \ncrystallise over many years. From a climate risk perspective there will be an increased trend in the acute physical climate-related \nrisks, whilst longer term and more chronic impacts may also begin to be realised.\nFrom a material financial impact perspective, the issues identified within the short term are likely to persist. The frequency and \nseverity with which acute impacts of natural catastrophes are felt is expected to begin to increase. The chronic impacts of climate \nchange are also expected to begin to feature. Liability claims associated with a failure to prepare or adapt to climate change are \nexpected to increase in severity and likelihood.\n2.1.2 Process to identify climate-related risks with a material financial impact\nIt is acknowledged that climate-related issues are likely to manifest more over the medium and long term. As set out in the \ntable below, Beazley uses a variety of qualitative and quantitative tools to help manage and prioritise our approach to climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities. This ensures we can prioritise those with the most material financial impact.\n \nProcesses used to identify \nrisks and opportunities\nDescription\nMateriality assessment \nprocess (hereafter referred \nto as the materiality \nassessment)\nUsing 2020 written premium and modelled losses, in 2021 Beazley undertook a materiality assessment by country and physical risk \nperil. The outputs of the materiality assessment determined that the US is the most material geographical location, and the material \nperils are US tropical cyclone, US inland flood, US wildfire, US severe convective storm, US winter storm, European windstorm, and \nJapan tropical cyclone.\nScenario analysis\nBeazley participated in the CBES Stress Test in 2021, the results of which have been used to inform Beazley’s identification of \nclimate-related risks. The outputs of this exercise are discussed later in this disclosure. Beyond the physical peril analysis, climate \nlitigation risk was identified as a material risk to Beazley, given our exposure on specialty risks. Climate litigation risk will continue to \nbe reviewed by a cross-functional team at Beazley. We are engaging with a third-party expert that could assist us with reviewing and \nchallenging our scenario development and analysis, and wider thinking on climate litigation risk\nFocus group deep dives\nIn 2022, Beazley commenced a strategic project to further embed ESG considerations within the underwriting process. To facilitate \nthis, the project engaged with each underwriting focus group, through a series of deep dive workshops, to help identify both the risks \nand opportunities associated with ESG issues. A number of these opportunities are linked to climate-related issues. The output of \nthis work has informed the project objectives for 2023.\nWider peer and investor \nengagement\nAs part of our wider approach to responsible business, Beazley is involved in a number of market initiatives. This engagement \nenables us to identify emerging workforces and disclosure requirements. This work is also supported by feedback from our investors \non ESG matters. The outputs of this correspondence can be found within our responsible business strategy and ESG disclosures.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n33"

      "text": "TCFD 2022 continued\n2.1.3 Process to identify climate-related opportunities with a material financial impact\nBeazley has a number of processes to identifying  climate-related opportunities with a material financial impact. These \nprocesses complement one other, and which ones we use depends on their alignment with existing products and services, the \nknowledge required to ascertain the size of the opportunity, and the resources required to deliver the opportunity. In summary, \ntherefore, this means that climate-related opportunities can be identified through the mechanisms described in the following \ntable:\n \nMethod of identification\nDescription\nIdentified as a result of \ndetermining a risk\nThe methods used to determine a risk also enable identification of an opportunity. The development of an opportunity, where \nunderwriting-related, will be delivered using one of the three processes described below.\nIncubation process\nThe Incubation Underwriting team develops new products that sit outside of existing underwriting team business plan and appetite. \nNew product opportunities are sourced from brokers, InsurTechs, Beazley underwriting teams and internally from within the \nincubation team itself. When reviewing a new product opportunity, and thus its potential materiality, the Incubation team will \nconsider: the addressable market; buyer urgency; market saturation; product economics; and customer interests. \n \nShould the opportunity meet the threshold to pursue further, the incubation team will engage with experts within Beazley before \npresenting the opportunity to the head of strategy and the underwriting strategy manager. Following feedback from these internal \nstakeholders, a decision paper is prepared. This is then presented by the Incubation team to the CUO and/or the underwriting \ncommittee. \n \nOpportunities are launched in pilot periods, typically to maximum aggregate limits, to test the opportunity. If suitably ‘proven’ in the \nunderwriting pilot, and following approval, the opportunity will be handed over to an existing Beazley team, where suitable.\n \nCurrently the Incubation team is investigating solutions for the carbon transition. Their work is monitored by the underwriting \ncommittee.\nBusiness planning process\nUnderwriting focus group leads are responsible for developing the annual business plan, in which they may identify an area of \nbusiness in which to either enter or expand their portfolio. They will document their strategy within their business plan. This could \ninclude the type of products/services they will insure, and the size of the market and the opportunity for Beazley. This work is \nsupported by input from specialists. One such example of this approach is the work being undertaken to develop a business plan for \nrenewable energy, with a view to the energy team decarbonising its energy portfolio over the long term. This will align with the metric \ncurrently disclosed for the premium generated from low and zero carbon technologies.\nExtension to an existing \nproduct or service\nDue to the specialist nature of Beazley’s products and services, there may be several existing products and services which can be \nused to cover similar risks in new settings. Where this occurs, the relevant underwriting team use their knowledge and expertise to \nensure any adjustments to the policy wording are implemented. This work is supported by the product development team. \n2.1.4 Summary of risks and opportunities \nidentified\nPhysical climate-related risks and opportunities\nBased on the materiality assessment, the US was determined \nthe most material geographical location in which the Group \noperates and underwrites. The material perils are US tropical \ncyclone, US inland flood, US wildfire, US severe convective \nstorm, and US winter storm. Perils not related to the US are \nEuropean windstorm, and Japan tropical cyclone, which are \nmaterial to our Property and Treaty underwriting business.\nThe opportunities related to these areas for Beazley lie, in the \nfirst instance, in further developing our understanding of these \nperils and the impact they may have on the business. By \nenhancing our understanding of the risk and being able to \nimprove the quantification of this this risk then we will be able \nto better mitigate the risk. Such mitigation measures may \ninclude; better risk selection and pricing; diversification of our \nunderwriting portfolio to avoid any material risk concentration \nthus optimizing our portfolio to increase underwriting \nperformance; better transfer of the risk through reinsurance; \nsupporting our clients to mitigate climate risk and improve \ntheir risk management.\nLiability-related climate risks and opportunities\nClimate liability risk could be a material risk given Beazley’s \nexposure on speciality risks. We continue evolving our \nunderstanding of climate liability risk, and understanding how \nour policy wording could respond to climate liability scenarios, \nand engaging with clients to understand the risks better. This \nrisk could also bring products and services opportunities that \nwe will keep exploring. \nTransition-related climate risks and opportunities\nFor Beazley, it is important to support a just transition to a net \nzero world. Whilst there are risks associated with the \ntransition, opportunities are also available in this area for \nBeazley. These opportunities include Beazley developing its \nown transition plan, incubating products which provide \ncoverage for clean/green technology, and supporting our \nclients as they begin their transition. From an investment \nperspective, seeking to align our investment portfolio with a \n1.5 degree Celsius pathway is important, and work has been \nundertaken to help establish the current alignment of our \ninvestment portfolio.\n \n34\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "2.2 Impact of climate-related risks and \nopportunities on business strategy and \nfinancial planning\nOur insureds are the most important part of our value chain, in \nrespect of developing long-term value for Beazley. We do not \nsee this value just in being their insurer, but in the \npartnerships we can create to support our clients as they \nthemselves address climate-related risk. Both Beazley’s \nclimate risk strategy, and wider responsible business strategy. \nhelp set out how we manage our material climate-related risks \nand opportunities. A summary of our approach to climate-\nrelated matters across our underwriting, investments and \noperations and how they are helping to inform our strategy is \nprovided in the following section.\n2.2.1 Developing Beazley's plan for the \ntransition to net zero\nThe transition to net zero is an important topic for Beazley, \nand cuts across our approach to our operations, investments \nand underwriting. The development of the first iteration of our \ntransition to net zero plan will be completed in 2023, and will \nform a key part of our strategic approach to ESG and climate-\nrelated matters going forward. This plan can be broken down \ninto three key areas:\nUnderwriting\nIn 2022, Beazley became a member of the NZIA, which is an \nindustry initiative led by the United Nations Environment \nProgram Finance Initiative (UN EPFI) to develop an appropriate \nmethodology for measuring the apportioned GHG emissions \narising from the underwriting portfolio. The methodology - the \nNZIA target setting protocol 1.0 was published in January \n2023, and will enable all NZIA members to develop their first \nround of targets relating to the decarbonisation of the \nunderwriting portfolio by 2050. As a condition of continued \nmembership of the NZIA, Beazley is mandated to publish its \nfirst target by the end of July 2023, for which work has already \ncommenced.\nOperations & Investments\nBeazley has also committed to adopting a Science Based \nTargets initiative (SBTi) target. The SBTi methodology is a well \nestablished framework by which Beazley can set a credible \npathway for the decarbonisation of our operations and \ninvestments to near to net zero emissions by 2050. In \naccordance with the SBTi requirements, the plan will set a \nnumber of clear qualitative and quantitative targets, at a \nmaximum of five year intervals, for both the operations and \ninvestments.\nIn brief, for the operations element, this will include the \ncontinued decarbonisation of the material GHG emissions \ngenerated by Beazley across our Scopes 1, 2 and 3. This plan \nwill build on the GHG reductions the Group has already \nachieved, as reported within the Metrics section. For our \ninvestments, our initial transition plan will cover our approach \nfor the decarbonisation of the relevant asset classes set out \nwithin the latest version of the SBTi finance sector guidance. \nThis work will build on the metrics reported in the Metrics \nsection of this report. We will of course, look to expand the \nreporting of the emissions arising from our investments as \nand when new guidance is published for asset classes not \ncurrently covered within existing methodologies, i.e. sovereign \nbonds. \nFor the elements of our transition plan which can be verified \nby the SBTi, Beazley has set the objective to achieve this \nverification by the end of 2023.\n2.2.2 Climate risk strategy for underwriting\nOur climate risk strategy forms the basis for the planning the \nactions the business will take, in the short term, to further \nembed climate change into our, business as usual, \napproaches. The strategy covers four key areas:\n• embedding climate risk into underwriting;\n• underwriting product opportunities;\n• risk mitigation; and\n• financial stewardship\nApproach to embedding climate risk into underwriting \nThe CBES stress test conducted in 2021 has moved us forward in the work required to fully embed climate-related matters into \nunderwriting and has triggered a series of key projects and activities, all of which are overseen by the CRWG. A summary of \nprogress is as follows: \n1. Strengthen catastrophe \nmodelling capabilities and \ndevelop forward looking \nview of risk\nIn 2022, we validated and implemented a US hurricane climate-change-conditioned model for use as our view of risk for 2023. This \ntakes account of the fact that hurricane risk is elevated due to climate change and allows us to develop a forward-looking view of \nrisk. This view of risk for US hurricane is implemented in portfolio management, pricing, and capital setting. We also validated the US \nwildfire model during 2022 and the model is planned to be implemented in 2023. \nIn 2023, we also plan to further review US hurricane climate change impacts including storm surge and tropical cyclone induced \nflooding to update our view of risk. For US wildfire and inland flood, we will continue evaluating the models and develop a forward-\nlooking view of risk. We will also continue strengthening our modelling approach for other key perils.\n2. Develop climate \nadjusted pricing for key \nperils\nIn 2022, we introduced key peril model calibration pricing. We introduced climate loss trends in pricing for US wildfire, US inland \nflood at the end 2022, and US hurricane in January 2023. In 2023, we plan to review and incorporate other key peril climate loss \ntrends (US hail, US tornado, and US winter storm). We plan to investigate and evaluate whether catastrophe model outputs for US \nwildfire and inland flood could be used in pricing. If they are proven to be better than the current climate risk models used in pricing, \nwe will incorporate the catastrophe model outputs for US wildfire and inland flood into the pricing tool and provide underwriters with \ntraining to help them understand any changes in pricing methodology and outputs.\n3. Develop underwriting \nclimate change metrics\nWe developed a climate change metric on US hurricane risk during 2022 to be implemented in January 2023 into our key property \npricing tool. This metric has been developed by using a third-party tool that provides climate change projections for a list of physical \nrisk perils. The US hurricane climate change metric was validated and is to be implemented first, given that it is the most material \nperil. This metric will help underwriters understand future climate change impact in the assessment of their portfolio, which will \nsupport underwriting decision-making. At this stage it will not impact the modelled premium as this is already captured in the \nhurricane adjusted climate loss trends. This metric could also be shared with clients to support client engagement. During 2023, we \nplan to embed this metric into the underwriting process and provide training to underwriting teams to understand uses of this metric \nand how it can be used in underwriting. Additionally during 2023, we also plan to review and evaluate the third-party climate-change-\nconditioned data and scores, and develop and incorporate into the pricing tool climate change metrics for other key perils.\nInitiative\nSummary of progress and plan for 2023\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n35"

Portfolio management: \ndevelop and implement \ncatastrophe optimisation \nframework and tools \nIn 2022, we developed a catastrophe optimisation framework and tool. This framework and tool enables underwriters to optimise the \nUS property risks portfolio using risk appetite metrics and performance metrics. This allows underwriters to manage their portfolios \ndynamically and make decisions on where we would like to expand or retract our exposure to optimise the overall portfolio. \nIn 2023, we will implement this framework and tool and proactively manage the US property risks portfolio using the optimisation \ntool. We will consider how climate risk can be further incorporated into the framework and tool.\n5. Climate litigation: \nscenario development \nIn 2022, we have developed an internal realistic disaster scenario on greenwashing to assess and quantify the potential impact of \ngreenwashing and consider actions needed to mitigate this risk. \nIn 2023, we plan to work with a third party partner that could assist us with reviewing and challenging our scenario development and \nanalysis, underwriting questions development, wording impact assessment, and our wider thinking on climate litigation risk.\n6. Wording analysis\nAn analysis of wording was carried out in 2022 to investigate if there were any potential ambiguities of peril coverage in underwriting \npolicies. \n7. Development of climate \nchange risk assessment \nframework\nTo enhance our approach to defining material issues, Beazley is working to further incorporate scientific research into our materiality \nassessment. This process is going to be part of the climate change risk assessment framework which will be developed in 2023.  \nThis framework will enable Beazley to further communicate not just the material issues, but also the actions being undertaken to \nmanage the risks (e.g. model validation, model adjustment, actions to pricing and underwriting).  This work, will be supported by the \nestablishment of a natural hazards research team, which will further strengthen our model evaluation and research capabilities. \nUnderwriting product opportunities\nIt is important to consider climate risk impact on end-to-end \ninsurance operations that will drive opportunities for new and \nchanges to existing products and propositions. The processes \nwe have in place, as discussed in section 2.1.3, will help \nfacilitate the development of product opportunities. \nIn 2022, we undertook a review on how Beazley's current and \nplanned product suite applies for industries and sub-industries \nthat are key to carbon transition (i.e. green/clean tech). As \npart of the review, we gathered information from our \nunderwriting teams on both their appetite and demand for \ncoverage for these industries. There is clearly a demand for \nproducts and services for renewable energies (wind, solar, \nhydro-electric, wave & tidal, geo-thermal, and hydrogen), as \nwell as being demand for green technology (carbon capture & \nstorage, battery technology, recycling) and green services, \n(green consulting, technical services, green finance). \nThe exercise also enabled Beazley to identify the challenges \nto underwriting green/clean tech, which include:\n• a lack of available historical data, such as claims \nperformance, creating significant challenges for underwriting \nand pricing new products; and \n• having difficultly in predicting which green technologies will \nprove most successful, or how quickly they will be adopted.\nRisk mitigation services opportunities\nWe feel it is important to be able to support our clients in \nbetter understanding, mitigating and managing their climate \nrisks. This work is to commence in 2023.\nFinancial stewardship\nIn 2023, work will commence to investigate further how we \ncan best support our clients during their transition to net zero. \nWe wish to support as many of our clients as we can during \ntheir transition to net zero. We believe that this can be \ndelivered through a combination of: education on the need for \na smooth and just transition; knowledge sharing from the \nlearnings we gain during our own transition journey; and the \nprovision of products and services in this space. \nFor Beazley, a key part of the transition to net zero is to \nensure it occurs in a just manner, and the short term social \nneeds of energy security are balanced against the longer term \nneeds to reach net zero by 2050. At the beginning of 2022, \nwe adopted a policy of not underwriting any new thermal coal, \noil tar sands, or arctic energy exploration projects, or \nbusinesses which generated more than 5% revenues from \nthese areas. However, in November, due to the ongoing war in \nUkraine, it was decided that the exclusion for thermal coal, \nwould be revised. This revision applies only to our Marine and \nPolitical Risk underwriting classes, where Beazley is prepared, \nuntil June 2024, to insure new clients who are transporting \nthermal coal from existing coal mines. This approach was \nadopted in order to support the need for energy security, and \nthe fact that a number of global countries are having to \nincrease their use of thermal coal plants to provide electricity. \nWorking with brokers\nBrokers are a key link between Beazley and our clients and \ntherefore our relationship with our brokers will be central to \nour response on climate-related matters. We have recently \nbegun working with external analytics teams to enhance our \nknowledge of the latest research of climate change impacts to \nphysical risk perils, catastrophe models and tools, and \nclimate scenario analysis. This will enhance our ability to \nmodel and manage climate risks, and allow us to keep \nabreast of latest market developments on catastrophe and \nclimate risk analytics. \n \n36\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "2.2.3 Investments\nIn 2021 Beazley published, for the first time, its Responsible \nInvestment Policy, which sets out how ESG factors and \nclimate risk are considered as part of the investment decision-\nmaking process. In 2022, we took a number of steps to \nfurther enhance this approach, which include:\n• Moving the calculation of climate risk metrics for our \ncorporate bond and listed equity exposures to a specialist \nplatform to improve consistency and quality of data. This \nhas enabled Beazley to determine the apportioned carbon \nemissions and weighted average carbon intensity (WACI), \nwhich we now report as part of our climate-related metrics; \n• Using the same platform to access information on the Paris \nalignment of our assets and physical and transition risks, \nthis knowledge will help us to monitor and manage our \nclimate risk on an ongoing basis; and\n• Commencing work to develop and incorporate climate data \nand emission factors for sovereign exposures. It is \nanticipated these numbers will be incorporated into our \nannual reporting at the end of 2023.\nAlongside this work, Beazley also made its first impact \ninvestment. This was based on a Beazley commitment in \n2021 to invest, over time, up to $100m of the investment \nportfolio in impact investments (these are defined as \ninvestments that have a measurable positive social and \nenvironmental impact as well as a financial return). In 2022, \nfollowing detailed analysis, we made our first such \ninvestment, in a fund focused on the creation of renewable \nenergy capacity. This fund is managed by a member of the \nNatural Capital Investment Alliance (NCIA) which was \nestablished through the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) \nto increase the scale of natural capital investment. In 2023, \nwe will maintain our focus and momentum in searching for \nimpact investments. Progress will be overseen by the \nInvestment Committee.\nFor 2023, in addition to supporting the development of \nBeazley's plan for the transition to net zero, will also focus on \ndeveloping our analysis on the impact of different climate \nscenarios on the EBITDA of the companies we invest in, over \nvarious time horizons out to 2050, to enable us to reduce \nexposure to climate risk across our investments. \nFor our internally managed investment-grade fixed income \nportfolios, we will look to reduce our exposure by disinvesting \nfrom companies not making sufficient progress to \ndecarbonise. We feel this approach is appropriate given the \nsize and nature of investments are not sufficient scale to \nallow us to effectively engage directly with companies we \ninvest in. Equity investment is a small proportion of our \nportfolio and the management of these assets is outsourced \nto external investment managers; we do require that they \nexercise our voting rights and engage with our investee \ncompanies on climate issues. We continually monitor \navailable investments to ensure we are invested in the most \nsustainable comparable option and/or engage with the \nmanager to apply pressure to make changes to the mandate \nwhere possible.\n2.2.4 Operations\nGreenhouse Gas reduction strategy\nBeazley operates from a number of offices across the globe. \nWhilst these locations could be impacted by physical climate-\nrelated events, in the short term the focus of business \nstrategy is on how Beazley can best work to reduce our \ncontribution to climate change, particularly in respect to the \ngreenhouse gases (GHGs) we generate. As laid out within our \nResponsible Business Strategy, a 40% reduction in GHG \nemissions was targeted for 2022, and a 50% reduction \nsought in 2023; both targets are set against a 2019 baseline. \nProgress against these figures is reported in the metrics \nsection. Beazley’s GHG emissions predominantly arise from \nour Scopes 2 and 3 emissions, as set out in within our GHG \nemissions disclosures. We aim to deliver our targets through \nthe following actions:\nOffice space selection \nWe are selecting our office spaces based on our changing \nneeds as a business. The move to an activity-based working \napproach means that our office space is smaller than in \nprevious years. Furthermore, by selecting offices which \nachieve a BREEAM or LEED certificate, we can guarantee that \nthe energy performance of the fabric and technology within the \nbuilding is energy efficiency.\nCarbon travel budget\nBusiness travel is a significant part of our scope 3 emissions. \nTo help address the impact of business travel, a carbon \nbudget was introduced at the beginning of 2022. As with a \nfinancial budget, each division has a total amount of carbon \nthey can ‘spend’ on GHG emissions arising from business \ntravel. Updates on performance were provided throughout the \nyear, so teams could track budget spends. \nFor 2023, we have developed this further to improve the \nalignment between the carbon travel budget and the financial \nbudget for business travel. We will monitor both the financial \nand carbon budgets in 2023 in order to identify where \nimprovements to this revised approach can be made.\nSupply chain\nCurrently we do not disclose emissions arising from our supply \nchain, beyond those produced by two of the data centres we \nlease. However, Beazley has committed to embedding ESG \nmatters into our procurement, including a focus on GHG \nemissions arising from our suppliers' operations. We will \nbegin to develop this procurement strategy in 2023. Progress \nagainst targets, and the emissions arising from our supply \nchain, will be reported in subsequent years in the metrics \nsection.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n37"

The exercise covered \nmodelling of physical, transition and liability (litigation) risk over a 30-year time horizon within three different scenarios – Early \nAction (EA), Late Action (LA), and No Additional Action (NAA). The scenarios were based on those established by the Network for \nGreening the Financial System (NGFS), with their key characteristics summarised in the table below:\n \nEarly Action\nLate Action\nNo Additional Action\nPhysical Risks\nLimited\nLimited\nHigh\nMean global warming rise by end of scenario \n(since pre-industrial times)\n1.8\n1.8\n3.3\nMean sea level rise in UK (m)\n0.16\n0.16\n0.39\nTransition risks\nMedium\nHigh\nLimited\nTransition begins\n2021\n2031\nn/a\nNature of transition\nEarly and orderly\nLate and disorderly\nOnly policies that were \nin place before 2021\nImpact on output\nTemporarily lower \ngrowth\nSudden contraction \n(recession)\nPermanently lower \ngrowth and higher \nuncertainty.\nThe exercise focussed on both assets and liabilities, taking\na view, based on end-of-year 2020 balance sheets, of what \nmight happen depending on future climate-related policies, \ntechnological advancements and consumer behaviour to limit \ngreenhouse gas emissions. A quantitative questionnaire also \naccompanied the qualitative exercise, asking for the \ndisclosure of potential management actions to improve the \nmanagement and mitigation of climate-related risks. \nIt was determined that the overall balance sheet impact is \nmaterial over the long term, particularly in the NAA scenario \nwhich sees greater physical and transitional risk. However, in \nno scenario is Beazley rendered unviable as an organisation.\nOn physical risk, the biggest impact on loss occurs in the NAA \nscenario, specifically the US perils (i.e. US windstorm, US \ninland flood, US wildfire, US severe convective storm, and US \nwinter storm). There is however, a range of reliability of \nclimate data and this leads to significant uncertainty as to the \nimpacts of climate change on individual perils and regions. As \na result, the modelling of physical risk triggered a series of \nfurther actions on improving catastrophe modelling by \ndeveloping climate change conditioned view of risk, \nincorporating climate risk trends for most material perils.\nOn transition risk, the largest asset portfolio loss occurs in \nthe NAA scenario and the smallest in the EA scenario. The \n‘balance sheet shock’ approach has its limitation, however we \ncontinue to decarbonise our investment portfolio. \nThe climate litigation risk scenarios have been useful to \nstimulate discussion, raise awareness, and consider timing of \nimpact on industry sectors. The impact on the underwriting \nportfolio was estimated to be the highest for the \ngreenwashing scenario. This led to development of an internal \ndeterministic greenwashing scenario.\n \n38\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "3.2 Post CBES actions\nCBES has significantly moved us forward in embedding \nclimate risk into our business and has triggered a number of \nactions, as discussed previously in section 3.1. From a \nscenario analysis perspective, our focus in 2022 was to \ndevelop a Beazley most likely future state climate scenario, a \ndeterministic greenwashing scenario, and a plan for further \nscenario development in 2023. Progress on these matters is \nsummarised in the section below. \nLikely future state scenario\nIn 2022, we developed a 'likely future state' scenario which \nensures that all areas of the business are aligned in terms of \nviews on likely future scenarios and what ‘degree world’ we \nare operating in and planning for. This scenario has been \ndeveloped to support internal business activities (e.g. view of \nrisk selection, underwriting and pricing decisions, capital \ninvestment choices). The scenario is based on NGFS \nscenarios and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC) scenarios. The proposed ‘Beazley most likely’ scenario \nparameters are: \n• a 3 degree celcius warmer world at 2050;\n• a 0.6m sea level rise at 2050; and\n• a very late and more aggressive policy transition. Assumes \nannual emissions do not decrease to 2030. \nThis corresponds to the NGFS ‘Delayed transition’ scenario \nand the IPCC RCP4.5 scenario. We also proposed stressed \nversions of the scenario, for both physical risk and transition \nand liability risk. The likely future state scenario will be \nreviewed on a regularly basis to ensure the continued \nappropriateness of the parameters. \nThe 'likely future state' scenario parameters have already \nbeen used to decide which view of risk we should take in our \nUS hurricane climate-change-conditioned model, and also \nwhen developing climate change metrics for US hurricane for \nunderwriters. \nDeterministic climate litigation scenario\nPost CBES, we found that one of the climate litigation \nscenarios merited further investigation internally, and this has \nresulted in the development of a deterministic greenwashing \nscenario to assess and quantify the potential impact of \ngreenwashing and consider actions needed to mitigate this \nrisk.\nScenario analysis plan for 2023\nOn physical risk, we have already assessed the impacts on \nkey perils in our CBES exercise. Recognising the need to \ncontinue carrying out such scenario analysis, however, we \nplan to keep developing short-term, medium-term, and long-\nterm scenarios. We will link these to our business planning \nand decision making. We plan to link the future likely state \nscenarios to individual perils when developing physical risk \nscenarios. This will enable Beazley to understand what the \nphysical risk impacts would be under future likely state \nscenario, and the stressed version of the scenario. \nOn litigation risk, we are investigating the merit of working with \na third-party partner to review and challenge the way we \nundertook the CBES litigation scenario, and also our internal \nclimate litigation scenario. This would potentially not only \nallow us to better understand and assess our climate \nlitigation risk, but also refine/update the scenario and design \nmore scenario(s) if necessary. The internal climate litigation \nscenario will be monitored on a quarterly basis. We will review \nthe quarterly movement in scenario results linked to climate \nligation claims and the risk landscape, enabling us to review \nthe scenario and its use for decision making.\n3.3 Climate-related issues and the financial \nplanning process\nThe outputs from scenario analysis and risk modelling help to \ndetermine Beazley's capital allocation for risks. The risk \nmodelling continues to be updated to reflect the latest \nconsensus of scientific opinion. For example, the US hurricane \nmodel includes assumptions that are based on climate-\nconditioned output. The process also informs the amount of \nreinsurance which needs to be purchased to cover claims \narising from climate-related issues. This work is conducted on \nan annual basis, as part of the business planning process, \nand ensures Beazley has sufficient capital to cover ongoing \nclaims. \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n39"

      "text": "TCFD 2022 continued\n4. Risk management\n4.1 Risk management framework\n4.1.1 Overview of Beazley’s risk \nmanagement framework \nBeazley’s risk management framework establishes our \napproach to identifying, measuring, mitigating and monitoring \nthe Group’s key risks, including climate risk. See additional \ndetail on the risk management framework in the strategic \nreport which starts on page 1. \n4.2 Identification and assessment of \nclimate-related risks \nWe use the key mechanisms set out below to identify and \nassess a range of climate-related risks relevant to Beazley, \nwhether that be by geographical location, sector or product \nline. \nScenario analysis\nScenario analysis includes stressing the scenarios of the first \nline or developing additional scenarios to consider climate \nrelated risks. \nNatural catastrophe modelling\nBeazley utilises physical damage catastrophe models, such as \nthose created by Moody's proprietary modelling system RMS, \nto help understand the implications of physical events. The \nmodelling of physical events with a climate-adjusted view, i.e. \nmodels that enable us to review potential changes in physical \nrisk as a result of a changing climate, is a discipline in its \ninfancy. The Group has licensed, and validated, the RMS \nclimate-adjusted model for our most material peril and \nexpects to review and validate more climate-adjusted models \nreleased in 2023. \nThe primary purpose of the tool is to gather data from the \nunderwriting portfolio and provide loss-related information \nabout pre-defined events, such as Lloyd's Realistic Disaster \nScenarios (RDSs). However, it is also used to assist with \ndetermining rate adequacy and as a key input in portfolio \nmanagement decisions; for example, in terms of \ndiversification and geographical spread. \nThe modelling enables the impact of climate-related risk to be \nreviewed from the following perspectives:\n• regional variation;\n• different climate risk scenarios; and\n• different loss perspectives\nBeyond this modelling, we also engage with other data and \ntool providers to review potential changes in physical perils at \nan individual location level.\nDeterministic scenarios\nBeazley runs RDSs in order to determine the impact of \ndifferent risks. The natural catastrophe RDS and climate \nlitigation RDS are run on a regular basis. This modelling \nprocess is overseen by the exposure management team, who \nhave developed a complex and emerging underwriting risks \nprotocol. This sets out the activity in place to review \npotential,complex, and / or emerging risks relating to \nunderwriting. There are approximately 60 Deterministic \nRealistic Disaster Scenarios (D-RDS) used to monitor the \nmost significant. \nThese scenarios are either modelled, using data drawn from \nthird-party modelling partners, or non-modelled, where experts \nacross Beazley collaborate to determine the impact. An \nexample of our approach to non-modelled risks is wildfires, an \nincreasingly common event due to the impacts of climate \nchange. The modelling approach, meanwhile takes into \naccount the impact of sector, geography and business \nsegment, in order to determine Beazley’s exposure. This helps \nto determine the relative significance of the climate-related \nrisk in relation to other risks. In turn this informs decision-\nmaking across the business. \nClimate-related strategic risks\nThe Board identifies and analyses emerging and strategic risk \non an annual basis for discussion at The Board level. In the \ncontext of climate-related matters, strategic risks relate to \nBeazley’s approach overall to climate risk and behaving as a \nresponsible business by seeking to minimise our \nenvironmental impact. This includes our approach to the \ntransition to net zero, key disclosure requirements, and \nembedding climate risk and responsibility actions into \nbusiness as usual approaches.\nStrategic risks are also reviewed, twice a year, by the risk \nteam as part of Beazley’s risk assessment process. These \nreviews are a collaborative effort with all the business \nfunctions, and are an opportunity to identify emerging risk, \nreview existing risks, and provide appropriate mitigation \nmeasures to reduce/manage the risk. This assessment is \ninward looking and primarily concentrates on operational \nprocesses, whilst helping to encourage open dialogue with \nrisk owners. This assessment is also where Beazley’s own \nresponse to climate change is noted, and the appropriate \naction to deliver improvements is documented.\n \n40\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "Identification of emerging trends and regulatory \nrequirements\nRegular scanning of the horizon for emerging trends, \nregulatory requirements and stakeholder perspectives is \nundertaken. Key elements which are looked for include:\n• Understanding the perspectives of stakeholders, whether \nthey be investors, activists or our employees, through \nregular dialogue;\n• Determining current and emerging legal requirements, \nwhether they be mandated or voluntary. This includes \ncompliance with regulatory demands and legislation. It also \nextends to voluntary initiatives Beazley is a member of, \nsuch as the UN Principles for Sustainable Insurance, or the \nNet Zero Insurance Alliance; and\n• Understanding the evolving reputational risks associated \nwith our activities.\nRegular communication on these matters occurs across the \nteams identified in section 1.2 in order to ensure Beazley’s \napproach to responsible business meets stakeholder \nexpectations. Where necessary, proposals are put to the \nresponsible business steering group for further discussion or \nclarification and recommendations for any appropriate action. \nLast year the Group committed to setting a net zero target for \n2050.\n4.3 Management of climate-related risks \n4.3.1 Consideration of climate-related risk \nwithin the Risk Management Framework\nThe classification of climate-related risk has evolved at \nBeazley. The Board identified it as an emerging risk in 2019 \nbefore being reflected under enterprise risk which is a \nprincipal risk within the risk framework in 2021. However, \nenterprise risks including climate-related risks are pervasive \nand span multiple risk categories and risk owners. \nA brief outline of how climate-related matters are reflected in \nthe risk categories wider than enterprise risk, is outlined in \nthe tables below.\nInsurance risks \n \nRisk type\nRelevance to climate-related matters\nMarket cycle risks\nThis is the risk of systematic mispricing of the medium-tailed speciality risks business, which could arise due to a change in the \nUS tort environment, changes to the supply and demand of capital, companies using incomplete data to make decisions. In the \ncontext of climate-related matters, liability risks could manifest themselves, especially in relation to accusations of greenwashing. \nTransitional risk may also play a part in claims arising from market cycle risks.\nThe Group uses a range of techniques to mitigate this risk including sophisticated pricing tools, analysis of macro trends, analysis \nof claim frequency and the expertise of our experienced underwriters and claims managers.\nNatural catastrophe risks \nevents\nThis is the risk of one or more large events caused by nature affecting several policies and therefore giving rise to multiple losses. \nGiven Beazley’s risk profile, such an event could be a hurricane, major windstorm, earthquake or wildfire. \nThis risk is monitored using exposure management techniques to ensure that the risk and reward are appropriate, and that the \nexposure is not overly concentrated in one area.\nReserve risk\nThis is the risk that established reserves are not sufficient to reflect the ultimate impact climate change may have on paid losses. \nThis includes unanticipated liability risk losses arising from our clients facing litigation if they are held to be responsible for \ncontributing to climate change, or for failing to act properly to respond to the various impacts of climate change. With support \nfrom our Group actuarial team, claims teams and other members of management, the Group establishes financial provisions for \nour ultimate claims liabilities. The Group maintains a consistent approach to reserving to help mitigate the uncertainty within the \nreserves estimation process.\nAsset, credit and liquidity risks \n \nRisk type\nRelevance to climate-related matters\nRisk to earnings\nThis is a risk of investment loss, in any period, sufficient to impact capital and/or cause reputational damage. Beazley’s \ninvestment portfolio could suffer detrimental returns following drops in the share prices of investments following a climate-risk-\nrelated incident.\nTo mitigate this risk, an approved investment strategy is in place that provides guidance on appetite. In addition, adherence to the \ninvestment strategy is monitored through ongoing review, oversight and audit work.\nReinsurance credit risk\nIn the event material natural catastrophe events, there would be a risk that our reinsurance counterparties are unable to pay \nreinsurance balances due to Beazley. If the frequency or severity of these events is increased due to climate change, this could \ncause a corresponding increase in credit risk. An important consideration when placing our reinsurance programme is evaluation \nof our counterparty risk. Every potential reinsurer is evaluated through a detailed benchmarking exercise which considers financial \nstrength ratings, capital metrics, performance metrics and other considerations.\nLiquidity risk\nThere is a risk that losses resulting from unprecedented natural disasters or extreme weather could erode our ability to pay \nclaims in a timely manner, due to unavailability (or not having access to) the neccesary financial resources to meet obligations.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n41"

      "text": "TCFD 2022 continued\nStrategic risk \n \nRisk type\nRelevance to climate-related matters\nStrategic decisions\nThe Group’s performance would be affected in the event of making strategic decisions that do not add value. \nThe Group mitigates this risk through the combination of recommendation and challenge from Non-Executive directors, debate at \nthe Executive Committee and input from the Strategy and Performance Group (a group of 30+ senior individuals from across \ndifferent disciplines at Beazley).\nIn the context of climate-related matters, this relates to decision making around the transition to net zero across underwriting, \ninvestments and our operations.\nCommunication\nHaving the right strategy and environment is of little value if the strategy is not communicated internally so that the whole Group \nis heading in the same direction, or if key external stakeholders are not aware of Beazley’s progress against its strategy.\nBeazley regularly communicates internally and externally on responsible business matters. This is underpinned by the responsible \nbusiness strategy.\nSenior management \nperformance\nThere is a risk that senior management could be overstretched or could fail to perform, which would have a detrimental impact on \nthe Group’s performance. \nThe performance of the senior management team is monitored by the CEO and Culture and People team, and overseen by the \nNomination Committee. Climate-related objectives are built into senior management remuneration packages. This ensures \nprogress can be measured and reported against.\nEnterprise risk\n \nRisk type\nRelevance to climate-related matters\nClimate financial risk\nThis relates to potential financial risks that may result from the physical impact and transition requirements of a changing climate \non Beazley’s underwriting and investment portfolios. This could be due to systemic mispricing of climate-related exposures, \nmismanagement of our aggregate exposures, or greater claims costs than expected resulting in financial loss and/or reputational \ndamage.\nThe Group mitigates this in a number of ways, including having a clearly defined and documented underwriting and investment \nstrategy. There is training and guidance on related risks as part of the business planning process. Pricing models are regularly \nreviewed and updated to include/reflect climate-risk-related information. Exposure management processes are in place, including \nstress and scenario analysis. \nEnvironmental, social, and \ngovernance (ESG)\nESG is the umbrella term for environmental, social and governance factors that are used to measure the sustainability and ethical \nimpact of a business. The risk is that we fall short of the expected standard of ESG in relation to our stakeholders. For example, \nthis could stem from failing to understand and keep pace with ESG related thinking (that continues to gain momentum) and \nconsequently not taking appropriate actions to address Beazley’s stance and exposure in those areas. This could result in actual, \nor a potential, material negative impact and/or reputation of Beazley, arising from an adverse sustainability impact.\nWe mitigate this risk by ensuring there is a clearly defined and documented ESG strategy driven by the executive team, that \nincludes targets and milestones which are communicated to all staff. This is primarily governed via the Responsible Business \nSteering Group to ensure we take a consistent approach across the Group. Sustainability initiatives are incorporated into the \nbusiness planning process.\nReputation\nAlthough reputational risk is a consequential risk, i.e. it emerges upon the occurrence of another risk manifesting, it has the \npotential to have a significant impact on an organisation. Beazley expects its staff to always act honourably by doing the right \nthing.\nFrom a climate-related risk perspective, reputational risk manifests itself in the decisions we make on climate matters. This \nincludes our approach to the transition to net zero, our approach to underwriting and investments, particularly in carbon-intensive \nsectors, and performance against the objectives we have set within our Responsible Business Strategy.\nOperational risk\nRisk type\nRelevance to climate-related matters\nExternal event\nThis is the risk that the physical impact of climate-related events has a material impact on our own people, processes and \nsystems, leading to increased operating costs or the inability to deliver uninterrupted client service. The Group has business \ncontinuity plans in place to minimise the risk of interrupted client service in the event of a disaster.\nCommercial management\nThe Group aims to minimise where possible the environmental impact of its business activities and those that arise from the \noccupation of its office spaces. As we operate in leased office spaces, our ability to directly influence the building's environmental \nimpacts is limited. However, we do choose office space with climate change mitigation in mind, and engage with our employees, \nvendors and customers in an effort to reduce overall waste and our environmental footprint.\nRegulatory and legal\nRegulators, investors and other stakeholders are becoming increasingly interested in companies’ responses to climate change. \nFailure to appropriately engage with these stakeholders and provide transparent information could result in the risk of reputational \ndamage or increased scrutiny. The Group regularly monitors the regulatory landscape to ensure that we adhere to any changes in \nrelevant laws and regulations. This includes making any necessary regulatory or statutory filings with regard to climate risk.\n \n42\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "4.3.2 Processes for managing climate-related risks\nBeazley’s risk management philosophy is to balance the risks the business takes on with the associated cost of controlling \nthese risks, whilst also operating within the risk appetite agreed by The Board. In addition, our risk management processes are \ndesigned to continuously monitor our risk profile against risk appetite and to exploit opportunities as they arise. As a specialist \ninsurer, a number of classes of business that we underwrite are susceptible to the impact (or potential impact) of climate \nchange. There are broadly four options that we have as an insurance company in relation to these risks: we can accept the risk, \navoid the risk, mitigate the risk, or transfer the risk. \nTools to help manage climate-related risks\nBeazley employs a variety of tools to help manage climate-related risks. These are as follows:\n \nTools used\nDescription of use\nStress and scenario \nframework\nThe stress and scenario framework is a key element of the risk management framework, enabling senior management to form an \nunderstanding of the vulnerabilities of the business model. There are two levels of stress and scenario tests conducted at \nBeazley, which ensures there is coverage of the key risks facing us and ownership at the appropriate management level.\nSingle-pillar stress and scenario tests such as RDSs are performed as part of normal business processes, with RDSs for natural \ncatastrophes run on a regular basis in order to determine the impact of different risks. \nIn addition, multi-pillar testing is conducted as part of the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) process, to ensure that \ntests continue to develop and reflect the evolving risk environment.\nMonitoring of aggregation of \nexposure\nThe Exposure Management team has the responsibility for developing approaches to monitor the aggregation of exposure to \nnatural catastrophes. Part of this work involves assessing the latest views on climate change and reporting to the business on \nthe impacts any changes could have to the insurance portfolios. The Exposure Management team reports to the Chief \nUnderwriting Officer, who in turn provides regular updates to The Board on these matters. The Exposure Management team is \nsupported by the Head of Financial Climate Risk.\nCapital modelling\nThe Head of Capital provides an update to The Board, using modelled and non-modelled information, to help determine the impact \nof climate change on the business. An example of this is the internal modelling the capital team undertook to determine the \nimpact of wildfires, which are becoming increasingly prevalent as a result of climate change. They also set out a view on the more \nmaterial hurricane risk as part of this process.\nRisk appetite\nOn an annual basis, Beazley’s risk appetite is reviewed and is informed by outputs from the RDS, capital model, and credit risk \nassessment, as well as input from the trading teams. This helps guide the trading teams for the following year, before being \nreviewed against the capacity available. \nThis appetite is agreed and set by The Board, before being tracked by the exposure management team on a monthly basis, who \nflag up to the business any areas where we are close to the limits the business has set. Capacity is obviously impacted by the \nnumber of physical weather events which occur throughout any given year, and therefore the impact of climate change is \nconsidered when deciding on risk appetite. \nDuring 2022, risk appetite statements and specific Board-level key risk indicators (KRIs) have been developed for climate-related \nfinancial risk, which includes investment and underwriting. These are being monitored from 2023 onwards. \nQuantitative and qualitative assessment of climate-related risks within the Risk Management Framework\nSpecific Board-level key risk indicators (KRIs), as set out in the risk appetite statements, are being monitored, as part of the \nrisk management framework from 2023 onwards. They are designed to provide triggers that through monitoring can be \naddressed through Beazley’s governance structure. They set out tolerance levels using red, amber and green ('RAG') ratings to \nhelp indicate the extent to which a risk is inside or outside appetite and whether any escalation is required. The climate change-\nrelated KRIs will be as follows:\n \nArea of the business\nKey Risk Indicator\nUnderwriting\nPhase 1 Climate change in underwriting and pricing objectives met\nRegulatory disclosure requirements met\nInvestments\nCompliance with responsible investment policy and transition risk\nOperations\nReduction in carbon emissions for our operations compared to the 2019 baseline of 40% in 2022, and 50% in 2023.\nWhere possible, these KRI’s have been reported in the metrics section of the TCFD disclosure, with full incorporation expected \nfrom 2023.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n43"

For 2022, there are two \nquantitative metrics which we can report against as a \nmeasure of initial progress, with the expectation that we will \ndevelop more metrics to measure our progress against our \nclimate risk strategy in 2023.\nNumber of perils with climate- change- conditioned \nview of risk\nBeazley is investigating the climate change conditioned \nmodels in the market and updating our understanding of \nclimate change impact on physical risk perils from dedicated \nresearch, in order to develop a forward-looking climate-change-\nconditioned view of risk.

This is the first \nstep in the process to fully embed climate loss trends for key \nperils into pricing. In 2022, we reviewed climate loss trends \nfor US hurricane, US wildfire, and US inland flood. These were \nintroduced into the key property pricing tool in December \n2022 for US Flood and US Wildfire and January 2023 for \nUS Hurricane.

Calculations have been based on an \nassumption that the user would travel 100 miles per day as \npart of the rental.\nThe parameter of Scope 1 and Scope 2 reporting in 2022 \nincludes 16 sites covering London (UK), Birmingham (UK), \nDublin (Ireland), Munich (Germany), Paris (France), Barcelona \n(Spain) and Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Farmington, New \nYork, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Miami (USA) and Montreal \n(Canada) and two third party data centres. Additional offices \nare located across the globe, many of which are considered \nshared space or serviced office suites. Beazley pays a service \ncharge for their use, however, has no control over the \noperation or use of utility provisions. Responsibility for energy \nconsumption and carbon emissions, therefore, falls to the \nlandlord, and is considered out of scope for the purpose of \nthese calculations. The global emissions reported do not \ninclude data for the following office locations: Houston, Los \nAngeles, Denver, Singapore, Rio de Janerio, Shanghai, and \nVancouver. These offices make up 8% of Global FTE in 2022. \nThis equates to 94% of Beazley employees including \ncontractors. The 2022 reporting scope is comparable with the \nGHG emissions reported for 2019 to 2021. Beazley’s two \nsubsidiaries, Lodestone & BHI, are excluded due to data \nquality and will aim to be incorporated in future reporting. \nReporting is based on operational control. Beazley Group does \nnot have operational control over the building infrastructure \nand plant at its offices due to the presence of facility \nmanagement companies and shared tenancy; as a result, \nemissions primarily fall within Scope 2 and 3 of the \nGreenhouse Gas Protocol.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n45"

This equates to an 55% reduction when compared to our 2019 baseline. This sizeable \nreduction is a reflection of the actions taken over the last three years, which have included the relocation of our office in London \nto more energy efficient premises at 22 Bishopsgate, the outsourcing of our data centres, and a reduction in business travel.\nLocation- based GHG Emissions (tCO2e)  \n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nScope 1\n21.08\n16.50\n8.23\n65.20\nScope 2\n2,010.84\n1,773.92\n1,412.87\n1,144.79\nScope 3\n6,735.91\n1,647.04\n807.37\n4,073.96\nTotal tCO2e  \n8,767.83\n3,437.46\n2,228.46\n5,283.00\nTotal tCO2e/FTE  \n5.52\n2.09\n1.22\n2.49\n5.4.3 Market- based GHG emissions \nBeazley Group’s market-based GHG reporting for 2022, taking into account the procurement of 538,589.43 kWh of electricity \nfrom certified renewable sources, is summarised in the table below. Renewable energy was procured for our Dublin, Barcelona, \nParis and London offices, and equates to renewable energy being 53.46% of Beazley's overall in scope energy use. The \nprocurement of renewable energy resulted in a saving of 116.63 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The contribution of renewable energy \nto our overall energy consumption is lower than the 65.55% saving achieved in 2021. This is because we were reporting energy \narising from both our new and old London offices whilst in the process of relocating. Both offices used renewable energy, and \ntherefore both our overall energy consumption and the contribution from renewable energy was temporarily higher than in a \nnormal operating year.\nThe market-based emissions, which take into account the carbon emission reductions achieved through the use of renewable \nenergy in four of Beazley's offices, are set out in the table below.\n \n \nMarket-based GHG Emissions (tCO2e)  \n2021\n2022\nScope 1\n \n8.23  \n65.20 \nScope 2\n1,038.22  \n1,027.79 \nScope 3\n \n776.12  \n4,066.63 \nTotal tCO2e  \n1,822.57  \n5,158.65 \nTotal tCO2e/FTE  \n1.00\n2.43\n5.4.4 Detailed Breakdown of Emissions\nSCOPE 1 \nOur Scope 1 emissions arise from company car use, refrigerant top ups of air conditioning systems and back-up generator use \nfor our Dublin office.

The targets we have set for carbon reductions do not include any allowance of the use of carbon offsets.\n5.4.5 Water Consumption\nAs part of the Building Management System, Beazley has sub meters on the incoming water feed to the two floors we occupy \nwithin 22 Bishopsgate. This sub metering covers the water consumption arising from the use of our kitchenette facilities, and in \n2022 resulted in 1,013m3 of water being used. This is an increase on the 305m3 used in 2021, however, office occupancy \nrates were lower due to the impact of social distancing for COVID-19. The consumption figures cited do not include for the water \nbeing used for the toilets being used on our floors, nor water consumption arising from central functions across the remainder \nof the building. These elements are controlled and measured by the building's landlord. Water consumption is cited only for our \n22 Bishopsgate office, as this is the only office for which we currently have accurate water data for. This office is occupied by \n42.51% of FTEs.\n5.4.6 Waste Consumption and Recycling Rate\nBeazley is also able to measure the amount and type of waste being generated from our London office, Data is provided by our \nlandlord, who is responsible for coordinating the collection and disposal of the waste generated by all building occupants. This \ninformation confirms the amount and type of waste stream being generated, by weight. This data is recorded and collated by \nthe landlord's appointed waste contractor, before being provided to Beazley. Based on the information provided, for 2022, \nBeazley generated a total of 10.98 tonnes of waste, with 6.58 tonnes of this waste being recycled across multiple waste \nstreams. We were able to achieve a recycling rate of 59%. This is an increase on the 1.12 tonnes of waste recycled in our \nLondon office in 2021, however, office occupancy rates were lower due to the impact of social distancing for COVID-19. This \noffice is occupied by 42.51% of FTEs.\n5.5 External Benchmarks\nBeazley uses a number of external ESG ratings to help benchmark our progress on ESG matters. Of the ESG ratings we \nparticipate in, two are relevant to benchmarking climate-related matters: – Climatewise and Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). \nThe 2022 scores are detailed in the table below, with historic data provided for comparison.\n \nRating Scheme\n2020\n2021\n2022\nImprovement in 2022?\nClimatewise\n46\n72\n72\nNo Change\nCDP\nC\nC\nB\nYes\n \n48\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

The Board is \ncommitted to engaging with each of our stakeholder groups to \nhelp inform our strategy, annual plans and specific decision \nmaking. \nThe Board reviews who it determines to be its key \nstakeholders. The key stakeholder groups continue to be: our \npeople, our clients and broker partners, our shareholders and \nour regulators. The Board also continues to recognise \nsuppliers and communities as important groups. \nThis section of the report provides further information on how \nBeazley and The Board engage with each of these key \nstakeholder groups, what have been the outcomes of this \nengagement in 2022, and how the views of stakeholders have \nbeen considered in the key decisions taken by The Board \nduring the year. \nOur people\nWhy we engage?\nOur people are fundamental to Beazley’s long-term success \nand as such have been identified as one of the five key pillars \nsupporting our strategy. We believe that by listening, sharing \nideas, and learning we help each other strive for better. We \nseek to be open and honest in our dealings with our \nemployees and contractors and support Beazley’s values and \nculture of ‘doing the right thing'.\nHow does Beazley engage?\nEmployee engagement takes place informally and formally at \nall levels of the organisation. Our managers are encouraged to \ncommunicate actively with their teams, seeking engagement \nat team meetings and in their day-to-day work.\nWe have five employee networks consisting of individuals from \nacross the business in different roles and locations. Each \nnetwork is focussed on raising awareness of different \nelements of our inclusion and diversity strategy and are able \nto give an employee view on matters within their remit. You \ncan read more about these networks in the responsible \nbusiness report.\nMembers of our Executive Committee support the overall \napproach to engagement, including through hosting ‘executive \ncoffees’ with groups of employees and ‘executive Q&A panel \nevents’ held virtually with the entire workforce. These \nsessions provide an opportunity for two-way engagement and \nfor the executive to keep our people updated on what is \nhappening across Beazley. Members of the Executive \nCommittee are also regular contributors to our ‘weekly news’ \nemails, and other employees are also encouraged to \ncontribute on relevant work developments and with interesting \npersonal stories.\nOur Chief Executive Officer regularly engages with the \nworkforce through his email and spoken updates and \nencourages questions on all topics through the ‘Ask Adrian’ \nforum.\nMore formal workforce engagement takes place at our ‘how \nare we doing? Live’ strategy event. This event is held annually \nin person in multiple locations globally and gives an \nopportunity for the Executive Committee members and other \nemployees to present on key developments. There are also \nannual all-employee surveys on engagement and leadership, \nthe findings of which are presented to the Executive \nCommittee and Board in order that plans can be developed to \naddress any findings. There is regular reporting to the \nExecutive Committee and Board by the Head of Culture & \nPeople on employee matters.\nAn important element to support our employee engagement is \nour whistleblowing hotline. This enables employees and other \nmembers of the workforce to raise in confidence any specific \nconcerns, and we undertake to investigate fully any matters \nraised.\nHow does The Board engage?\nAs previously mentioned, The Board receive regular updates \nfrom the Head of Culture & People on employee matters in \ngeneral and on the findings from the annual surveys on \nemployee engagement and leadership. \nIn addition, and in line with the Corporate Governance Code, \nwe have appointed a Non-Executive Director with responsibility \nfor bringing the ‘employee voice’ into Board level decision \nmaking. For the majority of 2022 this role was held by Bob \nStuchbery, with Fiona Muldoon taking on the role from \nNovember. \nFiona will continue Bob’s work on providing updates to The \nBoard on her formal and informal engagement with the \nworkforce. This engagement includes attendance at meetings \nof the NexCo (an alternative Executive Committee of high \npotential employees from across the business which runs in \nparallel to the usual Executive Committee meetings), and \nattendance at informal meetings held virtually between \nmembers of the Executive Leadership team and a small \nnumber of employees. There is also ongoing engagement with \nemployees through matters raised via the dedicated \n‘employee voice’ pages on our intranet site. In 2022, some of \nthe Non-Executive Directors hosted a live virtual panel for all \nemployees, discussing their role and experience and \nanswering employee questions. During the event Bob \nStuchbery talked about his role as the ‘employee voice’ in the \nboardroom.\nWhat is important to our people?\nOur annual employee survey continues to highlight the \nimportance of engagement to our employees, and our 2022 \nsurvey showed continued high levels of employee \nengagement. Particular themes from the 2022 survey were \nthe importance of working collaboratively, of feeling trusted \nand listened to, and being able to share their thoughts, \nopinions and ideas.

      "text": "Outcomes from engagement with our people in 2022\nVarious steps have been taken during 2022 in response to \nour engagement with the workforce including:\n• Steps to support individual growth and career development\n– much of our business requires individuals with specialist \nknowledge built up over a number of years. However, we \nhave addressed feedback around helping individuals \nfurther in their own career development. This has \nincluded hosting careers fairs and workshops, helping \npeople get to know other areas of Beazley, \ncommunicating internal opportunities and sharing \nexamples of how others have developed their careers at \nBeazley. We have also developed specific career \npathways for our underwriters, distinguishing between the \ntechnical and managerial elements of the role, and \nsought to provide further clarity to individuals wishing to \nsit on our various leadership forums.\n• Providing greater transparency on remuneration and bonus \nsetting \n– remuneration is a key matter for our employees. We have \nencouraged open and honest conversations between \nmanagers and employees on remuneration topics and \ncontinued our ‘your compensation explained’ sessions \nwhere the Chief Executive Office and Group Finance \nDirector provided information and answered questions. In \nresponse to specific feedback on challenges faced due to \nthe cost of living crisis, the Executive Committee and \nBoard gave their support to making a one-off cost of living \npayment to those individuals where the impacts were \nbelieved to be hardest felt. These impacts were also \nconsidered in agreeing salary increases for 2023.\n• Support around mental health – the pandemic brought into \nsharp focus the importance of mental health, and we have \ncontinued to receive feedback from employees seeking \nsupport in this area. Our Beazley Wellbeing network has led \non promoting a number of campaigns encouraging \ncolleagues to strike the right balance between work \npressures and their mental health, including encouraging \npeople to take a break when needed. Our Culture & People \nbusiness partners also work with their teams locally to \nidentify key issues and resolve them.\n• Supporting those with, or intending to start, a family – we \nlaunched the new Beazley Families network in 2022, with a \nfocus on supporting those colleagues already with a family, \nthose seeking to start a family and those with caring \nresponsibilities. Further resources have been developed for \nemployees and managers on our policies around families, \nincluding the ability for employees to take up to six months’ \nparental leave. A buddy system has been set up for parents \nreturning to the office who may need informal support. \n• Promoting Juneteenth – the Beazley RACE network received \nfeedback from our US workforce on the importance of \nrecognising Juneteenth as an official holiday. As a result, \nthe executive leadership team gave its support to granting \nJuneteenth as a holiday for all of our US workforce from \n2023. \nClients and broker partners \nWhy do we engage\nRespecting and listening to the needs of our clients is a \nstated key pillar of our strategy to enable Beazley to deliver its \npurpose of helping our clients explore, create and build. We \ntalk about this further in the Chief Underwriting Officer's \nreport.\nWe strive for two-way dialogue with our clients to help us \ndevelop products and insurance solutions to best meet their \nneeds. As Beazley has primarily an intermediated business \nmodel, our broker partners play a vital role in helping us \nengage and connect with our ultimate clients as well as being \na vital stakeholder in their own right.\nHow does Beazley engage\nDirect engagement with our insureds and broker partners is \nfundamental to how we do business. There is constant \nengagement by underwriters with brokers and clients to fully \nunderstand specific risks and requirements and by claims \nteams to ensure responsiveness, fair claims outcomes and \nexcellent service. We are extremely proud that in 2023, for the \nseventh year running, we were awarded the Outstanding \nService Quality Marque for claims service by Gracechurch \nConsulting. \nMore coordinated engagement with our broker partners takes \nplace via our dedicated Broker Relations team. Our Broker \nRelations team ensure we are maintaining and fostering the \nbest possible relationships with brokers to complement our \nbusiness teams.\nDuring 2022, and building on the work of our ‘Closer to the \nClient’ strategic initiative, we created the role of Client \nEngagement Manager (CEM). The CEM has responsibility for \ncoordinating activities across the business to focus on our \nultimate clients. Their work has included appointing a number \nof strategic relationship officers, who are specifically focussed \non the needs of their portfolio of clients, establishing \nworkstreams to engage with medium-sized and SME clients, \nreviewing customer survey findings and liaising with product \ndevelopment teams to address client feedback on new \nproducts. The continued adoption of a customer relationship \nmanagement (CRM) tool will be key in gathering information \non clients from across teams and be able to respond to their \nneeds.\nHow does The Board engage?\nThe Chief Executive Officer is actively engaged with key clients \nand broker partners and brings the insight he receives to \nBoard discussions. Maintaining good relationships with our \nbroker partners is a key priority of the Chief Executive Officer, \nand his engagement takes the form of discussions on specific \nand general topics in conferences and at other formal and \ninformal settings.\nA number of our Non-Executive Directors also maintain contact \nwith broker networks from their previous executive roles and \nare able to bring relevant insights to the boardroom.\nThe Board receives reports on key areas of client and broker \nengagement via reporting from the Chief Executive Officer, \nChief Underwriting Officer, and other teams. \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n51"

We partner with our clients and \nbroker partners to offer risk solutions, expertise and \nknowledge, to allow our clients to focus on running their \nbusinesses. \nOutcomes from our engagement with clients and broker \npartners during 2022\nExamples of direct engagement with clients and broker \npartners during 2022 included:\n• holding a summit with Beazley and key client \nrepresentatives on the healthcare claims environment – this \nsummit was very well received by attendees and provided a \ngreat opportunity to share insight into the healthcare claims \nenvironment on a non-specific basis. \n• engagement on developments in our cyber policies – we \nhave engaged with brokers to explain the evolving nature of \ncyber risk, particularly in the context of war, and how \nBeazley intends to respond to this risk.

We have also increased our level of formal \ninvestor engagement and, in 2022, management attended \nfour European investor conferences in 2022 and conducted a \nnumber of ad hoc investor meetings. Additionally, Beazley \nhosted a capital markets day in May, where the Chief \nExecutive Officer, Group Finance Director and the Chair met \nwith our investors. The opportunity was used to remind the \nmarket about Beazley’s products and the platform and \ndistribution strategy which underpins our planned growth.

      "text": "Outcomes from our engagement with shareholders\nand investors in 2022.\nExamples of actions taken in response to dialogue with \nshareholders during 2022 included:\n• Giving shareholders greater visibility of our longer-term \noutlook - during the year, a number of our larger \nshareholders have expressed a change in their focus to \nBeazley's long-term strategy, including the strategy for the \nCyber business and other future opportunities. This follows \nshareholders being more focussed on the shorter term \nduring Covid-19.\n• Helping shareholders to understand our platform strategy – \nan agenda topic at the capital markets day in May was to \nprovide specific information on how Beazley carries out its \nbusiness globally across multiple platforms. This followed \nfeedback that the global reach of the business and the \nplatform strategy were not well understood by some \nshareholders.\n• Seeking shareholder support in our equity raising – our \nshareholders gave us strong support in the raising of new \nequity capital in November. The additional capital serves to \nnot only support our business plans, but also address \nfeedback from some shareholders on the level of debt to \nequity that was maintained in the business. The Board's \ndecision to raise equity is further discussed in the Section \n172 statement on page 55.\n• Providing information to shareholders to support the \nproposed changes to our remuneration policy – we actively \nengaged with the top 100 shareholders and with proxy \nagencies on the proposed changes to our remuneration \npolicy. As part of this, we provided some worked examples \non how the changes to the remuneration policy could work \nin practice. Further information on the engagement with \nshareholders on the remuneration policy are included on \npage 90.\nOur regulators \nWhy do we engage?\nAt Beazley, we recognise the key role played by our regulators \nin protecting our customers. The Group seeks to maintain a \npositive and transparent relationship with each of its \nregulators, as a key element in carrying out its business \neffectively, and living to its value of ‘doing the right thing’. \nWe have a number of regulators globally including the \nPrudential Regulation Authority (PRA), Financial Conduct \nAuthority (FCA), Central Bank of Ireland (CBI), Lloyd’s, the \nConnecticut Insurance Department (CIT) and other US state \nregulators, and regulators in other jurisdictions where Beazley \noperates. \nHow does Beazley engage?\nOur Compliance function coordinates the Group’s regulatory \nrelationships, engaging with each of its regulators on a \nfrequent basis and help the Group meet their expectations.\nThere are regular scheduled meetings with the supervisors of \nthe Group’s key regulators, including an annual meeting with \nsupervisors from the PRA, CBI and CIT and the Group’s Chief \nExecutive Officer, Group Finance Director, Chief Risk Officer \nand Head of Compliance. Regulators may also request \nmeetings with other members of senior management and The \nBoard as part of the Group’s supervision.\nBeazley also engages with regulators through discussions on \ncertain topics and business activities, participates in industry-\nwide thematic reviews, core risk assessments, thought \nleadership and providing industry feedback. The engagement \nis two-way, and may be initiated by the regulator or by Beazley. \nHow does The Board engage?\nThe Board and its Committees receive reports on regulatory \npriorities and regulatory engagement, including any reviews, \nrequests and responses. This information is considered in \ndiscussions and decision-making. The regulated subsidiary \nBoards and their Committees also receive regular reports \nwhich focus on the activities and views of their respective \nregulators. \nAs mentioned, our regulators request meetings with our Board \nDirectors as required to support their overall supervision. \nFollowing such meetings, Directors share the outcomes and \nfeedback with the wider Board.\nWhat is important to our regulators?\nOur regulators are primarily concerned with the safety and \nsoundness of the firms which they regulate, the protection of \ncustomers and ensuring the stability of the wider economy. \nThis is managed through regulation and oversight of a firm’s \nactivities.\nOutcomes from engagement with regulators during 2022\nDuring 2022, we specifically engaged with our regulators on \nvarious matters including business plans and strategy, the \nwar in Ukraine, climate change, cyber insurance, the \nmodernisation programme and governance.\nOutcomes from regulatory engagement activities during 2022 \nincluded valuable feedback on the PRA climate biennial \nexploratory scenario (CBES), cyber underwriting and delegated \nauthority thematic reviews.

The new policy is for a single annual dividend \npayment to be considered based on the year-end results, with \nthe intention being to grow the level of dividend annually but \nrecognising that some earnings fluctuations are to be \nexpected. \nThe Board paused the payment of dividends following the \npayment in March 2020. The decision to resume dividend \npayments in March 2022 was taken in consideration of the \nviews of Beazley’s established shareholder base, which \nincludes a large number of employee shareholders. The \ndecision to move to an annual cycle of dividend payments was \nalso taken to give better alignment to business and capital \nplanning cycles, including to the annual capital planning cycle \nwith Lloyd’s (and other regulators) and give Beazley greater \nflexibility to be able to respond to the needs of its customers.\nApproval of the medium-term plan to support the long-\nterm strategy\nIn April 2022, The Board reviewed a plan for a number of key \nmedium-term projects to support Beazley’s longer-term \nambitions. The plan was formulated in consideration of our \npurpose of helping our customers explore, create and build, \nwith key areas of focus around de-risking, simplification, \nefficiency and product suite. \nThe medium-term plan has been developed in consideration of \nthe interests of all of Beazley’s key stakeholder groups. This \nhas included the views of clients and broker partners on the \nrole they would like Beazley to play over the medium term, and \nthe views of shareholders and regulators to ensure plans are \nprofitable and sustainable. \nA key element in the delivery of the medium-term plan is the \nexecution of steps under Beazley’s modernisation programme. \nThe modernisation programme impacts all of our people, and \nthere has been a particular focus on communicating to the \nentire workforce and obtaining feedback to ensure that there \nis a culture of engagement and openness around this \nimportant programme. The Board has received updates on the \nmodernisation programme during the year, including reviewing \nand approving the overall governance framework for ensuring \nthe modernisation programme is implemented successfully. \nThe establishment of the Risk Committee is discussed below \nand a key role of this Committee will be to provide assurance \nto The Board around the mitigation of risk on delivery of the \nmodernisation programme. \nSteps to strengthen and diversify Beazley’s overall \nbusiness, supported by the raising of additional equity \n2022 has been a year of particular turbulence, with the \nimpacts of war, energy prices and rising inflation impacting all \nof our stakeholders. The Board has monitored closely the \ndeveloping economic situation to ensure that steps are taken \nto support Beazley in remaining resilient through this time.\nIn the Chief Executive Officer’s report, we talk about the \nsupport we have provided to our employees most likely \nimpacted by the cost of living crisis, through a one-off payment \nin June 2022. In the remuneration report, we have provided \ndetails of the steps we took for year-end salary adjustments \nfor the workforce.\nDuring the year The Board has also closely monitored the \nimpact across Beazley’s markets of the macroeconomic \nsituation. In particular, The Board have noted a strong \nopportunity to grow the Property book in response to rising \nrates in Property Treaty. Engagement with senior employees \nwas key to determining that Beazley had the capacity to \nsupport growth to its Property book, which would have the \nfurther benefit of creating greater diversification across \nBeazley’s overall book. \nIn November, The Board approved that steps be taken to seek \nto raise additional equity to support the planned growth. This \nfollowed an assessment of market opportunities, including \nobtaining the views of brokers, and the need to raise \nadditional capital versus other alternatives to support these \nopportunities. The capital raising is an enabler for the further \ndiversification of Beazley’s overall book of business to support \nlong-term and sustainable business growth for the interests of \nall of its stakeholders.\nPrior to launching the equity raise, the views of most \nsignificant shareholders were assessed via Beazley’s \nstockbrokers, to the extent possible under a pre-emptive \nequity raising. The recently published recommendations of the \nPre-emption Group were also considered, as Beazley was the \nfirst FTSE 350 company to seek to raise capital under the new \nregime. \nVia the company’s subsidiary, Beazley Furlonge Limited, The \nBoard also proactively engaged with Lloyd’s to obtain views on \nthe impacts to plans for business written in the Lloyd’s \nmarket.\nOverall, the equity raise concluded with £340.8m ($404.4m)  \nof equity capital being raised through an institutional placing \nand small retail offering.

As a percentage of gross \npremiums written it increased to 26% from 24% in 2021.\nCombined ratio \nThe combined ratio of an insurance company is a measure of \nits operating performance and represents the ratio of its total \ncosts (including claims and expenses) to total net earned \npremium. \nA combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. \nConsistent delivery of operating performance across the \nmarket cycle is clearly a key objective for an insurer. Beazley’s \ncombined ratio improved in 2022 to 89% (2021: 93%). \nClaims \n2022 proved to be a year of several market events, including \nHurricane Ian and the war in Ukraine. Despite this our claims \nratio for 2022 reduced to 54% (2021: 58%), with our estimate \nfor the war in Ukraine remaining unchanged since our 2022 \ninterim report. Our expectation of losses for Hurricane Ian \nremains at $120m net of reinsurance.\nReserve margin \nBeazley has a consistent reserving philosophy, with initial \nreserves being set to include risk margins that may be \nreleased over time as and when any uncertainty reduces. \nHistorically these margins have given rise to held reserves \nwithin the range of 5-10% above our actuarial estimates, \nwhich themselves include some margin for uncertainty. The \nmargin held above the actuarial estimate was 5.3% at the end \nof 2022 (2021: 6.4%). Reserve monitoring is performed at a \nquarterly ‘peer review’, which involves a challenge process \ncontrasting the claims reserves of underwriters and claim \nmanagers, who make detailed claim-by-claim assessments, \nand the actuarial team, who provide statistical analysis. This \nprocess allows early identification of areas where claims \nreserves may need adjustment. During years where we \nexperience large losses we tend to see the margin we monitor \nbeing lowered as often we hold the same estimates within \nboth the actuarial and held reserve estimates. \nWith the move to IFRS 17 from IFRS 4, we have taken the \nopportunity to revisit our reserving strategy. What is currently \nheld under IFRS 4 will change under IFRS 17. The main \nchanges will be how we will set and disclose the level of \nreserve margin (known as risk adjustment for non-financial \nrisk under IFRS 17) and that the insurance liabilities will be \ndiscounted. Currently, Beazley has an approach of setting \nreserves within a preferred range of 5-10% above the actuarial \nestimate. The actuarial estimate itself has a level of prudence \nalready embedded, and is higher than the corresponding best \nestimate reserve.\nUnder IFRS 17, we will move to a preferred confidence level \nrange of between the 80th and 90th percentile, which will be \ndisclosed. This will show a percentile giving an indication \nabout where the reserves sits compared to the best estimate \nand the capital requirement. IFRS 17 requires that the level of \nthis additional amount above a best estimate reserve, known \nas the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, needs to be \nconsidered against a number of principles of which there are \ntwo dominant ones. First, the level needs to be consistent \nwith how risk is managed, contracts are priced and the \nportfolios are managed. The second principle states that the \nrisk adjustment level should make the firm neutral to running \noff the obligations or selling them. \nAt the end of 2022, our margin above actuarial estimates of \n5.3% equated to a confidence level at the upper end of the \n80th to 90th percentile range. At the date of transition to IFRS \n17, 1 January 2022, our reserve confidence level was also at \nthe upper end of this range, with an equivalent margin of 6.4% \nabove actuarial estimates. Under IFRS 17, we expect the \nconfidence level on transition to be nearer the middle of this \nrange. Accordingly, the Group expects the provision for claims \nrecognised on adoption of IFRS 17 to be lower than IFRS 4 \ntechnical provisions, which have historically been near the \nupper-end or above the preferred reserve range we will be \nusing under IFRS 17. This is because under IFRS 17, the level \nof reserve margin has been calculated on a ground up basis \nwith consideration of the compensation we target for each line \nof business, in line with IFRS 17 principles.\nReserve releases\nPrior year reserve releases in 2022 totalled $132.6m (2021: \n$209.8m) which represented 3.7% of earned premium. The \nreduction in reserve releases was driven primarily by a \nreduction in releases from Cyber Risks and Property Risks.\nOnce again each of the divisions released reserves off of prior \nyears in total. MAP Risks saw strong releases across all year \nof account totalling $66.2m, while the other four divisions \nreleased off two of the prior years.\nFinancial year\nSurplus in net held \nassets:reserves\nWhole account reserve strength within \nour 5-10% target range (%)\n04\n06\n08\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\n0\n5\n10\n \n60\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

Beazley’s foreign \nexchange loss taken through the statement of profit or loss in \n2022 was $24.0m (2021: $7.2m loss). The higher than \naverage loss was driven primarily by the revaluation of our \nnon-monetary items, such as deferred acquisition costs and \nunearned premium reserve, back to historic rates. From 2023, \nthis revaluation of our non-monetary items will no longer take \nplace as IFRS 17 mandates that all insurance items are now \ntreated as monetary.\nInvestment performance \nRecent rapid growth in our financial assets continued in 2022 \nas the business grew significantly and the value of our \ninvestments, cash and cash equivalents increased to \n$8,998.1m at year end (2021: $7,875.3m). We generated an \ninvestment return of $(179.7)m, or (2.1)% (2021: $116.4m, \n1.6%) on these assets during the year. \nInflation became the key consideration for financial markets in \n2022, as remaining supply-chain pressures arising from the \nCOVID-19 pandemic were exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, \naffecting energy and food costs. Earlier expectations that \nhigher inflation would be temporary were revised and central \nbanks became increasingly aggressive in raising interest rates \nas inflation accelerated. Unusually, both Sovereign bonds and \nrisk assets saw significant losses, as yields rose and \neconomic growth forecasts declined.\nUS Treasury yields at shorter maturities increased by more \nthan four percentage points during 2022; the biggest increase \nin more than half a century. We acted to reduce portfolio \nduration for much of the period, which helped to reduce the \nadverse impact of rising yields, but our fixed income \ninvestments still generated a loss of 3.0%. Global equities \nlost more than 18% in 2022 and our equity portfolio, which \nreflects our responsible investment objectives, saw modestly \ngreater losses. However, equities make up less than 3% of \nour portfolio and all of our other capital growth investments \nachieved positive returns. Our hedge funds, in particular, \nproved resilient in the difficult market conditions, returning \nmore than 7% in a year when the hedge fund universe \nrecorded losses. Overall, our capital growth investments \nreturned a small gain, of 0.3%. As part of our responsible \ninvestment initiative we have committed to build an ‘impact’ \nportfolio, of up to $100m, targeting investment opportunities \nwhich have measurable social or environmental benefits. We \nmade our first such investment in the fourth quarter of 2022, \nin a private equity fund supporting the creation of renewable \nenergy capacity in Europe.

The reinsurance receivables from \nreinsurers are split between recoveries on claims paid or \nnotified of $420.6m (2021: $371.4m), and an actuarial \nestimate of recoveries on claims that have not yet been \nreported of $2,066.8m (2021: $1,458.0m).\nThe Group’s exposure to reinsurers is managed through:\n• minimising risk through selection of reinsurers who meet \nstrict financial criteria (e.g. minimum net assets, minimum \n‘A’ rating by S&P). These criteria vary by type of business \n(short vs medium tail);\n• timely calculation and issuance of reinsurance collection \nnotes from our ceded reinsurance team; and\n• regular monitoring of the outstanding debtor position by our \nReinsurance Security Committee and Credit Control \nCommittee. We continue to provide against impairment of \nreinsurance recoveries and at the end of 2022 our provision \nin respect of reinsurance recoveries totalled $29.3m (2021: \n$11.5m).

The balance at 31 December \n2022 was $1,811.7m (2021: $1,696.1m). The amount of \nestimated future premium that remains in insurance \nreceivables relating to years of account that are more than \nthree years developed at 31 December 2022 is $29.8m \n(2021: $15.4m).\nInsurance liabilities \nInsurance liabilities of $10,354.2m (2021: $8,871.8m) \nconsist of two main elements, being the unearned premium \nreserve (UPR) and gross insurance claims liabilities. Our UPR \nhas increased by 20% to $2,971.7m (2021:$2,472.7m). The \nmajority of the UPR balance relates to current year premiums \nthat have been deferred and will be earned in future periods. \nCurrent indicators are that the business is profitable. \nGross insurance claims reserves are made up of claims which \nhave been notified to us but not yet paid of $1,758.4m \n(2021: $1,627.5m), and an estimate of claims incurred but \nnot yet reported (IBNR) of $5,624.1m (2021: $4,771.7m). \nThese are estimated as part of the quarterly reserving process \ninvolving the underwriters and Group Actuary.

      "text": "Financial review\nBalance sheet management\ncontinued\nFinancial liabilities \nFinancial liabilities comprise borrowings and derivative \nfinancial liabilities. The Group utilises two long-term debt \nfacilities: \n• in November 2016, Beazley Insurance dac issued $250m of \n5.875% subordinated tier 2 notes due in 2026; and \n• in September 2019, Beazley Insurance dac issued $300m \nof 5.5% subordinated tier 2 notes due in 2029.\nA syndicated short-term banking facility led by Lloyds Banking \nGroup plc provides potential borrowings up to $450m. Under \nthe facility $450m may be drawn as letters of credit to \nsupport underwriting at Lloyd’s, and up to $225m may be \nadvanced as cash under a revolving facility. The cost of the \nfacility is based on a commitment fee of 0.4725% per annum, \nand any amounts drawn are charged at a margin of 1.35% per \nannum. \nThe cash element of the facility will expire on 23 July 2024, \nwhilst letters of credit issued under the facility can be used to \nprovide support for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 underwriting \nyears. In 2022 $225m has been placed as a letter of credit \nas Funds at Lloyd’s (FAL).\nOther assets \nOther assets are analysed separately in the notes to the \nfinancial statements. The items included comprise:\n• deferred acquisition costs of $550.1m (2021: $477.8m); \nand \n• deferred tax assets available for use against future taxes \npayable of $35.2m (2021: $16.3m).\nJudgement is required in determining the policy for deferring \nacquisition costs. Beazley’s policy assumes that variable \nreward paid to underwriters relates to prior years’ business \nand is not an acquisition cost. As a result, the quantum of \ncosts classified as acquisition is towards the lower end of the \npossible range seen across the insurance market. Costs \nidentified as related to acquisition are then deferred in line \nwith premium earnings.\nCapital structure\nCapital structure \nBeazley aims to hold capital in excess of regulatory \nrequirements in order to be best placed to swiftly take \nadvantage of growth opportunities arising outside of our \nbusiness plan, as well as to provide additional protection \nagainst downside events.\nThe Group actively seeks to manage its capital structure. Our \npreferred use of capital is to deploy it on opportunities to \nunderwrite profitably.\nBeazley has a number of requirements for capital at a Group \nand subsidiary level. Capital is primarily required to support \nunderwriting at Lloyd’s, in the US and through our European \nbranches and is subject to prudential regulation by local \nregulators (the Prudential Regulation Authority, Lloyd’s, the \nCentral Bank of Ireland, and the US state level supervisors). \nBeazley is subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the \nEuropean Union (EU) Solvency II regime (SII). We comply with \nall relevant SII requirements.\nFurther capital requirements come from rating agencies which \nprovide ratings for Beazley Insurance Company, Inc and \nBeazley Insurance dac. We aim to manage our capital levels \nto obtain the ratings necessary to trade with our preferred \nclient base.\nBeazley holds a level of capital over and above its regulatory \nrequirements. The amount of surplus capital held is \nconsidered on an ongoing basis in light of the current \nregulatory framework, opportunities for organic or acquisitive \ngrowth and a desire to maximise returns for investors.\nIn November 2022 we raised $404m of new capital through a \nnon-pre-emptive share issuance. The decision to raise this \nadditional equity was taken following the market dislocation \nacross the Property market. We see this as an opportunity to \nexpand our Property and Reinsurance books, whilst also \nenabling further growth within our Cyber Risks and Specialty \nRisks books, net of reinsurance.\n2022\n2021\n$m\n$m\nShareholders’ funds\n2,573.5\n2,130.8\nTier 2 subordinated debt (2026)\n249.4\n249.1\nTier 2 subordinated debt (2029)\n298.6\n298.3\nDrawdown of letter of credit\n225.0\n225.0\n3,346.5\n2,903.2\nDuring 2022 the equity raise further strengthened our capital \nbase which will enable us to deliver our underwriting plan.

Furthermore, rather than taking a one year view of this \nbusiness, it assumes that all risks run to ultimate. Finally, \nLloyd's apply a 35% uplift to this number. These three factors \nmake the ECR requirement considerably more onerous than \nthe standard Solvency II measure which considers a one year \ntime horizon and contains no uplift.\nIn general we expect our capital requirement to grow broadly \nin line with the net written premiums in our business plan, \nwhich in the short term should be double digit growth; \nhowever, premium growth due to rate change has a more \nlimited impact on the capital requirement, as the amount of \nrisk stays broadly the same.\nAt Beazley we aim to hold excess capital over the Lloyd’s ECR \nand US capital requirement, expressed as a percentage of \nLloyd’s ECR, and have a preferred range of 15-25%. Given the \nstringent nature of the Lloyd’s ECR as noted above, our Group \nsurplus capital ratio is not directly comparable to the standard \nSolvency II capital ratio which is based on a one year time \nhorizon.\nAt 31 December 2022, we have surplus capital (on a Solvency \nII basis) of 44%, above our current preferred range of 15% to \n25% of ECR. Following payment of the proposed interim \ndividend of 13.5p, this surplus reduces to 40%. \nIn addition to the surplus above, we have two further capital \nlevers which may be called upon. Firstly, the remaining \nundrawn banking facility of $225m may be utilised and is not \nincluded within the capital stack used in the capital surplus \ncalculation. Secondly, we continue to use reinsurance as a \ntool to manage our capital position.\nTo ensure capital efficiency is maintained for our operations in \nthe US, we continue to use a captive arrangement through \nBeazley NewCo Captive Company, Inc. that we set up in 2020.\nBoth tier 2 subordinated debt issuances issued by Beazley \nInsurance dac in 2016 and 2019 were assigned and maintain \nan Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating of ‘A+’ by Fitch. \nSolvency II\nThe Solvency II regime came into force on 1 January 2016. \nBeazley continue to provide quarterly Solvency II pillar 3 \nreporting to both Lloyd’s for the Beazley managed syndicates \nand the Central Bank of Ireland and the Prudential Regulation \nAuthority for Beazley Insurance dac and Beazley plc. \nUnder Solvency II requirements, the Group is required to \nproduce a Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) which sets out \nthe amount of capital that is required to reflect the risks \ncontained within the business. Lloyd’s reviews the syndicates’ \nSCRs to ensure that SCRs are consistent across the market.\nThe current SCR has been established using our Solvency II \napproved internal model approved by Central Bank of Ireland \n(CBI) which has been run within the regime as prescribed by \nLloyd’s. In order to perform the capital assessment:\n• we use sophisticated mathematical models that reflect the \nkey risks in the business allowing for probability of \noccurrence, impact if they do occur, and interaction between \nrisk types. A key focus of these models is to understand the \nrisk posed to individual teams, and to the business as a \nwhole, of a possible deterioration in the underwriting cycle; \nand\n• the internal model process is embedded so that teams can \nsee the direct and objective link between underwriting \ndecisions and the capital allocated to each team. This gives \na consistent and comprehensive picture of the risk/ reward \nprofile of the business and allows teams to focus on \nstrategies that improve return on capital.\nIFRS 17\nThe implementation of the IFRS 17: Insurance Contracts \nstandard came into force for accounting periods commencing \non 1 January 2023. Applying this standard has been a major \nundertaking and involved a multi-functional project over the \npast six years.\nSince the start of 2023, we have been accounting under IFRS \n17 for insurance contracts at a Group level. The expected \nimpact on equity at the date of transition, 1 January 2022, is \nan increase of at least 2% of equity. This increase is primarily \ndriven by discounting, alongside a reduction in reserves held \non the balance sheet. As discussed on page 60, these \nreserve reductions are driven by the different approach to \ncalculating the reserve margin between IFRS 4 and IFRS 17, \nmoving to a confidence level led approach. It is important to \nnote that interest rates have increased since the date of \ntransition, so the discounting effect on more recent balance \nsheet dates is expected to be more significant at other dates.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n65"

      "text": "Risk management\nand compliance\nIn a year of geopolitical instability, our risk \nmanagement and compliance functions \nsupported our business, and ultimately our \nclients, successfully through challenging \ntimes.\nRisk management oversight\nand framework\nThe Beazley plc Board delegates direct oversight of the risk \nmanagement function and framework to its Audit and Risk \nCommittee, and the primary regulated subsidiary Boards and \ntheir Audit and Risk Committees. The Board delegates \nexecutive oversight of the risk management function and \nframework to the Executive Committee, which fulfils this \nresponsibility primarily through its Risk and Regulatory \nCommittee.\nBeazley takes an enterprise-wide approach to managing risk. \nThe risk management framework establishes the approach to \nidentifying, measuring, mitigating, monitoring, and reporting on \nkey risks. The risk management framework supports the \nGroup strategy and objectives.\nBeazley leverages the ‘three lines of defence’ model, in which \nthe risk management function is part of the second line of \ndefence. Ongoing communication and collaboration across the \nthree lines of defence ensures that the Group identifies and \nmanages risks effectively.\nA suite of risk management reports support senior \nmanagement and The Board in discharging their oversight and \ndecision-making responsibilities. The risk reports include \nupdates on risk appetite, risk profiles, stress and scenario \ntesting, reverse stress testing, emerging and heightened \nrisks, a report to the Remuneration Committee, and the Own \nRisk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) report.\nThe Board approved the Group risk appetite statements during \n2022 and received updates on monitoring against risk \nappetite throughout the year.\nRisk management\nWe pride ourselves on understanding the drivers of risk; \nsupporting and challenging management on managing \nthose risks for the Group and its clients. Whilst we \nmanaged the challenges that growth can bring, we \nremain mindful of emerging risks as well as regulatory and \nlegal changes. The risk function continues to engage in \nkey strategic projects to provide second line challenge \nand ensure the risk management framework adapts \naccordingly.\nDuring the year, we made refinements to the risk \nmanagement framework including our approach to \narticulating and monitoring risk appetite. This work will \ncontinue during 2023 to ensure the framework adapts to \nthe Group risk profile and continues to embed a strong \nrisk culture. We have continued working with our \ncolleagues across the first and second lines of defence to \nensure effective risk management practices remain \nembedded in business processes. Ultimately, this will \nhelp ensure achievement of the Group’s strategic \nobjectives.\nOur approach to managing the risks arising from climate \nchange are set out within the TCFD section of this report.\nThe latest report to The Board confirmed that the control \nenvironment identified no significant failings or \nweaknesses in key processes and that Beazley plc was \noperating within risk appetite as at 31 December 2022, \nwith the systems having been in place for the entirety of \n2022.\nThe business operated a control environment which supported \nmitigating risks to stay within risk appetite. The risk \nmanagement function reviewed and challenged the control \nenvironment through various risk management activities \nthroughout the year. In addition, the risk management function \nworked with the capital model and exposure management \nteams, particularly in relation to validation of the internal \nmodel, preparing the ORSA, monitoring risk appetite and \nthrough the business planning process. These teams provided \nregular reports to the Underwriting Governance Committee \nwhich the Chief Risk Officer chairs. \nThe risk management plan considers, among other inputs, the \ninherent and residual risk scores for each risk event. The risk \nmanagement function also includes results from internal \naudits into its risk assessment process. The internal audit \nfunction considers the risk management framework in its audit \nuniverse to derive a risk-based audit plan.\nIn 2022, the Group's approach to identifying, managing and \nmitigating emerging risks was enhanced to include inputs from \nthe business,  post-risk incident lessons learned and industry  \nthought leaders. The approach considers the potential \nmateriality and likelihood of impacts which helps prioritise  \nemerging risks which the Group monitors or undertakes \nfocused work on. Key emerging risks in 2022 included \ngeopolitical risks, the macroeconomic environment (e.g. \ninflation, global insurance market trends) and ESG. The Board  \ncarried out a robust assessment of the Group's emerging and \nprincipal risks.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n67"

High calibre claims and underwriting professionals \ndeliver expert service to insureds and claims handling. The Underwriting \nCommittee oversaw these risks.\nMarket (asset)▲\nThe value of investments may be adversely impacted by financial \nmarket movements of values of investments, interest rates, \nexchange rates, or external market forces. Expected asset returns \nmay not align to risk and capital requirements. \nBeazley operated a conservative investment strategy with a view to \nlimiting investment losses that would impact the company’s financial \nresult. Beazley mitigated this risk by carrying out asset liability matching \nas per the investment constraints specified in the investment strategy. \nMore detail on climate related risks and mitigations impacting the \ninvestment strategy can be found in the TCFD report. The Investment \nCommittee oversaw the investment strategy and its implementation.\nCredit ▲\nThis risk of failure of another party to perform its financial or \ncontractual obligations in a timely manner. Exposure to credit risk \nfrom reinsurers, brokers, and coverholders, of which the \nreinsurance asset was the largest exposure for the Group. \nBeazley traded with strategic reinsurance partners over the long term \nthat support Beazley through the cycle despite catastrophic claim \nevents. The Group did not have significant concentration to reinsurers, \nensuring these partners meet internal approval criteria overseen by the \nReinsurance Security Committee. Credit risk arising from brokers (non-\npayment of premiums or claims) and coverholders being low, has relied \non robust due diligence processes and ongoing monitoring of aged debt \nand financial status.\nGroup ▲\nThe risk of an occurrence in one area of the Group, which adversely \naffects another area in the Group, resulting in financial loss and/or \nreputational damage. This also includes a deterioration in culture \nwhich leads to inappropriate behaviour, actions and/or decisions \nincluding dilution of culture or negative impact on the Group brand. \nGroup risk culture was centred on principles of transparency, \naccountability, and awareness. This expected outcome continued to help \nmaintain a strong risk culture that supported the embedding of risk \nmanagement within Beazley, such that it makes a difference and was \noverseen by The Board. An effective risk culture supported strong risk \nmanagement, encouraged sound risk taking, created an awareness of \nrisks and emerging risks. The Executive Committee and The Board \noversaw this risk.\nLiquidity ▲\nInvestments and/or other assets are not available or adequate in \norder to settle financial obligations when they fall due.\nBy managing liquidity Beazley maximised flexibility in the management of \nfinancial assets, including investment strategy, without incurring \nunacceptable liquidity risks over any time horizon; and in doing so \nhelped to ensure that clients and creditors were financially protected. \nThe Group periodically assessed the liquidity position of Beazley and \neach entity, and this was overseen by the Audit and Risk Committee. \nThis included a benchmarking view from a third-party assessment.\nRegulatory and legal ▲\nNon-compliance with regulatory and legal requirements, failing to \noperate in line with the relevant regulatory framework in the \nterritories where the Group operates leading to being unable to \nunderwrite, manage claims, fines, etc.\nThe control environment supports the nature, exposure scale and \ncomplexity of the business with oversight from the Risk and Regulatory \nCommittee. The Group maintains a trusting and transparent relationship \nwith regulators, ensuring coordinated communication and the following \nof robust processes, policies and procedures in the business.

      "text": "Risk management\nand compliance continued\nViability statement\nThe Board assesses the viability of the Group within the long-\nterm plan over a five-year period. A period of five years is \nconsidered short enough to be reasonably assessable, given \nthe dynamic nature of the business that we underwrite as a \nspecialist insurer, with the need to adapt capital and solvency \nin response to changing markets and emerging opportunities. \nHowever, it is also long enough to reflect the Group risk profile \nof a portfolio of diversified short-tailed and medium-tailed \ninsurance liabilities.\nThe business planning process tests and demonstrates the \nongoing viability of the business. This includes a base view of \nprofit and growth so that the reinsurance requirements and \ncapital surplus can be projected. As a specialist insurer, we \nmanage several risks as listed above; however the principal \nrisk that could undermine the business model is insurance \nrisk. The business plan sets out a view of the emerging risks \nthat impact this area (e.g. social and economic inflation) and \nhow the business will respond to these trends. The business \nplanning process also considers key risks: for example, \nnatural catastrophe risk was compared to the capital surplus \nand the cyber exposure as a share of the total is monitored. \nScenarios were also tested that allow for a range of gross \nrates, volume, and reinsurance rates and availability. The \nimpacts of climate related trends were allowed for in the plan \nand The Board has also assessed the impact of climate \nchange and concluded that it does not lead to unviability.\nA range of stresses, scenarios and modelled exposures were \nreported by the business throughout the year. These help to \nmonitor aggregations across our key insurance risk \nexposures, such as casualty, cyber and natural catastrophe, \nas well as potential reserve deteriorations and investment risk \nstresses. The five most material realistic disaster scenarios \nrelating to our casualty and cyber exposures were reviewed \nand approved by The Board. We also considered several \nreverse stress tests, which identified extreme scenarios which \ncould trigger unviability (either through insolvency or a loss of \nstakeholder confidence) and the possible mitigations and \nactions. Based on our related risk profile, this considered \nevents such as a natural catastrophe, cyber catastrophe, and \nmajor operational incident (e.g., internal fraud). Much of the \nabove stress and scenario testing was incorporated into the \nannual ORSA that was presented to The Board and \nsummarised the short-term and longer-term risks to the Group \nand the capital implications. \nIn the unlikely event that capital surplus falls below the \ninternal 15% threshold, additional capital may be available \nfrom a number of sources. The Group maintains a list of \nmitigation options available to improve its position in the \nevent of liquidity or capital distress. The financial and \ncorporate actions available to Beazley are monitored on an \nongoing basis. The available mitigation options following an \nextreme event include:\n• Underwriting action/manage plan growth;\n• Stop/delay infrastructure investment;\n• Sell off business units;\n• Suspension of dividends;\n• Additional reinsurance purchases;\n• Posting of available unutilised letter of credit as funds at \nLloyd’s; and\n• Accessing additional external capital via debt or equity \nmarkets.\nThe Board has concluded, based on the business plan, \nscenario and ORSA reporting, that there is a reasonable \nexpectation that the Group will be able to continue to operate \nand meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five year \nperiod of assessment.\nRegulatory compliance\nTo ensure that we conduct business in accordance with \nall applicable laws and regulations we operate a Group-\nwide compliance framework designed to consider the \nrisk, govern decision-making, ensure the best for our \nclients and monitor performance. Our compliance \nframework consists of processes, policies and controls, \nincluding senior management oversight, training, risk \nassessments, monitoring and reporting.\nThe recent challenging geopolitical environment has \nheightened the importance of ensuring compliance with \nrapidly changing regulations and laws, such as \nsanctions, and ensuring there is a robust anti-financial \ncrime control environment.

Equally, Fiona augments The Board's strengths \nthrough her extensive leadership experience and senior \nfinance positions in listed firms, general insurers and at the \nCentral Bank of Ireland. With these new appointments, I \nstrongly believe that Beazley’s Board has the breadth and \ndepth of experience and skills to support the company’s \nstrategic aims, purpose and values and this has been further \nenhanced by the new Board members. I am pleased to report \nthat The Board is currently well-balanced in terms of gender. \nFollowing Clive Bannister joining The Board in February 2023, \nThe Board is comprised of 45% women.

They \ninspire the way we work, from how we engage with our \nstakeholders and colleagues, to how we design our \nworkspaces, treat our customers and behave as a responsible \nbusiness. Keeping and renewing our strong culture is key for \nBeazley in achieving its purpose of helping our clients and \npeople to explore, create and build in a complex and uncertain \nworld.\nWe are proud of our culture, it resonates with our people, and \nit always scores very highly in our employee engagement \nsurveys. The Board monitors culture through various \nmechanisms including: the annual employee engagement and \nleadership surveys, turnover statistics, whistleblowing and \ngrievance data, feedback from leavers, periodic internal audit \nreviews, and routine board reporting. The Board is very \nfocused on helping to promote an open culture and \nmaintaining regular engagement with the workforce. This is a \nkey focus of the director with responsibility for bringing the \nemployee voice to The Board. Fiona Muldoon succeeded Bob \nStuchbery in this role in November 2022. The stakeholder \nengagement report on page 50 provides further information on \nhow Beazley’s culture supports the interactions with all of its \nstakeholders, and how The Board oversees stakeholder \nengagement and considers it in decision making.\nThe findings of the 2022 employee engagement survey will be \nassessed by The Board in early 2023. A brief overview is \nincluded in the stakeholder engagement report on page 50.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Board is committed to promoting inclusion and diversity in \nall its forms and is pleased to have met the Parker Review \nrecommendations and other targets in relation to Board \ndiversity. However, we recognise our work in this area is never \ndone. To make more impactful progress in this area, Beazley \nupdated its global diversity policy and introduced a Board \ndiversity policy in January 2022, which details a set of pledges \naimed at building a diverse, inclusive environment that \noperates zero tolerance to discrimination or harassment and \nfully supports and celebrates differences. These policies are \naligned to each other and to the Company's strategy.\nWe also recognise that aspiring to have a diverse workforce is \nnot enough. We remain committed to our race and ethnicity \ndiversity goals to have at least 25% of the global workforce \nconsisting of people of colour. We also committed to reaching \nat least 45% female representation in senior leadership. Both \nof these targets were set for the end of 2023. We have \nalready met the race target and are on track to meet the \ngender target. More information on Beazley’s inclusion and \ndiversity initiatives can be found in the responsible business \nreport and the Nomination Committee report.\nRemuneration policy \nIn accordance with the normal three-year cycle, our \nshareholders will have an opportunity to vote on a revised \nremuneration policy at the 2023 AGM. Over the last 12 \nmonths the Remuneration Committee has undertaken a full \nreview of the policy to ensure that it supports our strategy, \npromotes Beazley’s long-term success, and is aligned with our \npurpose and shareholder expectations. For more information \non the proposed changes to the policy, please see the \nDirectors' remuneration report on page 111. \nStakeholder engagement\nThe Board has continued to identify employees, clients and \nbroker partners, shareholders and regulators as its key \nstakeholders. In addition, we also recognise that Beazley’s \nsuppliers and the communities in which the Group operates \nare important stakeholders to be considered in decision \nmaking. On pages 50 to 57 we discuss how these \nstakeholder groups have been considered in key decisions \ntaken during the year. \nLooking ahead\nAs ever, we welcome any and all engagement with our \nshareholders either via our AGM, our presentations throughout \nthe year and via our website. All directors expect to attend this \nyear’s AGM, which will again provide an opportunity for all \nshareholders to hear more about our performance and to ask \nkey questions of The Board. Where it is not possible for \ndirectors to attend in person, arrangements will be in place for \nthese individuals to attend virtually.\nI would like to thank all of my colleagues on The Board for \ntheir contributions during the year.\nChristine LaSala\nInterim Chair\n \n74\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

Following this, \nChristine LaSala, who was independent on appointment to \nThe Beazley plc Board, was appointed as Interim Chair and \nhas led The Board whilst the recruitment process for a new \nChair was being conducted. In addition to the Chair, at 31 \nDecember 2022, The Board consisted of seven independent \nNon-Executive Directors. Prior to David’s resignation, there \nwere eight independent Non-Executive Directors in addition to \nthe Chair. Christine LaSala was the Senior Independent Non-\nExecutive Director until her appointment as interim Chair on \n21 October 2022. Robert Stuchbery was appointed as the \nInterim Senior Independent Director on 21 October 2022. The \nBoard also consists of two Executive Directors, Adrian Cox \nwho is Chief Executive Officer and Sally Lake who is the Group \nFinance Director. The Non-Executive Directors, who have been \nappointed for specified terms and are subject to annual \nelection or re-election by the shareholders, are considered by \nThe Board to be independent of management and free of any \nrelationship which could materially interfere with the exercise \nof their independent judgement.\nOn 8 February 2023, the new Chair Designate Clive Bannister \nwas announced. Following this appointment there are nine \nindependent Non-Executive Directors including the Chair \nDesignate, who was independent on appointment.\nThe Senior Independent Director will, if required, deputise for \nthe Chair and their role is to act as a sounding board for the \nChair and as an intermediary for other directors. They are \navailable to talk to shareholders if they have any issues or \nconcerns or if there are any unresolved matters that \nshareholders believe should be brought to their attention. \nOn 25 March 2022, The Board appointed Pierre-Olivier \nDesaulle to the Nomination Committee and on 26 April 2022 \nThe Board appointed Raj Agrawal to the Remuneration \nCommittee. Cecilia Reyes Leuzinger and Fiona Muldoon were \nappointed as Non-Executive Directors to The Board and as \nmembers of the Audit and Risk Committee with effect from 31 \nMay 2022.

Nicola Hodson is acting \nas Interim Chair of the Remuneration Committee. Bob \nStuchbery, as confirmed above, is acting as Interim Senior \nIndependent Director.\nBoard information\nThe Company Secretary, Christine Oldridge, ensures that \nboard members receive timely and accurate financial and \noperational information to enable them to discharge their \nduties appropriately. Board papers are circulated digitally, \nusually one week in advance of board meetings. Directors also \nhave access to independent professional advice at the \ncompany’s expense, if they consider this appropriate. During \n2022, independent professional advice was sought on \nconflicts of interest in relation to proposed group transactions.\nIn accordance with the Code, The Board has recommended \nthat all directors should submit themselves for election or re-\nelection on an annual basis and as such all directors will \nstand for election or re-election at the forthcoming AGM.\nBiographies of current board members appear in The Board of \nDirectors section on page 77. The biographies indicate the \nhigh level and wide range of business experience that are \nessential to manage a business of this size and complexity. \nAn established operational and management structure is in \nplace and the roles and responsibilities of senior executives \nand key members of staff are clearly defined.\nBoard meeting attendance\nThe full Board meets at least five times each year and more \nfrequently where business needs require.

They are asked to complete a skills and \nknowledge assessment and a tailored initial training plan is \ndeveloped to ensure the director is capable and comfortable \nin discharging their duties. Where appropriate, mentoring is \nprovided to new directors by an external provider. Annual \ntraining is provided for all directors. The training sessions \ninclude business and industry specific topics and information \non changes to director duties and responsibilities and to legal, \naccounting, information security and tax matters. Standard \ntraining modules are regularly reviewed to ensure they meet \nbest practice and the changing business environment. \nBespoke training will also be provided if requested by any \ndirector.\nIn 2022, director training included: reinsurance strategy and \neconomics, IFRS 17, European operating structure and cyber \nscenarios. The training sessions include videos sent out in \nadvance, followed by a live question and answer session \nwhere the directors can discuss specific aspects of interest to \nthem in detail. \nFor topics of key significance, more frequent optional briefings \nare held for directors to ensure they have sufficient \ninformation and understanding to discuss and challenge \nmanagement. For example, during 2022 a series of briefings \nwere held on IFRS 17 to provide director with sufficient detail \non the requirements and key judgements which would need to \nbe made by The Board and Committees upon transition to the \nnew standard in 2023. \nTo enable The Board to function effectively and directors to \ndischarge their responsibilities, full and timely access is given \nto all relevant information. In the case of board meetings, this \nconsists of a comprehensive set of papers, including regular \nbusiness progress reports and discussion documents \nregarding specific matters. Directors have access to an \nelectronic information repository to support their activities. \nThe terms and conditions of appointment for all the Non-\nExecutive Directors set out the expected time commitment \nand they agree that they have sufficient time to provide what \nis expected of them.\nDuring the year, there has been a continued focus on \nimproving the quality of board reporting to promote better \ndiscussions and further assist decision-making. Refresher \ntraining sessions on how to write effective board reports have \nbeen carried out by the external provider of the board portal \nplatform and the corporate governance team have also \nprovided training to relevant authors of Board and Committee \nreports. The Board and Committees consider the quality of \nreporting at each meeting and feedback is provided to ensure \ncontinuous improvement.\nThere is an agreed principle that directors may take \nindependent professional advice if necessary at the \ncompany’s expense, assuming that the expense is \nreasonable. This is in addition to the access which every \nDirector has to the Company Secretary. The Company \nSecretary supports the chair to ensure that The Board has the \nnecessary policies, processes, information, time and the \nresources to function effectively and efficiently.\nBoard performance evaluation\nThe report on the internal Board evaluation carried out during \n2022 and progress against the outcomes of the 2021 \nexternally facilitated evaluation is on page 88. \nInclusion and diversity\nThe Board firmly believes that having an inclusive and diverse \nworkplace will support us in our ambitions to outperform the \nmarkets in our chosen areas of business. The Board has \ncontinued to meet the ethnic diversity targets set by the \nParker Review. The Board is currently comprised of 45% \nwomen directors. \nWe were pleased to already be meeting the new Listing Rule \nrequirements that at least one of the chair, senior \nindependent director, chief executive officer or finance director \nroles is held by a woman; that 40% of The Board are women; \nand that at least one member of The Board is from a minority \nethnic background (as categorised by the UK Office of \nNational Statistics). We have voluntarily disclosed this \ninformation for 2022 in the Nomination Committee report.\nIn addition, we have met the voluntary recommendations of \nthe FTSE Women Leaders Review, that 40% of senior \nleadership positions are held by women by the end of 2025. \nOur own goal is 45% representation by the end of 2023, which \nwe are on target to meet. \nThe current composition, gender, tenure and diversity of The Board members are set out below.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n85"

During the year The Board \napproved a new target to increase the representation of \npeople of colour in senior leadership roles. More information \nis included in the responsible business report on page 21 and \nthe Nomination Committee report on page 100. \nThe Board has adopted a global Inclusion and Diversity policy, \nwhich sets out the approach to inclusion and diversity across \nthe business. In January 2022, The Board also adopted its \nown Inclusion and Diversity policy. Diversity of thought is also \nchampioned, and our Board reflects this, with the skills and \nexperience of the directors set out in the biographies on \npages 77 and 78. There is a mix of tenures on The Board \nwhich brings a fresh perspective as well as a long-term \nunderstanding of the business, how it has grown and its \nculture.\nThe Nomination Committee continually reviews our approach \nto diversity and our aim is to promote diversity in the hiring of \nnew employees and in creating opportunities for individuals to \nprogress their career within Beazley.\nFurther details regarding The Board’s approach are included in \nthe report from the Nomination Committee on page 100.

However, such a \nsystem can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance \nagainst material misstatement or loss. The system is \ndesigned to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure \nto achieve business objectives within the risk appetite set by \nThe Board. The Board confirms that it is comfortable with the \neffectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal \ncontrols (including financial, operational and compliance \ncontrols), which have been in place throughout 2022 and \ncontinue to operate up to the date of approval of the annual \nreport and accounts. More information is provided in the Audit \nand Risk Committee report on page 91.\nThe Board agrees the overall risk appetite for the Group. \nThroughout the year, The Board has monitored performance \nagainst risk appetite in accordance with the risk management \nframework, which is itself reviewed and approved by The \nBoard annually. Key components of the risk management \nframework include ongoing assessment and validation of \ncontrols, and taking steps to ensure that controls remain \neffective. Ongoing oversight of risk is undertaken via the \nExecutive Risk and Regulatory Committee, which meets each \nmonth and considers risk KPIs and reviews of specific risk \nareas. There is ongoing reporting of risk matters to the Audit \nand Risk Committee and Board, via the risk management \nteam. Risk management also provide The Board with specific \nassessments of risk to support key decision-making. Early in \nthe year, risk management provided a risk assessment for the \nUkraine/Russia conflict, with particular regard to our MAP and \nCyber classes, which identified key themes and areas of focus \nas well as recommendations for The Board’s consideration. \nThe Board also discussed a risk assessment on inflation \n(including economic and social inflation) highlighting key \nrecommendations and the mitigations in place across core \nfunctions. In addition, risk management provided an opinion \non the approach to, and risks around, loss estimates for \nHurricane Ian. Other ongoing assessments throughout the \nyear included regular reviews of the Group’s modernisation \nprogramme, data management control framework and \neconomic downturn risk. During the year the risk management \nframework and risk appetite statements were reviewed and \nrefreshed. Further information is provided in the risk \nmanagement and compliance report on page 67.\nDuring 2022, the Audit and Risk Committee and Board have \nreviewed and provided comment on the Own Risk and \nSolvency Assessment (ORSA) report. The ORSA provides a \ndetailed assessment of the short- and long-term risks faced by \nthe company to ensure that solvency needs can be met. The \nORSA policy is reviewed and approved annually by The Board.\nThe Audit and Risk Committee receives regular reports on the \nfindings of reviews undertaken by internal audit. The \nCommittee also considered any significant findings raised by \nthe external auditors during their reviews of the annual and \ninterim results. Members of the Audit and Risk Committee \ncould also discuss relevant matters with the internal and \nexternal auditors without members of management being \npresent.\nOn 1 January 2023, the Audit and Risk Committee was \nreplaced by a separate Audit Committee and Risk Committee \nto enhance oversight responsibilities and committee \neffectiveness.

The evaluation is \ndesigned to assess whether The Board and its Committees are operating effectively and whether the Chair and individual \nDirectors are making effective contributions. Feedback from the evaluation is also used to formulate action plans for \nimprovement areas and identify where the composition of The Board and Committees could be enhanced.\nAn externally facilitated performance evaluation is carried out every three years, and the evaluation is conducted internally in \nother years. As an external evaluation was conducted by Clare Chalmers Limited in 2021, the Nomination Committee \ndetermined that it was appropriate for the 2022 performance evaluation to be conducted internally. The external and internal \nevaluations complement Beazley’s overall approach to board evaluation.\nBeazley’s overall approach to board evaluation\n \nExternal reviews (every three years)\nInternal reviews (other years)\nAn independent external evaluation firm is appointed \nwho works with the Chair, the Nomination Committee \nand Company Secretary to define the scope of the \nevaluation. This scope is designed to build on \nBeazley’s experience from previous evaluations, \nwhilst also enabling the evaluator to use their own \nexperience and independence to provide insight.\nThe evaluator will conduct interviews with Directors, \nattend board and committee meetings and review \nmeeting materials to support assessments of the \neffectiveness of The Board and its Committees.\nOn conclusion of their work, the evaluator will \nprovide a detailed report on their findings, which they \nwill present to The Board for review and discussion. \nThe Board will therefore have the opportunity to \nchallenge any of the findings before an action plan is \nagreed. Progress against these actions is monitored \nby The Board throughout the year.\nThis process is undertaken for Beazley plc and other \nkey Group subsidiaries.\nThe Chair and Company Secretary meet with Directors individually to obtain their views \non the effectiveness of The Board and each Committee. Directors are encouraged to \nshare their views openly, and a number of specific questions are asked to each \ndirector to determine overall Board and Committee effectiveness.\nThe findings from this work are presented to The Board and an action plan is created \nto address specific findings. Progress against these actions is monitored by The \nBoard throughout the year.\nThe Chair also conducts separate meetings with each Director to solicit their feedback \non board dynamics, review their individual performance and determine any steps to be \ntaken. The Senior Independent Director conducts this review of the Chair. The findings \nfrom these discussions are considered alongside individual Directors’ skills self-\nassessments to identify any areas for individual or collective board training for the \nfollowing year.\nThis process is undertaken for Beazley plc and other key group subsidiaries.\nFindings from the 2022 evaluation\nPerformance of The Board and its Committees\nOverall, the 2022 evaluation concluded that The Board and \neach of its Committees are operating effectively. The overall \nfindings were that The Board and Committees have strong \ncompositions and good diversity of background and \nexperience; there is an inclusive culture in the board room, \nwhich encourages challenge and contribution from the \nDirectors; and that the newer Non-Executive Directors have \nbrought new insights and perspectives which are helpful and \npositive. A number of actions were agreed to address specific \nobservations and support the continued effectiveness of The \nBoard and Committees, and these actions are set out below.\nSpecific comments are made in the committee reports on \nrelevant findings from the evaluation of that Committee.\nChair and individual Director performance\nOverall, the evaluation concluded that the Chair and each \nDirector are operating effectively and contributing to the \neffective operation of The Board and Committees. A number of \nareas to support Directors’ individual or collective \nperformance were identified, and action plans have been \nformulated. This includes delivery of the 2023 Board \nknowledge and training plan.\nThe 2022 review concluded that the Chair provided support to \nthe effective operation of The Board through strong leadership \nand driving an open and inclusive environment where debate \nis encouraged.

This will include consideration of the sequencing of meetings and the use \nof in-person/hybrid formats to support the effective operation of The Board and \nCommittees and encourage free-flowing conversations.\nProgress made on action areas from the 2021 external Board performance evaluation\nEnsure Non-Executive Directors continue to provide a \ncreative contribution by stepping back from the detail \nin areas where management can provide assurance.\nThrough 2022, Directors have been focussed on providing the right level of input and \noversight, and avoiding getting into too much detail where this is not needed.\nThis has been supported by improvements to the quality of board reporting (as \nmentioned below). The Executive Committee also received specific training on how to \nbest manage relationships with The Board.\nContinuing to improve Board reporting.\nFollowing the work commenced in 2021, steps have continued in 2022 to embed \nimproved reporting to Boards and Committees. At each meeting, views are sought \nfrom Directors on areas where reporting can be further improved. Feedback is then \nshared with authors and support and training provided.\nA suite of reporting templates and training materials has been made available to all \nemployees to support in preparing board reports.\nConsidering sequencing of meetings to streamline \nagendas and achieve efficiency between The Board \nand Committees, and key subsidiary boards, by \nassigning responsibility for oversight of different \ntopics.\nSpecific focus has been given to the timetable of meetings in 2023 to support \nefficiency of operation and decision-making across Boards and Committees.\nWork to further drive the efficiency of corporate governance will continue through the \ngovernance review action identified in the 2022 evaluation.\nSharpening The Board’s strategic focus by giving \nmore attention to a five- and ten-year time horizon\nImproving long-term strategy and planning have been key areas of focus in 2022. The \nboard reviewed specific medium-term and long-term plans in 2022, and approved \nsteps for their further development and implementation.\nIn line with previous years, The Board met over a number of days in May to discuss \nstrategic matters. This included consideration of longer-term market trends, \ntechnological developments, ESG and overall business strategy. The Board will \ncontinue to consider and debate matters of longer-term strategic importance. \nExploring ways to enhance workforce engagement.\nA re-launch of the employee voice took place during 2022 and included the \nenhancement of board reporting of employee engagement.\nFiona Muldoon was appointed as the employee voice of The Board in November 2022, \nand will continue the work with Culture & People and other stakeholders to review the \nprocess and channels for engagement between the workforce and The Board. See the \nstakeholder engagement report on page 50 for more information on engagement \nchannels.\nContinuing to lead the Group on ESG matters and \nensuring there is sufficient reporting to subsidiary \nBoards to enable them to fulfil their regulatory \nresponsibilities.\nDuring 2022, the Beazley plc Board’s role in overseeing the Group’s overall approach \nto ESG has been embedded.

      "text": "Engagement in action: \nspotlight on the\nremuneration policy\nIn accordance with the Code, our remuneration policy is \nsubject to a binding vote from shareholders every three years. \nThe policy was last approved at the 2020 AGM, and the \nrevised policy will be proposed for approval at the company's \nAGM on 25 April 2023. \nIn advance of presenting the final policy for approval at the \n2023 AGM, the remuneration committee conducted an \nextensive engagement exercise to ensure that shareholders’ \nviews were addressed. This exercise commenced in October \n2022 with the chair of the remuneration committee writing to \nthe majority of Beazley’s shareholders (who collectively \nrepresented 94% of Beazley’s issued share capital) and the \nmain proxy advisory agencies to gather shareholder feedback \nfor consideration in the proposed new policy. Through this \nwritten communication, the committee was able to clearly set \nout the key policy changes being considered and how they \nwould further align executive remuneration pay with Beazley’s \nlong-term strategy. \nWe invited shareholders to provide their responses to the \nproposals and gave them the opportunity to meet with the \nchair of the remuneration committee and members of Beazley \nmanagement to further discuss the proposed changes and \nprovide feedback. Following this, a number of meetings were \nheld with shareholders and written feedback was also \nreceived. This feedback was discussed by the remuneration \ncommittee, and has resulted in a number of changes being \nmade to the remuneration policy being presented for approval \nat the 2023 AGM, as follows: \n• Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) – Around 145 employees \nparticipate in Beazley’s LTIP each year and it represents a \ncritical tool to incentivise and retain senior talent.  Since \n2012 the vesting of our LTIP has been wholly based on \ngrowth in net asset value per share (NAVps).  NAVps is \nBeazley’s central KPI and its use in the LTIP strongly aligns \nthe interests of participants with our shareholders.  LTIPs \nare awarded in two tranches with 50% vesting over three \nyears (subject to an additional two year holding period) and \n50% vesting over five years. The five year performance \nperiod is longer than is typically seen in the market. \nDuring the consultation we explored the idea of amending \nour performance assessment so that NAVps would be \nmeasured over five separate years. The intention being that \nthis would help to limit the disproportionate impact that \nexceptionally good or bad years can have over the five year \nperformance period. The design included a number of best \npractice features including an underpin, so that awards \ncould be scaled back if cumulative NAVps growth was \nnegative.\n \nBased on some shareholder feedback the Committee decided \nagainst the annualised LTIP approach. Taking into account the \nviews of shareholders the remuneration committee agreed \nthat it would not proceed with this change. Instead, the \ncommittee is proposing an amendment to the policy so that \nthe entire LTIP is based on performance measured over three \nyears. This compromise more closely aligns to typical market \npractice, taking on board the views of shareholders, and \nreduces the impact that a single year has on multiple LTIP \nawards. \n• ESG in incentives – during 2022 the remuneration \ncommittee has given careful consideration on how Beazley’s \ncommitment to doing the right thing for our people, partners \nand the planet should be reflected in the remuneration \nframework.  ESG performance forms part of the annual \nbonus, and as part of the consultation, the committee \nproposed that ESG metrics should be included in the LTIP.\nShareholders gave their strong support for this proposal, \nand the committee has taken into account their comments \nwhen setting ESG targets that are suitably stretching, \nquantifiable and align with our external commitments. \n• Chief Executive Officer salary – Although the Chief Executive \nOfficer’s salary is not a matter concerning the new policy, \nthe committee was also keen to discuss this with \nshareholders.\nThe Remuneration Committee recognises the calibre, \nexperience and track record of Adrian Cox, and his key role \nin supporting Beazley to deliver its long-term strategic \npriorities. The committee was of the view that Adrian’s \nsalary did not reflect his particular skills and experience, nor \nthat it was appropriate for Beazley’s size and complexity. \nAccordingly, the committee considered that it would be \nappropriate to make an increase for 2023.\nA number of shareholders commented that generally they \nexpect salary increases for executives directors to be in-line \nwith or below the increases for the workforce, and that this \nissue was exacerbated by the current macro-economic \nenvironment. The committee agrees with this principle as \ncan be seen by the alignment between the Group Finance \nDirector’s salary increase and the workforce.  In addition, \nthey took into account the recent support provided by \nBeazley to the workforce, including one-off payments and \nadditional salary increases to those employees most likely \nimpacted by the cost-of-living crisis. Overall, the committee \nbelieves that the proposed salary increase to the Chief \nExecutive Officer remains appropriate, further information on \nwhich is found on page 122 of the directors’ remuneration \nreport.\nThe other proposed changes to the policy were strongly \nsupported by all shareholders that engaged with the company. \nThe Remuneration Committee welcomed the opportunity to \nengage openly with its shareholders and appreciates the input \nof all those who participated in the consultation. Full \ninformation on the proposed changes to the remuneration \npolicy are available in the Directors’ remuneration report on \npage 111.\n \n90\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "Audit and Risk Committee\nDear shareholder\nI am pleased to report on the activities of the Audit and Risk \nCommittee in 2022 as we supported The Board in overseeing \naccurate financial reporting and audit processes, compliance \nwith laws and regulations and a robust risk management \nframework.\nFirm foundations in a turbulent time\n2022 has been a particularly turbulent time on a global level. \nThe devastating war in Ukraine, cost of living crisis and effects \nof global inflation have further reminded us of our \ninterconnected world and how impacts of events can be far \nreaching. This followed closely after the impacts of Covid-19 \nand the changes we all needed to make on a personal and \nbusiness level.\nDuring this challenging year, the audit and risk committee \nhelped support Beazley’s resilience through its oversight of \nreserving, its role in ensuring the quality and integrity of \nfinancial reporting, and of a robust external audit process and \nits ongoing monitoring of the appropriateness of Beazley’s risk \nmanagement framework. The committee continued to oversee \nrisks arising from the war in Ukraine and its secondary effects, \nincluding assumptions around inflation and volatility in energy \nprices and financial markets.\nPreparedness for significant accounting and regulatory \nregime changes\n2023 will see a number of significant changes to the way we \nare required to report and oversee our business. The \nimplementation of IFRS 17 from 1 January 2023 will represent \na major change to how all insurers account for their business \nactivities, and has particular impacts on Beazley due to the \nrange of business we write.\nThere has been a significant project undertaken across many \nfunctions in Beazley in preparing the business for the changes \nunder IFRS 17, and I extend my thanks to the team for the \nwork they have undertaken. During 2022, the Audit and Risk \nCommittee closely monitored the progress of this project. \nCommittee members also received training and briefings to \nensure they fully understood the scope of IFRS 17 to support \ntheir discussions with management.\nThe Committee was also actively involved in reviewing and \ndebating with management on the key accounting judgements \nto be made under IFRS 17. Shareholders will ultimately see \nthe full impacts of IFRS 17 in our 2023 reporting, starting with \nthe 2023 half-year results and we are reporting on the \ntransition to IFRS 17 in the financial review on page 58 and in \nnote 1 to the financial statements on page 163.\nThe Committee has also overseen steps being taken across \nBeazley in preparedness for changes in US requirements \nrelating to the oversight, monitoring and governance of \ninsurance business, under the Model Audit Rule (MAR).\nClimate reporting\nWe discuss throughout this annual report Beazley’s \ncommitment to doing the right thing and being a responsible \nbusiness. In supporting these commitments, the Committee \nhas overseen further enhancement of Beazley’s reporting of \nESG matters in accordance with the ‘Taskforce on Climate-\nRelated Financial Disclosures’ (TCFD), and the early adoption \nof reporting requirements under the Companies (Strategic \nReport) (Climate-related Financial Disclosure) Regulations \n2022.\nSupporting our shareholders\nThe Committee carried out an assurance role for The Board in \nrelation to the successful cUSD400m equity raising in \nNovember 2022. This role involved not only considering \nfinancial assumptions around the capital raising, but also \nchallenging management to ensure the capital raising was \ncarried out in the best interests of all stakeholders.\nPrior to any decision to pay a dividend, the Audit and Risk \nCommittee reviews the viability of the business over the long \nterm. The Audit and Risk Committee was happy to support The \nBoard’s decision to resume the payment of a dividend \nfollowing finalisation of the results for 2021.\nHelping Beazley keep ‘different’\nThe audit and risk committee took a number of steps in 2022 \nto help support change at Beazley.\nDuring 2022, the committee oversaw a reorganisation of the \nRisk Management and Compliance teams to ensure these \nfunctions are best aligned with to the growth of the business. \nThe committee maintained its strong relationship with \nBeazley’s Chief Risk Officer, Rob Anarfi, in supporting the \nreorganisation.\nThe transition to separate Audit and Risk Committees\nI’d like to sign off this letter, which I write in my previous role \nof chair of the audit and risk committee, by thanking my fellow \ncommittee members. With effect from 1 January 2023, the \nBeazley plc Board has taken the decision to create separate \nAudit and Risk committees to further enhance Beazley’s \ncorporate governance framework and enable each Committee \nto have greater focus on their respective roles.\nOn a personal level, I look forward to taking on the role of \nChair of the new Audit Committee. I am also delighted that \nBob Stuchbery has taken on the role to chair the Risk \nCommittee. Bob and I will continue to work together In our \nnew capacities.\nJohn Reizenstein\nAudit Committee Chair \n(previously Audit and Risk Committee Chair)\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n91"

More information on this decision is provided in \nthis report. The remainder of this report provides information \non the activities of the Audit Committee during 2022, with \nactivities already undertaken by the Audit and Risk Committee \nspecifically highlighted.\nThe Committee supported The Board of Directors in \noverseeing the accuracy of financial reporting, and ensuring \nthe system of internal control, the audit process and the \ncompany’s processes for compliance with laws and \nregulations and internal policies and procedures are robust, \neffective and responsive to ever-changing environments. \nDuring 2022, the committee was focused on matters relating \nto maintaining the Group’s strong financial performance, \nnotwithstanding the residual impact of COVID-19 and the \nglobal effects of the Ukraine conflict and related sanctions \nmonitoring. They also considered the ongoing development of \nsustainability and climate change responsibilities, the \nmonitoring of the consultation by the UK’s Department for \nBusiness, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) on reforms to \naudit and corporate governance and preparing for the \nimplementation of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 and the US Model \nAudit Rule. In the discharge of their remit, the committee gave \ndue consideration to all relevant laws and regulations, the \nprovisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘Code’) and \nthe requirements of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing, \nProspectus and Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTRs) \nand any other applicable rules, as appropriate.\nCommittee membership and meetings\nDuring the year, Fiona Muldoon and Cecilia Reyes Leuzinger \nwere appointed to the Committee and Catherine Woods stood \ndown. Fiona and Cecilia’s appointments strengthened the \nCommittee’s ‘recent and relevant financial experience’ and \n‘sectoral experience’, as required by the Code and DTRs, both \nhaving gained over 25 years’ experience in the insurance \nindustry.

The nomination committee provided recommendations \nto The Board for the membership of both committees. Terms \nof reference for the separate audit and risk committees were \nalso approved by The Board and are available on the website. \nThe Committee had oversight of the closure of actions arising \nfrom the 2021 committee effectiveness review and reviewed \nthe new actions arising from the 2021 review during the year. \nSee the board evaluation report on page 88 for more details \non this process.\nResponsibilities of the committee\nThe Committee’s main responsibilities are unchanged from \nthe prior year and are set out below:\nAudit and financial reporting\na) Financial and narrative reporting\n• monitor the integrity of the company’s financial and \nnarrative statements including any disclosures such as the \nTask Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) \nreport, interim report, preliminary or other formal \nannouncement relating to the company’s financial \nperformance;\n• review significant financial reporting judgements contained \nin the financial statements;\n• review and challenge the consistency of, and any changes \nto, significant accounting policies both on a year-on-year \nbasis and across the company/Group;\n• review and monitor the going concern assumption and \nviability statement;\n• advise The Board on whether, taken as a whole, the annual \nreport is fair, balanced and understandable and provides \nthe information necessary for shareholders to assess the \ncompany’s performance, business model and strategy; and\n• review other reporting such as the solvency and financial \ncondition report.\nb) Internal audit\n• recommend the appointment, or termination of \nappointment, of the head of the internal audit function;\n• monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal \naudit function; and\n• review and approve the internal audit plan and monitor its \nimplementation, including consideration of resources.\nc) External audit\n• review and make recommendations to The Board regarding \nthe external audit contract, including appointment, \nremuneration, and terms of engagement;\n• review and oversee the relationship with the external audit, \nincluding their independence, objectivity and the policy on \nand level of non-audit services; and\n• review and monitor the effectiveness of the external auditor \nand the audit process.\nd) Internal control, Risk management and compliance\n• review and make recommendations to The Board on the \neffectiveness of the internal financial controls and the \ninternal control and risk management systems, including \noversight of breaches of risk appetite;\n• review the risk management and compliance plans and level \nof resources to perform the roles effectively and review the \neffectiveness of the compliance function;\n• review statements in the annual report concerning internal \ncontrol, risk management and assessment of principal and \nemerging risks;\n• review and recommend to The Board the annual Own Risk \nand Solvency Assessment (ORSA) report;\n• review whistleblowing arrangements in place for raising \nconcerns, in confidence;\n• review procedures in place relating to fraud detection, \nprevention of bribery and anti-money laundering; and\n• monitor the performance and independence of consulting \nactuaries used for the review of insurance reserving.\nCommittee activities during 2022:\na) Financial and narrative reporting\nThe Committee reviewed the full and half year results \nannouncements, the quarterly trading statements, the annual \nreport including viability and going concern statements to \nrecommend to The Board for approval.

      "text": "Audit and Risk Committee\ncontinued\nCritical financial judgements and estimates for year ended 31 December 2022\nValuation of insurance contract liabilities\nAs further explained in note 24 to the financial \nstatements, the Group’s policy is to hold \nsufficient provisions, including those to cover \nclaims which have been ‘incurred but not \nreported’ (IBNR) to meet all liabilities as they fall \ndue. The reserving for these claims represents \nthe most critical estimate in the Group’s \nfinancial statements.\nIn 2022, we noted the uncertainty around the impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the rise in inflation, and \ncost of living increases on the global economy. Accordingly, the potential that higher inflation and insolvency in \ncertain corporate sectors will result in increased volatility, as well as greater estimation challenges in respect of \ninsurance claims, remained a key consideration for 2022.\nThe Group continued to monitor its exposure to ‘social inflation’ and the potential for higher than average court \nsettlements. The key areas of exposure are within our healthcare and employment practices lines of businesses \nwhere claims can take many years to finalise. As courts continue to deal with increased litigation, the \nuncertainty around the level and acceleration of social inflation remains. Given the outlook for the US and \nEuropean economies, reserve loadings for recession, excess economic and social inflation undergo regular \nmonitoring by the actuarial function for potential management action.\nThere was continued improvement in frequency measures for ransomware claims frequency on our US Cyber \nbook for 2022. However, there are indications that these frequency trend reductions are slowing down, and \ntherefore this remains an area of uncertainty.\nThe Group also continued to gain more certainty around COVID-19 related claim costs in 2022 as more data \nmaterialised on claims settlements. \nThe Audit and Risk Committee received regular reports from both the internal Group chief actuary and the \nexternal audit team (including the Senior Accounting Officer), as the output of independent projections are \nreviewed at key reporting quarters. In the latter part of the year, the Group Chief Actuary has reported on the \nresults of the third-quarter reserving process, which the committee considered to be a key control as this \nprocess provides a level of informed independent challenge for the reserve position. To support the year-end \nview, the Committee has received a detailed paper in support of the level of margin held within technical \nreserves in the Group’s statement of financial position. Management confirmed that they remain satisfied that \nthe outstanding claims reserves included in the financial statements provide an appropriate margin over \nprojected ultimate claims costs to allow for the risks and uncertainties within the portfolio, and the Committee \nwas satisfied that there were no errors or inconsistencies that were material in the context of the financial \nstatements as a whole.\nAs in prior years, the committee also considers the report of the external auditor following its re-projection of \nreserves using its own methodologies.\nOn the basis of the information provided by the Group actuary and through the consistent application of \nBeazley’s reserving philosophy, the Audit Committee was satisfied that the reserves held on the Group \nstatement of financial position at 31 December 2022 were appropriate.\nValuation of unquoted and illiquid financial assets\nThe Board is responsible for setting the Group’s \ninvestment strategy, defining the risk appetite \nand overseeing the internal and outsourced \nproviders via the chief investment officer. The \ncommittee has oversight of the assumptions \nand techniques used to value the Group’s \ninvestment portfolio. The valuation of our hard to \nvalue ‘level 3’ investments, particularly our \nilliquid credit assets, requires significant \njudgement.\nThe Committee noted that the overall investment strategy was broadly unchanged from prior periods. The \nCommittee received updates from the Group Finance Director and reviewed reports that confirm that the \ninvestment portfolio was in line with the 2022 Board-approved risk appetite, that carrying values of the portfolio \nas at 31 December 2022 were appropriate and that the valuation methodologies applied to each hierarchy level \nwere consistent with the accounting policies. Committee members were invited to and periodically attended the \nInvestment Committee.\nNo misstatements that were material in the context of the financial statements as a whole were identified and \nthe Audit Committee was satisfied with the approach employed by management in valuing the financial assets \nat fair value on the balance sheet at 31 December 2022. Further detail on the valuation of financial assets is \ngiven in note 16.\nPremium estimates\nA portion of gross written premiums is based on \nthe estimated premium income (EPI) of each \ncontract, which is an underwriters’ estimate of \nthe ultimate premium expected to be paid over \nthe life of the contract. Judgement is required in \ndetermining these estimates.\nThe Committee received a summary of the processes and controls around EPI and how they had operated \nthroughout the year. The Committee receives comfort over EPI through managements’ quarterly review process \nover these estimates which validate their adequacy and reasonableness. \nAssessing indicators of impairment of Goodwill\nAs further explained in Note 12 to the financial \nstatements, the Group considers annually \nwhether its Goodwill and other indefinite life \nintangible assets require impairment. The \nrecoverability assessment of these assets \ninvolves consideration of a number of \njudgmental assumptions such as future \nprofitability and premium rates.\nThe Committee received information to enable it to review managements assumptions and inputs into the \nanalysis of whether there were any indicators of impairment of the Group's Goodwill balance. The Audit \nCommittee was satisfied with management’s approach in respect of the carrying value of all of the Group’s \nintangible assets and there was no impairment of the Group’s intangible assets as at 31 December 2022.\nArea of focus\nHow addressed by the committee\n \n94\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

In 2022, we considered the Group’s \ncapital position with regards to the Group’s issuance of new \nequity of approximately USD400m. This additional capital will \nsupport the growth of our Property business and the retention \nof more of the business in our Cyber and Specialty Risk \ndivisions.\nThe Committee also considered the appropriateness of \nmanagement’s viability statement and the period over which \nthis analysis is performed. The Committee was satisfied by \nthe level of analysis presented during the year and the related \napproach taken and statements made in the Group’s key \nexternal reporting.\nDividends\nDuring the year the Committee also reviewed the \nappropriateness of reinstating the dividend. It was decided \nthat the dividend would be reassessed at the year end when \nthe full year result was available. In February 2023, the Audit \nCommittee considered the full year result and the declaration \nof a 13.5p interim dividend.\nFair, balanced, and understandable assessment\nIt is a key requirement of the Group’s financial statements to \nbe fair, balanced, and understandable. The Audit Committee \napplied the same due diligence approach adopted in previous \nyears to assess this requirement under the Code. The annual \nreport is prepared following a well-documented internal \nprocess that is performed in parallel with the processes \nundertaken by the external auditor. The Audit Committee has \nreviewed management’s assessment as a part of the formal \nannual report governance process. Following its review, the \nAudit Committee is satisfied that the 2022 annual report is \nfair, balanced and understandable, and provides the \ninformation necessary for shareholders and other \nstakeholders to assess the company’s position and \nperformance, business model and strategy, and has advised \nThe Board accordingly.\nSolvency II reporting\nThe Committee reviewed and approved the Group’s 2021 \nsolvency and financial condition report and regular supervisory \nreport as well as approving the Solvency II policy \ndocumentation for the Group.\nESG reporting\nDuring the year, the Committee has considered the quality of \nESG reporting as contained in the Responsible Business and \nTCFD reports. This topic will remain an area of ongoing focus \nfor the plc audit committee as reporting standards and climate \nchange metrics develop and as Beazley’s Responsible \nBusiness Strategy is further embedded. The Committee \nreceived updates from the external auditor on their review of \nTCFD reporting, which is performed by their specialist \nsustainability reporting team. Management commissioned the \nexternal auditor to carry out additional ‘pre-assurance’ \nprocedures over the TCFD report. This included peer analysis \nof disclosures, scrutiny of metrics and substantiation of \nqualitative statements.\nAt the joint meeting of committees in November, the Chief \nUnderwriting Officer reported on the licensing of three new \nClimate Change models to augment to Group’s understanding \nand estimation of the impact of climate change on the \nbusiness we write. The Group also continued to hire personnel  \nwho strengthened the Group's oversight of Climate change, \nand will look to continue this in 2023.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n95"

      "text": "Audit and Risk Committee\ncontinued\nMonitoring forthcoming regulatory changes\nThe committee received updates on:\n• preparedness for forthcoming key accounting and regulatory \nchanges, including IFRS 17 and changes which may occur \ndepending on the outcome of the UK Government's \nconsultation on reforms to audit and corporate governance. \nThe committee notes that management have mobilised a \nproject to consider the impact of these reforms and that \nmore clarity is expected during 2023; and\n• monitoring of key reporting and regulatory updates, \nincluding updates on accounting standards, changes in tax \nlegislation and changes in regulatory requirements. This \nincluded the Model Audit Rule and Lloyd's new risk based \napproach.\nIFRS 17\nThe Committee received detailed reports on the IFRS 17 \nproject, including key implications and judgments as well as \nprogress towards implementation. As well as reports from the \nfinance team, they also received reports from EY. Information \nshared included the proposed risk adjustment methodology as \nwell as other assumptions and decisions required with the \nintroduction of IFRS 17. Several Board deep dive training \nsessions were carried out during the year in relation to IFRS \n17. The Committee have also concluded on the IAS 8 \ndisclosures included in these financial statements.\nExternal audit\nOne of the committee’s most important responsibilities is \nmanaging the relationship with the Group’s external auditor, \nErnst & Young LLP (‘EY’) on behalf of The Board and having \noversight of the external audit process. \nDuring the year, the Committee:\n• Reviewed the findings from EY’s audit of the 2021 Group \nAnnual report and accounts and the Group’s Solvency II \nSolvency and Financial Condition Report.\n• Reviewed EY’s Audit Plan Audit plan for the 2022 year end \naudit. The committee noted that the plan and scoping was \nconsistent with previous audits but responds to the Group’s \nincreased size and complexity. EY also set out in this plan \ntheir proposed approach and timings with regard to the \naudit work over IFRS 17.\n• Reviewed the findings of EY’s review of the Group’s Interim \nreport in July 2022. This predominantly focused on EY’s \nassessment of management’s approach to estimating \nexposure to the conflict in Ukraine and the review \nprocedures over the interim report and key judgemental \nbalances such as the valuation of hard to value investments \nand intangible assets. \n• Oversaw the change in role of the head of compliance to \nalso cover risk, and associated changes in the compliance \nfunction.\n• Reviewed EY’s findings coming out of their interim audit \nwork ahead of the year end. This work predominantly \nfocused on the testing of controls over processes from \nwhich financial information is derived, in addition to a \ndetailed actuarial review of our Q3 reserving position. The \nactuarial review included a deep dive on management’s \ntreatment of inflation within our reserves, as well as \nbenchmarking losses to natural catastrophes such as \nHurricane Ian in the year. \n• Reviewed EY’s Improvement Ideas report which they issue \nin consultation with management following the conclusion of \nthe 2021 year end audit across all group entities. This \nreport sets out suggested improvements to controls and \nprocesses which will further enhance the integrity of the \nfinancial reporting process. \n• Reviewed and agreed EY’s audit fee for the 2022 year end. \nA comprehensive paper was set out by EY explaining their \nproposed increase in fee and benchmarking the Group’s fee \nto similar audits. The significant increase in the audit fee \nthis year reflects both changes in scope, the costs of \noperational separation and inflationary considerations. \n• Received an update from EY on the implementation of \noperational separation of its audit practice in line with the \nFRC’s principles for Operational Separation. The committee \nnoted that this had limited practical impact on the Group’s \naudit, although the requirement for arm’s length rate cards \nfor certain specialists and other structural changes to the \naudit fee as a result of separation contributed to the \nincrease in the Group’s audit fees.\n• Were briefed by EY on their global plan to separate their \naudit and consulting units into two separate businesses. \nThe committee will continue to monitor developments in this \narea, with a focus on ensuring that the effectiveness and \nquality of the audit remains high.\n• Reviewed management’s assessment of the effectiveness \nof the external audit process and EY’s response to the \nFRC’s Audit Quality Inspection and Supervision Report which \nwas issued in June 2022. \nThe Committee regularly meet EY without management \npresent to facilitate open and transparent discussion, and the \nAudit Committee Chair and Committee members meet the \nlead audit partner outside of committee meeting on a regular \nbasis.\ni) Assessing the effectiveness of the external auditor\nThe Committee placed great emphasis on ensuring there are \nhigh standards of quality and effectiveness in the external \naudit process.\nAudit quality and effectiveness was assessed throughout the \nyear, with a focus on strong audit governance and the quality \nof the team, including the provision of technical and industry \nknowledge and the independence, objectivity and level of \nprofessional scepticism exercised by the external auditor. The \nCommittee’s activities in assessing the effectiveness of the \naudit included the following activities:\n• reviewing the quality and scope of the audit planning and its \nresponsiveness to changes in the business and identified \nrisk;\n• an assessment and review of the audit team, where \nfeedback from various stakeholders is conducted through \nsurvey and discussions;\n• reviewing the results of the annual survey on the \neffectiveness of the external audit process conducted by \nmanagement. Feedback was requested in the form of a \nquestionnaire circulated to non-executive directors and \nmanagement across the Group, including in the US, Ireland \nand Singapore. The survey focused on five areas; Audit \nQuality, Forward Looking & Insightful; Efficiency & Audit \nDelivery; ‘No surprises’ and Service Quality & Audit Team \nEngagement. Responses also covered EY’s professional \nscepticism and from non-executive directors the extent to \nwhich EY challenged management.

      "text": "robust. The survey also highlighted areas proposed by \nmanagement where EY and management could work \ntogether to improve the audit process; and reviewing the \nFRC’s Audit Quality Inspection and Supervision Report for \nEY. Overall, the FRC concluded that EY had made progress \non previous findings raised and had sought to make \nimprovements in relation to audit execution and firm-wide \nprocedures, although the committee noted that overall EY’s \nresults had deteriorated compared to prior reviews. The \nCommittee also noted that this predominantly related to \nEY’s non-listed audits and that the 2019 audit of the Group \nhad been subject to review by the FRC with no significant \nfindings raised.\nAfter taking all of the above into account, the Committee \nconcluded that the external audit process was effective.\nii) Non-audit services and independence of the external auditor\nThe Audit and Risk Committee’s responsibility to monitor and \nreview the objectivity and independence of the external auditor \nwas supported by a policy in relation to the provision of non-\naudit services by the auditor. The committee regarded the \nindependence of the External Auditor as of the utmost \nimportance in safeguarding the integrity of the external audit \nprocess.\nDuring 2022, our non-audit services policy was reviewed by \nthe committee. The objective is to ensure that the provision of \nsuch services does not impair the external auditor’s \nobjectivity. The policy specifically disallows certain activities \nfrom being provided by the auditor, such as bookkeeping and \naccounting services, internal actuarial services and executive \nremuneration services. The policy requires consideration and \npre-approval for all other material services. Permissible non-\naudit services are all closely related to the audit and/or \nrequired by law or regulation.\nThe Committee reviewed the terms of such proposed \nappointments to ensure they have been robustly justified. The \ncommittee receives a report from the external auditors setting \nout all non-audit services undertaken, so that it could monitor \nthe types of services being provided, and the fees incurred for \nthat work.\nIn the year, fees for audit and audit related services were \n$6.2m (2021:$3.8m). Fees for non-audit and assurance \nservices for 2022 were $0.7m (2021:$0.6m) and included \nwork related to the accounts and regulatory reporting of the \nsyndicates managed by Beazley, which would commonly be \ncarried out by the external auditor. None of the non-audit \nservices provided are considered by the audit and risk \ncommittee to affect the auditor’s independence or objectivity.\nThe committee received an overview from EY of the policies \nand procedures in place to safeguard auditor objectivity and \nindependence. These include annual confirmation by all EY \nprofessionals of compliance with independence policies and \nprocedures and wider processes and systems to monitor \npotential threats to auditor independence throughout the year. \nEY gave the annual confirmation of their independence to the \nCommittee, confirming in particular that no partners or staff \nheld any financial interests in the Beazley Group and that their \nethics and independence policies are consistent with the \nrequirements of the FRC’s ethical standard.\nHaving taken into account the following factors, the \nCommittee concluded that EY was independent from the \nGroup throughout the year and to the date of their audit \nreport:\n• non-audit services provided by EY were in compliance with \nthe Group’s non-audit policy and the requirements of the \nFRC’s ethical standard;\n• EY had complied with the FRC’s requirements around \nrotation of the audit partner and senior members of the \naudit team;\n• the Group has not employed members of the EY audit team \nor any EY partners during the year; and that\n• EY have confirmed compliance of their staff and partners \nwith EY’s internal policies and processes around \nindependence, in particular that no partners or staff held \nfinancial interests in the Group.\niii) Auditor Tenure and reappointment\nThe 2022 year end audit has been EY’s fourth consecutive \nyear end as the Group’s auditor, following their appointment in \n2019 following a comprehensive tender process. The Group is \nrequired to put the audit out to a competitive tender process \nat least every ten years. It is anticipated that the next \ncompetitive tender will be conducted prior to the \ncommencement of the 2029 audit. Following the conclusion of \nthe 2022 year end audit, the current audit partner, Stuart \nWilson, will have served as senior statutory auditor for four \nyears. In line with UK regulation the audit engagement partner \nmust rotate after their fifth year leading the audit, and thus a \nnew lead audit partner will be required for the 2024 audit. It is \nexpected that a successor will be identified in 2023.\nThe Group has complied with the UK Competition & Markets \nAuthority’s Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies \nMarket Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender \nProcesses and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 \nthroughout the year. There are no contractual obligations \nwhich restrict the Group’s choice of auditor. EY have indicated \ntheir willingness to be reappointed as the Group’s auditor and \nthe Audit Committee has recommended to The Board that they \nbe reappointed.\nInternal audit\nDuring 2022, the Group’s internal audit function reported \ndirectly, and was accountable, to the committee and the head \nof internal audit had direct access to the committee chair. The \ncommittee reviewed the effectiveness of the function and \nremained satisfied that the internal audit function had \nsufficient resources during the year to undertake its duties.\nDuring 2022, the Committee:\n• considered the results of all internal audit reports, and the \nfindings and themes emerging from them;\n• considered the annual report from internal audit, which \nincluded: analysis of the delivery of the audit plan; \nsignificant findings and overdue actions; the control \nenvironment and risk management framework and risk \nmanagement culture; control environment; and \nwhistleblowing. \n• monitored the implementation of the 2022 internal audit \nplan;\n• considered the internal audit approach to monitoring change \nportfolio risk including the Group’s modernisation \nprogramme;\n• reviewed the proposal for internal audit’s approach to the \nmonitoring of external assurance across the Group; \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n97"

External Quality Assurance reviews are also \nundertaken every five years (unless it is agreed by the \ncommittee that a review is required earlier). The last external \nreview was completed in November 2019. The Committee was \nsatisfied that the internal audit function remained effective.\nInternal controls\nThe Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal \ncontrol and for reviewing its effectiveness. However, as part of \nthis process the Audit and Risk Committee was responsible \nfor reviewing the effectiveness of financial controls and \ninternal controls and risk management framework. \nEach year an independent and objective opinion is provided by \nthe Internal Audit function regarding the design and operating \neffectiveness of the system of internal controls covering the \nintegrity of the Group’s financial statements and reports, \ncompliance with laws and regulations, and corporate policies \nand the effective management of risks faced by the Group in \nexecuting its strategic and tactical operating plans. In 2022 \nthis also included the Model Audit Rule assessment.\nThe review includes an assessment of the Control Maturity \nGrading framework, which enables Internal Audit to formulate \na strategic view on the maturity of the Group’s control \nenvironment. The review has concluded that the Group’s \noverall systems of controls are designed appropriately and are \noperating effectively.\nInternal Audit also noted that de-risking and simplification of \nthe Group’s processes is planned for 2023 as part of the \nGroup’s modernisation and has implemented a process to \nmonitor change portfolio risk.\nThe Committee discussed the report prepared by Internal \nAudit and were satisfied that the Group’s system of internal \ncontrol and risk management framework continues to operate \neffectively.\nRisk management and compliance\nRisk\nTo assist The Board, the Committee, supported by the risk \ncommittees of the regulated subsidiary Boards, received and \nreviewed reports from the risk management function focusing \non the following areas:\nRegular reporting \n• risk appetite: the Committee has monitored the actual risk \nprofile against risk appetite throughout 2022 and the Risk \nCommittee can confirm that Beazley plc has been operating \nwithin risk appetite as at 31 December 2022. The \nCommittee has also reviewed the proposed enhancements \nto the 2023 risk appetite statements and to the risk \nappetite framework;\n• risk assessment: the Committee has performed a review of \nthe Group’s risk profile to assess its coverage of the \nuniverse of risk and ensure that major underlying risks are \nvisible and are being monitored;\n• risk profiles: the Committee reviewed risk profiles, which \nare focused risk assessments of specific topics. In 2022, \nthe Committee considered an assessment of inflation risk. \nRisk management also provided an opinion on the approach \nto, and risks around, estimates for Hurricane Ian in relation \nto the Q32022 interim management statement which was \ndeemed reasonable and consistent with the approach for \nprevious natural catastrophe losses;\n• emerging risk: the Committee specifically considered areas \nof emerging risk via separate reports and through the Own \nRisk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA). In addition, the \nCommittee requested that EY provide a schedule of key \nexternal topics relevant to the Group for 2022 relevant to \nthe changing economic landscape. This resulted in EY \nproviding presentations on ‘Economic Trends impacting \nunderwriting and claims’ and ‘Leading Practices for Risk and \nInternal Audit functions’;\n• oversight of the control environment: the Committee \nreceived regular risk management and second line \nassurance reports which provided commentary on the \nstatus of the control environment. These included entries \nfrom the risk incidents log. This was supplemented by an \nannual Chief Risk Officer opinion on the performance of the \nenterprise risk management framework;\n• reverse stress testing: the Committee received the results \nof the reverse stress testing exercise, which explores what \nwould have to happen for the Group to be unviable and has \nbeen able to provide assurance to The Board that this work \nhas been performed with the appropriate level of depth and \nexpertise;\n• heightened risk: the Committee considered the heightened \nrisk register half-yearly. A risk is considered heightened if \nthe likelihood or the impact of occurrence is higher than \nusual;\n• oversight of the internal model: the Committee and the risk \ncommittees of the subsidiary Board reviewed regular reports \nassociated with the internal model. These have included a \nstanding report on internal model output, and a validation \nreport featuring both internal and independent validation \nand themed reviews - for example, on the approach used to \naggregate risk in individual entities which consolidate up to \nthe Group level.

In addition, the Committee reviewed and \napproved the plans for the 2022 internal board effectiveness \nreview for The Board, its Committees and for two of the \nprincipal regulated subsidiary Boards and their Committees. \nThe Committee received a report on the outcomes of the \ninternal review for all Boards and Committees and discussed \ncommon themes and key areas of focus in 2023. \nMore information on the board evaluation process is provided \non page 88.\nThe Committee is responsible for evaluating the independence \nof all Non-Executive Directors and undertakes an annual \nreview of each Non-Executive Director’s other interests. The \nBoard, on the recommendation of the committee, is satisfied \nthat each Non-Executive Director serving at the end of the year \nremains independent and continues to have sufficient time to \ndischarge their responsibilities to the company. \nBoard knowledge and skills assessment\nThe Board and Committee recognise the importance of a \ndiverse and effective team with a broad mix of skills and \nexperience. As part of each annual board evaluation, Non-\nExecutive and Executive Directors carry out a self-assessment \nof their knowledge against a wide range of skills and \ncompetencies. For each area, the Directors assess whether \nthey have considerable knowledge, a base level of knowledge \nnecessary to contribute to discussions, or no knowledge. The \nCommittee receives a report on the self-assessments \ncompleted, including information for each Director, to enable \nthem to assess whether each Director and The Board \ncollectively have the right mix of skills and experience. The \nChair also considers this information in the performance \nevaluations of the Directors, along with other relevant \ninformation and feedback. The self-assessment helps identify \nany areas where training would be useful to develop \nknowledge and skills either for Directors individually or for The \nBoard as a whole, and a training plan for each year is \ndeveloped. For some skills, which are dynamic and changing, \nthe Directors’ knowledge is augmented by external or internal \nexperts who ensure The Board has the right, up to date, \nexpertise to challenge effectively. The balance of skills and \nexperience on The Board is also a core part of Director \nsuccession planning. \nBased on the information received in 2022, the Committee \nwas satisfied that each of the Directors and The Board \nremained effective and high-performing and that they had the \nright mix skills and experience to challenge and support the \ndelivery of the strategy. \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n101"

      "text": "Nomination Committee\ncontinued\nSuccession planning \nThroughout 2022, the Committee carried out its key \nresponsibilities of ensuring that plans are in place for an \norderly succession to The Board, subsidiary Boards and wider \nsenior management positions and ensuring the continued \nstrong executive talent pipeline within the Group, which is a \nkey pillar of our strategy. \nThe Board and Committee believe that a regular refresh of \nboard membership is beneficial to a progressive, strong, \ndiverse, responsible and balanced leadership and therefore \nthe Committee regularly considered updates to the structure, \nsize and composition of The Board and its Committees. The \nCommittee receives reports which include information on the \ncomposition of the Group and regulated subsidiary Boards, \nthe tenure of each of the Directors, and other information for \nsuccession planning purposes.\nThe Committee reviews succession plans for the Executive \nCommittee members annually as well as reviewing their \nperformance against objectives. The succession plans for \nother senior roles (such as executive committee direct \nreports) or regulatory roles are also reviewed annually. The \nreporting includes information regarding potential successors \nfor each role in the short, medium and longer term as well as \nemergency cover, including whether roles could likely be filled \ninternally or externally. The reporting assists  with proactively \nplanning for future roles as well as with developing and \nprogressing our internal talent. The talent pipeline review also \ncovers cross team succession opportunities. The succession \nplans are linked to the Inclusion and Diversity strategy and \npolicy, to ensure that all areas of the business are \ncontributing to succession planning and development of talent \nis taking place. The progress towards meeting and/or \nexceeding externally and internally set diversity targets is \nreviewed.\nFor vacancies at both board and executive leadership level, \nexternal search agencies are often utilised. Any internal \ncandidates are incorporated into the process run by the \nappointed external agency. All external agencies are made \naware of our Inclusion and Diversity policy and long and short \nlists are designed to ensure there is a diverse selection of \ncandidates put forward. \nDuring 2022, the Committee spent time focused on Board \nsuccession planning and the appointment of new Board \nmembers, including the appointment of Fiona Muldoon and \nCecilia Reyes Leuzinger in May 2022 and the search for a new \nChair following the resignation of David Roberts in October \n2022. On 8 February 2023, following recommendation from \nthe Committee, The Board approved the appointment of Clive \nBannister as Chair Designate and an Independent Non-\nExecutive Director of Beazley plc. Clive will commence his role \nas Chair with effect from the conclusion of the company’s \n2023 AGM. He will also become Chair of the Nomination \nCommittee at the same point.\nSince the year end, Nicola Hodson has been appointed Chief \nExecutive of IBM in the UK and Ireland and has joined their UK \nsubsidiary Boards. Nicola previously held a senior global \nleadership role at Microsoft, and was able to balance well the \ncommitments of this role to her responsibilities as a non-\nexecutive director of Beazley. The nomination committee \nbelieves that this ability does not change with Nicola’s new \nexecutive role, and is happy to support her proposed re-\nelection as a Beazley non-executive director. However, the \ncommittee will keep the situation under close review to ensure \nthat Nicola remains able to commit the time and dedication \nrequired as a director of Beazley.\nAppointment of new Non-Executive Directors\n• The Committee, led by David Roberts, spent time in April \nreviewing the short list and recommended appointments for \nindependent Non-Executive Directors to replace Catherine \nWoods who stepped down from The Board on 25 March \n2022 at the conclusion of the AGM.\n• An independent external search consultancy, Hedley May, \nwas engaged to help with the appointment of a new \nindependent Non-Executive Director to replace Catherine \nWoods. The company and its Directors have no other \nconnection with Hedley May. \n• A detailed role description was prepared which included \nfocus on skills and experience, and a diverse candidate list \nwas requested.\n• The Committee was pleased with the diverse and \nexperienced candidates available and the Committee \ntherefore decided to recommend two of the four short-listed \ncandidates for appointment as two other Non-Executive \nDirectors would be reaching the end of their second three-\nyear term in 2023. Fiona Muldoon and Cecilia Reyes \nLeuzinger were appointed in May 2022. \n• Fiona Muldoon was recommended because of her vast \nleadership experience in the insurance industry as well as \nhaving recent experience as a public company CEO and \nhaving spent time working for the Central Bank of Ireland. \nCecilia Reyes Leuzinger was recommended because of her \ninsurance, risk and investment management experience to \nadd more in-depth investments experience to The Board. \nBoth candidates had styles which would complement but \nalso bring fresh challenge and diversity of opinion to The \nBoard. Both Directors were assessed to have sufficient time \nto fulfil the responsibilities of the role. \n• Following appointment, an induction programme is arranged \nto onboard new Directors. This includes: meetings with key \nindividuals across the organisation; board procedures and \ngovernance; corporate communications; compliance \ntraining; meetings with key external parties such as the \nauditors and regulators where relevant; and deep dives to \naid understanding of strategy and the different divisions \nwithin the business. \n \n102\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "Chair succession\nIn July 2022, David Roberts announced that he was to be appointed as Chair of the Court of the Bank of England in the \nautumn. The appointment date was unknown at that time. The Board, led by the Nomination Committee began a process to \nensure that plans were in place to ensure an orderly transition of the role of Chair and to commence a rigorous selection \nprocedure for a new Chair of Beazley plc. \nThe process was led by Christine LaSala, notwithstanding that she was Interim Chair of the Company during the process. \nRobert Stuchbery, the interim Senior Independent Director also provided key support to the process. David Roberts was not \ninvolved in the process prior to his resignation on 1 October 2022. \nStage 1:\nInterim arrangements\nThe Committee determined that interim arrangements should be put into place, based on \nemergency succession plans previously developed, while the search for a new Chair commenced. \nIn October, David’s resignation was confirmed, and the interim arrangements, as set out in the \nannouncement on 21 July 2022, explained in the corporate governance report were put in place.\nDavid Roberts spent time providing an induction and handing over responsibilities to Christine \nLaSala prior to his departure to ensure an orderly transition.\nStage 2:\nAppointment of search \nagency\nIt was agreed that Christine LaSala (initially as Senior Independent Director) would lead the \nsearch, with support from Robert Stuchbery and George Blunden, a Non-Executive Director of \nBeazley Furlonge Limited. In September, the Committee (excluding David Roberts) considered \ninformation regarding the process for appointing a new Chair, including the appointment of an \nindependent external consultancy to lead the search. A review of executive search agencies, \nincluding presentations to a panel, was undertaken to identify a firm with the right level of \nexpertise and cultural fit. Russell Reynolds was selected following the process. Russell Reynolds \nhas no other connection with the company or its directors.\nStage 3:\nRole specification\nTo develop the role specification, Christine LaSala led chair specification workshops with \nDirectors to draw out the key skills, competencies, experience and character attributes required \nin the new Chair and to help ensure that the new Chair would be a good fit for Beazley’s growth \nambitions culture and taking into consideration Beazley’s opportunities and challenges over the \nnext five years. Relevant policies such as the Inclusion and Diversity Policy requirements were \nincorporated, with the nomination committee having responsibility under the board inclusion and \ndiversity policy for ensuring appointments are made based on objective criteria with due regard to \ndiversity. A key specification for the role was a candidate who demonstrated commitment to \ninclusion, equity and diversity with evidence of leadership in this regard. \nA timetable was drawn up with Russell Reynolds and a comprehensive external search process \nwas undertaken.\nStage 4: initial interviews\nRussell Reynolds reviewed a wide range of diverse candidates which resulted in a long list of \ncandidates which were assessed initially, 37.5% of whom were women. Christine LaSala, Bob \nStuchbery and George Blunden carried out initial interviews with eight of these candidates, two of \nwhich were women. Four candidates were put forward for second stage interviews with the Chief \nExecutive Officer.\nStage 5: final interview \npanel\nThe Committee appointed a panel of independent Non-Executive Directors to conduct third stage \ninterviews, with two candidates, one man and one woman, put forward. \nStage 6: selection\nFollowing the process, Clive Bannister was considered by the Committee to be the most suitable \ncandidate for the role due to his valuable experience and credentials as a Chair, his extensive \nexecutive career at HSBC group and Phoenix Group plc, and his wealth of experience including \nstrategic, commercial, and significant transformational skills leading the turnaround and \nsignificant growth of Phoenix Group plc as its Chief Executive Officer. Interviews with Clive also \ndemonstrated that he would be a good fit for Beazley and showing the right balance of challenge \nand support needed by a Chair. In addition, the Committee noted that as chair of Rathbones \nGroup plc, Clive had made a number of board appointments to strengthen The Board and improve \nits diversity.\nThe Committee were also satisfied that Clive Bannister has capacity to dedicate sufficient time to \nBeazley.\nClive Bannister was appointed as an independent Non-Executive Director of Beazley plc with \neffect from 8 February 2023. He will commence his duties as Chair and Chair of the Nomination \nCommittee from the close of the AGM on 25 April 2023.

      "text": "Nomination Committee\ncontinued\nInclusion and diversity \nBeazley’s inclusion and diversity policy is largely unchanged \nfrom previous years. In January 2022, The Board adopted its \nown inclusion and diversity policy which is aligned to that of \nthe Group. Both policies are available on the company’s \nwebsite (www.beazley.com/en-sg/who-we-are/inclusion-\ndiversity).\nThe Beazley inclusion and diversity policy sets out our \ncommitment to recruit, retain and develop people with diverse \nbackgrounds and experiences to thrive at all levels of our \nbusiness, in a truly inclusive environment that has zero \ntolerance for discrimination or harassment and fully supports \nand celebrates differences. These differences could include \nbut are not limited to age, disability, gender, gender \nreassignment, marital status, pregnancy and maternity, race, \nnationality or ethnic origin, religion or religious beliefs, \nsexuality, socio-economic group or working pattern. \nWe want our workforce to reflect the diversity of our customers \nand the communities where we work around the world; \nhowever, we know that simply aspiring to have a diverse \nworkforce is not enough. We continue to set measurable \ntargets at an organisational level and clear objectives at an \nindividual level as we work to become a truly diverse and \ninclusive organisation where everyone is able to contribute \ntheir best work and develop fully.\nThe Board's inclusion and diversity policy sets out the \ncommitment of The Board to using its position and influence \nto create a truly inclusive environment and confirms The \nBoard's view that diversity is central to our strategy by \ncontributing to enhanced risk management and improved \nbusiness performance, bringing about richness of challenge, \ndebate and innovation. The Board commits to continue to be \nin line with, or in betterment of, guidelines and regulations for \ngender or racial diversity set out in the Parker Review and the \nFTSE Women Leaders review. While accepting there will be \nnatural fluctuations in balance due to the size of The Board, \nThe Board aims to reflect the company’s public targets \nregarding gender and race and ethnicity in its own \ncomposition. \nThe Board's inclusion and diversity policy also applies to The \nBoard's key committees. The Committee takes into account \ndiversity considerations when appointing Directors to Board \ncommittees.\nAs at 31 December 2022, The Board has exceeded the \ntargets set out by the Parker Review and the FTSE Women \nLeaders Review, now incorporated into the Listing Rules \nfollowing the FCA’s consultation on Diversity and Inclusion on \ncompany Boards and Executive Committees. In relation to the \nchanges to the Listing Rules (which will be effective for the \nyear ended 31 December 2023 for the Company and are \nvoluntarily disclosed) The Board has achieved the following:\n• At least 40% of the individuals on The Board are women: as \nat 31 December 2022, 50% of our Board were women, \ncompared with 40% at 31 December 2021. Following the \nappointment of Clive Bannister on 8 February 2023, 45% of \nour Board are women.\n• At least one of the senior board positions (Chair, CEO, SID, \nor CFO) is held by a woman: Sally Lake is our Finance \nDirector and Christine LaSala is our Interim Chair (and was \nand will return to being our Senior Independent Director \nfollowing the conclusion of the AGM on 25 April 2023.\n• At least one member of The Board is from a non-white \nethnic minority background: Raj Agrawal and Cecilia Reyes \nLeuzinger are from a non-white ethnic minority backgrounds.\nThe Committee is satisfied that the focus on inclusion and \ndiversity by The Board and executive leadership team and the \ncompany’s diversity strategy, underpinned by bold targets \nmean that any risks around continuing to meet externally set \ntargets for Board diversity are mitigated. The diversity of The \nBoard in terms of gender and ethnic background is also set \nout on page 85. \nThe Committee has agreed targets for gender diversity for the \nsenior leadership, which have been monitored by the \nCommittee during the year. The Committee monitors the \ndiversity of the workforce through reporting as well as through \nthe succession planning activities for the Executive \nCommittee. During the year we have continued to embed the \nstrategy for gender equality to help us reach our target of 45% \nfemale representation in senior leadership roles by the end of \n2023. At the end of 2022, 43% of the senior leadership team \nwere women. \nIn 2020, the Committee agreed targets for increasing the \nrepresentation of people of colour in the Beazley workforce to \nat least 25% by the end of 2023, with a quarter being black \npeople. We are pleased that this was achieved during 2022 \nand had increased from 23% at the end of 2021, and we are \non track for 25% of this group to be black people by the end of \n2023.\nThe Committee has continued to review broader targets for \nthe Group’s race and ethnicity strategy to ensure that these \nremain progressive. At the end of 2022, we introduced a new \ntarget to improve the representation of people of colour in \nleadership roles by 6% points from 11% to 17% by the end of \n2027. \nFor more information on our inclusion and diversity activities, \nincluding our strategy, objectives and outcomes, please see \nour responsible business report on page 21.\n \n104\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

In June 2022, those most impacted by \ncost-of-living received a one-off payment of up to £3,000 to \nhelp with increasing financial demands. This helped more than \nhalf of the workforce. In addition, at year-end, to recognise the \nchallenges created by rising inflation, those most impacted \nreceived greater salary increases than those earning at higher \nlevels, again to support those facing the greatest pressures \nfrom the cost-of-living crisis. Those earning at higher levels \nreceived c.5%, compared to 10% to 20% for those most \nimpacted. This commitment to ensuring available funding went \nto those most impacted has been well received across the \nbusiness. \nBusiness performance and incentive out-turns \nThe resilience of our business strategy and the dedication and \nmotivation of our team met the continuing challenges and \nuncertainty throughout 2022 such as high inflation, energy \nprice crunch and the continuing tragedy of war in Europe. \nDespite these challenges the Group maintained profitability \nwith a ROE performance of 7%. We achieved a profit of \n$191.0m and an impressive 89% combined ratio from strong \nunderwriting performance which was offset by a reduced \ninvestment performance driven by mark to market losses due \nto the volatile interest rate environment. Having carefully \nconsidered the financial performance and personal \nachievements for the year, the Remuneration Committee \ndetermined that the executive directors would receive annual \nbonuses of 37.5% of maximum in respect of FY22.\nBeazley’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) vests in two equal \ntranches based on net asset value (NAV) growth measured \nover a three-year and five-year period. The second tranche of \nthe 2018 LTIP vested at 14.9% of maximum following NAV \ngrowth per annum of 10.1%. The first tranche of the 2020 \nLTIP vested at 20.0% of maximum following NAV growth per \nannum of 10.5%. The committee is comfortable that \nexecutives have not unduly benefited from windfall gains in \nrespect of their LTIP awards.  In particular the Committee \nnoted that the 2020 awards were granted in February 2020 \nprior to the fall in share price resulting from the outbreak of \nCOVID-19.\nThe remuneration committee considers that the remuneration \npolicy operated as intended during 2022 and that the \nincentive out-turns are aligned with our pay for performance \nculture, accordingly no additional discretion was applied. \nReview of the remuneration policy \nIn accordance with the normal triennial schedule, we are \nsubmitting our remuneration policy for shareholder approval at \nthe 2023 AGM. During the year the remuneration committee \nundertook a detailed review of the policy to ensure that it is fit \nto support our strategy to be the highest performing \nsustainable Specialty insurer. Following the review, the \ncommittee believes that now is the right time to make some \nimportant changes to ensure that Beazley is appropriately \npositioned to retain the talent necessary to continue to deliver \nlong-term value to our shareholders. However, we are not \nproposing any changes to the broad framework or the overall \nincentive opportunity.\nI would like to thank those shareholders who took the time to \ndiscuss the policy with us during the year. The committee \ngreatly values the views of our shareholders, and their \ninvaluable feedback was carefully considered when finalising \nour proposals.\nContext of the review \nThe current remuneration framework has operated largely \nunchanged since 2012 and has supported Beazley well during \nthis period. However, Beazley is a much larger and more \ncomplex organisation than it was when the policy was \ndeveloped and therefore refinements are necessary to allow \nus to continue to flourish going forward. Over the past two \nyears Beazley has performed exceptionally, and we continue \nto execute against our strategy and deliver value to \nshareholders, culminating in our recent promotion to the FTSE \n100. We have also achieved a number of significant \nmilestones over the past year, including the streamlining of \nour underwriting structure, launching Lloyd’s first dedicated \nESG syndicate and realigning our digital business to be \nmanaged under one segment. \n \n108\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "Reweighting incentives to the long-term \nAt Beazley, we operate with a genuine long-term focus. In \norder to further align executives with shareholders over the \nlonger term and reward management for the delivery of our \nlong-term strategic objectives the Committee is proposing a \nreweighting between the short-term and long-term incentives. \nFrom 2023, we are proposing a reduction to the bonus \nopportunity of 100% of salary and an increase to the LTIP \nopportunity of 100% of salary. There is no change to the \noverall incentive opportunity. \nLTIP performance period\nA key feature of the Beazley business model is exposure to \ncatastrophes within a robust risk management framework. \nBecause of this, there is an inherent level of volatility in \ncompany performance. We have an established pay-for-\nperformance culture, a track record of aligning individual \nreward with performance and we do not believe in rewarding \nfailure. During the review of the policy, the remuneration \ncommittee identified that the volatility of our annual results \ncan have a disproportionate impact on LTIP awards, which is \nexacerbated by our longer-than-normal five-year performance \nperiod. \nTaking this into account the committee gave consideration to \nmoving to an annualised approach so that the LTIP is split into \nfive equal tranches with performance assessed pro-rata in \nyears one to five. We discussed the proposal with the majority \nof our shareholders (top 100) in order to gauge the potential \nlevels of support. During the consultation process, it became \nclear that a significant proportion of shareholders had \nreservations due to the atypical nature of the proposal and \nthere was a preference for a more market-typical approach, \nthat maintained a longer term performance period. \nBased on some shareholder feedback the committee decided \nagainst the annualised LTIP approach. As an alternative, and \naligned with our shareholders’ preference for a more market-\ntypical approach, the committee is proposing to simplify the \nLTIP performance period by removing the five-year \nperformance element so that the entire award is subject to \ncumulative performance measured over a three year period. \nWe believe that this change is appropriately aligned with the \ninterests of our shareholders, improves the clarity of the LTIP \nand makes it simpler for both participants and investors. The \nvesting of awards will continue to be subject to stretching \nperformance targets and shares will be subject to a two-year \npost-vesting holding period. Ultimately the committee believes \nthat this change, in conjunction with including an ESG metric, \nwill help to continue to incentivise and retain our high calibre, \nexperienced executive team. \nIncorporation of ESG metrics\nThe committee is mindful of evolving shareholder views \naround the use of relevant and robust ESG metrics in \nincentive plans. During our review, the Committee considered \nhow Beazley’s commitment to doing the right thing for our \npeople, partners and the planet was reflected in our current \nremuneration framework. Our bonus structure already includes \nconsideration of ESG measures, and the committee \ndetermined that it would be appropriate for executives to be \naligned with our long-term ambitions by incorporating ESG \nmeasures into our LTIP. For 2023 the LTIP will include targets \nlinked to our carbon reduction, gender and ethnic diversity \ngoals. These targets will be assessed over three years and \nwill have a weighting of of 17-20% of the overall LTIP award \nand will pay up to a maximum of 50% of salary. \nOther changes to policy\nFrom 2023, we intend to increase the CEO shareholding \nrequirement from 200% to 300% of salary to align with the \nLTIP opportunity. We are also proposing refinements to the \npolicy to ensure that it is aligned with the latest best practice \nand shareholder expectations. The post cessation \nshareholding guideline will be increased to 100% of the in-\nemployment guideline for two years following departure. From \n2023 the level of bonus deferred into shares will be fixed at \none-third, moving away from the current approach whereby the \nportion of bonus deferred varies depending on the outturn. We \nalso plan to introduce a global share match programme which \nwe believe further aligns employee experience with that of the \nshareholder as well as creating another form of retention.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n109"

      "text": "Letter from the Chair of our \nRemuneration Committee \ncontinued\nRemuneration approach for 2023\nReview of Executive Directors’ salaries \nAs part of the policy review, the Remuneration Committee \ncarefully considered the salary levels for the CEO and Group \nFinance Director to ensure that they remained reflective of \ntheir skills and expertise as well as being appropriate for a \ncompany of Beazley’s size and complexity. \nThe Committee has identified that the CEO’s salary has fallen \nout of step with the transformative changes that have taken \nplace in our recent history. As context, since 2017, CEO pay \nhas only increased by c.3% per annum and when Adrian Cox \nreplaced Andrew Horton as CEO, the Committee did not \nincrease the CEO salary (£525,25k). However, the Committee \nwere cognisant a review would be required in the near future \nto permit Beazley to compete for executive talent globally and \nmore importantly to recognise that over the last 5 years, \nBeazley has grown significantly in terms of scale and \ncomplexity. Our annual market capitalisation to 31 December \n2017 was c.£2.45bn. During 2022 our market capitalisation \nexceeded £4.5bn, with an annual average of c.£3.25bn (total \ngrowth of more than 300%). Gross written premiums have \nmore than doubled from $2.1bn to $5.3bn and the number of \nBeazley employees has increased two-fold to c.1,900. We are \nnow Lloyds’ largest syndicate and in 2019 and 2022 \nrespectively we commenced writing business on our Smart \nTracker and ESG syndicates. \nSpeciality insurance is a global business, and our operations \nare increasingly US and European based, with few businesses \nin the Speciality insurance domiciled in the UK with the same \nscale and scope of Beazley. The Remuneration Committee is \ntherefore mindful that our talent spans across a global \nfootprint and the Committee is mindful that other companies \nof similar size and scale can offer significantly more attractive \npackages. We want to retain our best talent and manage an \neffective succession slate over the long term, ensuring that \nour remuneration framework remains competitive against \nthese markets. Although benchmarking is not a primary driver \nfor decisions around pay, the Committee took into account \nmarket data which showed that the CEO’s salary was below \nthe market competitive range against all relevant comparator \ngroups and the other UK-listed Lloyd’s of London underwriters.\nThe Remuneration Committee believes Adrian Cox has an \nexceptional track record of high performance. Having joined \nBeazley in 2001, he has served as an Executive Director since \n2010 and was appointed as CEO in April 2021. He has \ncontinued to prove himself to be a high calibre executive with \nan extensive knowledge of the insurance industry and a \nprimary driver of Beazley’s success. The Remuneration \nCommittee are therefore proposing that his salary is increased \nto £625,000. On balance, the Committee believes that the \nenhancements made to the remuneration policy which is \nconsidered appropriate within the context set out above and \nhis considerable experience in the industry.\nSally Lake’s salary as Group Finance Director was considered \nto be appropriately positioned following the change made last \nyear in-light of her increased responsibilities. It has therefore \nbeen increased by 5% for 2023, which is in-line with the \napproach for senior management and below the average rate \nof the workforce. \nNon-Executive Director fees\nIn October 2022 David Roberts stepped down as Chair of The \nBoard. As announced in February 2023 Clive Bannister will be \nappointed as chair with effect from 25 April 2023. Until Clive \nBannister’s official appointment Christine LaSala has been \nappointed as Interim Chair of The Board, Robert Stuchbery \nhas been appointed Interim Senior Independent Director and I \nhave been appointed Interim Remuneration Committee Chair. \nThe fees for the three roles have been pro-rated to reflect the \nadditional responsibilities.\nAs announced in December 2022, The Board decided to split \nthe Audit & Risk Committee into two separate committees \nfrom 1 January 2023. The fees for the roles on the new \ncommittees have been set with reference to the \nresponsibilities and time commitments required and are set \nout on page 131. Following the annual fee review, it was \ndetermined that the non-executive director fees should be \nincreased by 3%, below the general increase for the \nworkforce. \n2023 AGM \nAt the forthcoming AGM there will be an advisory vote in \nrespect of the directors’ remuneration and a binding vote on \nthe proposed new remuneration policy. There will also be a \nvote to approve amendments to the LTIP rules. These \namendments are necessary to affect the reweighting and \nrevised measurement approach set out above. I hope you will \nfeel able to support these proposals and look forward to your \ncontinued support. \nNicola Hodson\nInterim Remuneration Committee Chair\n \n110\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "Directors’ remuneration report\nRemuneration in brief\nRemuneration policy\nWhen developing the revised remuneration policy and considering its implementation for 2023, the Committee was mindful of a \nwide range of factors including guidance from institutional investors, the requirements of Solvency II and the provisions of the \nUK Corporate Governance Code. The main aim of Beazley’s remuneration policy is to ensure that management and staff are \nremunerated fairly and in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualified \npersonnel. The Committee considers that the policy supports our strategy and promotes the long-term success of Beazley.\nThe following table summarises how the committee addressed the factors set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code when \ndetermining the remuneration policy:\nFactor\nDetails\nClarity\nRemuneration arrangements should be \ntransparent and promote effective \nengagement with shareholders and the \nworkforce\nAt Beazley performance-related remuneration is an essential motivation to management and \nstaff and is structured to ensure that Executives’ interests are aligned with those of our \nshareholders.\nWe operate a bonus structure that is based on Group profitability and long term performance. A \nkey principle is that the committee exercises its judgement in determining individual bonus \nawards. In recent years we have expanded our disclosure to provide shareholders with further \nclarity on the way in which we determine awards.\nSimplicity\nRemuneration structures should avoid \ncomplexity and their rationale and operation \nshould be easy to understand\nIn determining our remuneration framework the Committee was mindful of avoiding complexity \nand making arrangements easy to understand for both participants and our shareholders. \nAs part of the Policy review we have simplified our approach to bonus deferral so that one-third \nof any bonus is deferred into shares for three years and we have also simplified the LTIP \nperformance period.\nRisk\nRemuneration arrangements should ensure \nreputational and other risks from excessive \nrewards, and behavioural risks that can arise \nfrom target-based incentive plans, are \nidentified and mitigated\nWe believe reward at Beazley is appropriately balanced in light of risk considerations. The \nCommittee receives an annual report from the Chief Risk Officer to ensure that our wider \nremuneration policy is consistent with, and promotes, effective risk management.\nOur framework has a number of features which align remuneration out-turns with risk, including \na five year time horizon on the LTIP, deferral of bonus into shares and personal shareholding \nrequirements which extend post departure. Further details of the link between risk and \nremuneration are set out on page 130.\nPredictability\nThe range of possible values of rewards to \nindividual directors and any other limits or \ndiscretions should be identified and \nexplained at the time of approving the policy\nPage 118 provides four illustrations of the application of our remuneration policy including the \nkey elements of remuneration: base salary, pension, benefits and incentives. Payments at \nBeazley are directly aligned to the Group’s performance and the graph set out on page 127 \ndemonstrates how historic annual bonus out-turns have reflected profit and ROE performance.\nProportionality\nThe link between individual awards, the \ndelivery of strategy and the long-term \nperformance of the company should be clear. \nOutcomes should not reward poor \nperformance\nIndividual remuneration reflects Group objectives but is dependent on the profitability of the \nGroup and is appropriately balanced against risk considerations. Potential rewards are market-\ncompetitive and the committee is comfortable that the range of potential out-turns are \nappropriate and reasonable.\nAlignment to culture\nIncentive schemes should drive behaviours \nconsistent with company purpose, values \nand strategy\nThe Remuneration Committee considers that the structure of remuneration packages supports \nmeritocracy, which is an important part of Beazley’s culture. All employees at Beazley are \neligible to participate in a defined contribution pension plan and a bonus plan. Bonuses are \nfunded by a pool approach which reflects our commitment to encourage teamwork at every \nlevel, which is one of our key cultural strengths.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n111"

The Committee also sought the views of the Group’s \nmajor shareholders and took these into account in \ndetermining the final policy. \nThe key changes between this policy and the policy which was \napproved by shareholders at Beazley’s 2020 AGM are as \nfollows:\n• Reweighting of incentives to the long term. In recognition \nthat shareholders have generally expressed a preference for \nlonger-term incentives, a reweighting between the bonus \nand LTIP maximum opportunities is being proposed. The \nmaximum annual bonus opportunity will reduce by 100% of \nsalary for both executive directors and the maximum LTIP \nopportunity will increase by 100% of salary. There are no \nproposed changes to total incentive opportunities. \n• Introduction of ESG to the long-term incentive. Historically \nthe LTIP award has been assessed against a single metric. \nTaking into account the importance of ESG and \nshareholders’ preference for the use of multiple measures \nthe policy has been amended to allow for the introduction of \nESG measures in the LTIP. \n• Simplified LTIP performance period. From 2023 LTIP awards \nwill be measured over a three-year period only. Awards will \ncontinue to be subject to a holding period so that no shares \nare released until the end of year five. \n• Fixed rate of deferral. From 2023, the level of annual bonus \nthat is normally deferred into shares for three years will be \nfixed at one-third of the bonus.\n• Increased shareholding guidelines. The shareholding \nguideline for the CEO has been increased from 200% to \n300% of salary. \n• Enhanced post-employment shareholding guidelines. Our \npost-employment shareholding guidelines have been \nenhanced.

For these purposes ‘payments’ includes \nthe Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration \nand, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the \npayment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted. This \npolicy applies equally to any individual who is required to be \ntreated as a Director under the applicable regulations. \nPerformance measures and targets\nThe following table provides further detail on why performance measures are chosen and how targets are set.\n \nIncentive plan\nPerformance measures\nWhy performance measures were chosen and target setting\nAnnual bonus \nplan\nFinancial performance \n(including profit and \nROE), corporate/\nstrategic performance \n(including risk \nadjustment) and \nindividual \nperformance\n• The Committee believes the approach to the determination of bonuses creates alignment to \nshareholders’ interests and ensures that bonuses are affordable, while the ROE targets \nincrease the performance gearing and the risk adjustment is consistent with and promotes \neffective risk management.\n• The Committee reviews the bonus pool framework each year to ensure that it remains \nappropriate and targets are set taking into account the prevailing environment, interest rates \nand expected investment returns, headcount and any other relevant factors.\n• A key principle of the process is that the Committee exercises its judgement in determining \nindividual awards taking into account the individual’s contribution and performance.\nLong term \nincentive plan\nGrowth in net asset \nvalue per share \n(NAVps)\n• Creates alignment to Beazley’s central key performance indicator, and recognises that NAVps is \na key item supporting increases in share price and shareholder returns.\n• Vesting of awards requires sustained growth in NAVps over a three-year time period.\n• The Committee reviews the NAVps targets periodically to ensure they remain appropriate with \nreference to the internal business plan, the external environment and market practice.\n• In the event that NAVps were to become unsuitable as a performance measure in the opinion of \nthe Committee (for example due to a change in accounting standards) the Committee would \nsubstitute a measure which followed broadly similar principles.\nESG measures\n• The Committee recognises the importance of ESG to Beazley’s long-term success and believes \nthe introduction of ESG measures to the LTIP will incentivise the delivery of our ambitions.\n• For 2023 the ESG measure will be assessed against three categories relating to carbon \nreduction, gender diversity and ethnic diversity. The Committee will review the ESG targets \nperiodically to ensure they remain appropriate with reference to our long-term ESG priorities and \nmarket practice.\n• For 2023, ESG objectives are to be assessed over a three-year performance period.\nInvestment in \nunderwriting\nThe plan mirrors \ninvestment in an \nunderwriting syndicate\n• The Beazley staff underwriting plan provides for participants to contribute personal capital to \nBeazley syndicates. Selected staff are invited to participate through bonus deferral with an \nelement of cash incentives ‘at risk’ as capital commitments.\nDifferences in policy from broader employee population\nThe policy for Executive Directors follows the same broad \nprinciples in place for all employees in Beazley. Differences in \npolicy for executive directors and senior management as \ncompared to the broader employee population reflect different \nmarket levels for seniority, as well as their group \nresponsibilities. For example, incentive performance \nconditions for Executive Directors and senior management are \nmore closely aligned to group performance, whereas \nunderwriters participate in incentive plans linked to the \nperformance of their business area.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n117"

Although the \ncompany operates in a highly competitive market for \nexecutive talent, the Committee remains conscious of the \nneed to avoid paying more than is necessary on \nrecruitment; \n• the Committee will, so far as practical, seek to align the \nremuneration package for any incoming Executive with the \nremuneration policy table set out above; \n• on recruitment, salaries will be set to take into account role \nand responsibilities. For interim positions a cash \nsupplement may be paid rather than salary (for example a \nNon-Executive Director taking on an executive function on a \nshort term basis); \n• the Committee may, on appointing an Executive Director, \nneed to ‘buy out’ remuneration arrangements forfeited on \njoining the company; \n• any buyout would take into account the terms of the \narrangements (e.g. form of award, performance conditions, \ntimeframe) being forfeited in the previous package. The \nform of any award would be determined at the time and the \ncommittee could if necessary make use of LR 9.4.2 of the \nListing Rules (for the purpose of buyout awards only). The \nCommittee would seek to structure buyout awards to be in \nline with Beazley’s remuneration framework so far as \npractical. The overriding principle will be that any \nreplacement buyout awards would be of comparable \ncommercial value to the awards which had been forfeited;\n• all buyout awards would normally be liable to forfeiture or \n‘clawback’ on early departure. For Executive Directors early \ndeparture is defined as being within the first two years of \nemployment; \n• the maximum level of variable remuneration which may be \ngranted in the first year (excluding buyouts) is in line with \nthe aggregate maximums set out in the policy table. The \nCommittee retains the flexibility to determine that for the \nfirst year of appointment any annual bonus award will be \nsubject to such conditions as it may determine; and \n \n118\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

Similarly, if an Executive Director is appointed \nfollowing Beazley’s acquisition of or merger with another \ncompany, legacy terms and conditions would be honoured.\nService contracts and loss of office payment policy\nIt is company policy that service contracts with Executive \nDirectors contain notice periods, from the company or \nemployee, of not more than 12 months. The company may at \nits absolute discretion elect to terminate an Executive \nDirector’s employment by making a payment in lieu of notice \nof the individual’s salary for that period.

The Committee greatly values feedback \nfrom our shareholders and took their views into account when \nfinalising the proposals. \nA number of the changes made to the remuneration policy \nhave been made in direct response to feedback received from \nshareholders. For example, from 2023 we are fixing the rate \nof bonus deferral and have enhanced our post-employment \nshareholding requirements to align with evolving market \nexpectations. We have also responded to shareholders’ \npreference for the use of multiple measures in the LTIP by \nintroducing an ESG measure from 2023. \nAs a Committee, we monitor evolving shareholder views on \nExecutive remuneration and regularly review guidance from \nproxy bodies, as well as from our shareholders. We continue \nto value input from our shareholders and are committed to \nensuring an open dialogue.\nMinor changes\nThe Committee may make minor amendments to the policy \nset out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax, or \nadministrative purposes, or to take account of a change in \nlegislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for such \namendments.\n \n120\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "Salary ▪\nThe Committee reviews salaries annually taking into \nconsideration any changes in role and responsibilities, \ndevelopment of the individual in the role, and levels in \ncomparable positions in similar financial service companies. It \nalso considers the performance of the Group and the \nindividual as well as the average salary increase for \nemployees across the whole Group. Salary reviews take place \nin December of each year, with new salaries effective from 1 \nJanuary.\nDuring the year the Committee reviewed the executive \ndirectors’ salaries and identified that Adrian P Cox’s salary as \nCEO had fallen out of step with the transformative changes \nthat have taken place at Beazley in our recent history. The \nCommittee recognised that it was in the interests of \nshareholders that Adrian’s salary is set at a reasonable level \nin order to retain and motivate a CEO of the calibre necessary \nto effectively run Beazley and to deliver our long-term strategic \npriorities. Therefore the committee has made a step change \nto his salary for 2023 increasing it from £525,250 to \n£625,000. Further details on the Committee’s rationale are \nprovided on page 110. \nAs set out in the Remuneration Committee Chair’s statement, \nthe committee was cognisant of the cost-of-living challenges \nfacing the wider workforce in light of inflation levels. Therefore \nthe salary increase budget was targeted at those experiencing \nthe greatest pressures. For 2023 the GFD’s salary is being \nincreased by 5.0%, in-line with the approach for other senior \nroles, and considerably below the increases awarded to more \njunior staff.\nThe base salaries for the executive directors in 2022 and 2023 are as set out below:\n \n2022\nbase salary\n2023 \nbase salary\nIncrease\n£\n£\n%\nAdrian P Cox\n525,250\n625,000\n 19.0 \nSally M Lake\n414,000\n434,700\n 5.0 \nBenefits ▪\nBenefits include private medical insurance for the director and their immediate family, income protection insurance, death in \nservice benefit at four times annual salary, travel insurance, health-club membership, season ticket and the provision of either \na company car or a monthly car allowance.\nPension ▪\nExecutive directors receive a pension allowance of 12.5% of salary, in-line with the rate available to the majority of the UK \nworkforce.\nPrior to 31 March 2006 the company provided pension entitlements to directors that are defined benefit in nature, based on its \nlegacy policy under the Beazley Furlonge Limited Final Salary Pension Scheme. Future service accruals ceased on 31 March \n2006. Only base salary is pensionable, subject to an earnings cap. The normal retirement age for pension calculation purposes \nis 60 years.

      "text": "Annual bonus structure ▪\nThe annual bonus plan is a discretionary plan in which all \nemployees are eligible to participate. The annual bonus is \nfunded by a bonus pool. The pool is calculated as a \npercentage of profit subject to a minimum group ROE. The size \nof the pool as a percentage of profit increases for higher \nlevels of ROE. This ensures that outcomes are strongly \naligned with shareholders’ interests.\nThe operation of an annual bonus pool approach reflects \nBeazley’s commitment to encourage teamwork at every level, \nwhich, culturally, is one of its key strengths. A broad senior \nmanagement team, beyond Executive Directors, participate in \nthe bonus pool, reinforcing the company’s collegiate culture.\nOnce the annual bonus pool has been calculated the \ncommittee determines individual allocations taking into \nconsideration corporate/strategic achievements and individual \nachievements. The bonus is discretionary and, rather than \nadopting a prescriptive formulaic framework, the Committee \nconsiders wider factors in its deliberations at the end of the \nyear: for example quality of profit and risk considerations.\nIn determining awards, the committee will not necessarily \naward the bonus pool in aggregate (i.e. the sum of the bonus \nawards may be less than the bonus pool).\nThe approach to the calculation of bonuses is aligned to \nshareholders’ interests and ensures that bonuses are \naffordable, while the ROE targets increase the performance \ngearing. The Committee reviews the bonus pool framework \neach year to ensure it remains appropriate, taking into \naccount the prevailing environment, interest rates and \nexpected investment returns, headcount and any other \nrelevant factors.\nAnnual bonus out-turn for 2022\nThe process for determining 2022 bonuses is described \nbelow, including full details of the ROE targets underpinning \nour bonus approach along with the guideline levels which are \nused by the Committee in its determination for each Executive \nDirector.\nAnnual bonus pool calculation for 2022\nAt the beginning of the financial year, the risk-free return (RFR) was set at 0.75% taking into account the yield on US treasuries \nof two to five year maturities. This resulted in the following ROE hurdles and guideline bonus awards:\n \nROE performance hurdles\nThreshold\nMaximum\nROE performance\n0.75%\n3.75%\n10.75%\n18.25%\n25.75%\nGuideline/illustrative bonus award as % of maximum\n0%\n12.5%\n37.5%\n75%\n100%\n2022 ROE hurdles and guideline bonus awards\nGuideline/illustrative bonus award as % of maximum\n0%\n3%\n10%\n17.5%\n25%\n30%\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nThese percentages are indicative only and based on broad \ncorporate results. Within the pool framework bonus out-turns \nmay be higher or lower taking into account corporate \nachievements and individual performance (see next page).\nROE for 2022 was 7% and the overall bonus pool (in which \nexecutive directors as well as other senior employees \nparticipate) was calculated based on this.\nWhen considering the annual bonus pool outcome, the \nCommittee takes into account the outcome of the Group’s \nROE/profit. The framework is used by the Committee as a \nbroad guideline rather than being formulaic and applies to a \nbroader group of Executives than Board Directors. A key \nprinciple of the process is that the Committee exercises its \njudgement in determining individual awards taking into \naccount the corporate/strategic objectives, individual’s \ncontribution and performance. In particular, there may be a \ndiverse spread of returns earned across the various divisions \nwithin the business which will be reflected in bonus out-turns \nachieved. The table therefore provides full retrospective \ndisclosure of all the Group financial targets and corporate/ \nstrategic performance which the Committee considers when \ndetermining the annual bonuses.\nWhen determining annual bonuses an assessment against the \nexpectation for each element is made with reference to the \nfollowing grading system:\nExpectation achieved or exceeded\nReasonable outcome against expectation \nExpectation not met\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n123"

The bonus ROE framework set out in this report is based on the \nprevious accounting standards and, if necessary, may be updated to reflect the new accounting standards.  In making any \namendments the committee will ensure that targets are no more or less stretching and that participants do not inadvertently \nbenefit from the change in accounting standards.\nAs set out earlier in the Report, the Committee are proposing two key changes to the annual bonus approach for 2023. As part \nof the wider rebalancing to the longer-term the maximum annual bonus opportunity will be reduced to 300% of salary and the \nlevel of deferral will be fixed so that one-third of any bonus for 2023 will be deferred into shares for three years.\nLong term incentive plan (LTIP) ▪\nUnder the LTIP Executive Directors, senior management and selected underwriters receive awards of shares subject to the \nachievement of stretching performance conditions. As mentioned in the Letter from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee \nwe are proposing a number of changes to the LTIP as part of the renewal of our Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the 2023 \nAGM. The proposed changes are explained in more detail at the end of this segment whilst the following sections set out the \ndetails for outstanding LTIP awards granted under our current structure.\nLTIP structure for awards granted prior to 2023 ▪\nVesting of awards is based on growth in net asset value per share (NAVps), one of Beazley’s key performance indicators. NAVps \nperformance is assessed equally over a three year and five year period. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code \nthe first tranche of LTIP awards is subject to a further two year holding period, taking the total time frame for the entire award to \nfive years. \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n127"

Beazley has an established pay-for-\nperformance culture, a track record of aligning individual \nreward with performance and a policy of not rewarding failure. \nDuring the review of the policy, the Remuneration Committee \nidentified that the volatility of our annual results can have a \ndisproportionate impact on LTIP awards, which is exacerbated \nby our longer-than-normal five-year performance period. \nTaking this into account the Committee gave consideration to \nmoving to an annualised approach so that the LTIP is split into \nfive equal tranches with performance assessed pro-rata in \nyears one to five.\nThis proposal was discussed with the majority of our \nshareholders (top 100) in order to gauge the potential levels \nof support.

As an alternative, and \naligned with our shareholders’ preference for a more market-\ntypical approach, the Committee is proposing to simplify the \nLTIP performance period by removing the five-year \nperformance element so that the entire award is subject to \ncumulative performance measured over a three year period.\nThe Committee believes that this change is appropriately \naligned with the interests of our shareholders, improves the \nclarity of the LTIP and makes it simpler for both participants \nand investors. The vesting of awards will continue to be \nsubject to the stretching performance targets set out below, \nand shares will be subject to a two-year post-vesting holding \nperiod. Ultimately the Committee believes that this change, in \nconjunction with including an ESG metric, will help to continue \nto incentivise and retain our high calibre, experienced \nexecutive team.\n \nNAVps performance1\n% of award vesting\nNAVps growth < risk-free rate +7.5%\n 0 %\nNAVps growth = risk-free rate +7.5%\n 10 %\nNAVps growth = risk-free rate +10%\n 25 %\nNAVps growth = risk-free rate +15%\n 100 %\n1 As part of their review of the financial targets for the 2023 LTIP awards the Committee noted the potential impact of the implementation of IFRS 17 which applies \nfrom January 2023.  The targets set above are based on the previous accounting standards and, if necessary, may be updated to reflect the new accounting \nstandards.  In making any amendments the committee will ensure that targets are no more or less stretching and that participants do not inadvertently benefit \nfrom the change in accounting standards.\nIntroduction of ESG metrics \nBeazley’s aspiration is to be the highest performing \nsustainable specialist insurer in the market. We believe that \nwe must demonstrate our commitment to this and have made \na series of measurable steps to incorporate relevant \nenvironmental, societal and governance (ESG) features into \nevery aspect of our business. From 2023 we are introducing  \nESG metrics into the LTIP in order to incentivise the delivery of \nour ambitions over the longer-term.

The Committee intends to set stretching, \nquantifiable targets which align with our external commitments around carbon reduction. Full details of the targets will be published on the Company’s website \nwhen available.\nWe understand that we and the business world are on a \ncomplex journey. Whilst we believe that the above metrics are \nthe most appropriate metrics for the LTIP at this time, we \nacknowledge that our ESG strategy will evolve over time, and \nwe intend to employ alternative metrics in the future where \nappropriate and relevant given our priorities.\nDilution\nThe share plans permit 10% of the company’s issued share \ncapital to be issued pursuant to awards under the LTIP, SAYE \nand option plan in a 10-year period. The company adheres to \na dilution limit of 5% in a 10 year period for executive \nschemes.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n129"

      "text": "Directors’ remuneration report\nAnnual remuneration report\ncontinued\nInvestment in underwriting ▪\nTraditionally, Lloyd’s underwriters contributed their personal \ncapital to syndicates in which they worked. With the move to \ncorporate provision of capital, individual membership of \nLloyd’s has declined significantly. The Committee feels that \nhaving personal capital at risk in the syndicate is an important \npart of the remuneration policy and provides a healthy \ncounterbalance to incentivisation through bonuses and long \nterm incentive awards. The company has operated the Beazley \nstaff underwriting plan for this purpose since 2004 and \nexecutive directors and other selected staff are invited to \nparticipate through bonus deferral with an element of their \ncash incentives ‘at risk’ as capital commitments. These \ncapital commitments can be lost in full if underwriting \nperformance is poor.\nThe Group funds the capital for the plan. The individual capital \ncommitment is then funded through individual’s bonus \ndeferral. The aim is for individuals to fund their capital within \nthree years.\nTo date over 300 employees of the Group have committed to \nput at risk £15.2m of bonuses to the underwriting results of \nsyndicate 623. Of the total at risk, £13.0m has already been \ndeferred from the bonuses awarded.\nThe following executive directors participated in syndicate 623 through Beazley Staff Underwriting Limited:\n \nTotal bonuses deferred \n£\n2021 year of accounting \nunderwriting capacity\n2022 year of accounting \nunderwriting capacity\n2023 year of accounting \nunderwriting capacity\nAdrian P Cox\n216,000\n400,000\n400,000\n400,000\nSally M Lake\n54,000\n100,000\n100,000\n250,000\nAdrian P Cox has fully funded the capital requirement. Sally M Lake is fully funded for the capital requirement for 2021-2022, \nthe increase in capital for the 2023 capacity will be funded via future bonus deferral.\nMalus and clawback\nRecovery provisions (malus and clawback) have applied to incentives for a number of years. Further detail on the recovery \nprovisions, including the circumstances and timeframe for which they can be applied are set out in the remuneration policy.\nRisk and reward at Beazley\nThe Committee regularly reviews developing remuneration governance in the context of Solvency II remuneration guidance, other \ncorporate governance developments and institutional shareholders’ guidance. The chief risk officer reports annually to the \nremuneration committee on risk and remuneration as part of the regular agenda. The Committee believes the Group is adopting \nan approach which is consistent with, and takes account of, the risk profile of the Group.\nWe believe reward at Beazley is appropriately balanced in light of risk considerations, particularly taking into account the \nfollowing features:\nFeatures aligned with risk considerations\nShare deferral\nA portion of bonus is normally deferred into shares for three years. These deferred shares, together with \nshares awarded under the LTIP, mean that a significant portion of total remuneration is delivered in the \nform of shares deferred for a period of years.\nLTIP holding period\nOutstanding LTIP awards vest over a five year period. From 2023 LTIP awards will vest over a three-year \nperiod. Any awards which have a performance period of less than five years are subject to an additional \nholding period, following the date on which the award vests, up to the fifth year of the award.\nShareholding requirements\nExecutive Directors are expected to build up and maintain a shareholding of 300% of salary for the CEO and \n200% of salary for the GFD. Executive Directors are also expected to maintain a shareholding post-\ndeparture.\nInvestment in underwriting\nManagement and underwriters may defer part of their bonuses into the Beazley staff underwriting plan, \nproviding alignment with capital providers. Capital commitments can be lost if underwriting performance is \npoor.\nUnderwriters remuneration \naligned with profit received\nUnder the profit related bonus plan payments are aligned with the timing of profits achieved on the account. \nFor long tail accounts this may be in excess of six years. If the account deteriorates then payouts are \n‘clawed back’ through adjustments to future payments. Since 2012 profit related pay plans may be at risk \nof forfeiture or reduction if, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, there has been a serious \nregulatory breach by the underwriter concerned, including in relation to the Group’s policy on conduct risk.\nMalus and clawback provisions\nMalus and clawback provisions apply to all incentives that Executive Directors participate in.\n \n130\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

Non-Executive Directors may receive \nadditional fees for sitting on subsidiary Boards. As a result of developments in regulation, the degree of autonomy in the \noperation of each Board has increased in recent years, with a consequent increase in time commitment and scope of the role.\nNo Non-Executive Director participates in the Group’s incentive arrangements or pension plan.\nNon-Executive Directors are appointed for fixed terms, normally for three years, and may be reappointed for future terms.\nNon-Executive Directors are typically appointed through a selection process that assesses whether the candidate brings the \ndesired competencies and skills to the Group. The Board has identified several key competencies for Non-Executive \nDirectors to complement the existing skill-set of the Executive Directors.

The following tables set out the \nadditional incentive arrangements for other staff within the organization.\nOther incentive arrangements at Beazley (not applicable to executive directors):\n \nElement\nObjective\nSummary\nProfit related pay plan\nTo align underwriters’ reward with the \nprofitability of their account.\nProfit on the relevant underwriting account as \nmeasured at three years and later.\nSupport bonus plan\nTo align staff bonuses with individual \nperformance and achievement of objectives.\nParticipation is limited to staff members not on the \nexecutive or in receipt of profit related pay bonus. \nThe support bonus pool may be enhanced by a \ncontribution from the enterprise bonus pool.\nRetention shares\nTo retain key staff\nUsed in certain circumstances. Full vesting \ndependent on continued employment over six years.\nUnderwriter bonus plan – profit related pay plan\nUnderwriters participate in a profit related pay plan based upon the profitability of their underwriting account. Executive Directors \ndo not participate in this plan.\nThe objective of the plan is to align the interests of the Group and the individual through aligning an underwriter’s reward to the \nlong term profitability of their portfolio. Underwriters who have significant influence over a portfolio may be offered awards under \nthe plan. There is no automatic eligibility. Profit related pay is awarded irrespective of the results of the Group. Awards are \ncapped.\nThis bonus is awarded as cash and is based upon a fixed proportion of profit achieved on the relevant underwriting account as \nmeasured at three years and later. Any movements in prior years are reflected in future year payments as the account develops \nafter three years. For long-tail accounts the class is still relatively immature at the three-year stage and therefore payments will \nbe modest. Underwriters may receive further payouts in years four, five and six (and even later) as the account matures. \nTherefore each year they could be receiving payouts in relation to multiple underwriting years.\nIf the account deteriorates as it develops any payouts are ‘clawed back’ through reductions in future profit related pay bonuses. \nFrom 2012 onwards any new profit related pay plans may be at risk of forfeiture or reduction if, in the opinion of the \nRemuneration Committee, there has been a serious regulatory breach by the underwriter concerned, including in relation to the \nGroup’s policy on conduct risk. The Remuneration Committee also have oversight for all materials risk takers who participate in \nthe profit related pay plan.\n \n132\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

Underwriting \nrisk is taken into account when setting profit targets.\nIn addition to profit related pay, underwriters are also eligible to receive a discretionary bonus, based upon performance, from \nthe enterprise bonus pool. A proportion of this bonus may be paid in deferred shares, which vest after three years subject to \ncontinued employment.\nSupport bonus plan\nEmployees who are not members of the executive and who do not participate in the underwriters’ profit related pay plan \nparticipate in a discretionary bonus pool. This pool provides employees with a discretionary award of an annual performance \nbonus that reflects overall individual performance including meeting annual objectives.\nA proportion of this award may also be dependent on the Group’s ROE and therefore allocated from the enterprise bonus pool. \nA proportion of this bonus may be paid in deferred shares, which vest after three years subject to continued employment.\nUK SAYE\nThe company operates an HMRC-approved SAYE scheme for the benefit of UK-based employees. The scheme offers a three-\nyear savings contract period with options being offered at a 20% discount to the share price on grant. Monthly contributions are \nmade through a payroll deduction on behalf of participating employees. The UK SAYE scheme has been extended to eligible \nemployees in Singapore, Ireland, Canada, France, Germany and Spain. The Irish SAYE scheme has been approved by the Irish \nRevenue. However due to changes in Irish regulations in 2021 it was no longer possible to offer an Irish tax approved SAYE \nplan. Instead, eligible Irish employees were invited to participate in the international SAYE plan offering on a non-tax approved \nbasis.

Thus, reducing variable pay \noutturns which are dependent on Group performance.\nIn-line with our pay-for-performance culture a significant portion of the CEO’s remuneration is variable and dependant on \nperformance. Therefore there is a direct correlation between Company performance, the CEO’s single figure and the pay ratios. \nThe Committee is comfortable that the pay ratios for 2022 align to the pay and progression policies for employees and, that the \nlink between individual awards, the delivery of strategy and the long-term performance of the company through our incentive \nschemes drive behaviours consistent with company purpose, values and strategy and appropriately motivate and reward.\n \n136\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

A resolution will be \nproposed at the 2023 AGM to renew the authority for the \ncompany to purchase its own share capital up to the specified \nlimits for a further year. More detail of this proposal is given in \nthe notice of AGM.\nSignificant agreements – change of control\nDetails of an agreement to which the company is party that \nalters on change of control of the company following a \ntakeover bid are as follows.\nIn 2021 we renewed the $450m multi-currency standby letter \nof credit and revolving credit facility. Key terms remain \nunchanged. The agreement, which is between the company, \nother members of the Group and various banks, provides that \nif any person or groups of persons acting in concert gains \ncontrol of the company or another group obligor, then: (a) the \nbanks are thereafter not obliged to participate in any new \nrevolving advances or issue any letter of credit; and (b) the \nfacility agent may:\n(i) require the Group obligors to repay outstanding revolving \nadvances made to them together with accrued interest; \nand\n(ii) ensure that the liabilities under letters of credit are \nreduced to zero or otherwise secured by providing cash \ncollateral in an amount equal to the maximum actual and \ncontingent liabilities under such letters of credit.\nFurthermore, the facility agreement includes a covenant that \nno group obligor (other than a wholly owned subsidiary) will, \nwithout prior consent of the banks, amalgamate, merge \n(within the meaning of generally accepted accounting \nprinciples in the UK), consolidate or combine by scheme of \narrangement or otherwise with any other corporation or \nperson. If this covenant should be breached without prior \nconsent, then the facility agent may: (a) require the Group \nobligors to repay outstanding revolving advances made to \nthem together with accrued interest; (b) ensure that the \nliabilities under letters of credit are reduced to zero or \notherwise secured by providing cash collateral in an amount \nequal to the maximum actual and contingent liabilities under \nsuch letters of credit; (c) declare that any unutilised portion of \nthe facility is cancelled; and (d) give a notice of non-extension \nto Lloyd’s in respect of any letter of credit.\nAnnual general meeting \nThe AGM of the company will be held on 25 April 2023 at \n14.30. The notice of the AGM details the business to be put \nto shareholders.\nCorporate, social and environmental responsibility\nThe company’s corporate, social and environmental activities \nare set out in the statement of the Chair on page 8 and the \nResponsible Business section on page 21. During 2022, \nBeazley and employees donated over $470,000 to charities, \ndetails of which can be found in the Responsible Business \nsection.\nEmployee engagement \nWe are committed to employee involvement across the \nbusiness. We place great emphasis on open and regular \ncommunication, to ensure employees are well informed of \nBeazley’s performance and strategy. Active employee \nengagement has always been a priority and has become \nincreasingly important due to our activity based working \npolicies which allow colleagues to work flexibly and as many of \nour teams are based across different locations. During the \nyear, regular all-employee meetings, Q&As with senior \nmanagement and smaller meetings between leadership and \ngroups of employees have taken place both virtually and in \nperson.\nThe Chief Executive Officer provides a periodic general \nbusiness update to all employees by email. He also \ncommunicates the key focus areas of the Executive \nCommittee via a regular podcast and other areas of interest \nvia regular virtual meetings. The intranet is accessible by all \nemployees and is a useful source of company information.\nDuring 2022, all employees were invited to participate in \nsurveys on the business and its culture and on Beazley’s \nleadership. The key findings from these surveys and actions to \naddress these findings are discussed by The Board. Insight \ngained through various employee networks and via the day-to-\nday engagement of senior management with the workforce \nwas also shared with The Board. In addition, employee views \nhave been obtained by the Non-Executive Director nominated \nby The Board, this was Bob Stuchbery, for much of 2022 and \nwas replaced by Fiona Muldoon in November 2022. \nThroughout the year, Bob and Fiona have attended a variety of \nforums with employees to get direct feedback. Further \ninformation on our employee engagement activities and how \nfeedback has informed decisions can be found in the \nStakeholder engagement report on page 50.\nEmployees are able to share financially in Beazley’s success. \nAnnual bonus payments may be awarded and relate to the \nperformance of the company, as well as an individual’s own \nperformance.

Our \nresponsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial \nstatements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a \nbasis for our opinion.\nIndependence\nWe are independent of the Group and parent in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the \nfinancial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have \nfulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n \nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent company and we \nremain independent of the Group and the parent company in conducting the audit.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the \npreparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group and parent \ncompany’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting involved evaluating the reasonableness of the \nGroup’s going concern assessment. Beazley’s going concern assessment period used was 12 months from the date the \nfinancial statements were authorised for issue. We verified that The Board approved the forecasts used in management’s \nanalysis and determined whether management’s going concern period was appropriate. With support from our actuaries, we \nchallenged and independently stressed the assumptions used by Beazley to develop their forecast, which included liquidity \nprojections and reviewed the clerical accuracy of Beazley’s base case, as well as assessed the accuracy of management’s \nhistoric forecasts to actual performance. Furthermore, management assessed the Group’s solvency and liquidity position if a \nnatural catastrophe or cyber catastrophe occurred, including potential mitigation actions that management could take to \nmaintain viability.

For the remaining six components (“specific \nscope components”), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the \npotential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these \naccounts or their risk profile.  For group-wide processes we performed audit procedures over the specific accounts which \nconsist of IBNR and Reinsurers’ share of IBNR, Taxation, Cash and cash equivalents, Share based payments, Right of use \nassets, Lease liabilities, Financial assets and Intangible assets (indefinite life). \nThe reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 95% (2021:97%) of the Group’s Profit before \ntax, 96% (2021: 96%) of the Group’s Revenue and 98% (2021: 99%) of the Group’s Total assets.

The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but \nwill have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group.  \nOf the remaining 26 legal entities that together represent 5% (2021: 3%) of the Group’s Profit before Income Tax, none are \nindividually greater than 4% (2021: 4%) of the Group’s Gross Written Premium, none are individually greater than 2% (2021: 1%) \nof the Group’s total assets. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review, testing of \nsignificant balances, review of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of \nmaterial misstatement to the Group financial statements.\nInvolvement with component teams \nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each \nof the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from the UK and other EY global \nnetwork firms operating under our instruction.\nThe primary audit team provided detailed audit instructions to the component team which included guidance on areas of focus, \nincluding the relevant risks of material misstatement detailed above, and set out the information required to be reported to the \nprimary audit team. \nFor three specific scope components (BIDAC, Beazley Furlonge Limited, Beazley Management Limited) and all group-wide \nprocesses, all audit procedures were performed directly by the primary audit team whilst the other full scope components (BICI \nand Syndicate 2623) and specific scope component (Beazley Services USA Inc and Syndicate 3623) were audited by \ncomponent audit teams in the United States of America and United Kingdom respectively. For the companies where the work \nwas performed by component auditors, the primary audit team was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process \nand the primary audit team determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit \nevidence has been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole. \nThe Senior Statutory Auditor, Stuart Wilson maintained oversight of the UK and US component teams through a programme of \nmeetings (both in person and virtually) with management of each significant component and held regular team interactions with \nthe component teams during various stages of the audit. \nThe work performed on the components, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate \nevidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.\n \n148\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

The Group has determined \nthat the most significant future impacts from climate change on their operations will be from underwriting portfolio \nmanagement, exposure risk appetite management and investment portfolio management. These are explained on pages 29 to \n49 in the required Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures, which form part of the “Other information,” rather than \nthe audited financial statements as explained below. Our procedures on these disclosures therefore consisted solely of \nconsidering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the course of \nthe audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on ‘Other information’. \n \nAs explained in the Basis of Preparation note governmental and societal responses to climate change risks are still developing, \nand are interdependent upon each other, and consequently financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as \nthese are not yet known.   The degree of certainty of these changes may also mean that they cannot be taken into account \nwhen determining asset and liability valuations and timing of future cash flows under the requirements of International Financial \nReporting Standards. As explained in note 1, management believe that reasonably possible changes arising from climate risks \nwould not have a material impact on asset and liability valuations at the year-end date.  \nOur audit effort in considering climate change was focused on validating this assertion, through considering the potential \neffects of climate risks on asset values and associated disclosures where values are determined through modelling future cash \nflows. We also challenged the Directors’ considerations of climate change in their assessment of going concern and viability \nand associated disclosures. Based on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change on the financial statements \nto be a key audit matter or to impact a key audit matter.\nWhilst the Group have stated their commitment to the aspirations of the Paris Agreement to achieve net zero emissions by \n2050, the Group are currently unable to determine the full future economic impact on their business model, operational plans \nand customers to achieve this and therefore as set out above the potential impacts are not fully incorporated in these financial \nstatements.\nKey audit matters \nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial \nstatements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due \nto fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the \nallocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

(PY comparative \nGross: $6,399.1m and reinsurers’ share of IBNR: $1,458.0m)\nRefer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report (page 94); Accounting policies (pages 168 and 170); and Note 24 of the \nConsolidated Financial Statements (pages 211 to 220).\nOne of the most significant financial statement risk areas from both a business and an audit perspective is the valuation and \nadequacy of the claims liabilities held by the Group. Gross claims liabilities, and the related reinsurance on IBNR are \ninherently uncertain and subjective by nature and therefore are more susceptible to fraud or error than other financial \nstatement balances. A small manipulation of an assumption could have a significant impact on the result for the year. This \ncould lead to insurance liabilities not falling within a reasonable range of estimates, resulting in a misstatement in the \nfinancial statements. Additionally, the valuation process is conditional upon the accuracy and completeness of the data.\nWe have split the risk relating to the valuation of insurance liabilities into the following component parts:\n• Actuarial assumptions used in estimating gross IBNR and reinsurers’ share of IBNR; and\n• Data\nThe assumptions used to develop \nthe IBNR reserves, which make up \na significant component of the \ninsurance liabilities (gross and \nreinsurers’ share on IBNR), involve \na significant degree of judgement. \nAs a result we focused on this area \nas the valuation can be materially \nimpacted by various factors \nincluding\n• The risk of inappropriate \nassumptions used in \ndetermining gross IBNR and \nreinsurers’ share of IBNR, \nespecially on:\n◦Newer or growing classes of \nbusiness, due to reliance on expert \njudgement in management’s \nestimates due to the limited \nhistorical data available and \nlimitations in use of market data; \nand\n◦Classes subject to changing claims \nenvironment or trends such as \nCyber, due to greater reliance on \nexpert judgement in management’s \nestimates due to limited relevance \nof historical data to form a view on \nfuture claim development.\n• The risk that IBNR loss reserve \nestimates in respect of \ncatastrophe and large claims \nlosses are insufficient due to the \nsize and extent of these losses \nbeing uncertain. The areas we \nconsider as key areas of \njudgement include the tail \ndevelopment and consistency of \nreserves specifically on reserving \nclasses where prior year \ndeteriorations are seen, \npremium rate increases are \nassumed, and inflationary \ntrends, including social inflation, \nare experienced.\nTo obtain sufficient audit evidence to conclude on the \nappropriateness of actuarial assumptions, we engaged our \nactuaries as part of our audit team and performed the following \nprocedures:\n• Obtained an understanding and tested the design \neffectiveness of key controls over management’s process in \nrespect of the valuation of gross IBNR and reinsurers’ share \nof IBNR including the setting and updating of actuarial \nassumptions and the reinsurance netting down process to \ncalculate the reinsurers’ share of IBNR from the gross IBNR.\n• Assessed the reserving methodology on a gross basis and net \nof reinsurers’ share of IBNR. This also involved comparing the \nGroup’s reserving methodology with industry practice.\n• Performed independent re-projections of IBNR applying our \nown assumptions, across all classes of business for \nattritional claims on a net of reinsurance and gross basis and \ncompared these to management’s results as at 31 December \n2022.\n• Assessed whether the assumptions, such as inflation, applied \nto key areas of uncertainty were appropriate based on our \nknowledge of the Group, industry practice and regulatory and \nfinancial reporting requirements. As part of our re-projections \nof the net and gross IBNR, we have formed an independent \nview of the additional claims cost arising from the current \neconomic inflationary environment.\n• Compared premium rate increases against industry \nbenchmarks and held discussions with management’s \nunderwriting and actuarial teams to understand any variances \nseen. Additionally, we reviewed evidence of renewals to verify \nthe cause of rate increases which included determining the \nreasonableness of the factors used to convert price changes \nto rate increases.\n• Benchmarking quantum of catastrophe losses, large losses, \nassumptions, and rates used in inherently uncertain classes \nand new growing classes, against other comparable industry \nparticipants to challenge and assess the reserving \nassumptions.\nWe determined that the \nactuarial assumptions \nas a whole, which are \nused by management \nare reasonable based \non our analysis of the \nexperience to date, \nindustry practice and \nthe financial and \nregulatory \nrequirements.

Where there were significant variances, we \nchallenged management’s assumptions used for bias and \nconsistency in approach from prior year.\n• For the data used in our independent re-projections we \ncorroborated premium data to underlying policy and finance \nsystems in order to test the completeness and accuracy of \nthis data set. This was performed through testing of key \nreconciliations to external sources such as external service \norganisations reports.\n• For a sample of policy estimates in respect of the 2022 \nunderwriting year, we corroborated the estimated premium for \npolices such as binders and inward reinsurance to supporting \nevidence such as signed slips. Additionally, to corroborate \nestimates, including for coverholder business, where similar \npolicies and binders have been written previously, we \nperformed back testing of historical estimated premium \nincome compared to actual premium signed.\nBased on the results of \nthe procedures \nperformed we \nconcluded that \npremium estimates had \nbeen recorded \nappropriately.\nRisk\nOur response to the risk\nKey observations \ncommunicated to the Audit \nand Risk Committee\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n151"

The \ninvestments themselves are in \nmany cases private and unquoted. \nThese assets are inherently harder \nto value due to the inability to \nobtain a market price of these \nassets as at the balance sheet \ndate. Therefore, there is judgement \nin both deriving the price and the \ntimeliness of receiving the \ninformation from the third-party \nmanagers, either of which could \nresult in misstatements of the \nvalue recognised in the financial \nstatements. Additionally, Beazley \nholds syndicate loans which are \nfunds provided by Beazley’s group \nsyndicates to the Central Funds at \nLloyd’s in respect of the 2019 and \n2020 underwriting years. \nObservable inputs are not readily \navailable for the valuation of \nSyndicate loans and so \nmanagement use models with \nother inputs to estimate their \nvalue. We consider that the key \nrisks on the valuation of Syndicate \nloans relates to (i) the \nassumptions used, as these are \nlargely based on non-observable \ninputs (ii) the appropriateness of \nthe valuation methodology applied \nto derive the fair value.\nTo obtain sufficient audit evidence to conclude on the \nappropriateness of valuation of level 3 investments, we \nperformed the following procedures for a sample of investments:\n• Obtained an understanding of the valuation process and \ntested the design effectiveness of key controls.\n• Obtained net assets valuation (‘NAV’) statements provided by \nthird party administrators in respect of all investments and \ncompared these to management’s valuations.\n• Assessed management’s valuations by performing \nindependent back testing of recent realisations, to confirm \nthat NAV is an appropriate proxy for fair value.\n• Obtained the most recent audited financial statements for \neach fund and inspected liquidity and going concern \ndisclosures for indication of impairment. Furthermore, we \ninspected the relevant accounting policies to confirm that the \nunderlying investments are being held at fair value to support \nthe NAV being a suitable proxy for fair value.\n• Performed retrospective testing to establish historic \nconsistency between the booked and final audited valuation \npositions in the underlying funds. This involved an analysis to \nestablish any trends, patterns, conditions, or discrepancies \nallowing challenge to management’s latest valuation.\n• Assessed investment carrying values for possible material \nmovements since the latest asset valuation by obtaining \nconfirmation of the investment managers latest percentage \nchange NAV estimates, where available, and inquire if they \nare aware of any indications of impairment since the latest \nvaluation date.\n• With support from our EY valuation specialists, we performed \nan independent valuation of the syndicate loans.\nBased on our \nprocedures performed \nwe were satisfied that \nthe valuations of illiquid \ncredit asset funds were \nreasonable.\nIn respect of the \nsyndicate loans, we \nwere satisfied the \ncarrying value was not \nmaterially different to \nour own valuation.\n \n152\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "Our application of materiality\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on \nthe audit and in forming our audit opinion.\nMateriality\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence \nthe economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent \nof our audit procedures.\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be $11.3 million (2021: $11.2 million), which is 5% of pre-tax profits on a 5-year \naverage adjusted for Covid-19 losses ($340m) and the gain on sale of the Beazley Benefit business ($55.4m) (2021: 5% of pre-\ntax profits on a 5-year average adjusted for Covid-19 losses and the gain on sale of the Beazley Benefit business).  This \nmateriality basis is in line with our approach taken in the prior year. We considered that adjusted pre-tax profits is the most \nrelevant performance measure used by investors, regulators and other stakeholders when assessing the Group. Given the \nnature of risks underwritten by Beazley, we believe the use of a five-year average profit is appropriate, as the profitability of the \nGroup is expected to fluctuate from period to period. Despite this we believe that an additional adjustment for COVID losses is \nalso appropriate given its unprecedented nature, which would not normally be expected in such a five-year time horizon.\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be $16.4 million (2021: $10.4 million), which is 1% (2021: 1%) of net \nassets. The Parent company primarily holds the investment in Group entities and, therefore, net assets is considered to be the \nkey focus for users of the financial statements.\nWe calculated materiality at the planning stage of the audit and then during the course of our audit, we reassessed initial \nmateriality at year end based on actual 2022 with no change as a result. \nPerformance materiality\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.  It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low \nlevel the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement \nwas that performance materiality was 50% (2021: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely $5.6m (2021: $5.6m).\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is \nundertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is \nbased on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement \nat that component.  In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was $5.6m to $1.2m \n(2021: $5.6m to $1.2m).\nReporting threshold\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\nWe agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of \n$0.6m (2021: $0.6m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, \nwarranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light \nof other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\nOther information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 232, other than the \nfinancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.  The directors are responsible for the other information contained within \nthe annual report. \nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly \nstated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. \nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially \ninconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be \nmaterially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to \ndetermine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we \nhave performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n153"

Reasonable assurance \nis a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists.

      "text": "Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our \nresponsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due \nto fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for \nexample, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of \ndetecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of \nthe company and management.\n• We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that \nthe most significant are permissions and supervisory requirements of the Central Bank of Ireland (‘CBI’), Lloyd’s, Prudential \nRegulation Authority (‘PRA’), the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’), state of Connecticut Insurance Department and the UK \nListing Authority (‘UKLA’).\n• We understood how Beazley plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit and \nthose responsible for legal and compliance matters. We also reviewed correspondence between the Group and regulatory \nbodies, reviewed minutes of the Executive Committee, Risk and Regulatory Committee and attended the Audit and Risk \nCommittees and gained an understanding of the Group’s approach to governance demonstrated by The Board’s approval of \nthe Group’s governance framework.\n• We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might \noccur by occur by considering the controls that the Group has established to address risks identified by the entity, or that \notherwise seek to prevent, deter or detect fraud. We also considered areas of significant judgement, including complex \ntransactions, performance targets, external pressures and the impact these have on the control environment and their \npotential to influence management to manage earnings or influence the perceptions of investors and stakeholders. Where \nthis risk was considered to be higher, within the valuation of insurance liabilities and the reinsurers’ share of IBNR and \nestimated premium income we performed audit procedures to address the identified fraud risk as detailed in the respective \nkey audit matters above. We made enquiries with management in person and via the use of video conferencing and \nperformed analytical review procedures to assess for unusual movements throughout the year. Our procedures to address the \nrisk identified also incorporated unpredictability into the nature, timing and/or extent of our testing; challenging assumptions, \nsignificant judgements and estimates made by management within their forward-looking information within their five-year plan, \nfor example. Additionally, we tested year-end manual journals to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements \nwere free from fraud or error. \n• Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. \nOur procedures involved making enquiry of those charged with governance and senior management for their awareness of any \nnon-compliance of laws or regulations; inquiring about the policies that have been established to prevent non-compliance with \nlaws and regulations by officers and employees both at a Group and component level; inquiring about the Group’s methods of \nenforcing and monitoring compliance with such policies; and inspecting significant correspondence with CBI, Lloyd’s, FCA, \nPRA, State of Connecticut Insurance Department and UKLA.\n• The Group operates in the insurance industry which is a highly regulated environment. As such the Senior Statutory Auditor \nconsidered the experience and expertise of the engagement team to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence \nand capabilities, which included the use of specialists where appropriate.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting \nCouncil’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.\nOther matters we are required to address\n• Following the recommendation from the Audit and Risk committee, we were appointed by the company on 23 May 2019 to \naudit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2019 and subsequent financial periods. \n• The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is four years covering the \nyears ending 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2022.\n• The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act \n2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required \nto state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.

The company’s registered \naddress is 22 Bishopsgate, London, EC2N 4BQ, United Kingdom. The principal activity of the company and its subsidiaries (the \n‘Group’) is to participate as a specialist insurer which transacts primarily in commercial lines of business through its \nsubsidiaries and through Lloyd’s syndicates. The Group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 comprise \nthe parent company, its subsidiaries and the Group’s interest in associates.\nThe financial statements of the parent company, Beazley plc, and the Group’s consolidated financial statements have been \nprepared in accordance with UK adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of the \nCompanies Act 2006. \nBy publishing the parent company financial statements together with the Group financial statements, the company is taking \nadvantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual statement of profit or loss.\nIn the current year, the Group have applied amendments to IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) \nand endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board (UKEB) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or \nafter 1 January 2022. The new effective amendments are: \n• Amendments to IAS 37 ‘Onerous contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract’ issued in May 2020;\n• Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020 issued in May 2020;\n• Amendments to IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment – Proceeds before Intended Use’ issued in May 2020; and\n• Reference to the Conceptual Framework – Amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ issued in May 2020.\nNone of the amendments issued by the IASB and endorsed by the UKEB have had a material impact to the Group. \nA number of new standards and interpretations adopted by the UKEB which are not mandatorily effective, as well as standards \nand interpretations issued by the IASB but not yet adopted by the UKEB, have not been applied in preparing these financial \nstatements. The Group does not plan to adopt these standards early; instead it expects to apply them from their effective dates \nas determined by their dates of UKEB endorsement. The Group expects the following upcoming standards to have an impact on \nits future financial statements:\n• IFRS 9: Financial Instruments (UKEB effective date: 1 January 2018, deferred in line with implementation of IFRS 17); \n• IFRS 9: Amendment: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (UKEB effective date: 1 January 2019, deferred in \nline with implementation of IFRS 17); and\n• IFRS 17: Insurance Contracts (UKEB effective date: 1 January 2023);\nThe IASB have issued a number of other minor amendments to standards which are not yet effective.

      "text": "1 Statement of accounting policies continued\nSignificant changes in accounting policy not yet effective\nInternational Financial Reporting Standard 17, Insurance Contracts (‘IFRS 17’)\nIFRS 17, Insurance Contracts, was issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in May 2017 and was \napproved for adoption in the United Kingdom by the UK endorsement Board on 16 May 2022. UK-adopted IFRS 17 is effective \nfor accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. IFRS 17 will materially change the way the Group accounts for, \nand reports, (re)insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts entered into in its consolidated financial statements.\nChanges to accounting policies\nThe IFRS 17 general measurement model requires that the following balances are recognised on initial recognition of an \ninsurance contract:\n• a discounted probability-weighted best estimate of future cash flows relating to the insurance contract;\n• a risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and\n• a contractual service margin (‘CSM’) representing the unearned profit that will be recognised over the coverage period of the \ncontract. The CSM is measured such that no profit arises on initial recognition.\nThe Group intends to measure all contracts consistently using the general measurement model set out above and does not \nexpect to use the simplified premium allocation approach for any portfolios or groups of insurance contracts currently issued. A \ndiscount rate to discount future cash flows will be derived using the ‘bottom-up’ approach, based on a risk-free discount rate \nthat is then adjusted with an illiquidity premium. Subsequent changes in discount rates on remeasurement will be accounted for \nthrough the statement of profit or loss.\nIFRS 17 requires that insurance contracts where the underlying risks are of a similar nature and where they are managed \ntogether be aggregated into groups of insurance contracts. These will then be subdivided based on the year coverage begins \nand whether it is onerous on initial recognition. The Group intends to align its IFRS 17 groupings with the way it currently \nmanages and reports its business. Where a contract is onerous on initial recognition, the Group will be required to recognise \nany losses up-front. The Group is currently assessing the extent to which contracts currently in issue may be onerous. \nReinsurance contracts which the Group takes out (reinsurance contracts held) will be measured similarly to (re)insurance \ncontracts issued. However the concept of onerosity does not exist in IFRS 17 for reinsurance and therefore the reinsurance \nCSM is measured such that no income or expense is recognised on initial recognition.\nChanges to presentation of financial statements on adoption of IFRS 17\nThe adoption of IFRS 17 will result in significant changes to the consolidated statement of profit or loss, the consolidated \nstatement of financial position and related notes. These include:\n• An insurance service result comprised of insurance revenue, insurance service expense and insurance finance income or \nexpense will replace the current premium and claims lines in the statement of profit or loss.\n• Reinsurance will be presented separately to insurance contracts issued.\n• The statement of financial position will contain less detail, with all balances in the scope of IFRS 17 being included in \ninsurance assets/liabilities or reinsurance assets/liabilities.\n• More extensive analysis of the IFRS 17 balances will be found in the notes to the financial statements.\nEstimated impact of the adoption of IFRS 17\nIFRS 17 requires that on transition comparative information is restated in accordance with the new accounting policies in force. \nThe Group expects to apply the fully retrospective transition approach. Contracts in the scope of IFRS 17 will be recognised and \nmeasured as if IFRS 17 had always applied, and previously reported balances which would not have existed if IFRS 17 had \nalways been applied (such as certain insurance receivables and some deferred acquisition costs) will be derecognised. Any \nresulting net difference will be included as a transition adjustment to retained earnings.\nThe Group has assessed the initial impact of IFRS 17 will have on its statement of financial position as at 1 January 2022. \nBased on assessments undertaken to date, the total adjustment (after tax) to the balance of the Group’s consolidated retained \nearnings is expected to be an increase of at least 2% of equity.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n164\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "1 Statement of accounting policies continued\nThis increase is due to a number of valuation differences between IFRS 4 and IFRS 17:\n• IFRS 17 technical provisions are discounted to reflect the time value of money. Under IFRS 4 the Group does not discount \ntechnical provisions, and thus under IFRS 17 net technical provisions will be less than when measured under IFRS 4.\n• In order to cover claims expected to be paid, the Group has historically held reserves within a range of 5-10% over an \nactuarial estimate. This actuarial estimate itself has a level of prudence within it. Under IFRS 17, reserves will be held at a \nbest estimate (with no prudence), with an added risk adjustment calculated to a specified confidence level. This will show a \npercentile giving an indication about where reserves sit compared to the best estimate and the capital requirement. The \nreserve margin at date of transition had a confidence level at the upper end of a 80th to 90th percentile range under IFRS 4. \nUnder IFRS 17 we expect the confidence level on transition to be nearer the middle of this range. Accordingly, the Group \nexpects the provision for claims recognised on adoption of IFRS 17 to be lower than current IFRS 4 technical provisions.\n• Under IFRS 4 unearned premium reserves and deferred acquisition costs are treated as non-monetary and are translated to \nthe Group’s functional currency using historic exchange rates. These balances are eliminated upon adoption of IFRS 17 and \nall insurance contract balances are considered to be monetary and are revalued using spot rates at each reporting date.\nThe assessment above is preliminary as we work to finalise the transition to IFRS 17. The actual impact of the adoption of IFRS \n17 may change as the Group refines the accounting processes and internal controls required for applying IFRS 17 whilst \ncarrying out parallel runs alongside IFRS 4 reporting. Additionally, the new accounting policies, judgements and estimation \ntechniques which will be adopted are subject to change until the Group finalises its first set of IFRS 17 compliant financial \nreporting in 2023.\nAs at the date of approval of these financial statements, the Group is conducting parallel runs of the IFRS 17 model which will \nproduce an IFRS 17 compliant result for the year ended 31 December 2022. The output of these parallel runs is currently being \nreviewed by management and will be subject to external audit. As the quantification of the impact of IFRS 17 on these financial \nstatements for the year ended 31 December 2022 is not fully audited, the Group has not disclosed this impact.\nInternational Financial Reporting Standard 9, Financial Instruments (‘IFRS 9’)\nIFRS 9 was issued by the IASB in July 2014 and became effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. \nThe IASB issued amendment to IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts in September 2016 and June 2020 which exempts eligible entities \nfrom applying IFRS 9 for accounting periods beginning before 1 January 2023. The Group remains eligible to apply the \ntemporary exemption in IFRS 4 and thus will begin to apply IFRS 9 for accounting periods beginning on 1 January 2023.\nThe Group qualifies for this exemption because, as at 31 December 2015, $5,040.7m or 95% of its total liabilities were \nconnected with insurance. There has been no material change in the Group’s activities since 31 December 2015, therefore the \nGroup is still eligible to use the exemption. The Group has also disclosed information in relation to specific types of financial \ninstruments to ensure the comparability with the entities applying IFRS 9. As such, fair values are disclosed separately for the \nGroup’s financial assets which are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis and those which meet the solely payments of \nprincipal and interest (SPPI) test under IFRS 9. \nThe below table sets out the disclosures required by the amendments to IFRS 4 for the deferral of IFRS 9 and sets out the fair \nvalue of assets which are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis and those which meet the SPPI test under IFRS 9. \nInformation on credit exposures can be found in note 2 on page 183.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n165"

This practice will continue under IFRS 9 as the Group \ndoes not manage its investments using a ‘hold to collect’ or ‘hold to collect and sell’ business model and therefore is required \nto measure its investments at fair value through profit or loss. Certain receivable balances will continue to be measured at \namortised cost and will have an expected credit loss applied on adoption of IFRS 9. The Group will continue to measure \nborrowings at amortised cost. The Group does not expect the adoption of IFRS 9 to have a material impact on the Group's \nearnings or the timing of when profits are recognised.\nIFRS 9 is not required to be applied retrospectively, as such the new standard will be applied prospectively from 1 January \n2023. At this point an expected credit loss provision will be recognised with the resulting difference recognised as an \nadjustment in retained earnings. The Group expects this resulting difference to be insignificant on the date of transition.\nBeazley plc as a standalone entity adopted IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018, which had an immaterial impact on its financial \nstatements.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n166\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "1 Statement of accounting policies continued\n1.1 Basis of presentation\nThe Group financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, with the exception of financial assets and derivative \nfinancial instruments which are stated at their fair value, and the defined benefit pension asset which is measured as the fair \nvalue of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit pension obligation. All amounts presented are in US dollars \nand millions, unless stated otherwise. \n1.2 Going concern\nThe consolidated financial statements of Beazley plc and the standalone financial statements of the company have been \nprepared on a going concern basis. In adopting the going concern basis, The Board has reviewed the Group’s current and \nforecast solvency and liquidity positions for the next 12 months from the date that the financial statements are authorised for \nissue. The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance, and \nposition, are set out in the strategic report contained in the Group’s Annual Report & Accounts. In addition, the risk report and \nfinancial review includes the Group’s risk management objectives and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for \nmanaging its capital. \nIn assessing the Group’s going concern position as at 31 December 2022, the Directors have considered a number of factors, \nincluding:\n• the current statement of financial position and in particular the adequacy of technical provisions;\n• the Group’s strategic and financial plan for the next 12 months, taking account of possible changes in trading performance \nand funding retention; \n• the Group's capital forecast, which takes into account the capital requirements of major subsidiaries and their current \nexternal credit rating and outlook;\n• the Group's liquidity at both a group and material subsidiary level; \n• stress testing and scenario analysis which, among others, assess the impact of natural and cyber catastrophe events on the \nGroup's capital and liquidity positions and reverse stress test scenarios designed to render the business model unviable; and\n• other qualitative factors, such as the market environment and the Group's ability to raise additional capital and/or liquidity. \nAs a result of the assessment, no material uncertainty in relation to going concern has been identified. As at its most recent \nregulatory submission, the Group’s capital ratios and its total capital resources are comfortably in excess of regulatory solvency \nrequirements, and internal stress testing indicates the Group can withstand severe economic and competitive stresses. \nBased on the going concern assessment performed, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and the \nGroup have adequate resources to continue in operational existence over a period of at least 12 months from the date of this \nreport and therefore believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. Accordingly, they continue \nto adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements. \n1.3 Use of estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements that affect the \nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from those on which management’s \nestimates are based. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other \nfactors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. Estimates which are sensitive to economic, \nregulatory and geopolitical conditions could be impacted by significant changes in the external environment such as rising \ninflation, rising interest rates, climate change, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and US legislation. \nSpecific to climate change, since responses to it are still developing, it is not possible to consider all possible future outcomes \nwhen determining asset and liability valuations, and timing of future cash flows, as these are not yet known. Nevertheless, the \ncurrent management view is that reasonably possible changes arising from climate risks would not have a material impact on \nasset and liability valuations at the year-end date. \nEstimates are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the \nestimate is revised and in any future periods affected. \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n167"

      "text": "1 Statement of accounting policies continued\na) Valuation of insurance contract liabilities\nThe most critical estimate included within the Group’s financial position is the estimate for insurance losses incurred but not \nreported (IBNR), which is included within total insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets in the statement of financial position \nand in note 24. This estimate is critical as it outlines the current liability for future expenses expected to be incurred in relation \nto claims. If this estimation was to prove inadequate then an exposure would arise in future years where a liability has not been \nprovided for. \nThe best estimate of the most likely ultimate outcome is used when calculating notified claims. This estimate is based upon \nthe facts available at the time, in conjunction with the claims manager’s view of likely future developments. Further detail on \nhow the Group determines its technical provisions is included in note 24.\nb) Valuation of unquoted and illiquid financial assets\nDetermination of fair value of unquoted and illiquid assets involves judgement in model valuations, through the incorporation of \nboth observable and unobservable market inputs. These inputs include assumptions that lead to the existence of a range of \nplausible valuations. Further detail on the methodologies and inputs used by the Group is included in note 16.\nc) Premium estimates \nA portion of gross written premiums is based on the estimated premium income (EPI) of each contract, which is an \nunderwriters’ estimate of the ultimate premium expected to be paid over the life of the contract. Where premium is written \nthrough delegated authority agreements, the EPI is pro-rated across the agreement period. Judgement is involved in determining \nthe ultimate estimates in order to establish the appropriate premium value and, ultimately, the cash to be received. EPI \nestimates are updated to reflect changes in an underwriters expectation through consultation with brokers and third-party \ncoverholders, changes in market conditions, historic experience and to reflect actual cash received for a contract. \nDue to the nature of the Lloyd’s business and the settlement patterns of the underlying business it is also not uncommon for \nsome contracts to take a number of years to finalise and settle, and a receivable on the balance sheet remains. The amount of \nestimated future premium that remains in insurance receivables relating to years of account that are more than three years \ndeveloped at 31 December 2022 is $29.8m (2021: $15.4m). \nd) Assessing indicators of impairment of Goodwill \nA number of estimates are used in determining the key assumptions underlying the recoverable amounts used in assessing the \nimpairment of goodwill. The key assumptions used in the preparation of future cash flows are: premium growth rates, claims \nexperience, discount rates, retention rates and expected future market conditions. Further detail is provided in note 12.\n1.4 Significant Accounting Policies\nConsolidation \na) Subsidiary undertakings \nSubsidiary undertakings are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights \nto, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the \nentity. Subsidiary companies where the Group has control are consolidated within these financial statements.\nEquity financial investments made by the parent company in subsidiary undertakings and associates are stated at cost in its \nseparate financial statements and are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying \nvalue may be impaired.\nCertain Group subsidiaries underwrite as corporate members of Lloyd’s on syndicates managed by Beazley Furlonge Limited. In \nview of the several and direct liability of underwriting members at Lloyd’s for the transactions of syndicates in which they \nparticipate, only attributable shares of transactions, assets and liabilities of those syndicates are included in the Group \nfinancial statements. The Group continues to conclude that it remains appropriate to consolidate its share of the result of these \nsyndicates and accordingly, as the Group is the sole provider of capacity on syndicates 2623, 3622 and 3623, these financial \nstatements include 100% of the economic interest in these syndicates. The Group provides 10% of the capacity on Syndicate \n4321 and these financial statements include 10% of the economic interest in this syndicate.\nFor the following syndicates to which Beazley is appointed managing agent, being syndicates 623, 6107, and 5623, for which \nthe capacity is provided entirely by third parties to the Group, these financial statements reflect Beazley’s economic interest in \nthe form of agency fees and profit commission to which it is entitled.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n168\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

Other factors may be taken \ninto consideration when determining the existence of significant influence. Investments in associates are accounted for using \nthe equity method of accounting. \nc) Intercompany balances and transactions \nAll intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are \neliminated in the Group financial statements. Transactions and balances between the Group and associates are not eliminated. \nForeign currency translation \na) Functional and presentational currency \nItems included in the financial statements of the parent and the subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary \neconomic environment in which the relevant entity operates (the functional currency). The Group financial statements are \npresented in US dollars, being the functional and presentational currency of the parent and its main trading subsidiaries, as the \nmajority of trading assets and insurance premiums are denominated in US dollars. \nb) Transactions and balances \nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using average exchange rates applicable to the period \nin which the transactions take place. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and \nfrom translation at the period end of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the \nstatement of profit or loss. Non-monetary items recorded at historical cost in foreign currencies are translated using the \nexchange rate on the date of the initial transaction. \nc) Foreign operations\nThe results and financial position of the Group companies that have a functional currency different from the Group \npresentational currency are translated into the presentational currency as follows: \n• assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate as at the statement of financial position date; \n• income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss are translated at average exchange rates for the reporting period \nwhere this is determined to be a reasonable approximation of the actual transaction rates; and \n• all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and as a separate component of equity. \nInsurance contracts \nInsurance contracts (including inwards reinsurance contracts) are defined as those containing significant insurance risk. \nInsurance risk is considered significant if, and only if, an insured event could cause Beazley to pay significant additional \nbenefits in any scenario, excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance. Such contracts remain insurance contracts until \nall rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.\nNet earned premiums\na) Premiums \nGross premiums written represent premiums on business commencing in the financial year together with adjustments to \npremiums written in previous accounting periods and estimates for premiums from contracts entered into during the course of \nthe year. Gross premiums written are stated before deduction of brokerage, taxes, duties levied on premiums and other \ndeductions. \nb) Unearned premiums \nA provision for unearned premiums (gross of reinsurance) represents that part of the gross premiums written that it is \nestimated will be earned in the following financial periods. It is calculated using the daily pro-rata method, under which the \npremium is apportioned over the period of risk. \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n169"

The proportion of acquisition costs in respect of unearned \npremiums is deferred at the reporting date and recognised in later periods when the related premiums are earned. \nClaims \nThese include the cost of claims and claims handling expenses paid during the period, together with the movements in \nprovisions for outstanding claims, claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) and claims handling provisions. The provision for \nclaims comprises amounts set aside for claims advised and IBNR, including claims handling expenses. \nThe IBNR amount is based on estimates calculated using widely accepted actuarial techniques which are reviewed quarterly by \nthe Group actuary and annually by Beazley’s independent syndicate reporting actuary. The techniques generally use projections, \nbased on past experience of the development of claims over time, to form a view on the likely ultimate claims to be \nexperienced. \nFor more recent underwriting years, attention is paid to the variations in the business portfolio accepted and the underlying \nterms and conditions. Thus, the critical assumptions used when estimating provisions are that past experience is a reasonable \npredictor of likely future claims development and that the rating and business portfolio assumptions are a fair reflection of the \nlikely level of ultimate claims to be incurred for the more recent years.\nLiability adequacy testing \nAt each reporting date, liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of the claims liabilities net of DAC and \nunearned premium reserves. In performing these tests, current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims handling \nand administration expenses, and investment income from the assets backing such liabilities are used.\nAny deficiency is immediately charged to the statement of profit or loss and subsequently by establishing a URR provision for \nlosses arising from liability adequacy tests. \nCeded reinsurance\nAny benefits to which the Group is entitled under its outwards reinsurance contracts held are recognised as reinsurance assets. \nThese assets consist of balances due from reinsurers and include reinsurers’ share of provisions for claims. These balances \nare based on calculated amounts of outstanding claims and projections for IBNR and URR, net of estimated irrecoverable \namounts, having regard to the reinsurance programme in place for the class of business, the claims experience for the period \nand the current security rating of the reinsurer involved. Reinsurance liabilities are primarily premiums payable for reinsurance \ncontracts and are recognised as an expense when a contract incepts.\nThe Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment. If there is objective evidence of impairment, then the carrying \namount is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. \nOther income\nOther income is made up of commissions received from Beazley service companies, profit commissions, managing agent’s fees \nand service fees. Profit commissions are recognised and earned as the performance obligations of the related contracts are \nmet. Commissions received from service companies and managing agent’s fees are recognised as the services are provided, \nand therefore the performance obligations of the contracts are met.\n \nDividends paid \nDividend distributions to the shareholders of the Group are recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid. \nPlant and equipment \nAll plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Depreciation is \ncalculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the assets to their residual values over their estimated useful \nlives, which vary from three to ten years. \nThe carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that \nthe carrying value may be impaired. If any such condition exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to \ndetermine the extent of impairment and the difference is charged to the statement of profit or loss. \nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n170\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

Goodwill is carried \nat cost less accumulated impairment losses.\nGoodwill has an indefinite life and is annually tested for impairment. Goodwill is allocated to each cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) \nfor the purpose of impairment testing. Goodwill is impaired when the net carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its \nrecoverable amount, being its value in use. Value in use is defined as the present value of the future cash flows expected to be \nderived from the CGU. \nb) Syndicate capacity \nThe syndicate capacity represents the cost of purchasing the Group’s participation in the combined syndicates. The capacity is \ncapitalised at cost in the statement of financial position. It has an indefinite useful life and is carried at cost less accumulated \nimpairment. It is annually tested for impairment by reference to the latest auction prices provided by Lloyd’s.\nc) Licences\nLicences have an indefinite useful life and are initially recorded at fair value. Licenses are allocated to each CGU for the \npurpose of impairment testing. Licences are annually tested for impairment and provision is made for any impairment when the \nrecoverable amount, being the higher of its value in use and fair value, is less than the carrying value. \nd) IT development costs\nCosts that are directly associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products and that are anticipated to \ngenerate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Costs include external \nconsultants’ fees, certain qualifying internal staff costs and other costs incurred to develop software programs. The Group does \nnot routinely capitalise costs relating to software products hosted in the cloud. Costs are amortised over their estimated useful \nlife, three years, on a straight-line basis and subject to impairment testing annually. Amortisation commences when the asset \nbecomes operational. Other non-qualifying costs are expensed as incurred.\ne) Renewal rights \nRenewal rights comprise future profits relating to insurance contracts acquired and the expected renewal of those contracts. \nThe costs directly attributable to acquire the renewal rights are recognised as intangible assets where they can be measured \nreliably and it is probable that they will be recovered by directly related future profits. These costs are subject to an impairment \nreview annually and are amortised on a straight-line basis, based on the estimated useful life of the assets, which is estimated \nto be between five and 10 years.\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position at such time as the Group becomes a party to the \ncontractual provisions of the financial instrument. Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, \nwhich is the date the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual \nrights to receive cash flows from the financial assets expire, or where the financial assets have been transferred, together with \nsubstantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Group’s obligations specified in \nthe contract expire, are discharged or are cancelled. \na) Financial Assets\nOn acquisition of a financial asset, the Group is required to classify the asset into one of the following categories: financial \nassets at fair value through the statement of profit or loss, loans and receivables, assets held to maturity and assets available \nfor sale. The Group does not make use of the held to maturity and available for sale categories. \nExcept for derivative financial instruments and other financial assets listed in policies (c), (e) and (f) below, all financial assets \nare designated as fair value through the statement of profit or loss upon initial recognition because they are managed and their \nperformance is evaluated on a fair value basis. Information about these financial assets is provided internally on a fair value \nbasis to the Group’s key management. The Group’s investment strategy is to invest and evaluate their performance with \nreference to their fair values.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n171"

Fair value is a market-based measure and in the absence of observable market prices in \nan active market, it is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\nThe best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price, i.e. the fair value of \nthe consideration given or received, unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable \ncurrent market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique \nwhose variables include only data from observable markets. \nWhen the transaction price provides the best evidence of fair value at initial recognition, the financial instrument is initially \nmeasured at the transaction price and any difference between this price and the value initially obtained from a valuation model \nis subsequently recognised in profit or loss depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the transaction but before \nthe valuation is supported wholly by observable market data or the transaction is closed out. \nUpon initial recognition, attributable transaction costs relating to financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are \nrecognised in the statement of profit or loss when incurred. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are continuously \nmeasured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Net changes in the fair value of \nfinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss exclude interest and dividend income, as these items are accounted for \nseparately.\nc) Loans and receivables \nLoans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active \nmarket. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost less any impairment losses. \nd) Hedge funds, equity funds and illiquid credit assets \nThe Group invests in a number of hedge funds, equity funds and illiquid credit assets for which there are no available quoted \nmarket prices. The valuation of these assets is based on fair value techniques as described in note 16. The fair value of our \nhedge fund and illiquid asset portfolio is calculated by reference to the underlying net asset values (NAVs) of each of the \nindividual funds. Consideration is also given to adjusting such NAV valuations for any restriction applied to distributions, the \nexistence of side pocket provisions and the timing of the latest available valuations. At certain times, we will have uncalled \nunfunded commitments in relation to our illiquid credit assets. These uncalled unfunded commitments are actively monitored by \nthe Group and are disclosed in the notes 2 and 16 to the financial statements. The additional investment into our illiquid credit \nasset portfolio is recognised on the date that this funding is provided by the Group.\ne)  Insurance receivables and payables \nInsurance receivables and payables are recognised when due. These include amounts due to and from agents, brokers and \ninsurance contract holders. Insurance receivables are classified as ‘loans and receivables’ as they are non-derivative financial \nassets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market. Insurance receivables are measured at \namortised cost less any impairment losses. Insurance payables are stated at amortised cost. \nf)\nOther receivables\nOther receivables categorised as loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost less any impairment losses. \ng) Investment income\nInvestment income consists of dividends, interest, realised and unrealised gains and losses and foreign exchange gains and \nlosses on financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the statement of profit or loss. Dividends on equity securities are \nrecorded as revenue on the ex-dividend date. Interest is recognised on an effective rate basis for financial assets at fair value \nthrough the statement of profit or loss. The realised gains or losses on disposal of an investment are the difference between \nthe proceeds and the original cost of the investment. Unrealised investment gains and losses represent the difference between \nthe carrying value at the reporting date, and the carrying value at the previous period end or purchase value during the period. \nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n172\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

Subsequently borrowings are stated at \namortised cost and interest is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective \ninterest method.\nFinance costs comprise interest, fees paid for the arrangement of debt and letter of credit facilities, and commissions charged \nfor the utilisation of letters of credit. These costs are recognised in the statement of profit or loss using the effective interest \nmethod. \nIn addition, finance costs include gains on the early redemption of the Group’s borrowings. These gains are recognised in the \nstatement of profit or loss, being the difference between proceeds paid plus related costs and the carrying value of the \nborrowings redeemed. \ni)\nOther payables \nOther payables are stated at amortised cost determined according to the effective interest rate method. \nj)\nHedge accounting and derivative financial instruments \nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently \nremeasured at their fair value. The best evidence of fair value of a derivative at initial recognition is the transaction price. The \nmethod of recognising the resulting fair value gains or losses depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging \ninstrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices in active \nmarkets, recent market transactions, and valuation techniques which include discounted cash flow models. All derivatives are \ncarried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative. \nDerivative assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a \nlegally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the parties intend to settle on a net basis, or realise the assets \nand settle the liability simultaneously. \nThe Group has not designated any derivatives as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges and therefore \nall fair value movements are recorded through profit or loss.\nk) Impairment of financial assets \nThe Group considers evidence of impairment for financial assets measured at amortised cost at both a specific asset and a \ncollective level. The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a specific financial asset \nmeasured at amortised cost is impaired. A financial asset is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is \nobjective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that have occurred after the initial recognition of the assets \nand that event has an impact on the estimated cash flows of the financial asset that can be reliably estimated. Assets that are \nnot individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics. \nIf there is objective evidence that impairment exists, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s \ncarrying amount and the value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest \nrate. The amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. \nIn assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical trends of the probability of default, the timing of recoveries and \nthe amount of loss incurred, adjusted for management’s judgement as to whether current economic and credit conditions are \nsuch that the actual losses are likely to be greater or lesser than those suggested by historical trends. \nl)\nCash and cash equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held at bank, cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, cash held in Lloyd’s \ntrust accounts and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which \nare subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. These investments have less than three months maturity from the date \nof acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at fair value through the profit and loss account. \nm) Unfunded commitment capital \nUnfunded committed capital arising in relation to certain financial asset investments is not shown on the statement of financial \nposition as unfunded committed capital represents a loan commitment that is scoped out of IAS 39. \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n173"

The right-of-use asset is \nsubsequently measured at amortised cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease term. The cost \nof right of use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, an estimate of any costs \nto be incurred at expiration of the lease agreements and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any \nlease incentives received. Recognised right of use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its \nestimated useful life and the lease term. Right of use assets are subject to impairment. \nThe lease term is determined as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to \nextend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is \nreasonably certain not to be exercised. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise \nthe option to renew. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or \nchange in circumstances that is within its control and affect its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew (e.g., a \nchange in business strategy).\nThe Group applies the IFRS 16 election not to recognise any amounts on the balance sheet associated with leases that are \neither deemed to be short-term, or where the underlying asset is of low-value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases \nof low-value assets are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \nEmployee benefits \na) Pension obligations \nThe Group operates a defined benefit pension plan that is closed to new entrants and future service accruals. All employees \nmay now participate in defined contribution pension arrangements, to which the Group contributes. \nA defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, \nusually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The pension costs are assessed \nusing the projected unit credit method. Under this method the costs of providing pensions are charged to the statement of profit \nor loss so as to spread the regular costs over the service lives of employees in accordance with the advice of the qualified \nactuary, who values the plans annually. The net pension obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future net \ncash flows and is stated net of plan assets. \nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets \n(excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other \ncomprehensive income. \nThe Group also determines the net interest income/expense for the period on the net defined benefit asset/liability by applying \nthe discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit \nasset/liability at the beginning of the annual period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit asset/liability \nduring the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Consequently, the net interest on the defined benefit \nasset/ liability comprises: \n• interest cost on the defined benefit obligation; \n• interest income on plan assets; and \n• interest on the effect of the asset ceiling. \nNet interest income/expense is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. \nPast service costs are recognised as an expense at the earlier of the date when a plan amendment or curtailment occurs and \nthe date when an entity recognises any termination benefits. \nFor the defined contribution plan, the Group pays contributions to a privately administered pension plan. Once the contributions \nhave been paid, the Group has no further obligations. The Group’s contributions are charged to the statement of profit or loss in \nthe period to which they relate. \nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n174\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

The \namount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market \nperformance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the \nnumber of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share based \npayment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share based payment is measured to reflect such \nconditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. \nWhen options are exercised and new shares are issued, the proceeds received, net of any transaction costs, are credited to \nshare capital (nominal value) with the excess amount going to share premium. For other plans, when no proceeds are received, \nthe nominal value of shares issued is to share capital and debited to retained earnings. When the options are exercised and \nthe shares are granted from the employee share trust, the proceeds received, net of any transaction costs, and the value of \nshares held within the trust, are credited to retained earnings. \nIncome taxes\nIncome tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the statement of \nprofit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in \nwhich case it is recognised respectively in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. \nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at \nthe year end reporting date and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior periods.\nDeferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and \nliabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected \nmanner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively \nenacted at the reporting date. \nDeferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position to the extent that it is probable that future taxable \nprofit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. \nEarnings per share \nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit or loss after tax available to shareholders by the weighted average \nnumber of ordinary shares in issue during the period. \nFor diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all \ndilutive potential ordinary shares such as share options granted to employees. Share options with performance conditions \nattaching to them have been excluded from the weighted average number of shares to the extent that these conditions have not \nbeen met at the reporting date. \nThe shares held in the employee share options plan (ESOP) and treasury shares are excluded from both the calculations, until \nsuch time as they vest unconditionally with the employees. \nProvisions and contingencies\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is \nprobable that an outflow of resources or economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of \nthe obligation can be made. Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a \nseparate asset but only when the reimbursement is most probable. \nContingent liabilities are present obligations that are not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will \nbe required to meet the liabilities or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n175"

The Group seeks insurance risks as its core business. The four key components of insurance risk \nare underwriting, reinsurance, claims management and reserving. Each element is considered below.\na) Underwriting risk\nUnderwriting risk comprises four elements that apply to all insurance products offered by the Group:\n• cycle risk – the risk that business is written without full knowledge as to the (in)adequacy of rates, terms and conditions;\n• event risk – the risk that individual risk losses or catastrophes lead to claims that are higher than anticipated in plans and \npricing;\n• pricing risk – the risk that the level of expected loss is understated in the pricing process; and\n• expense risk – the risk that the allowance for expenses and inflation in pricing is inadequate.\nThe Group’s underwriting strategy is to seek a diverse and balanced portfolio of risks in order to limit the variability of \noutcomes. This is achieved by accepting a spread of business over time, segmented between different products, geographies \nand sizes. The annual business plans for each underwriting team reflect the Group’s underwriting strategy, and set out the \nclasses of business, the territories and the industry sectors in which business is to be written which are approved by the \nappropriate Boards.\nOur underwriters determine premiums for risks written based on a range of criteria tailored specifically to each individual risk. \nThese factors include but are not limited to financial exposure, loss history, risk characteristics, limits, deductibles, terms and \nconditions and acquisition expenses depending on the type of risk. A proportion of the Group’s insurance risks are transacted \nby third parties under delegated underwriting and claims authorities. Each third party is thoroughly vetted by our coverholder \napproval group before it can bind risks, and is subject to monitoring to maintain underwriting quality and confirm ongoing \ncompliance with contractual guidelines. All underwriters also have a right to refuse renewal or change the terms and conditions \nof insurance contracts upon renewal. Rate monitoring details, including limits, deductibles, exposures, terms and conditions \nand risk characteristics are also captured and the results are combined to monitor the rating environment for each class of \nbusiness.\nThe Group also recognises that insurance events are, by their nature, random, and the actual number and size of events during \nany one year may vary from those estimated using established statistical techniques. To address this, the Group sets out the \nexposure that it is prepared to accept in certain territories to a range of events such as natural catastrophes and specific \nscenarios which may result in large industry losses. This is monitored through regular calculation of realistic disaster scenarios \n(RDSs). The aggregate position is monitored at the time of underwriting a risk, and reports are regularly produced to highlight \nthe key aggregations to which the Group is exposed.\nThe Group uses a number of modelling tools to monitor its exposures against the agreed risk appetite set and to simulate \ncatastrophe losses in order to measure the effectiveness of its reinsurance programmes. Stress and scenario tests are also \nrun using these models. The range of scenarios considered includes natural catastrophe, cyber, marine, liability, political, \nterrorism and war events.\nOne of the largest types of event exposure relates to natural catastrophe events such as windstorm or earthquake. With the \nincreasing risk from climate change impacts the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes, the Group continues to monitor \nits exposure. Where possible the Group measures geographic accumulations and uses its knowledge of the business, historical \nloss behaviour and commercial catastrophe modelling software to assess the expected range of losses at different return \nperiods. Upon application of the reinsurance coverage purchased, the key gross and net exposures are calculated on the basis \nof extreme events at a range of return periods.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n176\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

Net of reinsurance exposures for \nthe Los Angeles quake scenario have increased by less than 1% in 2022, whereas gross exposures have reduced by 6%.

The US Northeast windstorm scenario \nhas increased by 3% gross and 11% net, with the increase in gross being driven by an increase in exposure in Contingency, and \nthe net increasing across both Contingency & Property Risks. Windstorm exposures have increased in the Gulf of Mexico during \n2022, which has resulted in the Gulf of Mexico scenario replacing the San Francisco quake scenario as one of the three largest \nnet scenarios for 2022. The net natural catastrophe risk appetite reduced by 16% in 2022 to $438.0m from $520.0m in 2021, \nwith the reduction in appetite coming from the Property Risks division.\nThe net exposure of the Group to each of these modelled events at a given point in time is a function of assumptions made \nabout how and where the event occurs, its magnitude, the amount of business written that is exposed to each event and the \nreinsurance arrangements in place.\nThe Group also has exposure to man-made claim aggregations, such as those arising from terrorism, liability, and cyber events. \nBeazley chooses to underwrite cyber insurance within the Cyber Risks and Specialty Risks divisions using our team of specialist \nunderwriters, claims managers and data breach services managers. Other than for affirmative cyber coverage, Beazley’s \npreference is to exclude cyber exposure where possible.\nTo manage the potential exposure, The Board has approved a risk budget for the aggregation of cyber related claims which is \nmonitored by reference to the largest of seventeen realistic disaster scenarios that have been developed internally. These \nscenarios include the failure of a data aggregator, the failure of a shared hardware or software platform, the failure of a cloud \nprovider & physical damage scenarios. Whilst it is not possible to be precise, as there is sparse data on actual aggregated \nevents, these severe scenarios are expected to be very infrequent. To manage underwriting exposures, the Group has \ndeveloped limits of authority and business plans which are binding upon all staff authorised to underwrite and are specific to \nunderwriters, classes of business and industry. In 2022, the maximum line that any one underwriter could commit the managed \nsyndicates to was $150m. In most cases, maximum lines for classes of business were much lower than this.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n177"

Failure of a \nreinsurer to pay a valid claim is considered a credit risk which is detailed in the credit risk section on page 183. In some cases \nthe Group deems it more economic to hold capital than purchase reinsurance. These decisions are regularly reviewed.\nThe reinsurance security committee examines and approves all reinsurers to ensure that they possess suitable security.\nThe Group’s ceded reinsurance team ensures that these guidelines are followed, undertakes the administration of reinsurance\ncontracts and monitors and instigates our responses to any erosion of the reinsurance programmes.\nc) Claims management risk\nClaims management risk may arise within the Group in the event of inaccurate or incomplete case reserves and claims \nsettlements, poor service quality or excessive claims handling costs. These risks may damage the Group brand and undermine \nits ability to win and retain business, or incur punitive damages. These risks can occur at any stage of the claims life cycle. The \nGroup’s claims teams are focused on delivering quality, reliability and speed of service to both internal and external clients. \nTheir aim is to adjust and process claims in a fair, efficient and timely manner, in accordance with the policy’s terms and \nconditions, the regulatory environment, and the business’s broader interests. Case reserves are set for all known claims \nliabilities, including provisions for expenses, as soon as a reliable estimate can be made of the claims liability.\nd) Reserving and ultimate reserves risk\nReserving and ultimate reserves risk occurs within the Group where established insurance liabilities are insufficient through \ninaccurate forecasting, or where there is inadequate allowance for expenses and reinsurance bad debts in provisions.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n178\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "2 Risk management continued\nTo manage reserving and ultimate reserves risk, our actuarial team uses a range of recognised techniques to project gross \npremiums written, monitor claims development patterns and stress-test ultimate insurance liability balances. The Group aims to \nhold reserves within a range of 5-10% above the actuarial estimates, which themselves include some margin for uncertainty.\nThe objective of the Group’s reserving policy is to produce accurate and reliable estimates that are consistent over time and \nacross classes of business. The estimates of gross premiums written and claims prepared by the actuarial department are \nused through a formal quarterly peer review process to independently test the integrity of the estimates produced by the \nunderwriting teams for each class of business. These meetings are attended by senior management, senior underwriters, and \nactuarial, claims, and finance representatives.\n2.2 Market risk\nMarket risk (known as asset risk in the Group’s risk management framework) arises from adverse financial market movements \nof values of investments, interest rates, exchange rates, or external market forces. Efficient management of market risk is key \nto the investment of Group assets for matching to future liabilities. Appropriate levels of investment risk are determined by \nlimiting the proportion of forecast Group earnings which could be at risk from lower than expected investment returns, using a 1 \nin 10 confidence level as a practical measure of such risk. In 2022, this permitted variance from the forecast investment return \nwas set at † $200m. For 2023, the permitted variance is likely to be modestly increased due to the higher level of investment \nassets. Investment strategy is developed to be consistent with this limit and investment risk is monitored on an ongoing basis, \nusing outputs from our internal model.\nChanges in interest rates also impact the present values of estimated Group liabilities, which are used for solvency and capital \ncalculations. The four key components of asset risk are foreign exchange, interest rate, prices of assets and derivatives and \ninvestment. Each element is in more detail considered below.\na) Foreign exchange risk\nThe functional currency of Beazley plc and its main trading entities is US dollars and the presentational currency in which the \nGroup reports its consolidated results is US dollars. The effect of this on foreign exchange risk is that the Group is mainly \nexposed to fluctuations in exchange rates for non-dollar denominated transactions and to net asset translation risk on non-\ndollar functional currency entities.\nThe Group operates in four main currencies: US dollars, sterling, Canadian dollars and euros. Transactions in all currencies are \nconverted to US dollars on initial recognition with any resulting monetary items being translated to the US dollar spot rate at the \nreporting date. If any foreign exchange risk arises it is actively managed as described below.\nIn 2022, the Group managed its foreign exchange risk by periodically assessing its non-dollar exposures and hedging these to a \ntolerable level while targeting to have net assets that are predominantly denominated in US dollar. As part of this hedging \nstrategy, exchange rate derivatives were used to rebalance currency exposure across the Group. Details of foreign currency \nderivative contracts entered into with external parties are disclosed in note 17. On a forward looking basis an assessment is \nmade of expected future exposure development and appropriate currency trades put in place to reduce risk.\nThe Group’s underwriting capital is matched by currency to the principal underlying currencies of its written premiums. This \nhelps to mitigate the risk that the Group’s capital required to underwrite business is materially affected by any future \nmovements in exchange rates.\nThe Group also has foreign operations with functional currencies that are different from the Group’s presentational currency. \nThe effect of this on foreign exchange risk is that the Group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates for US dollar \ndenominated transactions and net assets arising in those foreign currency operations. It also gives rise to a currency \ntranslation exposure for the Group to sterling, euro, Canadian dollars, Singapore dollars and Australian dollars on translation to \nthe Group’s presentational currency. These exposures are minimal and are not hedged.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n179"

The investment committee monitors the duration of these assets on a regular basis.\nThe Group also entered into bond futures contracts to manage the interest rate risk on bond portfolios.\nThe following table shows the modified duration at the reporting date of the financial instruments that are exposed to \nmovements in market interest rates. Modified duration is a commonly used measure of volatility which represents the \npercentage change of the price of a security to yield. The Group believes gives a better indication than maturity of the likely \nsensitivity of the portfolio to changes in interest rates.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n180\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

This is referred to as price risk.\nFinancial assets include fixed and floating rate debt securities, syndicate loans, hedge funds, illiquid credit assets, equity \ninvestments and derivative financial assets. The price of debt securities is affected by interest rate risk, as described above, \nand also by issuer’s credit risk. The sensitivity to price risk that relates to the Group’s hedge fund, syndicate loans, illiquid \ncredit and equity investments is presented below.\nListed investments that are quoted in an active market are recognised in the statement of financial position at quoted bid price, \nwhich is deemed to be approximate exit price. If the market for the investment is not considered to be active, then the Group \nestablishes fair value using valuation techniques (refer to note 16). This includes comparison of orderly transactions between \nmarket participants, reference to the current fair value of other investments that are substantially the same, discounted cash \nflow models and other valuation techniques that are commonly used by market participants.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n181"

Managing \nthe Group’s exposures to these risks is an intrinsic part of the investment strategy. Beazley uses an Economic Scenario \nGenerator to simulate multiple simulations of financial conditions, to support stochastic analysis of asset risk. Beazley uses \nthese outputs to assess the value at risk (VAR) of its investments, at different confidence levels, including ‘1 in 200’, which \nreflects Solvency II modelling requirements, and ‘1 in 10’, reflecting scenarios which are more likely to occur in practice. It is \nassessed for investments in isolation and also in conjunction with the present value of our liabilities, to help us monitor and \nmanage asset risk for solvency and capital purposes. By its nature, stochastic modelling does not provide a precise measure of \nrisk, and Economic Scenario Generator outputs are regularly validated against actual market conditions, and Beazley also uses \na number of other, qualitative measures to support the monitoring and management of investment risk. These include stress \ntesting and scenario analysis.\nBeazley’s investment strategy is developed by reference to an investment risk budget, approved annually by The Board. The \nSolvency II internal model is used to monitor compliance with the budget, which limits the amount by which our reported annual \ninvestment return may deviate from a predetermined target, at the 1 in 10 confidence level. In 2022, this permitted deviation \nwas set at † $200m. Additionally, a limit is specified for the net interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities combined and \ninvestments are managed to ensure that this limit is not exceeded.\n2.3 Credit risk\nThe risk arises when failure of another party to perform its financial or contractual obligations to the Group in a timely manner. \nThe Group accepts credit risk overall and recognizes credit risk is aligned to its appetite for insurance risk. The primary sources \nof credit risk for the Group are:\n• reinsurers – reinsurers may fail to pay valid claims against a reinsurance contract held by the Group;\n• brokers and coverholders – counterparties fail to pass on premiums or claims collected or paid on behalf of the Group;\n• investments – issuer default results in the Group losing all or part of the value of a financial instrument or a derivative \nfinancial instrument; and\n• cash and cash equivalents.\nAn approval system also exists for brokers with their credit and performance monitored. The investment committee has \nestablished parameters for investment managers regarding the type, duration and quality of investments including credit ratings \nacceptable to the Group. The performance of investment managers is regularly reviewed to confirm adherence to these \nguidelines. The Group has developed processes to examine all reinsurers before entering into new business arrangements and \nthey receive periodic review of their continued relationship with Beazley. Reinsurance recoverables are reviewed regularly to \nassess their collectability.\nTo assist in the understanding of credit risks, A.M. Best, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s (S&P) ratings are used. These ratings \nhave been categorised below as used for Lloyd’s reporting:\nA.M. Best\nMoody’s\nS&P\nTier 1\nA++ to A-\nAaa to A3\nAAA to A- \nTier 2\nB++ to B-\nBaa1 to Ba3\nBBB+ to BB- \nTier 3\nC++ to C-\nB1 to Caa\nB+ to CCC\nTier 4\nD, E, F, S\nCa to C\nR, (U,S) 3\nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n182\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

Additionally, insurance receivables are classified \nas unrated, due to premium debtors not being credit rated with the exception of the CRI accrual element. At 31 December \n2022, no cash and cash equivalents fell within the unrated category (2021: $1.8m). This was due to the Group transacting with \na bank in the US that did not have an external credit rating. Additionally the reinsurance share of unearned premium provision is \nclassified as unrated.\nInsurance receivables and other receivables balances held by the Group have not been impaired, based on all evidence \navailable, and no impairment provision has been recognised in respect of these assets. Insurance receivables in respect of \ncoverholder business are credit controlled by third-party managers. We monitor third party coverholders’ performance and their \nfinancial processes. These assets are individually impaired after considering information such as the occurrence of significant \nchanges in the counterparties’ financial position, patterns of historical payment information and disputes with counterparties. \nAn analysis of the overall credit risk exposure indicates that the Group has reinsurance assets that are impaired at the \nreporting date.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n183"

This \n$17.3m provision in respect of overdue reinsurance recoverables is included within the total provision of $29.3m shown in the \ntable at the top of the page.\nThe Group believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due more than 30 days are still collectable in full, based on \nhistoric payment behaviour and analyses of credit risk.\n2.4 Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk arises where cash may not be available to pay obligations. The Group is exposed to daily calls on its available \ncash resources, principally from claims arising from its insurance business which is an industry norm. In the majority of the \ncases, these claims are settled from the premiums received held as assets. Beazley avoids the risk of having insufficient liquid \nassets to meet expected cash flow requirements.\nThe Group’s approach is to manage its liquidity position so that it can reasonably survive a significant individual or market loss \nevent (details of the Group’s exposure to realistic disaster scenarios are provided on pages 177 to 179. This means that the \nGroup maintains sufficient liquid assets, or assets that can be converted into liquid assets at short notice and without any \nsignificant capital loss, to meet expected cash flow requirements. These liquid funds are regularly monitored using cash flow \nforecasting to ensure that surplus funds are invested to achieve a higher rate of return. The Group also makes use of loan \nfacilities and borrowings, details of which can be found in note 25. Further information on the Group’s capital resources is \ncontained on pages 64 to 66.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n184\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

This is \nbased on the Group’s own individual capital assessment. It may be provided in the form of either the Group’s cash, \ninvestments, debt facilities, or letter of credit;\n• to support underwriting in Beazley Insurance Company, Inc., Beazley America Insurance Company, Inc., and Beazley NewCo \nCaptive Company, Inc. in the US;\n• to support underwriting in Beazley Insurance dac in Europe; and\n• to support strategic acquisitions and investments.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n186\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "2 Risk management continued\nAll entities within the Group have been in compliance with externally imposed capital requirements during the year. \nThe Group uses letters of credit (LOC) available under a syndicated short term banking facility led by Lloyds Banking Group plc \nto support Funds at Lloyd’s (FAL) requirements. Lloyd’s of London apply certain criteria to banks issuing LOCs as FAL, including \nminimum credit rating requirements and counterparty limits. Should any of the banks on the existing LOC facility breach Lloyd’s \nof London requirements, the Group might be asked to replace the LOC provided with alternative eligible issuer(s) and/or assets \nmeeting Lloyd’s requirements. The creditworthiness of the counterparties on the facility is monitored by the Group on an \nongoing basis.\nThe Group considers Shareholders' Funds, Tier 2 subordinated debt and letters of credit to be the primary sources of capital for \nthe Group. For more detail on the value of capital managed and how its value has changed in the year, please see pages 64 to \n66.\nThe Internal Model Solvency Capital Requirement is a dedicated quantitative review of syndicate models and it sets outs to be a \nkey input to the Lloyd’s Internal Model.\nThe Board operates a progressive dividend strategy, intending to grow the dividend each year but recognising that some \nearnings fluctuations are to be expected. When determining the level of the dividend, The Board considers the Group's capital \nposition, future investment and growth opportunities and our ability to generate cash flows. Dividends are typically paid on an \nannual basis to align with the Group's capital planning cycle. Our capital management strategy is to carry some surplus capital \nto enable us to take advantage of growth opportunities which may arise. At 31 December 2022, we have surplus capital of 44% \nof ECR (on a Solvency II basis), above our preferred target range of 15% to 25% of ECR. The capital base has been \nstrengthened following the recent equity raise to enable us to continue to pursue our sustainable long-term growth strategy, \nparticularly in opportunities identified in Property Risks.\n2.6 Company risk\nThe Group’s parent company is exposed to the same interest rate and liquidity risk exposure experienced on its mutual \nborrowings with the Group. The Group’s exposure can be seen in sections 2.3b and 2.7.

This tax rate change to 25% will increase the Group’s future current tax charge. It was reflected in the calculation of the deferred tax balances as at \n31 December 2021 for relevant temporary differences expected to reverse on or after 1 April 2023.\nThe Tax Act (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) was signed into law in the US in December 2017. The Tax Act includes base erosion \nanti-avoidance tax provisions (the ‘BEAT’). We have performed an assessment for our intra-group transactions potentially in \nscope of BEAT. The application of this new BEAT legislation is still uncertain for some types of transaction and we are keeping \ndevelopments under review. With support from external advisors, we believe that the BEAT impact on the Group is not \nsignificant. No amount has been provided for BEAT liabilities in these financial statements (2021: nil). The ultimate outcome \nmay differ and if any additional amounts did fall within the scope of the BEAT, incremental tax at 10% might arise on some or all \nof those amounts. \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n193"

It is estimated by discounting future cash flows sourced from financial budgets approved by \nmanagement which cover specific estimates for a five year period. The key assumptions used in the preparation of future cash \nflows are: premium growth rates,combined ratios, retention rates and expected future market conditions.\nA discount rate, based on weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 10.9% (2021: 9%) has been applied to projected future \ncash flows. This has been calculated using independent measures of the risk-free rate of return and is indicative of the Group’s \nrisk profile relative to the market. The impairment test for goodwill confirms that no impairment is required.\nThe Group has taken the following measures to ensure that the key assumptions used in deriving value in use for each CGU \nconsiders the potential adverse effects of these potential changes in economic and regulatory environments:\n• Projected combined ratio – The Group has used projected combined ratios consistent with its five year financial budgets. \nSensitivity testing (a 5% increase in combined ratio for all classes and all years) has been performed to model the impact of \nreasonably possible changes in combined ratio to our base case impairment analysis and headroom. Within these ranges, \nthe recoverable amounts remain supportable.\n• Future market conditions – to test the segment’s sensitivity to variances (including those caused by the factors listed above) \nfrom forecast profits, the discount rate has been flexed to 5% above and 5% below the central assumption. Within this range, \nthe recovery of goodwill was stress tested and remains supportable across all CGUs. Headroom was calculated in respect of \nthe value in use of all the Group’s other intangible assets.\n• Premium growth rates/Retention rates – The Group has used a terminal growth rate of 0% (2021: 0%) to extrapolate \nprojections beyond the covered five year period.\nThe Group’s intangible assets relating to syndicate capacity is allocated across all CGUs. The fair value of syndicate capacity \ncan be determined from the latest Lloyd's of London capacity auctions. Based upon the latest market prices, management \nconcludes that the fair value exceeds the carrying amount and as such no impairment is necessary.\nUS insurance authorisation licences represent the privilege to write insurance business in particular states in the US. Licences \nare allocated to the relevant CGU. There is no active market for licences, therefore the recoverable amount is deemed to be the \nfair value. As described above, a WACC discount rate applied to projected future cash flows sourced from management \napproved budgets. Key assumptions are the same as those outlined above. Based upon all available evidence the results of \nthe testing indicate that no impairment is required.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n196\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

Level 2 \ninputs include: \n• Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; \n• Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price \nquotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly; \n• Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (for example, interest rates and yield curves \nobservable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities and credit spreads); and \n• Market corroborated inputs. Included within level 2 are government bonds and treasury bills, equity funds and corporate \nbonds which are not actively traded, hedge funds and senior secured loans.\nLevel 3 – Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable or for which there is limited market activity against which to \nmeasure fair value. The availability of financial data can vary for different financial assets and is affected by a wide variety of \nfactors, including the type of financial instrument, whether it is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other \ncharacteristics specific to each transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are unobservable in \nthe market, the determination of fair value requires more judgement. Accordingly the degree of judgement exercised by \nmanagement in determining fair value is greatest for instruments classified in level 3. The Group uses prices and inputs that \nare current as of the measurement date for valuation of these instruments. \nOur valuation approach for fair value assets and liabilities classified as level 2:\na) For the Group’s level 2 debt securities, our fund administrator obtains the prices used in the valuation from independent \npricing vendors. The independent pricing vendors derive an evaluated price from observable market inputs. These inputs are \nverified in their pricing assumptions such as weighted average life, discount margins, default rates, and recovery and \nprepayments assumptions for mortgage securities. \n \nb) For our hedge funds , the pricing and valuation of each fund is undertaken by administrators in accordance with each \nunderlying fund’s valuation policy. Individual fund prices are communicated by the administrators to all investors via the monthly \ninvestor statements. The fair value of the hedge fund portfolios are calculated by reference to the underlying net asset values of \neach of the individual funds. \nc) Subordinated debt and tier 2 subordinated debt fair value are based on quoted market prices. \nOur valuation approach for fair value assets and liabilities classified as level 3:\na) Our illiquid credit fund investments are managed by third party managers (generally closed ended limited partnerships or \nopen ended funds). While the funds provide full transparency on their underlying investments, the investments themselves are \npredominantly in private and unquoted instruments. The valuation techniques used by the fund managers to establish the fair \nvalue of the underlying private/unquoted investments may incorporate discounted cash flow models or a more market-based \napproach, whilst the main inputs might include discount rates, fundamental pricing multiples, recent transaction prices, or \ncomparable market information to create a benchmark multiple. \nb) The syndicate loans are loans provided by our Group syndicates to the Central Fund at Lloyd’s in respect of the 2019 and \n2020 underwriting years. These instruments are not tradeable and are valued using discounted cash flow models, designed to \nappropriately reflect the credit and illiquidity risk of the instruments. \nThere were no changes in the valuation techniques during the year compared to those described in the Group's 2021 Annual \nReport and Accounts. \n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n201"

This structure involved the issue of ordinary and preference shares \nby Cash Box to one of the investment banks advising the company in respect of the equity raise. These preference and ordinary \nshares were subsequently acquired by the company and the preference shares were redeemed by Cash Box. The acquisition by \nthe company of the ordinary shares in Cash Box held by the investment bank resulted in the company securing over 90% of the \nequity share capital of Cash Box. The company was therefore able to rely on Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, which \nprovides relief from the requirements under Section 610 of the Companies Act 2006 to create a share premium account. \nTherefore, no share premium was recorded in relation to the Placing shares.\nThe premium over the nominal value of the Placing shares was credited to a merger reserve and subsequently recognised in \nretained earnings. The merger reserve created was determined to be distributable for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006. \nCertain Directors of the company participated in the equity raise via the Placing Shares and the 26,086 Subscription Shares.\nRetail investors were able to participate in the equity raise on the same terms as institutional investors via the retail offer, \nwhich was hosted on the PrimaryBid platform.

The \nbasic technique involves the analysis of historical claims development factors and the selection of estimated development \nfactors based on historical patterns. The selected development factors are then applied to cumulative claims data for each \nunderwriting year that is not yet fully developed to produce an estimated ultimate claims cost for each underwriting year.\nChain-ladder techniques are most appropriate for classes of business that have a relatively stable development pattern. Chain-\nladder techniques are less suitable in cases in which the insurer does not have a developed claims history for a particular class \nof business, or for underwriting years that are still at immature stages of development where there is a higher level of \nassumption volatility.\nThe Bornhuetter-Ferguson method uses a combination of a benchmark/market-based estimate and an estimate based on \nclaims experience. The former is based on a measure of exposure such as premiums; the latter is based on the paid or \nincurred claims observed to date. The two estimates are combined using a formula that gives more weight to the experience-\nbased estimate as time passes. This technique has been used in situations where developed claims experience was not \navailable for the projection (e.g. recent underwriting years or new classes of business).\nThe expected loss ratio method uses a benchmark/market-based estimate applied to the expected premium and is used for \nclasses with little or no relevant historical data.\nThe choice of selected results for each underwriting year of each class of business depends on an assessment of the \ntechnique that has been most appropriate to observed historical developments. In certain instances, this has meant that \ndifferent techniques or combinations of techniques have been selected for individual underwriting years or groups of \nunderwriting years within the same class of business. As such, there are many assumptions used to estimate general \ninsurance liabilities.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n213"

      "text": "24 Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets continued\nWe also review triangulations of the paid/outstanding claim ratios as a way of monitoring any changes in the strength of the \noutstanding claim estimates between underwriting years so that adjustments can be made to mitigate any subsequent over/\n(under) reserving. To date, this analysis indicates no systematic change to the outstanding claim strength across underwriting \nyears.\nWhere significant large losses impact an underwriting year (e.g. first-party COVID-19 losses, the events of 11 September 2001, \nthe hurricanes in 2004, 2005, 2008, 2012, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the typhoons in 2018 and 2019, or the earthquakes in \n2010, 2011 and 2017), the development is usually very different from the attritional losses. In these situations, the large loss \ntotal is extracted from the remainder of the data and analysed separately by the respective claims managers using exposure \nanalysis of the policies in force in the areas affected.\nFurther assumptions are required to convert gross of reinsurance estimates of ultimate claims cost to a net of reinsurance level \nand to establish reserves for unallocated claims handling expenses and reinsurance bad debt.\nb) Major assumptions\nThe main assumption underlying these techniques is that the Group’s past claims development experience (with appropriate \nadjustments for known changes) can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs. As such \nthese methods extrapolate the development of premiums, paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim \nnumbers for each underwriting year based on the observed development of earlier years.\nAnother assumption used within insurance liabilities is the estimation of an unexpired risk reserve (URR) for the expected value \nof net claims and expenses attributable to the unexpired periods of policies in force at the balance sheet date which exceeds \nthe unearned premium reserve.\nThroughout, judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may or may not apply in the future; for example, to \nreflect changes in external or market factors such as economic conditions, public attitudes to claiming, levels of claims \ninflation, premium rate changes, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy \nconditions and claims handling procedures.\nc) Changes in assumptions\nAs already discussed, general insurance business requires many different assumptions. The diagram below illustrates the main \ncategories of assumptions used for each underwriting year and class combination.\nFurther information on the calculation of loss reserves and the risks associated with them is provided in the risk disclosures \nsection in note 2. The risks associated with general insurance contracts are complex and do not readily lend themselves to \nmeaningful sensitivity analysis. Given the range of assumptions used, the Group’s profit or loss is relatively insensitive to \nchanges to an individual assumption used for an underwriting year/class combination.\nThe Group’s profit or loss is potentially more sensitive to a systematic change in assumptions that affect many classes, such \nas judicial changes or when catastrophes produce more claims than expected. The impact of an unreported event could lead to \na significant increase in the Group’s loss reserves. The Group believes that the loss reserves established are adequate, \nhowever a 20% increase in estimated losses would lead to a $1,476.5m (2021: $1,279.8m) increase in gross loss reserves \nand a $979.0m (2021: $913.9m) increase in net loss reserves. The Group uses a range of risk mitigation strategies to reduce \nsuch volatility including the purchase of reinsurance. In addition, the Group holds capital to absorb volatility.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n214\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "24 Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets continued \nd) Claims reserve strength analysis\nThe estimation of IBNR reserves for future claim notifications is subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than the estimation \nof the outstanding claims already notified. This is particularly true for the Specialty Risk business, which will typically display \ngreater variations between initial estimates and final outcomes as a result of the greater degree of difficulty in estimating these \nreserves. The estimation of IBNR reserves for other business written is generally subject to less variability as claims are \ngenerally reported and settled relatively quickly.\nAs such, our reserving assumptions contain a reasonable margin for prudence given the uncertainties inherent in the insurance \nbusiness underwritten, particularly on the longer tailed Specialty Risk classes.\nSince year end 2004, we have identified a range of possible outcomes for each class and underwriting year combination directly \nfrom our internal model (previously our individual capital assessment (ICA)) process. Comparing these with our pricing \nassumptions and reserving estimates gives our management team increased insight into our perceived reserving strength and \nthe relative uncertainties of the business written.\nTo illustrate the robustness of our reserves, the loss development tables below provide information about historical claims \ndevelopment by the five segments – Cyber Risks, Digital, MAP Risks, Property Risks and Specialty Risks. The tables are by \nunderwriting year which in our view provides the most transparent reserving basis. We have supplied tables for both ultimate \ngross claims and ultimate net claims.\nThe top part of the table illustrates how the Group’s estimate of the claims ratio for each underwriting year has changed at \nsuccessive year ends. The bottom half of the table reconciles the gross and net claims to the amount appearing in the \nstatement of financial position.\nWhile the information in the table provides a historical perspective on the adequacy of the claims liabilities established in \nprevious years, users of these financial statements are cautioned against extrapolating past redundancies or deficiencies on \ncurrent claims liabilities. The Group believes that the estimate of total claims liabilities as at 31 December 2022 is adequate. \nHowever, due to inherent uncertainties in the reserving process, it cannot be assured that such balances will ultimately prove to \nbe adequate.\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n215"

      "text": "24 Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets continued\nProperty Risks\nFavourable developments on attritional claims and established catastrophe events have led to releases on the 2019 and 2020 \nunderwriting years. The 2021 underwriting year has been impacted by weather related events in the US during 2022. The \nimpact is less gross of reinsurance due to favourable developments on established catastrophe events. \nSpecialty Risks\nThe 2017 and 2018 underwriting years have seen adverse claims development gross of reinsurance predominantly driven by \nthe healthcare book. Both these years are recovering under aggregate excess of loss reinsurance programmes, so the impact is \nlower net of reinsurance. Recent underwriting years continue to improve as the risk expires.\nClaim releases\nThe below table analyses our net claims between current year claims and adjustments to prior year net claims reserves. These \nhave been broken down by segment and underwriting year. Beazley’s reserving policy is to maintain catastrophe reserve \nmargins either until the end of the exposure period or until catastrophe events occur. Therefore margins have been released \nfrom prior year reserves where risks have expired during 2022.\nThe below table has been prepared on an underwriting year of account basis, whereas the net loss development tables on \npages 219 to 220 have been prepared on an accident year basis in relation to our US admitted business. However, in \naggregate the net release or strengthening is consistent.\nReserve releases during the year totalled $132.6m (2021: $209.8m). The net of reinsurance estimates of ultimate claims \ncosts have improved on the 2021, 2020 and 2019 and earlier underwriting years, with releases of $13.3m, $96.6m and \n$22.7m respectively. Our MAP Risks division saw strong releases across all years of account, while the other four divisions \neach saw a strengthening on one of the years of account.

The scheme provides the following benefits:\n• an annual pension payable to the member from his or her normal pension age (60th birthday) of generally 1/60th of final \npensionable salary for each year of pensionable service up to 31 March 2006;\n• a spouse’s pension of 2/3rds of the member’s pension payable on the member’s death after retirement;\n• a lump sum of four times current pensionable salary for death in service at the date of death; and\n• a pension of 2/3rds of the member’s prospective pension at the date of death, payable to the spouse until their death. This \npension is related to salary at the date of death.\nThe scheme is administered by a trust that is legally separated from the Group. The trustees consist of both employee and \nemployer representatives and an independent chair, all of whom are governed by the scheme rules.\nDuring 2022, the pension scheme trustees completed a transaction that insures all of the scheme's liabilities to a third party \nvia a bulk annuity buy-in with an external insurance company. The buy-in covers all members of the scheme and preserves their \nexisting pension entitlements. The annuity contracts meet the criteria to be classified as qualifying insurance policies as \ndefined in IAS 19 as the cash flows match the timing and value of the benefits payable to members that they cover. These \nannuities are thus valued at the present value of the obligations insured. \nThe pension scheme trustees and the company will consider in due course whether to move to a full buy-out of the plan, \nwhereby the buy-in policies held by the plan will be converted to individual annuity policies which will be issued to scheme \nmembers. This is a separate decision for the trustees and the company and whilst the buy-in policy allows for such a buy-out to \nhappen, this is not a requirement. At the reporting date, the trustees and the company retain all obligations to ensure benefits \ndue to scheme members are paid.\nThe purchase of these annuities has not been treated as a settlement, and the difference between the purchase price of the \nannuities and their carrying value has been recognised in Other comprehensive income on the revaluation of plan assets, which \nalso includes any valuation movements during the year before the buy-in transaction completed.\nHistorically the scheme exposed the Group to additional actuarial, interest rate and market risk. However as a result of the buy-\nin transaction in December these risks are now born by the insurance company to which liabilities have been insured. The buy-in \ntransaction does expose the Group to additional credit risk with regard to the insurance company from whom the annuities were \npurchased.\nContributions to the scheme are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method as set out in the \nscheme rules and the most recent valuation was at 31 December 2022. Following the buy-in transaction the Group expects to \nmake no further contributions to the scheme.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\n \n222\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\nwww.beazley.com"

      "text": "27 Retirement benefit obligations continued\nTrustees obligations\nUnder section 222 of the Pension Act 2004, every scheme is subject to the Statutory Funding Objective (SFO), which is to have \nsufficient and appropriate assets to cover its technical provisions, which represent the present value of benefits to which \nmembers are entitled based on pensionable service to the valuation date. This is assessed at least every three years using \nassumptions agreed between the Trustees and the employer as set out in the Statement of Funding Principles produced in \naccordance with the Occupational Pensions (Scheme Funding) Regulations 2005 (OP(SF)R 2005) Regulation 6.\nThe Trustees written Statement of Funding Principles is dated 29 January 2021 and it sets out their policy for securing that the \nSFO is met (that the scheme will have sufficient assets to cover its technical provisions). In accordance with the OP(SF)R 2005 \nRegulation 5(2) trustees have chosen the Defined Accrued Benefit Method, a variant of the projected unit credit method where \naccrual has ceased.\nThe most recently completed Actuarial Valuation of the Scheme was carried out at 1 January 2020 including a valuation carried \nout in accordance with the Pensions Protection Fund (Valuation) Regulations 2005 and with appropriate section 179 guidance \nand assumptions issued by The Board of the Pension Protection Fund.\nDuring 2021 a decision was made to move the plan assets out of equities and to reinvest in quoted corporate bonds and index \nlinked securities. The rationale for this was to protect the scheme’s funding position and provide protection against movements \nin interest rates and expected inflation. Following the buy-in transaction, the main class of plan assets is the purchased annuity \ncontracts. During the year, the scheme had no exposure to liability driven investment products (2021: nil).\nThe Trust Deed provides Beazley with an unconditional right to a refund of surplus assets assuming the full settlement of plan \nliabilities in the event of a plan wind-up. Furthermore, in the ordinary course of business the Trustee has no rights to unilaterally \nwind up, or otherwise augment the benefits due to members of, the scheme. Based on these rights, any net surplus in the UK \nscheme is recognised in full.\n2022\n2021\n$m\n$m\nMovement in present value of funded obligations recognised in the statement of financial position\nBalance at 1 January\n56.9\n64.8\nInterest cost\n1.0\n0.8\nActuarial (gain) due to changes in financial assumptions\n(22.1)\n(4.0)\nBenefits paid\n(0.5)\n(2.8)\nForeign exchange (gain)\n(4.2)\n(1.9)\nBalance at 31 December\n31.1\n56.9\n2022\n2021\n$m\n$m\nMovement in fair value of plan assets recognised in the statement of financial position\nBalance at 1 January\n75.0\n69.6\nExpected return on plan assets\n1.3\n0.9\n(Loss)/gain on asset return\n(34.6)\n8.1\nEmployer contributions\n–\n1.3\nBenefits paid\n(0.5)\n(2.8)\nForeign exchange (loss)\n(5.5)\n(2.1)\nBalance at 31 December\n35.7\n75.0\nPlan assets are comprised as follows:\nPurchased annuities\n31.1\n–\nCorporate bonds\n–\n3.4\nIndex linked securities\n–\n70.0\nCash\n4.6\n1.6\nTotal\n35.7\n75.0\n \nwww.beazley.com\nBeazley | Annual report 2022\n223"
