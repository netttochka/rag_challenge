      "text": "Chairman’s statement\nThese commitments underpin our determination \nto build modern, sustainable, and safe living \nand working environments in the communities \nin which we operate. We recognise our \nresponsibility, as a leading industry player, to \nsupport the construction industry in taking \nmeaningful steps to protect the environment \nand reduce carbon emissions. \nThe Board was pleased to approve the Group’s \nrefreshed sustainability policy during the year \nwhich sets out the actions being taken to \nachieve net zero carbon by 2035 and zero  \nSIG waste to landfill by 2025. The policy also \nsupports our commitment to ensuring our \nemployees feel safe, valued, and proud to  \nwork for us.\nFurther information on our progress can  \nbe found on pages 26 to 54.\nGroup performance\n2022 LFL sales growth was strong at 17% \nwith high levels of price inflation providing a \nsubstantial tailwind to the reported level of \ngrowth throughout the year. Volume growth \nwas broadly flat with gains in market share \noffsetting declines in some of our end-markets, \nnotably in the second half of the year.\nWe reported an underlying operating profit of \n£80.2m, a £38.8m increase compared with \n2021 (2021: £41.4m), and an underlying profit \nbefore tax of £51.6m (2021: £19.3m). This led \nto an increase in underlying earnings per share \nfrom 0.3p in 2021 to 3.2p. Statutory profit \nbefore tax was £27.5m (2021: loss of £15.9m), \nwith a statutory earnings per share of 1.3p \nagainst a loss per share of 2.4p in 2021.\nAs anticipated, the Group has delivered positive \nfree cash flow for the year, which was a key \nstrategic target and milestone set under our \nReturn to Growth strategy. The £10.6m free \ncash flow has helped to further reduce our \npost-IFRS 16 leverage from 3.2x in 2021 to 2.8x \nin 2022. Post-IFRS 16 net debt has increased \nlargely due to additional lease liabilities \nfollowing lease renewals and additions  \nacross our trading sites and fleet.\nNo dividend is proposed for 2022. We will \ncontinue to monitor free cash flow generation \nand progress toward our target leverage. \nThe Board remains committed to returning to \npaying a dividend when we sensibly can, as \npart of our wider capital allocation policy.\nGovernance and Board\nWe believe that good corporate governance \ncomes from an effective Board that provides \nstrong leadership to the Group and engages \nwell with both management and stakeholders.\nI am pleased to report that a smooth CEO \ntransition from Steve to Gavin has been \nachieved, and I am confident that our new  \nCEO and the Executive Leadership Team will \nbuild on the significant progress made in the \nlast three years.\nDuring the year, the Board also placed \nsignificant focus on the development of \nsuccession planning for our senior team to \nensure that the Group is well prepared and \ncontinues to have a stable body of experienced \nleaders in place.\nI believe the Board continues to operate \neffectively across all aspects of its role, \nand more details of this can be found in the \nCorporate Governance report and particularly \non page 87 where we describe the annual \nevaluation exercise undertaken by the Board.\nThe Board of ten Directors includes two \nwomen and one Director from an ethnic \nminority background, and there remains work \nto be done to improve the diversity of the \nBoard. Recognising that during the year the \nNominations Committee’s focus was on CEO \nsuccession and the development of our senior \nleadership team, we remain committed to \ntaking further steps to address Board diversity \nin 2023.\nThe Board firmly believes it is important for \nDirectors to engage directly with employees to \ngain first-hand insight into their challenges and \nviews. During the year, I am pleased to report \nthat nominated Board members continued \nto deliver our Board Workforce Engagement \nprogramme, meeting face-to-face with a broad \ncross-section of employees. You can read \nmore about this on pages 80 to 81.\nChristian Rochat has informed the Group that \ndue to the recent increase in his commitments \nto companies within the CD&R portfolio, he \nwill not stand for re-election at the AGM on \n4 May 2023 and will accordingly step down \nas of that date. CD&R is entitled to appoint a \nDirector to replace him. Christian joined the \nBoard at the time of CD&R’s investment in July \n2020 and I would like to express our gratitude \nto him for the role that he played in the Group’s \nturnaround and progress since then, to the \nbenefit of all of SIG’s shareholders.\nPeople and culture\nOur people continue to be our biggest strength. \nThe Board would like to thank employees for \ntheir dedication, commitment, and hard work \nthroughout the year.\nThe Board is cognisant of the pressures the \ncurrent economic climate, and especially the \nincreases in the cost of living, place on our \npeople. As a Group, we will continue to work \nhard to provide support to our employees \nthrough these challenging times including \nselective one-off cost of living payments.\nWe continue our efforts to build an inclusive \nculture, and our third annual employee \nengagement survey, which provides both \nqualitative and quantitative data, enables us  \nto engage and listen directly to employees.\nThe Board was very encouraged to see \npositive feedback and signs of continued \nimprovement in many areas, and the insight \nand recommendations continue to support our \nPeople strategy. You can read more about the \nfeedback and actions on pages 40 to 44.\nThe Board is committed to SIG’s ambition \nto be an employer of choice in the building \nmaterials sector. Our approach to people and \nculture will continue to be a critically important \npriority, with an even greater focus on talent, \ndevelopment, diversity, and succession \nplanning.\nOutlook\nWe believe that, through the dedication of our \npeople, SIG is currently in better shape than it \nhas been for a number of years, to the benefit \nof all stakeholders.\nWe retain strong positions in our core markets \nand, while market headwinds remain in 2023, \nour scale, diversification, and resilience give the \nBoard confidence in our ability to deliver the \nGroup’s medium to longer-term objectives.\nI would like to thank our employees and all our \nother stakeholders for their ongoing support.\nI, along with the rest of the Board, very much \nlook forward to working with Gavin to build on \nthe strong foundations established over the last \nthree years and delivering on our expectations \nfor the year ahead.\nAndrew Allner\nChairman\n7 March 2023\n16\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

LFL \nrevenue growth of 17% reflected the Group’s \nability to effectively manage input price inflation, \nas well as the successful execution of its \nstrategy and the gaining of market share in \nkey geographies. The Group also delivered its \ntargeted step-up in profitability, reaching a 3.1% \nunderlying operating margin in H1, and closing \nthe year at 2.9%, a 110 bps improvement over \n2021. This performance was achieved despite \na one-off loss of £5m in H2 as a result of \nAvonside, a major UK roofing contractor and \none of the Group’s largest customers, going \ninto administration.\nThese results reflect the further progress made \nunder the Return to Growth strategy launched \nin 2020. We have empowered branches, \nwho can respond to local trading conditions \nand drive local performance, and we have \nbusinesses that are now more specialist, \nflexible, productive, and engaged. Customer \nNPS has improved in most geographies and \nthe Group’s NPS increased from +40 to +46, \nmeaning that an increasingly high proportion \nof our customers are likely to recommend SIG \nto others. \nSIG’s 2022 results also demonstrate a \nsignificantly improved financial position since \n2020. The Group has returned to positive free \ncash flow and further reduced its leverage, \nwhich were both key targets set in 2020. As set \nout in the Financial review, the financing put in \nplace during 2021 secured long-term funding \nat good pricing until 2026. SIG also now has a \ngood level of liquidity to support the ongoing \nneeds of the growing Group.

      "text": "Market dynamics\nSIG’s results during 2022, and over the last \ntwo years, also reflect the Group’s successful \nmanagement of volatile macroeconomic \nconditions to deliver consistent performance \nimprovement. \nThe impact of Covid-19 during 2020 and 2021 \ncreated unprecedented disruption for the \nconstruction industry with knock-on effects \ncontinuing into 2022. The decline in market \nactivity during the initial lockdowns in 2020 \nwas followed by higher than usual RMI activity \nin many markets, coupled with significant \nsupply chain and logistics challenges and \nlabour shortages. As supply chains began \nto normalise, the commencement of war in \nUkraine in 2022 created volatile energy and raw \nmaterial markets, which drove price inflation \nand macroeconomic uncertainty.\nSIG has successfully managed through these \nmarket swings. During 2021, the Group took \nstrong action to ensure stock availability for \ncustomers, prioritising investment in product \ninventory and enhancing service levels. In 2022, \nthe Group was able to unwind some of the \nresulting higher inventory to more normalised \nlevels, with working capital improvement as a \nresult, whilst ensuring we maintained strong \ncustomer service and prompt delivery times.\nWhile input cost inflation has supported top-line \nrevenue growth, SIG’s tight focus on product \ncategory management was critical to enabling \neffective pass through. Strong relationships \nand communication with both suppliers and \ncustomers have also been vital, and I credit  \nour teams for their ongoing commitment in  \nthis area. \nAs set out in further detail in the “Our market” \nsection of this Strategic report the Group’s \ntrading environment includes the impact of \nnear-term economic trends and long-term \nstructural growth drivers. During 2022 we saw \nthe impact of both trends, from some softening \nof trading in the second half in geographies \nsuch as the UK due to weaker economic \nconditions, together with the continuation \nof long-term trends among governments to \nmandate greater sustainability in construction \nand the built environment, in particular to \nincrease the energy efficiency of buildings. \nStrategic progress across SIG’s \ngeographies\nIn France the operating margin of both the \nInteriors and Exteriors businesses now \nexceeds 5%, driven by consistent execution \nof our strategy. This execution has included \nproduct mix enhancement and a rigorous focus \non branch performance and has led to market \nshare gains.\nIn Germany we have delivered a strong \nturnaround since the introduction of new \nmanagement in Q4 2021, with 16% LFL sales \ngrowth in 2022 and underlying operating \nmargin improving to 3.7% from 0.9% in 2021. \nProgress in Germany has been driven by \nan “empower the touchpoints” strategy that \nhas increased empowerment of local teams, \nre-energised the sales force, and bolstered \nspecialist expertise to strengthen customer  \nand supplier relationships. \nThe UK Interiors business has delivered a \nsuccessful two-year turnaround, recovering \nmarket share and returning to profitability \nthrough consistent execution of its strategy, \nbetter pricing discipline, and aided by the \npricing tailwind. UK Exteriors had a solid year \nalbeit with market volumes declining in the \nsecond half in particular. Their margin was \naffected by the significant bad debt write-off \nreferenced on page 17.\nOur Benelux business returned to market share \ngain in 2022 with some initial improvements \nin profitability, and with further aspects of the \nturnaround plans to be implemented.\nThe Group has continued to utilise technology \nto support business transformation through \nimproved productivity and customer experience, \nwith a focus on making SIG a better place to \nbuy from, sell to and work for. Further progress \nis needed in 2023 to ensure consistent \ndeployment of these solutions across all  \nof the Group’s businesses.\nIn Poland our omnichannel services to \ncustomers and new ways of working have \ndriven strong sales, profit and productivity \nimprovement, with sales via our market-\nleading e-commerce platform representing \n10% of sales. Across our operating companies \nwe are progressing the transformation of \nour warehouse and transport management \nsystems onto digital platforms for process \noptimisation and productivity improvements. \nWe have also continued to build our digital \nleadership capabilities across the business. \nDuring 2022 the Group invested in both \nnetwork expansion and two accretive \nacquisitions. Eight new branches were opened, \nwhich will continue to bolster organic growth in \nthe years ahead, and the acquisitions of Miers \nConstruction Products and Thermodämm \ncompleted successfully. Miers is one of \nthe UK’s leading suppliers of specialist \nconstruction accessories and increases \nour exposure to infrastructure end-markets. \nThermodämm is a specialist interiors business \nin Germany, reinforcing our market-leading \nposition in flooring. \nThese acquisitions, together with those \ncompleted in 2021, reflect the Group’s \ncommitment to supplementing organic revenue \ngrowth with selective acquisitions, where these \ncan boost specialist expertise in high-margin \ncategories and deliver synergies with our \nexisting businesses.\nSustainability\nThe Group has set five commitments against \nwhich it will measure its continuing progress \nas a leader in sustainable construction. During \n2022 we have reduced emissions (Scope 1, \nScope 2 and business travel emissions) by 10% \nto 43,328 metric tonnes as we work towards \nour goal of being net zero carbon by 2035 at \nthe latest. The key drivers were an increased \nuse of renewable electricity contracts in the UK \nand Germany alongside replacing vehicles with \na lower-carbon alternative as leases come up \nfor renewal. We have also increased the level of \nwaste that is diverted from landfill to 92% from \n86% in 2021.\nThe Group reinforced its commitment to being \na health and safety leader in our industry, \nappointing a new Group Health, Safety and \nEnvironment Director. Our 2022 reported \nLTIFR reduced to 11.1 from 11.8 in 2021, \nalongside improved near-miss reporting which \nencourages all our employees, contractors \nand stakeholders to report near misses, \nunsafe situations and behaviours for positive \ninterventions. \nFurther details of our progress under these and \nour other sustainability commitments can be \nfound on pages 26 to 54. \nChief Executive Officer’s review\n18\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

I am greatly looking \nforward to spending more time working with \nmy colleagues and pursuing our opportunities \ntogether. Some of my initial impressions are:\nA successful three years\nThe Group’s progress over the last three \nyears in improving its operating and financial \nperformance has been significant, especially \nin challenging market conditions. There is a \nstrong sense of pride among the colleagues I \nhave met in what has been achieved and there \nis a clear appetite to continue that momentum. \nEngaged people and culture\nOur people are passionate about going the \nextra mile for our customers and meeting the \nneeds of their local markets.

However, \nalmost 60% of the Group’s revenue is generated \nfrom the EU with a portfolio of strong positions, \ndiversified by customer segment and end-\nmarket. This pan-European spread presents a \nrange of opportunities for profitable growth in \nexisting and adjacent categories.\nOutlook \nLooking beyond the impact of the short-\nterm economic cycle, SIG remains very well \npositioned to benefit from long-term structural \ngrowth in our industry, and, as a leading \nEuropean supplier of insulation and energy \nefficiency solutions, to benefit from structural \ntailwinds of decarbonisation. \nThrough the Group’s good progress over the \nlast two years, SIG is in a strengthened financial \nposition. This, together with the growth \nopportunities we have across the portfolio and \nthe opportunity for continued improvement in \noperating performance and profitability, gives \nme confidence in our ability to deliver long-term \nsustainable profitable growth.

We \nhave also set up a Group-wide monthly DEI \nforum with representation from all areas of the \nbusiness. This group developed and launched \nour new DEI policy and is responsible, going \nforward, for driving our agenda and prioritising \nkey activities for the business in meeting our \nDEI commitments. As part of its remit, the \nforum is now championing ways to ensure \nwe have an inclusive working environment in \nall our businesses and locations. It also acts \nas a channel to challenge the businesses in \nterms of practice, approach and development, \nparticularly in supporting underrepresented or \ndisadvantaged groups.\nEach business has delivered an initial plan \ncontaining initiatives such as creating their own \nDEI forum, employee resource groups, working \nwith external partners to attract candidates \nfrom particular diverse groups, reviewing \nemployment policies and processes and \nproviding communications, tools and  \nresources to raise awareness from the  \nwider employee base. \nIn our latest employee engagement survey, \n84% of our colleagues answered positively \nwhen asked if they feel they are treated with \nrespect regardless of their age, gender, and \ncultural background, 3% higher than 2021. \nWe have made substantial progress this year \nfrom a DEI perspective, improving related \ncommunications, dialogue and engagement \nand upgrading our support for international \ncampaigns and programmes. In 2023, the key \nareas for focus will include ensuring better \nchannels to attract, promote and retain diverse \ntalent, developing the DEI measures to report \nprogress, and continuing to deliver appropriate \ntraining to enhance knowledge and support.\nAll employees\n7,205\nBoard members\n10\nExecutive Leadership  \nTeam\n13\nEuropean Leadership  \nGroup\n103\n  Male \n  Female\nEnvironmental, social and governance | Social\n78%\n22%\n80%\n20%\n77%\n23%\n83%\n17%\nGender diversity figures \n(as at 31 Dec 2022)\nAligned to the Group’s vision and \ncommitments, France developed their own \nDEI plan and approach with the aim to \nreally bring to life what diversity, equality \nand inclusion means for our people and \ncelebrate the differences that having a \ndiverse and inclusive workforce can bring.\nA diversity committee was set up, with \nrepresentatives from the senior leadership \nteam and their first achievement was \ndeveloping a DEI Charter for all colleagues \nto sign up to.

Our success results from a profound \ncommitment to provide our people with the \nskills and knowledge they need, and the career \ndevelopment opportunities they deserve.\nApprenticeship programmes are a key part \nof how we both attract and develop talent \nand how we ensure we recruit individuals \nfrom different backgrounds with different \nexperiences and skill sets. Currently we have \nover 200 apprentices across the business \nand we aim to increase that to over 300 \nduring 2023. We offer technical training, \nsales competency learning and leadership \nprogrammes across our businesses. Our \nonline, virtual, and in-person training platforms \nensure learning for all employees as they seek \nnew opportunities and develop skills that \nbenefit them personally and professionally.\nIn 2022, we used our Group-wide talent \nframework to measure the level of capability \nin key roles throughout the organisation, \nidentify employees with high potential, develop \nsuccession plans for critical roles, and \nlocate candidates for potential development \nmoves. We have also undertaken a thorough \norganisational capability review and established \nour critical capabilities to develop a more \nrelevant and strategic talent framework and \nprinciples to embed within the business moving \ninto 2023.\nThis enables us to link capability and potential \nto the needs of the business more readily. We \nhave also recently launched our talent and \ndevelopment policy which outlines our aims, \nguiding principles and approach to all talent \nand development activity. \nProviding development opportunities is a key \npriority as we underpin and support our talent \nframework and performance management \nprocesses. In developing our pipeline of \nleadership talent to support the Group now \nand in the future, the Executive Leadership \nTeam have each completed a development \nand assessment programme consisting of \npsychometrics, feedback from colleagues \nand an individual leadership session, followed \nby feedback and development planning. The \nprocess also helped to develop our Group- \nwide leadership competency framework which \narticulates what SIG needs from its leaders. \nThe development programme and competency \nframework are currently being rolled out to the \nnext level of leadership. \nPerformance Manager, our online platform \nfor personal development reviews, which \nwas launched in 2021, has been further \ndeveloped to make the process of setting \nclear and realistic objectives even easier and \nhas increased the population of the workforce \nusing the system. \nApprenticeships in the UK \nThe UK have been running apprenticeship \nprogrammes for over a decade. 2022 saw 60 \napprentices on programmes across a variety of \ndisciplines, including customer service, business \nadministration, trade counter, warehouse, \nprocurement, sales, finance, HR and IT.\nJack Lawless, from our Interiors business in Leeds, \njoined the business in August 2021 as an apprentice. \nHe was offered an extended apprenticeship \nprogramme, with the aim of developing him into  \na skilled and valued member of the sales team.  \nJack’s development has been so impressive that  \nhis success has been recognised within the  \nbusiness and externally as he was shortlisted  \n(one of three from 2,000 applications) for  \nthe Lifetime Training’s \nRecruited Apprentice of \nthe Year 2022 award and \nreceived the Construction \nAccessories Rising Star \naward 2022.\nApprenticeships in Germany\nGermany have once again welcomed apprentices into their \nbusiness, with 26 enrolled in their successful apprenticeship \nprogramme in 2022.\nThe programme starts with a three-day induction whereby the \napprentices have the opportunity to get to know each other, meet \ncolleagues from the wider business and attend a dinner with the \nMD and senior management in order to understand more about \nthe business. \nThe programme then covers a number of disciplines ranging \nfrom operational management, sales, office management and \nwarehouse logistics, with the apprentices working as a key \nmember of the teams.

      "text": "Transition risks and chronic physical risks\nIn terms of transition and chronic physical risks, the Group considers short, medium and long-term horizons to be as follows: short-term is within the next \n3 years (in line with our viability review period); medium-term is 4-10 years; and long-term is over 10 years. The table below sets out the main climate-\nrelated transition and chronic physical risks that the Group faces alongside proposed mitigating strategies and the impact on the Group’s strategy.\nRisk\nDescription\nMitigation\nImpact on \nstrategy1\nSpecific climate-related risks\nRemoval of fossil \nfuels from our fleet \n(S/M/L)\nVehicle emissions remain the single largest contributor \nto our carbon emissions. There is a significant degree of \nuncertainty regarding the optimum future technology for \nour heavy-duty fleet and there is therefore risk regarding \nwhat and when any investment in new technologies should \nbe made.\nPages 28 to 32 set out our progress and future plans for \ndecarbonising our fleet. Whilst the most cost-effective \nroute for decarbonising heavy-duty vehicles remains the \nbiggest uncertainty, we are starting to trial the use of \nalternative fuels, i.e. HVO, and will continue to work with \nour fleet partners and manufacturers to assess the most \nviable long-term alternatives.\nHigh\nWaste \nmanagement (S)\nThere is an increased likelihood of greater regulatory \npressure to ensure that, in addition to the management \nof SIG’s “own waste”, companies will become liable for \nproduct waste, particularly with regards to “end of life” and \n“embedded carbon” obligations. Any such requirement in \nthe near term would present significant challenges in terms \nof reverse logistics processes and costs.\nOur commitment to zero SIG waste to landfill by 2025 \nis driving several waste initiatives in the Group. Whilst \nthis commitment is currently our focus, in 2023 we will \nexpand our thinking to include non-SIG waste and ensure \nthat we are well placed to support the circular economy \nby recycling and repurposing materials to reduce waste \nand raw materials extraction.\nMedium\nProduct carbon \ndata (S/M/L)\nThere is a risk that we either lack or do not have \naccess to the appropriate degree of detailed product \nor manufacturers’ data to satisfy customers’ needs \nwith regards to their own internal ESG requirements or \nsustainability drivers.\nProduct data quality remains a focus area for our \noperating companies, who continue to monitor, \nassess and upgrade their product data requirements, \ncapabilities, and governance considering ongoing \nchanges in business needs and regulation.\nMedium\nEnergy efficiency \n(property portfolio) \n(S/M)\nThere is a risk that the inherent age and construct of \nour branch estate impacts our ability to drive enhanced \nenergy efficiency across our property portfolio. This has \nthe potential to create reputational impacts and potential \nwellbeing issues for the employees in the branches.\nWe expect that all new branches procured or leased \nwill have sustainable, low-carbon features included. \nFor the existing estate, branches are being upgraded in \na controlled manner, where needed, with LED lighting \nbeing used to replace traditional lighting and other energy \ninitiatives being put in place to reduce energy usage.\nMedium\nChronic physical \nrisks (M/L)\nFrequent summer heatwaves restrict or impact summer \nconstruction periods whilst higher winter precipitation \nand more intense storm events affect outdoor winter \nconstruction. This may have an impact on how \nconstruction projects are scheduled, planned and \nexecuted. \nChronic physical risks are longer-term shifts in climate \npatterns. The relatively long-term nature of the risk will \nallow the Group time to formulate a sustainable response \nto the changing weather patterns, alongside its suppliers \nand customers.\nMedium\nUse of carbon \noffsets (L)\nSIG has set net zero carbon targets and may use carbon \noffset schemes to balance harder-to-reduce emissions. \nThere is a risk that sufficient “quality” and economically \nviable offset schemes may not be available to meaningfully \nmitigate any carbon target shortfalls. \nWe are committed to achieving our carbon targets and \nwill identify and prioritise the key enablers to reducing our \ncarbon emissions and ensure that offsets are utilised only \nas a last resort.\nMedium\nEnergy market \nvolatility (S/M)\nConflict between long-term decarbonisation targets and a \ndesire to manage uncertainties presented by unpredictable \nenergy markets results in governments delaying or failing \nto make the necessary infrastructure investments to \nsupport the transition to a green economy. This impacts \nthe industry’s ability to deliver its carbon reduction plans.\nWhile recognising the impacts of government policy and \nregulation on our decarbonisation strategies, we continue \nto assess our planned contribution to reducing carbon \nemissions on the basis of the benefits to SIG and our key \nstakeholders and customers. We remain committed to \ntheir execution and the realisation of their benefits.\nMedium\nGrid electrification \ncapacity (S/M/L)\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, the electrification \nof cars is likely to increase the total electricity demand \nupwards by 10-20% globally. There is a risk that local \npower grids and transmission network capacity and \ninfrastructures are unable to accommodate the increased \nvolume of required charge points or the capacity of local \ntransmission networks to handle increased peak loads to \nsupport recharging.\nWhile we continue to seek opportunities to utilise \nalternative technologies to reduce our carbon footprint, \nwe recognise that the capacity of local infrastructures \nto support the introduction of these technologies may \nimpact the speed or scope with which these initiatives \nare introduced. \nWe continue to work with key partners and stakeholders \nto ensure that any constraints are identified, risk \nassessed and, where possible, mitigated prior to the \nimplementation of new technologies and any additional \ncosts are considered as part of our investment appraisal \nprocesses.\nMedium\n1.\t \u0007The risk noted above that has a “High” impact has been referenced as part of the wider ESG risk disclosed in the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties on page 59.  \nRisk classification and prioritisation has been determined based on complexity and the materiality of the cost of risk reduction. We anticipate the impact of the climate-related  \nrisks to reduce over the medium/long term as we gain more certainty and clarity on our detailed plan to achieve net zero carbon.\n(L) Long-term horizon (M) Medium-term horizon (S) Short-term horizon\n47\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

She is supported by local health and safety \nmanagers, embedded in each of our businesses, who \nprovide leadership and support as well as providing \nregular monitoring and reporting of key performance \nmetrics and the status of local actions and initiatives  \n(see pages 37 to 39 for further details).\nHigh\nEmployee \nwellbeing\nThere is an increasing risk regarding how the increased \ncost of living, mental health and wellbeing are increasingly \ninterconnected.\nEach of our operating companies has introduced \nprogrammes and initiatives to continually support \nemployees. These are underpinned by a Group-wide \nemployee health and wellbeing policy and training \nfor employees to outline their responsibilities to keep \nthemselves and their colleagues safe and well  \n(see page 41 for further details).\nHigh\nDiversity and \ninclusion\nThere is a risk that SIG’s relative lack of diversity in the \nworkforce is a missed opportunity to tap into additional \nsources of new employees and talent, in addition to \npotentially contributing to adverse reputational risk.\nOur DEI policy, which is mandatory for all employees to \nreview and understand, outlines both management and \nemployee responsibilities in this area. The policy sets out \nour aims to encourage, promote, and maintain an inclusive \nand supportive work environment which reflects the rights \nof individuals to be treated fairly and with respect and \nenables them to fulfil their potential. There is also a Group-\nwide DEI forum which comprises senior representatives \nacross the Group, who are dedicated to progressing the \nDEI agenda (see page 42 for further details).\nMedium\nCapability and \ncapacity\nThere is a risk that SIG lacks the necessary capacity, \nexpertise and capability to manage the full scope of both \nexternal and internal ESG reporting activities and is unable \nto provide accurate, complete and timely ESG data. This \nrisk will be exacerbated by increasing regulatory reporting \nrequirements due to take effect in the near term.\nIn 2022, we used our Group-wide talent framework to \nmeasure the level of capability in key roles throughout \nthe Group, including the ESG organisation. We identified \nemployees with high potential, developed succession \nplans for critical roles, and identified candidates for \npotential development moves to ensure we have a talent \nand succession plan to meet the current and expected \nESG requirements (see page 43 for further details).\nMedium\nNew and emerging \nlegislation\nThere is a risk that SIG fails to effectively scan, impact \nassess and scenario plan for new and emerging legislation \nor standards. This may result in regulatory censure, \npenalties or negative reputational impacts.\nThe Group operates with a strong governance \nframework, with policies and procedures in place to \nensure compliance with all relevant legislation. The Group \nhas a General Counsel who is a member of the Executive \nLeadership Team and who is supported by a dedicated \nin-house legal and company secretarial team at a Group \nand operating company level. Additionally, use is made of \nexternal legal support where required to ensure all new \nand emerging legislation that is relevant to the Group is \nunderstood and responded to appropriately.\nMedium\n1. \t\u0007The risks noted above that have a “High” impact have been referenced individually or as part of the wider ESG risk disclosed in the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties  \non pages 58 and 59.

Our category mix is \nwell positioned, with both insulation and roofing \ncritical to building energy performance and \naddressing product sustainability.\nOur commercial priorities and opportunities \ncentre around:\n1. \u0007Responding to regulations in the energy \nperformance of buildings and the need \nfor enhanced building materials product \nsustainability – the resulting growth in \nthe retrofit market and in energy efficient \ncategories such as insulation, timberframe, \nPV and heat pumps, as examples, will lead \nto significant tailwinds in many of our core \ncategories and will accelerate the growth of \nlower embodied carbon products, especially \ninsulation, roofing and plasterboard. It will \nalso lead to the expansion of our design \nand specification advice proposition which \nprovides data-driven technical advice based \non knowledge of operational and embodied \ncarbon performance of specific products \nacross multiple suppliers.\n2. \u0007Accelerating the growth of new \nsustainable products and solutions \na.\t Insulation – new lower carbon insulation \nproducts have been introduced such as \nwood fibre insulation and sheep’s wool \ninsulation. France, as an example, is \ntargeting 10% of insulation sales from \nbio-sourced products in the medium term.\nb.\t Sustainable roofing solutions – we are \nexpanding and promoting our sustainable \nroofing solutions including lightweight \nsynthetic roof tiles, natural slate tiles, \ngreen/brown roofs and single ply \nmembranes.\nc.\t Solar panel market innovation – driven \nby legislation in new builds and rising \nenergy costs, the market for solar panels \nwill increase significantly. We are building \ncapability to ensure we have complete \nsolutions for pitched roofs, flat roofs, \nindustrial buildings and rainscreens.\nd.\t Small scale drylining options – supporting \nand incubating emerging suppliers in \nlow-carbon plasterboard solutions and \nnatural alternatives to steel for stud and \ntrack walls.\n3. \u0007Partnering with early-stage innovators to \ndevelop new products and solutions – we \nare partnering with start-ups and academic \ninstitutions, leveraging our network and \ncustomer bases to bring new sustainable \nproducts to market and demonstrating the \nGroup’s value as an innovation partner.\nImpact on financial planning and financial \nstatements\nThe largest financial impact from our carbon-\nrelated risks is the cost involved with removing \nfossil fuels from our fleet. The strategy for \ntransitioning the fleet to a lower carbon basis \nis to replace aged vehicles with lower carbon \nalternatives as and when the leases naturally \nrenew and to focus on a short to medium-term \ntransition to lower carbon fuels which can be \nused in our existing fleet. There are currently no \nplans to accelerate the transition of the fleet to \nlower carbon alternatives over and above the \nnatural lease cycle. This is because:\n•\tthe cost to break the leases and accelerate \nthe renewal of the fleet with lower carbon \noptions is prohibitive;\n•\tthere is also little to no availability for low-\ncarbon HGVs, at least in the near term;\n•\tthe national charging networks are currently \ninsufficient to support our charging needs – \nnational infrastructure plans are required to \nmake the option financially viable;\n•\tmany of our branches will not have the \npower capacity currently to support charging \nrequirements or hydrogen provision;\n•\tthe currently available electric HGV range \ndoes not support our delivery structure – it \nis most suitable for long routes with no stops \nwhich is not common in our business; and\n•\tvehicle solutions are still in development – \nOEMs are currently uncertain on whether \nelectric, hydrogen, battery or hybrids will be \nthe favoured solution.\nUsing our strategy, we are forecast to meet our \nnet zero carbon goals by 2035 and therefore \nthere is currently no need to accelerate \nthe replacement of the fleet to meet our \ncommitments.\nThe costs of pursuing this strategy over the \nshort term have been factored into our 2023 \nbudget and medium-term plans by each \noperating company. Over this period, these \ncosts largely relate to the transition of our car \nand forklift fleet to lower-carbon alternatives \nand the gradual transition to fuels such as  \nHVO in our large trucks.\nWhilst the total cost of novating the fleet on \nrenewal of the lease is material to the Group, \nthe incremental cost of choosing to renew with \nlower carbon vehicles instead of traditional \nvehicles is not material. In the UK (which has \n40% of our emissions), the incremental cost \nof novating this fleet is c£0.8m in 2023, 2024 \nand 2025. Similarly, the cost of building the \ninfrastructure to support the move to HVO fuel \nin the UK in some of our trucks is less than \n£100k per annum. HVO fuel is not expected to \nhave any significant incremental cost impact \nover the diesel which is currently purchased.\nWe would expect to see the upside from the \nclimate-related opportunities noted above \nexceed these incremental costs in the short \nand medium term.\nGiven the uncertainty in the optimum future \ntechnology for our heavy-duty fleet, it is not \npracticable to quantify the financial impact it \nmay have on the Group long-term. However, \ngiven the opportunities we see for the business \nin response to climate change, we do not \nconsider there to be a material risk to the long-\nterm financial health of the Group.\nThe financial impact of climate-related matters \nis further discussed on pages 66 to 67 as part \nof our viability and going concern statements \nas well as in Note 11 of the financial statements \nwhich details our considerations in respect \nof impairment reviews. These statements \nconclude that there is not considered to be a \nsignificant risk of climate change causing  \na significant downturn in cash flows across  \nthe Group.\n49\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

We will continue to review this assessment and work to enhance our reporting on the resilience \nof our strategy to these scenarios.\nEnvironmental, social and governance | Governance\nScenario\nEffective action but implementation delayed (transition scenario)\nLate action: The implementation of policy to drive the transition is \ndelayed until 2031 and is then more sudden and disorderly. Some \ngovernment and societal commitment to ongoing enhancements and \nimprovements to achieve targets and forecasts implemented. Global \nwarming is limited to 1.8OC by the end of the scenario (2050) relative to \npre-industrial levels.\nThe more compressed nature of the reduction in emissions results in \nmaterial short-term macroeconomic disruption. Significant growth \nopportunities for SIG in terms of likely increased demand for transitional \ntechnologies and products to support lower carbon construction and \nbuilding upgrades.\nIneffective action (physical scenario)\nNo action: No policies introduced beyond those already implemented. \nThe absence of transitional policies leads to a growing concentration of \ngreenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and, as a result, global \ntemperature levels continue to increase, reaching 3.3OC relative to \npre-industrial levels by the end of the scenario (2050).\nThis leads to chronic changes in precipitation, ecosystems and sea levels \nleading to permanent impacts on living and working conditions, buildings \nand infrastructure. UK and global GDP growth is permanently lower and \nmacroeconomic uncertainty increases.\nLikely impact and consequences\nPolicy and \nregulatory\nThere will be significant government support for green infrastructure \ninvestments. Mandatory product information will be needed to \nsupport this investment. \nCarbon taxes help to drive the transition to sustainable energy, \npenalising the use of fossil fuels whilst encouraging investments in \nenergy efficient infrastructure.\nFailure to meet national and global carbon targets will likely result in \nmore regulatory interventions resulting in some short-term scarcity  \nin supply chains.\nGovernment policy supports and subsidises investment in lower \ncarbon intensity fleets.\nNo additional effective policy action on climate change.\nEconomy \nand market\nLikely that there is a climate-related recession in the early 2030s but \nthat long-term growth continues.\nSignificant infrastructure investment needed in a drive to develop  \nnon-fossil fuel energy sources and transport networks.\n<5% of homes become uninsurable for climate risks.\nBanks offer green mortgages and financing products for green \nrenovations.\nDemand for offsets and renewable energy products rises, pushing up \nprices and creating a “renewable” gap so that the Group cannot rely \non purchasing green electricity certificates to meet carbon targets.\nEconomic growth in steady decline and driven by high levels of \neconomic uncertainty.\nUK and global growth are permanently lower.\nc10% of homes become un-insurable for climate risks prompting overall \nlower investment in affected property.\nInfrastructure investments are critical, driven by the need to develop \nclimate resilience defences.\nTechnology\nOffsite manufacturing is used due to its lower embodied carbon.\nNewly built structures will need to be significantly redesigned, with \nbuildings simultaneously needing to consume less materials in the \nbuild yet be structurally stronger. \nIncreased investment in digital capabilities to facilitate the modelling  \nof the build to disclose carbon content.\nProducts heavily reliant on fossil fuels no longer wanted, leading  \nto product innovation, rising deconstruction and higher supply  \nchain costs.\nOffsite manufacturing boosted as onsite work impacted by weather \nextremes.\nIncreased focus on resilience of buildings to climate change.\nUrgent pressure to decarbonise the construction industry results in \nnew products which may make existing product obsolete or see new \ndisruptors entering the market, challenging long-standing relationships \nand arrangements.\nPhysical and \nclimate\nHigher incidence rate of acute physical weather events with some \nimpact on chronic events such as increased precipitation and \nheatwaves.\nGlobal warming relative to pre-industrial times reaches 3.3°C by \n2050. Accelerating and widespread climate change manifests itself in \nirreversible consequences that will push ecosystems beyond tipping \npoints.\nFrequent summer heatwaves restrict summer construction period.  \nAt a certain level, extreme temperature can stop work on construction \nprojects for health and safety reasons while also potentially \ncompromising the structural soundness of materials, causing improper \noperation of machinery, and increasing fire risk on the site. \nConsiderably higher winter precipitation and more intense storm events \naffect winter construction.\nExtensive flooding with a mean sea level increase of c0.39m in the UK. \nUK, Netherlands and Northern Germany particularly exposed to flooding.\nSupply chains significantly disrupted in the worst-hit regions.\n50\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

An outline of the three lines model is \ndetailed below.\nOur approach to risk management\nThe ability to effectively manage risks and \nuncertainties is at the heart of every successful \norganisation and how we identify and respond \nto risks and uncertainty will influence business \noutcomes and contribute to the quality of our \ndecisions.\nTo identify our risks, we focus on our strategic \nobjectives and consider what might stop us \nachieving our plan within our strategic planning \nperiod. The approach combines a top-down \nstrategic Group-level view and a bottom-up \noperational view of the risks at operating \ncompany level. Meetings are held with our \noperating company leadership teams to \nidentify the risks within their operations. These \nare consolidated and, in conjunction with a \nseries of discussions held with the Executive \nLeadership Team and Non-Executive Directors, \nprovide the inputs to identify and validate our \nprincipal risks. \nTo assess our risks, we consider the likely \nfinancial, reputational, regulatory, and \noperational impacts and the probability that \neach risk may materialise. This helps us to \nassess the nature and extent of internal control \nwe need to implement to manage the risk to \nan acceptable level. For each of the principal \nrisks, we have considered whether the risk is \nincreasing, decreasing or remains unchanged. \nWe have also given an indication of those \nelements of our strategic plan which may be \nimpacted should any of the risks materialise.\nTo ensure we effectively monitor our risks, the \nprincipal risks are reviewed by the Board, the \nAudit & Risk Committee and the Executive \nLeadership Team regularly during the year. \nChanges to the principal risks and mitigation \nactivities are considered as part of this review. \nThe three lines model\nOperational management:\nOperational management is responsible for identifying \nand assessing risks on an ongoing basis, and for \nimplementing and maintaining appropriate controls \naligned to the organisation’s policies and procedures.\nRisk management, internal controls  \nand compliance functions:\nOur compliance, risk management and internal \ncontrols functions support the business in ensuring \neffective implementation of, and compliance with, \npolicies and procedures across the business.\nIndependent assurance:\nOur internal audit function provides independent \nassurance to ensure that controls are implemented  \nand are operating efficiently and effectively across  \nthe organisation.\n2\n3\n1\nSecond line\nThird line\nFirst line\n56\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

On at least an \nannual basis it considers the nature and level \nof risk it is prepared to accept to deliver the \nstrategy. \nRisk appetite is assessed against a suite of \nrisk categories directly relevant to the Group, \nsupported by high-level statements which set \nout the Board’s expectations with regards to \nthe accepted level of risk appetite for each \ncategory of risk.\nWe continue to have a higher appetite for those \nrisks that present the greatest opportunities \nfor commercial reward and take a balanced \napproach to such opportunities in terms of \nassessing potentially higher levels of risk  \nand return.\nWe do, however, have a very low tolerance \nfor risks that have significant negative \nconsequences, particularly when they \ncould adversely impact health and safety, \nlegal compliance, our values and culture, \nor our reputation. We aim to either avoid \nthose activities that may result in these risks \nmaterialising or eliminate these risks with  \nour mitigation efforts.\nPrincipal risks \nThe Board regularly monitors the Group risk \nregister, which includes the ten principal risks to \nthe Group set out in this report. These risks, if \nthey materialise, could have a significant impact \non the Group’s ability to meet its strategic \nobjectives. The assessed net risk scores \n(likelihood and impact of the risk occurring \nafter taking account of mitigating controls) are \noutlined in the matrix above and details of the \nrisks and current mitigations are included in the \ntable on the following pages.\nPrincipal risks\n1   Cyber security\n2   Health and safety \n3   Macroeconomic uncertainty\n4   Attract, recruit and retain our people\n5   Data quality and governance\n6   \u0007Environmental, social and  \ngovernance (ESG)\n7   Mergers and acquisitions\n8   Legal or regulatory compliance\n9   Digitalisation\n10   Change management\nLikelihood\nLikely\nPossible\nCritical\nModerate\nImpact\nOur risk \nmanagement \nprinciples\n2\n1\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n1\n2\n5\n4\n3\nRisk management \nprinciples\n57\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

Cyber security \nInternal or external \ncyber-attacks could \nresult in system \ndisruption or sensitive \ndata being compromised\nRisk movement: \n \nLink to strategic pillars:\nIn the context of widespread dependency on increasingly \ncomplex digital systems, growing cyber threats are \noutpacing societies’ ability to effectively prevent and \nmanage them. These risks are also exacerbated by \nan increasing willingness of nation states to engage in \nasymmetric cyber warfare to achieve geopolitical aims.\nThere is a risk that we lack the capabilities to effectively \nprevent, monitor, respond to, or recover from, suspected \ncyber-attacks on our IT infrastructure. Such attacks may \nresult in a loss of data or disruption to IT services which \nmay have a significant impact on our ability to operate and \ncomply with data protection and privacy laws (e.g. GDPR), \nand may have a detrimental effect on our reputation.\nCyber security continues to receive Board and Executive \nLeadership Team focus with an emphasis on ensuring that \nappropriate technologies are deployed across IT infrastructure to \nmanage cyber threats.\nRegular and independent reviews are performed to assess \nthe nature of potential cyber threats, security processes and \ninitiatives. They also ensure that we implement appropriate tools \nand processes to better identify and remediate new and emerging \ncyber risks and vulnerabilities. \nCyber-incident response protocols are in place to support our \nability to effectively respond to and recover from a cyber threat \nor incident and ongoing cyber training campaigns and initiatives \nensure employees are alert to the nature and consequences of \ncyber-attacks. \n2. Health and safety \nDanger of incident or \naccident, resulting in \ninjury or loss of life to \nemployees, customers,  \nor the general public\nRisk movement: \n \nLink to strategic pillars: \nThere is a risk that poor organisational arrangements  \nor behavioural culture with regards to health and safety \ncauses harm to individuals and may result in enforcement \naction, penalties, reputational damage, or adverse  \npress coverage.\nThe Group Health, Safety and Environment Director is a \nmember of the Executive Leadership Team and provides \nstrategic leadership for all matters relating to health, safety and \nenvironmental performance, oversight and strategy. During the \nyear we appointed a new Group Health, Safety and Environment \nDirector and she is supported by local health and safety \nmanagers, embedded in each of our businesses, who provide \nlocal leadership and support, and provide regular monitoring \nand reporting of key performance metrics and the status of local \nactions and initiatives implemented.\nA compliance standards framework is in place to ensure the \nadequacy of local health and safety standards and arrangements, \nwith assurance provided through a programme of compliance \naudits performed by suitably trained and experienced health and \nsafety professionals. \n3. Macroeconomic uncertainty\nMacroeconomic volatility \nimpacts the Group’s \nability to accurately \nforecast and to meet \ninternal and external \nexpectations\nRisk movement: \nLink to strategic pillars: \nGeopolitical tensions have been a key feature of 2022 and \nare unlikely to disappear in 2023. The ongoing impacts \nof restoring post-Covid-19 financial stability, conflict in \nUkraine and the response of Western governments, \nparticularly regarding the imposition of sanctions on \nRussia and retaliatory disruption to energy supplies, has \nresulted in unprecedented economic turbulence and \nfinancial uncertainty with significant ongoing inflationary \nand cost of living impacts for both the UK and Europe.\nThis volatility has the potential to impact customer \ndemand, along with presenting significant challenges to \nour financial, operational and commercial resilience, whilst \nadding costs to our operations and making planning and \nforecasting more difficult. Changes in macroeconomic \nconditions may adversely affect the Group’s people, \nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition,  \nor prospects.\nWe continue to assess inflationary and other supply chain \npressures and impacts on product pricing and will continue to \nwork with our suppliers to identify opportunities to improve supply \nchain resilience and to selectively pre-purchase products in order \nto ensure continuity of supply. \nThe Group’s geographical diversity across Europe reduces the \nimpact of changes in market conditions in any one country while \nindustry-based KPIs, monitored monthly at a Group and operating \ncompany level, help to ensure that warnings and indicators of \nrisk are identified early, and appropriate mitigation strategies \nimplemented.\nOur strategic pillars\nResponsible \nactions\nValuable \npartnerships\nSpecialist  \nexpertise\nSuperior  \nservice\nFocused  \ngrowth\nHighest  \nproductivity\nWinning  \nbranches\n58\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

Data quality and governance\nPoor data quality \nnegatively impacts our \nfinancial management, \nfact-based decision-\nmaking, business \nefficiency, and credibility \nwith customers\nRisk movement: \n \nLink to strategic pillars:\nThere is a risk that we lack the necessary quality of \nsystems and processes to ensure sufficient granularity, \ncompleteness, and accuracy of vendor, product and \npricing master data.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG)\nSIG suffers reputational \nimpacts due to poor \nenvironmental, social \nand governance \narrangements and \nperformance\nRisk movement: \n \nLink to strategic pillars: \nPublic and commercial consciousness has been growing \non a wide range of environmental, social and governance \nissues, including climate change, employee wellbeing and \nhow an organisation contributes to society. Organisations \nshould not only minimise their negative impacts, but also \ncontribute positively to both society and the environment.\nWhile SIG has a long and rich heritage in helping the \nconstruction industry deliver energy efficient solutions \nand products, risks remain in terms of how we deliver \nour ESG agenda. This is particularly the case in how \nwe ensure we achieve our stated aims with regards \nto climate change. These risks include the cost and \ncomplexity of compliance, the challenges presented by \nthe decarbonisation of our vehicle fleet and estate and \nhow we engage with the wider industry to reduce product \nand supply-chain carbon impacts.\nAs outlined on page 27, we have set ambitious ESG commitments \nand will focus on demonstrating health and safety leadership in \nour sector, committing to a net zero carbon target by 2035 at \nthe latest, sending zero SIG waste to landfill by 2025, partnering \nwith manufacturers and customers to reduce carbon and waste \nacross the supply chain, and to being recognised as an employer \nof choice in building materials distribution.\nThese commitments will be supported by verifiable and \nevidenced-based data to ensure that progress in achieving these \naims and ambitions is monitored and subject to appropriate \nrigour. To do this, we have enhanced our sustainability reporting \nand budgeting processes (particularly in relation to carbon \nemissions and waste) to ensure that we are able to effectively \ntrack both the progress and financial impacts of commitments.\nIn terms of employee wellbeing, each of our businesses has \nintroduced programmes and initiatives to support employees, \nunderpinned by a Group-wide employee health and wellbeing policy \nand training for all employees to understand their responsibilities \nto keep themselves and their colleagues safe and well.\n59\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

This was despite some \nvariability in demand, including increasing softness  \nin the second half.\nThe macroeconomic environment, notably the global \nincrease in energy costs, created significant price \ninflation of key materials in the construction industry. \nThe effects of this were successfully managed, as \nnoted, with the input price increases passed on to \ncustomers, increasing our reported revenue.\nDespite increased leasing renewals during 2022, partly \ndue to branch expansion but mostly due to timing and \nphasing of lease renewals, and a consequent increase \nto post-IFRS 16 net debt, we reported further progress \nin reducing our leverage towards our target level.  \nWe closed the year with a robust balance sheet  \nand good liquidity.\nRevenue \nThe Group saw a 17% increase in its LFL revenue \nover the year, with revenue up to £2,744.5m (2021: \n£2,291.4m) driven by the pass through of product \nprice inflation in all geographies and the impact of  \nour strategic growth initiatives.

      "text": "Taxation\nThe effective tax rate for the Group on the total profit before tax of £27.5m (2021: £15.9m loss) was 43.6% (2021: negative 78.0%). As the Group \noperates in several different countries, tax losses cannot be surrendered or utilised cross border. Tax losses are not currently recognised as deferred \ntax assets in respect of the UK business, which also impacts the overall effective tax rate. The combination of these factors means that the effective \ntax rate is less meaningful as an indicator or comparator for the Group.\nIn accordance with UK legislation, the Group publishes an annual tax strategy, which is available on our website (www.sigplc.com).\nPensions\nThe Group operates four (2021: four) defined benefit pension schemes and a number of defined contribution pension schemes. The largest defined \nbenefit scheme is a UK scheme, which was closed to further accrual in 2016.\nThe Group’s total pension charge for the year, including amounts charged to interest, was £7.4m (2021: £6.9m), of which a charge of £0.2m  \n(2021: £0.6m) related to defined benefit pension schemes and £7.2m (2021: £6.3m) related to defined contribution schemes. \nThe total net liability in relation to defined benefit pension schemes at 31 December 2022 was £23.0m (2021: £10.7m). The last triennial actuarial \nvaluation of the UK scheme as at 31 December 2019 was concluded in March 2021. This showed that the market value of the scheme’s assets had \nincreased by 20% to £196m and their actuarial value covered 102% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases \nin pensionable salaries. As part of the funding discussions, the Company paid an additional one-off contribution of £2.5m into the Plan in July 2021 \nto accelerate plans to achieve a secondary funding target. The next triennial valuation as at 31 December 2022 will commence shortly. The scheme \nremains well funded despite the recent volatility of rates experienced during 2022. \nFinancial position\nOverall, the net assets of the Group increased by £3.1m to £267.8m (2021: £264.7m), with a gross cash position at year end of £130.1m (2021: \n£145.1m). The movement in the year end cash balances reflects a positive free cash flow of £10.6m delivered in the year, more than offset by £27.5m \nspent on acquisitions and investments. Reported year end net debt on a post-IFRS 16 basis was £444.0m (2021: £365.0m) and £160.3m on a pre-\nIFRS 16 basis (2021: £128.6m). The movement in post-IFRS 16 net debt, beyond the change in cash noted above, is due mainly to an increase in \nlease liabilities of £46.6m, driven by timing of lease renewals and investments in new branches, and a currency movement of £14m on bond debt. \nLeverage continued to come down towards the Group’s medium-term targets and finished the year at 2.8x and 1.8x on post-and pre-IFRS 16 bases \nrespectively (2021: 3.2x and 2.5x respectively).\nCash flow \n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\nUnderlying operating profit\n80.2 \n41.4 \nDepreciation\n73.2 \n68.3 \nAmortisation\n3.2 \n3.4 \nUnderlying EBITDA\n156.6 \n113.1 \nIncrease in working capital \n(14.4)\n(85.4)\nRepayment of lease liabilities\n(60.1)\n(57.3)\nCapital expenditure\n(14.5)\n(18.6)\nCash exceptional items\n(14.7)\n(10.9)\nOther\n1.9\n(15.0)\nOperating cash flow1\n54.8\n(74.1)\nInterest and financing\n(28.8)\n(22.7)\nRefinancing cash costs\n(1.1)\n(16.9)\nTax\n(14.3)\n(10.4)\nFree cash flow1\n10.6\n(124.1)\nAcquisitions and investments\n(27.5)\n(10.6)\n(Repayment)/drawdown of debt\n(1.4) \n52.0 \nTotal cash flow\n(18.3)\n(82.7)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of the year2\n145.1 \n235.3 \nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes\n3.3\n(7.5)\nCash and cash equivalents at end of the year2\n130.1 \n145.1 \n1.\t \u0007Free cash flow represents the cash available after supporting operations, including capital expenditure and the repayment of lease liabilities, and before acquisitions and any \nmovements in funding.

Interest and financing costs increased as a result of the full-year impact of interest on the €300m bond and a £1.7m \nincrease in interest on lease liabilities. Tax paid increased due to increased profits in the tax-paying mainland European businesses. “Other” includes \npayments to the Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) to fund share plans of £4.0m, and a £2.5m annual payment to the UK pension scheme, offset by \nnon-cash items and proceeds on sale of property, plant and equipment. \n65\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

Those \nsubsidiaries sold an insulation product manufactured by a third party, \nand made requested adaptations to the product prior to selling it. The \nclaim relates to the adaptations.\nSubsequent to the year end, the Group has obtained additional \nindependent technical expert input on the matter, which is currently \nbeing discussed with our customer. This matter may give rise to a \npossible further obligation whose existence will be confirmed only by the \noccurrence of uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the \nGroup. Given the outcome of the matter remains highly uncertain at this \nstage, the Group cannot estimate the possible further financial impact \nin the event that the subsidiaries were determined to have any further \nobligation arising from this matter. Further information about the matter \nand its possible outcomes are not provided, as such disclosures could \nprejudice the position and interests of the Group in this matter.\nGoing concern\nThe Group closely monitors its funding position throughout the year, \nincluding monitoring compliance with covenants and available facilities \nto ensure it has sufficient headroom to fund operations. The Group’s \nfinancing facilities and compliance with its banking covenants are \ndetailed above. \nFinancial review\nThe Directors have considered the Group’s forecasts which support the \nview that the Group will be able to continue to operate within its banking \nfacilities and comply with its banking covenants. The Directors have \nconsidered the following principal risks and uncertainties that could \npotentially impact the Group’s ability to fund its future activities and \nadhere to its banking covenants, including:\n•\thigh levels of product inflation, and current economic and political \nuncertainties across Europe, all potentially impacting market demand;\n•\tpotentially recessionary conditions in the coming year; and\n•\tmaterial shortages impacting our ability to meet demand and hence \nhaving an impact on forecast sales.\nThe forecasts on which the going concern assessment is based have \nbeen subject to sensitivity analysis and stress testing to assess the \nimpact of the above risks and the Directors have also reviewed mitigating \nactions that could be taken. Details are set out in the Viability statement.\nThe Directors have considered the impact of climate-related matters  \non the going concern assessment and this is not expected to have  \na significant impact on the Group’s going concern assessment to  \n31 March 2024. \nOn consideration of the above, the Directors believe that the Group \nhas adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the \nforecast period to 31 March 2024 and the Directors therefore consider \nit appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 2022 \nfinancial statements.\nViability statement\nIn accordance with Provision 31 of the Corporate Governance Code, the \nDirectors have undertaken an assessment of the viability of the Group. \nIn making this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have \nperformed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the \nGroup, including those that would threaten its business model, future \nperformance, solvency or liquidity. Details of the risk identification and \nmanagement process as well as a description of the principal risks and \nuncertainties facing the Group are included in this Strategic report on \npages 56 to 61. The Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage \nthese risks successfully.\nThe Board has determined that a three-year period to 31 December \n2025 is the most appropriate period of assessment. Whilst the Board \nhas no reason to believe the Group will not remain viable over a longer \nperiod, three years has been chosen as this aligns with the Group’s \nmedium-term planning process and is considered the period over which \nit has reasonable visibility of the market and industry characteristics to  \nbe able to develop reasonable forecasting assumptions and perform  \na realistic viability assessment.\nThe assessment process and key assumptions \nIn making the Viability statement, the Directors are required to consider \nthe Group’s ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due, taking into \naccount the Group’s current position and principal risks.\nThe Group has a strong liquidity position at 31 December 2022 following \nthe robust trading performance during the year and the availability of \nthe £90m RCF. In December 2022, the Group extended its RCF by \n£40m, utilising the accordion feature of the existing RCF and bringing \nthe total committed facility to £90m. The increased RCF, which was \nentered into on the same terms as the existing £50m facility, will be used \nto provide additional committed standby liquidity given the uncertain \nmacro environment and to potentially take advantage of additional \nprofit and cash flow enhancing opportunities in the medium term. The \nGroup has committed facilities in place until 2026, comprising €300m \nfixed rate secured notes and the £90m RCF. The secured notes are \n66\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

The RCF was undrawn at  \n31 December 2022.\nAs part of the Group’s financial and strategic planning process,  \nthe Group has prepared financial forecasts for the three years to  \n31 December 2025. \nThe process included a detailed review of the forecasts, led by the Chief \nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with input from operational \nand functional management, and these forecasts were approved by  \nthe Board.\nIn order to assess the resilience of the Group to threats posed by the \nprincipal risks in severe but plausible scenarios, the Group’s financial \nforecasts were subjected to thorough multi-variant stress and sensitivity \nanalysis together with an assessment of potential mitigating actions. This \nmulti-variant stress and sensitivity analysis included scenarios arising \nfrom combinations of the following:\nScenario\nLink to principal risks and \nuncertainties\nThe implications of a challenging economic \nenvironment, in particular the potential \nimpacts of continued inflationary pressures, \nhave been modelled by assuming a severe \nbut plausible reduction in revenue and gross \nmargins in each of the three years.\n−\tMacroeconomic \nuncertainty \n−\tChange management\nThe impact of the competitive environment \nand softening of the construction market \nwithin which the Group’s businesses operate \nand the interaction with the Group’s gross \nmargin have been modelled by assuming a \nsevere but plausible reduction in revenue and \ngross margins during the three-year period.\n−\tMacroeconomic \nuncertainty \n−\tChange management \n−\tEnvironmental, social \nand governance\nThe impact of completing future acquisitions \nwhich do not deliver desired value creation \nor which take place as one or more of the \nabove scenarios begins to develop has \nbeen modelled by assuming a cash outflow \nin conjunction with a downside scenario in \nrevenue and gross margin. \n−\tMergers and \nacquisitions \n−\tMacroeconomic \nuncertainty\nThe resulting impact on key metrics was considered with particular \nfocus on solvency measures including liquidity headroom and financial \ncovenants where relevant. Under each of the scenarios considered, the \nforecasts indicate significant headroom during the three-year period. \nUnder a scenario including a combination of the above resulting in a 75% \nreduction in underlying operating profit from base forecasts in 2023, \n63% in 2024 and 57% in 2025, the analysis shows that sufficient cash \nwould be available without the need to draw on the RCF and therefore \nno covenant tests would apply. Reverse stress testing has also been \nperformed to analyse the level of revenue, operating profit and cash \nreductions over and above the scenario considered above that could \nbe experienced before the RCF becomes drawn and there is a potential \nbreach in the leverage covenant in the period under review. \nThe Directors have considered the potential impact of climate change \non the viability assessment. At the current time, no legislation has been \npassed that will impact the key assumptions used in the forecasts and \nthere are no overriding changes to key assumptions relating to climate \nchange built into the forecasts. The costs of implementing the Group’s \nstrategy of replacing the current fleet with lower carbon alternatives as \nand when leases naturally renew are factored into the Group’s forecasts. \nClimate change also presents a significant number of opportunities for \nthe Group which are built into the Group’s strategy. There is therefore not \nconsidered to be a significant risk of climate change causing a significant \ndownturn in cash flows across the Group over the viability assessment \nperiod and therefore no specific sensitivities relating to climate change \nare considered necessary over and above the sensitivities already \nperformed above. \nAfter conducting their viability review, and taking into account the \nGroup’s current position and principal risks, the Directors confirm \nthat they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to \ncontinue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the \nthree-year period of their assessment to 31 December 2025.\nCautionary statement\nThis Strategic report has been prepared to provide the Company’s \nshareholders with a fair review of the business of the Group and a \ndescription of the principal risks and uncertainties facing it.

      "text": "Chairman’s introduction\nContinued focus\nDear Shareholder\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Group’s Corporate \nGovernance report on pages 68 to 131.\nThe Group produced encouraging financial results for 2022, with an \nincreased profit from the previous year, margins improving towards \nour long-term goal of 5% and a positive cash result. On behalf of the \nBoard, I would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and \nachievements during the year. \nIn September 2022 we announced that Steve Francis would be stepping \ndown as Group CEO on 1 February 2023 and that Gavin Slark would \nbe joining SIG to take up the Group CEO role from that date. I wish to \nexpress my sincere thanks to Steve for the role that he played as Group \nCEO from February 2020. Steve oversaw the successful equity raise \nin 2020 that recapitalised the balance sheet and from there led the \nsuccessful turnaround of the Group, culminating in the return to profit in \n2021 and the generation of free cash flow in 2022. We welcomed Gavin \nto the Board in February 2023 and I look forward to working with him in \nbuilding upon the foundations that Steve laid for SIG for the future. \n2022 was marked by stability and continuity in terms of personnel at the \nBoard and in the ELT. There were no appointments to or resignations \nfrom the Board that took effect during the year. There was only one \nchange in the ELT, with no changes in the holders of the Managing \nDirector roles amongst the operating companies. This year the Board \nundertook an internal evaluation and I was pleased that this platform of \nstability and continuity produced a highly encouraging set of results. The \nBoard is not complacent as to the challenges that 2023 and beyond will \nprovide, but shareholders can take assurance that the Board is operating \nas a cohesive and effective body. The Board has developed relationships \nwith the ELT that are challenging, where required, but are respectful and \nsupportive. Further detail concerning the evaluation exercise can be \nfound on page 87. \nI would also like to take this opportunity to address our relationship with \nthe Company’s largest shareholder, CD&R. CD&R holds c29% of the \nshares in SIG, a stake that it took up in 2020 largely as part of the  \nequity fundraising. CD&R has two Directors appointed to the Board,  \ncurrently being Bruno Deschamps and Christian Rochat. CD&R has  \nthe right to appoint one member of the Remuneration Committee \n(currently Bruno Deschamps) and the Nominations Committee (currently \nChristian Rochat) and to appoint an observer to the Audit & Risk \nCommittee. Further details of the relationship with CD&R can be found \non page 83.\nThe recent Board evaluation exercise demonstrated that the other \nDirectors recognise and value the contribution made to the Group by \nBruno and Christian: their contributions are not limited to representing \nthe interests of CD&R’s funds which are invested in SIG. They each bring \na wealth of sector experience and wider knowledge that enhances the \ndiscussions at Board and contributes to the making of better decisions.\nThe Board is aware that the Code provides for a Remuneration \nCommittee to consist solely of independent Directors and that Bruno is \ndeemed to be non-independent by virtue of his relationship with CD&R. \nTo that extent, the Company is therefore not compliant with this provision \nof the Code. However, the Board’s opinion is that the Remuneration \nCommittee benefits from Bruno being a member of the Committee and \nwere he not a member the Committee would need to consider how to \nreplace the contribution that he makes. \nAs there were no changes in the make up of the Board in 2022, there \nis no difference in the gender diversity of the Board from the previous \nyear. The Board comprises ten Directors of whom two are women, with \none-third of the independent Non-Executive Directors being women. \nThe Board includes one Director from an ethnic minority background. \nThe Board is aware of the importance of making progress on diversity \nin general and in particular on gender diversity on the Board. The \nNominations Committee commenced steps during the year in this \ndirection, and further details can be found in the Nominations  \nCommittee report on page 91. \nFor 2021 SIG reported against eight of the eleven Taskforce on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommended disclosures. I am \npleased that for 2022 we have reported against all eleven of the TCFD \nrecommended disclosures. Finally, a year ago we published a set of \nfocused sustainability commitments and our first report on the progress \nwe have made towards fulfilling these commitments is contained in the \nStrategic report set out at pages 26 to 54. \n2023 Annual General Meeting\nThe Annual General Meeting will be held on 4 May 2023 at the offices \nof Allen & Overy LLP, One Bishops Square, London, E1 6AD. If you \nare unable to attend and you have any questions, please email them \nto cosec@sigplc.com in advance of the meeting. We will ensure the \nanswers to your questions are provided at the meeting. Further details  \nof the arrangements for the AGM will be sent to shareholders shortly.  \nI warmly extend the invitation to all shareholders to join us in person at  \nthe AGM. \nAndrew Allner \nChairman\n7 March 2023\n69\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

The additional Board meeting was held to agree the terms of Steve Francis stepping down \nas Group CEO and the appointment of Gavin Slark as Group CEO.\n2.\t \u0007This year there were three scheduled Nominations Committee meetings and two additional Nominations Committee meetings. The additional meetings were held in connection \nwith the Group CEO transition.\n3.\t The Chairman attended all four Audit & Risk Committee meetings.\n4.\t Ian Ashton attended all four Audit & Risk Committee meetings and those sections of the Remuneration Committee meetings to which he was invited by the Chair of the Committee.\n5.\t \u0007Steve Francis attended all four Audit & Risk Committee meetings as well as those sections of the Remuneration Committee meetings to which he was invited by the Chair of the \nCommittee.\n6.\t Simon King was unable to attend one Board meeting due to an engagement which he was unable to reschedule.\n7.\t Gavin Slark was appointed a Director on 1 February 2023, being after the year end, so was not a Director during the period covered by the table.\nThe table shows those meetings that each Director attended as a \nmember rather than as an invitee. Where “N/A” appears in the table the \nDirector is not a member of the Committee although may have attended \nthe meeting; please see the footnotes to the table. Directors do not \nparticipate in meetings when matters relating to them are discussed.\nThe Chairman holds meetings with the Non-Executive Directors without \nthe Executive Directors present. During 2022, several such meetings \nwere held. The Senior Independent Director also meets with the other \nindependent Non-Executive Directors without the Chairman present, in \nparticular when the performance of the Chairman is being considered. \nAll Directors attended the 2022 AGM. The meeting was open to \nshareholders to attend. \nDirectors’ conflicts\nEach Director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid any \nsituation where they have, or can have, a direct or indirect interest \nthat conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Company’s interests. \nProvision 7 of the Code also requires the Board to take action to \nidentify and manage conflicts of interest, including those resulting from \nsignificant shareholdings and to ensure that the influence of third parties \ndoes not compromise or override independent judgement. This duty is \nin addition to the obligation that they owe to the Company to disclose to \nthe Board any transaction or arrangement under consideration by the \nCompany in which they have, or can have, a direct or indirect interest. \nDirectors of public companies may authorise conflicts and potential \nconflicts, where appropriate, if a company’s Articles of Association \npermit and shareholders have approved appropriate amendments.\nProcedures have been put in place for the disclosure by Directors of any \nsuch conflicts and also for the consideration and authorisation of any \nconflicts by the Board. These procedures allow for the imposition of limits \nor conditions by the Board when authorising any conflict, if they think this \nis appropriate. These procedures have been applied during the year and \nare included as a regular item for consideration by the Board at each of \nits meetings. The Board believes that the procedures established to deal \nwith conflicts of interest are operating effectively, they are periodically \nreviewed to ensure they are fully compliant with the Code. \nAs part of the review of conflicts, the Directors confirmed they have no \nconnection with the external search firm Korn Ferry whose services \nwere used in connection with the appointment of the new Group Chief \nExecutive Officer. The Savannah Group and Odgers Berndtson were \nused during the year in connection with other senior recruitment activity. \nAll Directors are required to complete and disclose a gifts and hospitality \nform confirming the offering or receipt of any gifts or hospitality offered or \nprovided as a result of their directorship of the Company in accordance \nwith the Group’s Gifts and Hospitality policy.\nThe Board is aware of the other commitments of the Directors and is \nsatisfied that these do not conflict with their duties as Directors of the \nCompany and that the influence of third parties does not compromise  \nor override their independent judgement.\nCulture and purpose\nThe Board ultimately has responsibility for ensuring that workforce \npolicies and practices are in line with the Group’s purpose and values, \nand support the desired culture throughout the Group. This involves \nreviewing policies and practices that have an impact on the experience \nof the workforce and drive behaviours e.g. recruitment and retention, \npromotion and progression, performance management, training and \ndevelopment, reskilling and flexible working. The Board considers \nthat the Group operates a risk-aware culture with an open style of \ncommunication, which seeks to identify problems and issues early \nwherever possible. Where issues are identified, the Board endeavours \nto take action to remedy any areas of concern.\nCorporate governance report | Board activities\nBoard leadership and Company purpose\n2\n1\n3\n4\n5\n74\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

All employees, including the \nBoard, and contractors are asked to complete online training on each \nof these policies. Completion of this training is tracked, and reminders \nissued when required, to ensure that the training is completed. As new \npolicies are developed, appropriate training is provided to all employees. \nThe Board agrees that the right culture is key to future success and \nwhilst SIG’s culture varies between countries, the goal is to create a \nwinning, vibrant and modern culture which combines discipline, clear \nexpectations and effective processes with entrepreneurial spirit. The \nGroup has made consistent progress with embedding this within the \nworkforce in recent years. \nSee page 16 of the Strategic report for more details.\nSite visits are invaluable to the Board, enabling the Directors to meet \nmembers of staff and local management and gain a better insight into \nnot only the culture and purpose in the working environment, but to \nalso understand the functions of the branches and any restrictions or \nopportunities they face. In turn, the decisions made at Board level factor \nin all of these considerations and hence are better informed. As a Board, \nthe Directors visited four sites during the year. The Directors were able to \nsee first-hand how health and safety, culture and purpose are embedded \nand understood within the business. There was positive feedback from \nemployees and the Board following these visits.\nThe Group is committed to investing in, and rewarding, its workforce \nand accordingly it continues to develop and improve upon local \nrecognition programmes, which recognise outstanding work, efforts \nand achievements that are aligned with Group behaviours.

Further details can be found on pages 80 and 81.\nWorkforce engagement during Board visits\n•\tThe Board visited colleagues at the SIG Distribution Centre and the \nSIG Roofing branch in Leeds, UK. The Directors were given a tour of \nthe branches following which they joined branch colleagues for lunch \nand a presentation on sales performance and logistics. \n•\tBoard members also visited the SIG Bedford branch to view the health \nand safety procedures in operation at the site. The Directors were \njoined by colleagues from the branch for an informal lunch.\n•\tAdditionally, Board meetings are principally held at the offices at one  \nof SIG UK’s principal distribution sites in Colnbrook, Slough.\nAnnual employee survey\nThe third employee engagement survey was launched in September \nand the results were reported to the Board at its December meeting. \nConsistent with the first two surveys, the employee NPS methodology \nwas used for the 2022 survey. The survey’s principal focus concerned \nthe question “how likely is it that you would recommend SIG as an \nemployer?”. There were subsets of the survey which focused on key \nthemes such as: vision and leadership, culture, management, job \nsatisfaction, teamwork and collaboration, health and wellbeing, learning \nand development, communication, and customer focus. Overall, the \nresults of the survey were encouraging. The response rate was 73%, \nbeing above the benchmark average, which is a strong indicator of a \nworkforce’s engagement levels. \nDuring December 2022 the results of the survey were also reported \nto the ELT. Thereafter the results were cascaded to local business \nmanagement teams to enable plans to be drawn up at branch or \ndepartment level (as appropriate). Progress against these plans will be \nmeasured, reported and communicated internally on a regular basis.\nFocus on data\nTo monitor culture and engagement within the business, the Board \nreceives and reviews reports on the data sets recommended in the \nguidelines produced by the Financial Reporting Council.

The CEO and \nCFO are primarily responsible for investor relations. This has \nbeen further enhanced during the year with the appointment \nof a Head of Investor Relations. The Board is kept informed of \ninvestors’ views through the regular distribution and discussion \nof analysts’ and brokers’ briefings and a summary of investor \nopinion feedback. In addition, feedback from major shareholders \nis reported to the Board by the Chairman, CEO and CFO and \ndiscussed at its meetings. Formal presentations are made to \ninstitutional shareholders following the announcement of the \nGroup’s annual and interim results.\nThe Chairman believes in regular and transparent communication \nwith shareholders and makes himself available as required \nduring the year. The Chairman held discussions with several of \nSIG’s institutional shareholders during the year. These meetings \nrelayed the strategy and direction of the business, while enabling \nhim to understand their views on matters such as sustainability, \ngovernance and performance. Contact is also maintained, where \nappropriate, with shareholders to discuss overall remuneration \nplans and policies. The Chairman and the Senior Independent \nDirector are available to discuss governance and strategy with \nmajor shareholders if requested, and both are available for contact \nwith individual shareholders, should any specific areas of concern \nor enquiry be raised. The Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee \nand the Chair of the Remuneration Committee are also available \nfor contact with shareholders should there be any matters raised \nwhich are relevant to their area of responsibility and both are \navailable to answer questions at our AGM. During the year, the \nChair of the Remuneration Committee met with a number of \nshareholders to discuss proposed changes to the Directors’ \nremuneration policy at the next AGM. \nThe notice of AGM is sent to shareholders at least 21 clear \ndays before the meeting. The Group provides a facility for \nshareholders to vote electronically by proxy, and the form of \nproxy provides shareholders with the option of withholding \ntheir vote on a resolution if they so wish. At the AGM in May \n2023, shareholders will be asked to vote on a poll, rather than a \nshow of hands, following best practice. The General Counsel & \nCompany Secretary ensures that votes are properly received and \nrecorded.

It \ntherefore follows that the Directors \nconsider that shareholders’ views \nare important as part of their \ndecision-making process and \nwelcome discussions with them, \nparticularly in relation to strategy, \nperformance, remuneration and \ngovernance. \nSIG seeks to ensure that there is active \nengagement with all shareholders, which is \nachieved through the publication of the annual and \ninterim reports, Stock Exchange announcements, \nthe AGM, online presentations of the half-year \nand full-year results by the CEO and CFO, \ninvestor roadshows and analyst presentations, \nas well as meetings between shareholders and \nDirectors, including the Chairman and Chairs \nof Board committees. During the year there \nwas specific engagement by the Chairman and \nby the Chair of the Remuneration Committee \nregarding, respectively, the CEO transition and \nthe revised Directors’ remuneration policy to be \nput to shareholders at the AGM in May 2023. In \naddition, there has also been engagement with \nvarious proxy advisors to ensure that shareholder \nsentiment regarding a range of issues is also given \ndue consideration.\n•\tResponding to shareholder feedback in finalising the amended \nDirectors’ remuneration policy to be put to shareholders at the \nupcoming AGM.\n•\tAppointment of a dedicated Head of Investor Relations to \nprovide improved engagement with investors.\n•\tContinued focus on SIG’s sustainability commitments.\nColleagues\nSIG is a people business: \nengagement by the Group with \nits stakeholders is through its \npeople. Accordingly, engagement \nby the Group with its workforce \nunderpins SIG’s success. SIG’s \ngrowth and sustainability depends \non having the right company \nculture, supported by suitable \nbehaviours and with a clear \npurpose. \nThe Board Workforce Engagement programme \ncontinued and was expanded in 2022. As Covid-19 \nrestrictions were no longer in place it was possible \nto hold in-person meetings in all but one of the \noperating companies. The Board-Designated Non-\nExecutive Director, Simon King, once again led \nthe programme and participated in every meeting. \nThese sessions gave opportunity for employees \nto raise and discuss in an informal manner their \nexperiences, both positive and negative, and \nto identify key priorities and opportunities for \nimprovement. \nSIG also conducted its annual all-employee \nengagement survey. This was the third year of the \nsurvey, meaning that the Board is starting to be \nable to identify longer-term trends in employee \nsentiment. The results of the survey were reported \nto the Board together with an analysis of the results \nand a roadmap for how management will be taking \nforward its actions in response to the findings. \n•\tThe Board was mindful of the impact of high levels of inflation \nduring the year on the Group’s workforce. The Directors \nreceived regular reports from management as to the actions \nbeing taken in each country of operation to respond to and \nmitigate the effects of the high cost of living. Further details of \nthe financial responses taken by operating companies can be \nfound on pages 40 and 41.\n•\tThe Board also sought assurance from management that \nall employees had access to and were aware of the Group’s \nwellbeing and mental health services.\n•\tHealth and safety continues to be a cornerstone of the Group’s \nbusiness. The Board received an update at every meeting from \nthe Group Health, Safety and Environment Director in order to \nmonitor the continued improvement of the Group’s health and \nsafety processes. \n•\tFollowing feedback from the previous year’s workforce \nengagement exercise, the UK business revised its in-house \ntraining programmes to offer greater “hands on” training to \nenable colleagues to better advise customers.\nCustomers\nUnderstanding the needs and \nrequirements of our customers is \nhugely important and the Group \nseeks to use this knowledge \nto partner effectively with our \ncustomers.

For larger \ncustomers there is also engagement at a regional \nor national level within operating companies. The \nBoard receives regular updates from management \nduring the year to enable the Directors to \nmonitor such engagement and to offer guidance \nwhen appropriate.

      "text": "Why we engage\nEngagement activities\nActions taken\nSuppliers\nSIG enjoys a pivotal position in \nindustry supply chains: we connect \nsuppliers and customers in ways \nin which they would be unlikely to \nachieve without SIG’s presence. \nWe are a principal route to market \nfor many of our suppliers and we \nseek to add value for our suppliers \nby operating as their supply chain \npartner of choice. We engage with \nour suppliers to understand their \nbusinesses and to identify ways \nin which we can work with them \nstrategically. \nEngagement with suppliers most frequently relates \nto immediate or short-term trading matters. There \nis also engagement that relates to longer-term \nissues. During the year, one area of substantial \nengagement with suppliers concerned the \navailability of certain products in consequence of \nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine. The disruption \nof the supply of certain metal products that were \nmanufactured in Ukraine, and the impact on \nthe supply of timber following the imposition of \nsanctions on Russia, required some businesses \nin the supply chain to seek alternative sources of \nsupply. A second area of substantial engagement \nconcerned the continuing long-term trend to \ndevelop and identify products that have a lower \nenvironmental impact.\n•\tObtaining alternative sources of supplies of products where \nthe original source of supply was impacted as a consequence \nof the Russian invasion of Ukraine. \n•\tIn order to comply with good business practice and its ISO \n9001:2015 accreditation, SIG UK issued a questionnaire for all \nits suppliers. This helped identify existing and new suppliers \nwho are able to assist SIG UK with maintaining a consistently \nhigh standard of quality throughout the business.\n•\tContinued to evolve and develop the response to, and \npartnering with, suppliers to ensure SIG is at the forefront of \nsustainability in the construction industry.\nLenders\nSIG operates with a level of debt. \nSome of this debt is to support the \nGroup’s short-term working capital \nrequirements, including seasonal \nfluctuations, whilst other elements \nof SIG’s debt have a longer-term \nprofile. Working in partnership with \nour lenders is therefore important to \nensure that we have the appropriate \nfinancial structure to support the \nGroup’s day-to-day business as well \nas future growth and expansion.\nIn November 2021, the Company issued a \n€300m bond listed on The International Stock \nExchange in the Channel Islands and entered \ninto a £50m Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”) with \na syndicate of banks. During 2022, there was \nregular engagement with credit rating agencies on \nbusiness performance and with the lenders of the \nRCF, particularly in relation to the exercise of the \naccordion facility within the RCF.\n•\tIn December 2022, the Company exercised the accordion \nfacility in the RCF to increase the maximum size of the RCF \nfrom £50m to £90m (all of which was undrawn at the year \nend). This step was taken as a prudent and cost-effective \nmeasure to provide an enhanced liquidity position for  \nthe Group.\n•\tThe Board received regular updates on tax and treasury \nmatters from the CFO with the Group Head of Tax and \nTreasury also presenting an update on key matters to the \nAudit & Risk Committee during the year.\nPension scheme members and trustees\nThe Group operates four pension \nschemes which provide defined \nbenefits based on final pensionable \nsalary, the largest of which is in \nthe UK alongside three overseas \nschemes. The UK defined benefit \nscheme is closed to new members \nand has an age profile that is rising. \nThe overseas book reserve schemes \nremain open to new members. We \ncurrently engage with the trustees \nof the UK scheme to ensure that \nthe views and concerns of these \nimportant stakeholders are \nconsidered, and the schemes  \nare appropriately governed.\nThe Group has regular dialogue with the trustees \nof the UK pension scheme to discuss the ongoing \nmanagement of the scheme. Furthermore, SIG \nis in contact with scheme members through \nthe publication of regular newsletters. In 2022, \nthere was considerable communication with \nboth the trustees and the members of the UK \nscheme in relation to the transition to a sole \ntrusteeship model. In addition, there was significant \ncommunication with members concerning an \nexercise to increase flexibility and options for plan \nmembers around taking their retirement benefits. \n•\tThe trustee structure of the UK pension scheme was \namended in the year with a professional trustee firm being \nappointed as the sole trustee of the scheme. The Group \nengaged with the outgoing trustees and the professional \ntrustee firm to ensure a smooth and controlled transition. The \nmembers of the scheme were made aware of the transition \nthrough the member newsletter that is routinely circulated.\n•\tA member options exercise was conducted in the year to \nallow members to have more options on their retirement \nbenefits. Through the process, the Group and the trustees \nengaged on a very frequent basis to ensure the exercise was \ncompleted thoroughly and in line with scheme rules. Regular \ncommunication was also sent to the members, via individual \nletters, to set out their personal retirement benefit options plus \nthe process they needed to follow if they wished to engage in \nthe exercise.\nLocal community\nSIG’s businesses operate at the \nlocal level. This is a reason why \nthe Group’s strategy places strong \nemphasis on colleagues who work in \nbranches and distribution centres, \nand who otherwise engage directly \nwith customers and suppliers on \na daily basis. Accordingly, the \nDirectors recognise that close \nrelationships with the communities \nin which SIG’s businesses operate \nhelp to foster the long-term success \nof the business. SIG is part of its \nlocal communities, and its actions \nshould have a beneficial impact on \nthose communities.\nThere were a great number of collaborations \nacross the Group, which are too numerous to list \nindividually. \nPlease see page 44 for examples of the engagement \nactivities and actions taken.\nCorporate governance report | Engagement with our stakeholders\nBoard leadership and Company purpose\n2\n1\n3\n4\n5\n78\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "Why we engage\nEngagement activities\nActions taken\nEnvironment\nSIG has a long-standing \nenvironmental heritage. The \nDirectors appreciate that \nenvironmental matters are \nimportant to all stakeholder \ngroups who are calling on \ncompanies to do more on key \nsustainability topics and to be \nmore transparent about their \nefforts. This resonates with the \nGroup’s strategic pillar regarding \n“responsible actions” under which \nSIG seeks to ensure that its people \nfeel safe, proud and valued. SIG \nseeks to operate sustainably for \nthe benefit of communities and  \nthe environment.\nThe sustainability committee meets monthly, sponsored \nby the CEO. The committee is chaired by the Chief \nPeople Officer and is attended by the CEO and CFO \ntogether with senior representatives from all operating \ncompanies and functional experts from Group. The \nsustainability committee’s actions are the groundwork \nfor the sustainability strategy of the Group, including \nthe monitoring of performance towards the Group’s \nsustainability commitments. Whilst the sustainability \ncommittee is not a formal Board committee, its activities \nare reported regularly to the Board, by way of written \nBoard reports and presentations made to the Board.\nSee pages 26 to 36 of the Strategic report for details \nof the actions taken.\nExample of how the Directors applied their Section \n172 obligations\nResponse to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022\nThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022 had many \nconsequences that impacted the Group. Some of these were apparent \nrelatively quickly whilst others were consequences of actions taken by \nnational governments and the EU in response to the invasion. Examples \nof the consequences that were considered by the Board included:\n•\tDisruption of availability of products manufactured in Ukraine.\n•\tCessation of products from Russia in consequence of sanctions \nimposed on Russia.\n•\tIncrease in demand for alternative products, with impact on the price \nof those products.\n•\tIncrease in the cost of products more generally due to impact on \nenergy prices of the imposition of sanctions on Russian oil and gas.\n•\tContribution of these factors to increasing inflation, affecting all \nemployees and especially those on lower salaries.\n•\tDirect humanitarian impact of Ukrainian citizens leaving Ukraine for \nsecurity reasons, notably in Poland which shares a land border with \nUkraine.\n•\tWider humanitarian consequences, through the settling of Ukrainian \ncitizens across Europe or through the support of Ukrainians remaining \nin Ukraine.\nThe actions taken in response to these matters included:\nRisks and mitigation\n•\tUsing the WorldCheck One® risk intelligence database to screen our \ntop suppliers and other critical counterparties for sanction risks. This \nexercise is performed regularly to ensure our approach remains robust \nas sanctions regimes evolve.\n•\tUse of an external Corporate Intelligence and Sanctions team to \nprovide elevated due diligence where necessary.\n•\tImplementing a specific sanctions policy and rolling out online training \nfor relevant employees. \n•\tReviewing cyber risk and scanning third parties for increased risk of \ncyber-attack, for example counterparties based in countries such as \nBelarus or where the ultimate beneficial owner of a counterparty was \nbased in such a country.\nColleagues\n•\tSupported the fundraising efforts of colleagues across the Group. SIG \nmatched all employee donations made to the Disasters Emergency \nCommittee (“DEC”) Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal.\n•\tIn terms of response to the cost of living pressures on employees, \nplease see the actions described on page 103.\nCustomers\n•\tTo ensure that stock availability was maintained, alternative suppliers \nwere identified and, following the appropriate sanctions checks, were \nengaged.\n•\tThere was clear communication with customers regarding SIG’s \npolicies and procedures with regards to SIG’s approach to sanctions.\nSuppliers \n•\tAs described in the section headed “Risks and mitigation”, we quickly \ndevised and implemented arrangements to ensure that appropriate \nactions were taken to identify counterparties who were on a relevant \nsanctions list. \n•\tThis monitoring also identified third parties who were not directly \nimpacted by sanctions but were relatively high risk. This enabled \nmanagement to make decisions as to whether to continue to engage \nwith those parties. \nCommunities\n•\tSIG Poland was, through proximity to Ukraine, the most directly \naffected operating company. SIG Poland took immediate action to \nsupport the people of Ukraine and set up a funding account with a \nlocal charity organisation, making a significant donation to the account. \nSIG Poland, and its employees, also contributed in other ways, such as \ndonating paint and time to redecorate a hostel used to home families \nfleeing the conflict in Ukraine.\n•\tAll of the operating companies made contributions to support the \nwelfare of those seeking refuge in countries outside of Ukraine. In total, \nthe value of these contributions exceeded £285,000 (€342,000).\nShareholders\n•\tUltimately, all of the actions taken by SIG were for the benefit of \nshareholders and support the Group’s seven-pillar strategy.\n•\tAll of the actions are the hallmark of a responsible business.\n79\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

      "text": "Corporate governance report\nBoard leadership and Company purpose\n2\n1\n3\n4\n5\nWorkforce engagement \n \nwith Simon King, Designated Non-Executive Director\nThe Workforce Engagement programme  \nfor 2022 was carried out through site visits  \nin the UK, Ireland and mainland Europe  \nwith small groups comprising a cross section \nof employees, representing all levels, regions \nand functions. This allowed for contributions \nfrom all attendees and gave insights into all \nareas of the Group. During these meetings  \nI met with more than 170 colleagues from \nacross the Group. \nThe aim is to encourage meaningful dialogue between a Non-\nExecutive Director and employees. In the sessions everyone has \nscope to speak freely and ask questions. The role of the Designated \nNED for Workforce Engagement is to offer perspective from the \nBoard and factor employee feedback into Board level decision-\nmaking where relevant and appropriate. Any issue or escalation \narising in a meeting is addressed attentively but neutrally and \nbrought to the attention of senior management for follow-up. The \nBoard receives a regular update on the sessions from me. Feedback \nfrom employees during the sessions is not attributed to individual \nemployees. \nFor consistency, I asked the same three questions this year as I had \nasked the previous year. The three questions I asked were:\n•\tWhat has gone well in SIG (locally or corporately) in the last year?\n•\tWhat has not gone so well in SIG in the last year?\n•\tIf you were in charge, and budget was not a constraint, what would \nbe the one thing you would make happen at SIG?\nEach attendee had the opportunity to make their point on each \nquestion. Often the points colleagues made encouraged discussion \nwhich provided a rich source of insight. \nBranch visits \nIt was a privilege to visit a selection of SIG sites across Europe and \nthe UK in person during 2022. I was delighted to note the rise in \nconfidence across the teams and it is evident that we have the right \nlocal strategy in place. It was uplifting to hear the teams speak about \nwinning local business. Trust in the leadership and support from the \nGroup function and senior leadership is growing and this is further \nboosting the growing confidence. \n•\tThe French teams from both Larivière and LiTT acknowledge the \nstrong, diverse leadership that has been consistently developing \nover the last five years. They really appreciate the trust given to \nbranches to make decisions at a local level and several also took \nthe opportunity to push hard for regional investment to grow the \nbusiness further. At a branch in Lille our discussion was followed \nby a lunch with the whole team to celebrate their achievement as \nthe fastest-growing branch in France. During this event it became \napparent that everyone in the team had a voice and heart and \ncared deeply about their branch: lorry drivers in the distribution \nteam made awards to colleagues in the finance team, while one \nof the sales team presented an award to a driver for outstanding \ncustomer service, as he had looked after a loyal customer who had \nno electricity by taking them coffee and croissants which he had \npaid for out of his own pocket! \n•\tIn Poland the team are suitably proud of the leap forward they have \nmade in digitalisation within their business, having spent many \nyears building the right foundations. They are clearly working in \ncross-functional teams to bring efficiency and service enabled by \nthe digital world for the benefit of both colleagues and customers. \nWith the evident cooperation between teams, they are a great \nexample for other SIG teams to learn from.\n•\tThe team in Cambuslang (Scotland) made an impression, setting \nout their vision for helping to improve SIG’s sustainability credentials \nand making sure this was integral to all their local decision-making.\n•\tThe Ireland team’s development of their health and safety culture \nand wellbeing was great to see and has set an example to the rest \nof the Group. A big part of their focus is on self-help; starting each \nday with a safety briefing, making sure everyone in their team looks \nout for each other.\n•\tRespecting both the customer and the needs of the construction \nindustry have been brought to a new level in Germany where the \ndynamic new leadership team has listened to customer feedback \non how to build a modern business. They are strongly recovering  \nan old business and are enjoying and celebrating their success step \nby step.\nI really enjoyed hearing from all our teams across the Group about \ntheir passion for SIG; whether it’s bringing apprentices into SIG \nto develop our future teams faster and better, or suggestions \nfor changes that can be implemented to improve sustainability \ncredentials.\n80\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "The three principal insights I took from these meetings were: the teams were \nextremely supportive of SIG, want the Group to succeed and are confident  \nin our locally-led strategy; staff felt that communication had improved within \nthe Group; and our peoples’ desire for training and development, so they  \ncan further improve services to customers, remains undimmed.\nAs in previous years, it was also important for me to hear feedback on areas \nwhere we can improve, and colleagues were encouraged to raise matters \nthat could be done better and to speak honestly about their constructive \nfeedback. Many of the comments related to the cost of living pressures \naffecting staff and customers. I am pleased that many of these issues are \nbeing addressed within the operating companies and that we are providing \nhelp and support for our colleagues. I was again struck by the fact that  \nmany of the business-related issues raised with me concerned matters  \nthat, if fixed, would provide a better customer experience, or would benefit \nthe Group in some way.\nI greatly enjoyed hearing from my colleagues on their ideas for how  \nto improve SIG: their passion for our business really shone through.  \nEven though they were asked to assume no limitation on budget and with  \nthe freedom to do anything, colleagues invariably chose local matters and  \nto make their part of the business better. This is a great cultural strength from \nhard-working, dedicated teams. I was especially encouraged that many of the \nsuggestions involved sustainability issues. Many were innovative and most \nwould improve the customer experience, and ESG was a major topic this year \nas our colleagues embrace our sustainability messaging and targets. \nWhat has gone \nwell in SIG?\nWhat has not \ngone so well?\nWhat would be \nthe change you \nwould make?\nI shared these insights with my Board colleagues during the year and we considered this feedback in \nconjunction with the results of the employee engagement survey to identify common themes, which the  \nBoard in turn fed back to management.\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials\n81\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "Time commitments\nThe Board has satisfied itself that there is no compromise to the \nindependence of those Directors who have other appointments in \noutside entities. The Board believes each of the Non-Executive Directors \nbrings his/her own senior level of experience and expertise, and that \nthe balance between non-executive and executive representation \nencourages healthy independent challenge. \nPrior to their appointment, Directors are required to disclose any other \nsignificant outside directorships. The Nominations Committee reviews \nthe other commitments of Directors upon appointment, upon any \nproposal for reappointment and following any change in roles, to ensure \nthat the Board is satisfied that each of the Directors has sufficient time \nto undertake their role and responsibilities towards the Group. Directors \nare aware that they must not take on additional external appointments \nwithout the prior approval of the Board. \nDuring 2022, approval was given to Gillian Kent prior to taking up the \nroles as non-executive director of Marlowe plc and of THG plc. Simon \nKing was granted approval prior to him taking up the role as non-\nexecutive director of James Donaldson Group Ltd. Board approval \nwas given to Alan Lovell prior to him being appointed Chair of the \nEnvironment Agency and to Kath Durrant prior to her appointment  \nas a non-executive director for Essentra plc.\nInformation and support\nTo enable the Board to perform its duties efficiently and effectively, the \nDirectors have full access to all relevant information and to the services \nof the General Counsel & Company Secretary, whose responsibility it \nis to ensure that Board policies and procedures are followed, including \nformal minuting of any unresolved concerns that any Director may have \nin connection with the operation of the Group. During the year there were \nno such unresolved issues.\nThere is an agreed procedure whereby Directors wishing to take \nindependent legal advice in the furtherance of their duties may do so at \nthe Group’s expense. Further, on resignation, if a Non-Executive Director \nhad any concerns, the Chairman would invite them to provide a written \nstatement for circulation to the Board. The appointment and removal of \nthe Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board.\nThe Board and its Committees are provided with sufficient resources  \nto undertake their duties. Appropriate training is available to all Directors \non appointment and on an ongoing basis as required. \nThe Group operates a paperless meeting system for the Board and its \nCommittees. Using an electronic system for meeting packs supports \nour online drive across the Group and is consistent with reducing the \nimpact of our operations on the environment. It is also more secure \nthan distribution of paper or via email. The Board receives papers \ncirculated through the portal in advance of each Board meeting as well \nas information between Board meetings on matters such as analyst and \nshareholding reports and flash results. There is also a separate “Reading \nRoom” within the portal where Directors can access information such \nas corporate policies, daily sales information, the Articles of Association, \nGroup and organisational structures, Board dates and contact details.\nBoard arrangements\nThe General Counsel & Company Secretary attends all Board meetings \nand is at hand to answer questions or offer independent advice or \nexpertise to Directors, should that be required.\nComposition and succession\nThere were no appointments to or resignations from the Board that took \neffect during the year. In September 2022, it was announced that Steve \nFrancis would step down as Group CEO and a Director on 1 February \n2023 and that Gavin Slark would be appointed as his replacement as \nGroup CEO on that date. Gavin was also appointed a Director on  \n1 February 2023.\nElection and re-election of Directors\nUnder the Articles of Association, all Directors are subject to election \nat the AGM immediately following their appointment and to re-election \nevery three years. However, in accordance with the Code, all Directors \nseek election or re-election at the Company’s AGM each year. \nThe Board believes the success of the Group going forward will be \nachieved by the continued success of the strategy of returning to \nprofitable growth by maintaining a leading market position, with a \nmodernised operating model, effective partnerships with customers and \nsuppliers, developing high-performing people and becoming a more \nsustainably responsible business. The contribution of the whole Board is \nessential in delivering this strategy. In accordance with Provision 18, the \n2023 notice of AGM includes the skills and experience that each Director \nhas, and a statement as to why their contribution is and continues to be \nimportant to the Group’s long-term sustainable success, which enables \nshareholders to make their own informed decisions on the election or \nre-election of Directors.\nAndrew Allner brings varied and substantial board and general \nmanagement experience to the Group. He has an in-depth \nunderstanding of corporate governance having served as a director  \nand chairman of several listed companies.\nGavin Slark has a long track record of success in the pan-European \nconstruction distribution industry. He also has significant experience as \nGroup CEO of listed businesses.\nIan Ashton has extensive and broad global experience in financial \nleadership roles. He has a strong track record of driving change and \ndelivering value to stakeholders. \nAlan Lovell brings significant listed company board experience, both as \nan executive and non-executive director. He has extensive experience in \nthe UK and in Europe in the Group’s key sector of construction. \nGillian Kent is an experienced non-executive director having served on \na number of listed boards and as a member of audit, remuneration and \nnomination committees. She brings a valuable perspective with specialist \nknowledge in the development of e-commerce and software businesses \nand expertise in building product markets and brands. \n85\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

She has \nsignificant international and industry knowledge gained from her roles \nat Ferguson and CRH. Kath also has extensive experience of working in \nbusinesses undergoing transformation. \nShatish Dasani is an experienced public company CFO and audit \ncommittee chair as well as having strong international experience across \nseveral sectors relevant to SIG’s business. \nChristian Rochat has informed the Company that he will not seek \nre-election at the AGM and will therefore stand down as a Director on  \n4 May 2023.\nTo enable shareholders to make an informed decision, the 2023 notice \nof AGM includes biographical details and a detailed statement as to \nwhy the Group believes that those Directors seeking election/re-election \nshould be elected/re-elected. \nIt is the view of the Board that each of the Non-Executive Directors \nstanding for re-election brings considerable management experience \nand an independent perspective to the Board’s discussions and each is \nconsidered independent of management. Each of the independent Non-\nExecutive Directors standing for re-election is considered free from any \nrelationship or circumstance that could affect, or appear to affect, the \nexercise of their independent judgement.\nThe Chairman intends to confirm at the AGM that, as evidenced by \nthe internal 2022 Board evaluation process, the performance of each \nindividual continues to be effective, that each Director acts with integrity, \nleads by example, promotes the desired culture and demonstrates \ncommitment to the role.\nThe terms of the Directors’ service contracts are disclosed in the \nDirectors’ remuneration report on page 119. Full details of Directors’ \nremuneration, interests in the share capital of the Company and of share \noptions held are set out on pages 123 in the Directors’ remuneration \nreport. Directors’ service contracts and the letters of appointment of the \nNon-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s \nregistered office and will be available at the 2023 AGM.\nSkills and experience\nThe Board evaluation, described on page 87, identified that the \nBoard encompasses a wide range and combination of different skills, \nexperience and knowledge, ranging from accounting to strategy and \ndistribution to stakeholder engagement. \nTraining and induction\nThe Chairman reviews with the Board its training and development \nneeds. During the year, the Directors attended training sessions on \nvarious subjects, including their duties as directors concerning health \nand safety under UK law. All Directors receive induction training on their \ndirectors’ duties, the responsibilities of a premium listed issuer, and the \ncontinuing obligations of a company admitted to the premium listing \nsegment of the Official List of the FCA. The Board also receives regular \npresentations from advisors and senior management on a range of \ntopical issues, such as from the Group’s financial advisors in relation to \nthe macroeconomic and industry backdrop and sector dynamics that \nSIG faces.\nOn appointment, Directors receive an induction to the Group. This \ninvolves meetings with each Board member, members of the ELT, \nexternal advisors (such as brokers, auditors and financial advisors),  \nvisits to a number of branch locations, and receipt of a pack of corporate \nmaterials including corporate policies and procedures and details \nof insurance, financial framework and significant shareholders. The \nprogramme ensures that they are well briefed on current key Board \ntopic areas, the Group’s strategy, purpose and structure, stakeholder \nengagement activities, Group operations, finance and the industry.\nDiversity policy\nThe Board recognises that diversity of gender, social and ethnic \nbackgrounds and cognitive and personal strengths is important to the \nsuccess of the organisation. These areas are matters of key focus for the \nNominations Committee, together with the HR team, as they continue to \ndevelop diversity within the organisation during 2023 and beyond.

      "text": "The Code requires the Company to undertake an annual evaluation \nof the performance of the Board and its committees. The Company \nundertook an external evaluation in 2021, supported by Manchester \nSquare Partners, and the exercise in 2022 was conducted on an  \ninternal basis.\nThe Board approved a questionnaire to be completed by all Directors \nwith some questions requiring, in addition, open text comment answers. \nThe questionnaire focused on several key topics aligned to the Code, \nincluding Board leadership and culture; Group purpose and strategy; \nand Board and ELT composition and succession, including DEI. There \nwere subsets of the questionnaire specific to each of the Audit & \nRisk Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Nominations \nCommittee. \nThe responses to the questionnaire were reviewed by the General \nCounsel & Company Secretary and discussed with the Chairman, and \nwith the Chairs of each of the Committees regarding the sections of the \nquestionnaire specific to those Committees. As part of the evaluation, \nthe Chairman met with the Non-Executive Directors individually to \ndiscuss the feedback on their performance, and the Senior Independent \nDirector met with the Chairman to discuss his performance. \nThe principal finding from the review was that the Board and its \nCommittees were effective and worked well during the year. It was noted \nthat 2022 was the first year in a considerable period that there had not \nbeen any new appointments to the Board or departures from the Board. \nGiven the significant turnover in Board representation in the years that \npreceded 2022, this stability was most welcome as it enabled the Board \nto build further on the foundations that had been laid in 2020 and 2021 in \nensuring that the Board operated in a productive manner. \nIn establishing its priorities for 2023, the Board was particularly mindful \nof two factors. Firstly, the importance of ensuring that the CEO transition \nproceeds smoothly and that Gavin Slark’s onboarding as Group CEO \nis a success. This onboarding is a priority not only for the initial period \nof the handover by Steve Francis, but across the whole year, to ensure \nthat Gavin is properly established in role. The second factor of which the \nBoard was mindful is that 2023 will, almost inevitably, present tougher \ntrading conditions in all of the Group’s countries of operation than \nexperienced during most of 2022. It is therefore prudent to set objectives \nfor the Board, and its Committees, that are sensitive to these demands.\nBoard evaluation\nThe Board priorities for 2023 include:\n•\tensuring a smooth transition from Steve Francis to Gavin Slark as \nGroup CEO and a successful onboarding of Gavin Slark through 2023;\n•\tensuring an appropriate balance between longer-term vision and \nresponding to shorter-term volatility; and\n•\ta focus on technology issues and modernisation.\nFurther information on the objectives set by each Committee for 2023 \ncan be found in their reports.\nThe Board set a number of objectives for itself and its Committees for \n2022. Ongoing progress on these objectives was reported to the Board \nby the General Counsel & Company Secretary at each Board meeting, \nmeaning that the Board was able to review progress on a regular basis. \nThe Board also reviewed the wider economic circumstances prevailing \nduring the year, and particularly unforeseen circumstances such as the \nRussian invasion of Ukraine, persistent high inflation and rising interest \nrates leading to worsening trading conditions, to assess whether the \nobjectives set at the start of the year remained a priority.\nThe majority of objectives set for 2022 were addressed either in whole \nor in part during the year. Where an objective was satisfied in part during \n2022, it is expected that further progress will be made during 2023. For a \nsmall number of objectives, the Board decided during the year that they \nwould be deprioritised as the time and commitment of the Board or the \nappropriate Committee was better used in addressing other matters that \nhad arisen during the year. The Board is satisfied that in such cases it \nwas appropriate to take this action, in the best interests of the Company \nand its stakeholders. \n87\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

      "text": "Dear Shareholder,\nI am pleased to present the Nominations Committee Report for the \nfinancial year ended 31 December 2022 on behalf of the Board.\nThe composition of the Nominations Committee meets with the \nrequirements of the Code with the majority of members being \nindependent (five out of seven members were independent and I \nwas independent on appointment) and, in line with good practice, \nmembership is reviewed annually.\nA principal activity of the Committee during the year was the \nannouncement in September 2022 that Gavin Slark had been appointed \nas the Group’s new Chief Executive Officer with effect from 1 February \n2023, replacing Steve Francis who stepped down as Group CEO on  \nthat date. The Committee was delighted to secure Gavin as the Group’s \nCEO and the announcement in September was the culmination of \nconsiderable work by the Committee, management and our advisors  \nin the period leading up to that announcement. \nDuring the year the Committee also progressed its review of succession \nfor senior roles and of the talent and capabilities of the ELT, as it had \nstated last year that it would do. \nRecent years have, rightly, seen an increased focus by companies and \ntheir stakeholders on diversity and inclusion. The Committee devoted \nattention to this important subject during 2022, as we had said that we \nwould do, and a revised Diversity, Equality and Inclusion policy was \nlaunched in Q4 of 2022, and a Group-wide DEI forum was established \nwith representatives from across the business to develop our framework  \nand deliver actions in this area. The Committee is aware that the  \nGroup remains a work in progress in these areas and is committed  \nto continuing to seek to make progress in 2023. \nAs at the year end, my current term of office was due to expire on  \n31 October 2023. In light of the appointment of a new Group CEO  \non 1 February 2023, the Board took the decision in March 2023 to renew \nmy term for an additional 3 years, to 31 October 2026 to ensure a period \nof continuity as Gavin is onboarded as Group CEO.\nAndrew Allner \nChair of the Nominations Committee\n7 March 2023\nIndependence of Directors\nas at 7 March 2023 \nSummary of Directors’ skills1 \nAs at 7 March 2023 \nAge of Directors\nas at 7 March 2023 \nBoard ethnic background\nas at 7 March 2023 \nBoard gender diversity\nas at 7 March 2023 \n  Independent \n  Not independent \n  Male \n  Female \n50%\n50%\n40%\n60%\n90%\n10%\n80%\n20%\n  50–60 years\n  60+ years\n  White British/other White\n  Asian/Asian British\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nStrategy\nTransformation/Turnaround \nChange Management\nStakeholder Engagement\nWorkforce Engagement\nCultural Engagement\nLegal\nRetail\nDistribution\nInformation Security\nTechnology/Digital\nTransportation/Fleet Management\nHealth & Safety\nEnvironmental/ESG\nAccounting/Auditing\nTreasury Management\nMarketing\nM&A/Corporate Transactions\nProperty Management\nListed Company experience\nInternational\n26\n24\n25\n27\n25\n23\n13\n12\n17\n18\n24\n20\n12\n19\n21\n18\n18\n14\n23\n27\n26\nThe information contained above was sourced directly from each \nof the Directors.\n1.\t The Board were asked to score themselves from 0 (no/little experience) to 3 (detailed knowledge/experience) to give a score out of 30 for each topic.\n89\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

The quorum for meetings is three members, the majority \nof whom must be independent Non-Executive Directors. Members of the \nCommittee are not involved in matters affecting their own position.\nThe Committee comprises the Chairman and six Non-Executive \nDirectors of whom five are independent Non-Executive Directors.  \nNo Executive Directors are appointed to the Committee; however,  \nthey may attend by invitation if the matters to be discussed require  \ntheir participation. Attendance at meetings is set out on page 74.\nBoard balance, composition and skills \nThe Board comprises ten Directors: the Chairman of the Board, two \nExecutive Directors, and seven Non-Executive Directors, of whom five \nare independent Non-Executive Directors. \nA principal activity of the Committee in 2022 was the appointment of \nGavin Slark as Group CEO, replacing Steve Francis who stepped down \nas Group CEO on 1 February 2023. The Committee engaged Korn Ferry \nto support it during the recruitment process. A long-list of candidates \nwas prepared and considered by the Committee, from which it felt that \nGavin Slark was the outstanding candidate due to his tenure within the \nbuilding materials distribution industry and his previous track record as a \nlisted-company CEO, notably at Grafton Group plc. The Committee was \ndelighted that the Group was able to announce in September 2022 that \nGavin would be joining SIG in February 2023. \nDuring the year, and in accordance with its usual practice, the \nCommittee also reviewed the wider composition and balance of the \nBoard. The review considered the membership of the Committees of the \nBoard, the balance on the Board between Executive and Non-Executive \nDirectors, the tenure of the Directors, diversity on the Board and the \nindependence of the Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive \nDirectors, other than Bruno Deschamps and Christian Rochat who are \nCD&R representatives on the Board, are considered independent as at \nthe date of this report. On appointment to the Board, the Chairman was \nconsidered independent in accordance with the terms of the Code.\nFor more information on biographical details for each \nDirector see pages 70 to 71.\nIn making recommendations for the annual re-election of the Chairman \nand Non-Executive Directors, the Committee considers the skills, \nknowledge, experience, independence and the time commitments  \nof each Director to ensure that they have sufficient time to fulfil their \nresponsibilities to the business. All Directors will accordingly be put \nforward for election or re-election at the 2023 AGM, with the exception  \nof Christian Rochat who is to stand down and will not seek re-election. \nIn its most recent report, the Committee stated that it would consider \nduring 2022 whether to recommend to the Board the adoption of a policy \non external commitments held by Non-Executive Directors. The Committee \nwas mindful that whilst the Code does not prescribe specific limits on \nthe number of other directorships a Non-Executive Director may hold, a \nnumber of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies have \nissued such guidance. Having considered the matter during the year, the \nCommittee has concluded at this time not to make any recommendation \nthat SIG adopts a formal policy on external board appointments. \nHowever, the Committee takes shareholder opinions on over-boarding \nseriously and due consideration is always given to such concerns where \na Director requests permission to take up a further appointment. \nExecutive Leadership Team \nThere was one appointment made to the ELT during the year. Julie \nWestcott joined as Group Health, Safety and Environment Director, \nreplacing the previous holder of the role, which further strengthened the \nleadership in this area while also improving the gender diversity of the ELT. \nIn its previous report, the Committee stated that during 2022 it would \nundertake a review of the talent and capabilities of the ELT. Parsons \nConsulting were engaged to support this exercise, which ran through \nthe year. The results of the exercise were reported to the Committee and \nindividual plans have been put in place for each ELT member to further \ntheir development. The Committee also said that it would undertake a \nsimilar exercise for colleagues who report to an ELT member and Parsons \nConsulting were also engaged to provide support on this exercise. \nBoard succession planning\nDuring 2022, as it stated it would do, the Committee commenced the \nexercise of a more structured and formal review of talent, management, \nperformance and the capability of the Board. Savannah Group were \nengaged to assist in this exercise as it relates to the skills of the Non-\nExecutive Directors in particular. The majority of the time devoted by the \nCommittee during the year to Board succession was in relation to the \nGroup CEO transition, for understandable reasons. The work concerning \nbroader Board succession planning will continue during 2023.\n90\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "Diversity\nThe Board acknowledges the importance of diversity in its broadest \nsense in the Boardroom as a driver of Board effectiveness. The Board \nrecognises that gender, ethnic, social and cultural diversity of boards are \nsignificant aspects of diversity and acknowledges the role that women \nand those of different ethnic, social and cultural backgrounds with the \nright skills, experience, cognitive and personal strengths can play in \ncontributing to diversity of perspective in the Boardroom. The policy on \nBoard diversity was reviewed and updated by the Board during the year \nand is available on the Group’s website (www.sigplc.com). \nGender diversity is a significant aspect of diversity. The Board comprises \nten Directors, of whom two are women. Of the six independent Non-\nExecutive Directors, one-third are women. CD&R has the right to \nappoint two Directors, under the Relationship Agreement, and CD&R’s \ntwo appointees to the Board are both male. On a statistical level, this \nmakes meeting higher thresholds of gender diversity more challenging. \nThe Board is compliant with the Parker Review recommendations for \nFTSE250 companies as it includes one Director of an ethnic minority \nbackground.\nThe Committee receives regular information on diversity from across the \nGroup except from those countries where the law does not permit such \ninformation to be gathered. The Group continues to ensure where possible \nthat recruitment for any new roles has a short-list of diverse candidates. \nInformation on the gender balance of senior management is on page 42.\n2022 saw SIG establish a Group-wide DEI forum, including \nrepresentation from each operating company, which contributed to \nthe new DEI policy published during the year (and available on the \nCompany’s website www.sigplc.com).

The Board delegates \nresponsibility to the Audit & Risk Committee to consider the adequacy of \nthe risk management and internal control framework, to agree the risk-\nbased internal audit programme and to ensure the risk management and \ninternal control structure and frameworks are robust.\nThe ELT has responsibility for ensuring that risk management is \nembedded into all processes and for ensuring that risk profile is in \nline with the approved risk appetite. Local controls managers support \nprocess owners to develop controls and to test their effectiveness. \nGroup Internal Audit is responsible for providing independent assurance \non the quality of the risk management processes, developing a risk-\nbased internal audit programme and providing independent assurance  \nto the Board and the Audit & Risk Committee that the controls in place \nare designed appropriately and operating effectively.\nThe Group Internal Audit function comprises an in-house team \nsupported by external resources, where necessary, to assist in providing \nassurance on specialist areas. The Board regularly reviews the need for \nthe Group Internal Audit function and the effectiveness of the co-source \narrangement.\nInformation on audit can be found in the Audit & Risk Committee Report \non pages 94 to 100.\nKey elements of ongoing process for risk \nmanagement and internal control\nGroup Internal Audit periodically reviews local risk management \narrangements in order to provide reasonable assurance to both the Audit \n& Risk Committee and the Board that appropriate internal controls have \nbeen implemented to mitigate the likelihood of risks materialising and \neffectively minimising potential impacts arising. In addition, on at least \nan annual basis, the Group Director of Audit and Risk meets with the \noperating company leadership teams to perform a detailed review of \ntheir key strategic risks and uncertainties, which is used as an input to \nthe annual Group strategic risk review.\nThe key elements of the existing systems for risk management and \ninternal control, in accordance with the FRC’s Guidance on Risk \nManagement and Internal Control and Related Financial and Business \nReporting (September 2014), are as follows:\nRisk management\n•\tThe documented Group risk management framework, approved by \nthe Audit & Risk Committee, provides an overview of the agreed risk \nmanagement processes within the Group and gives practical guidance \nto operating companies and individual functions on the management \nof risk. \n•\tIn accordance with the Group risk management framework, the Group \nDirector of Audit and Risk works with operating companies and central \nfunction leadership teams to ensure appropriate local risk registers are \nmaintained.\n•\tThe Board maintains an overall Group risk register, the content of \nwhich is reviewed and assessed at least twice a year by the Board \nand includes regular input from the Audit & Risk Committee. A review \nof the Group’s principal risks and how it manages or mitigates them is \npresented in the Strategic report on pages 56 to 61.\n•\tThe Group risk register has been reviewed and updated and contains \nthe principal risks faced by the Group, assessing the potential risk \nhaving taken into account likelihood, impact and the current controls \nto mitigate an identified risk and any further actions required to bring \nthe risk to within risk appetite. Once identified, emerging risks are \nassessed by identifying and mapping out the core elements of the \nrisk, identifying owners for each element in the operating companies, \nholding workshops with risk owners to assess the level of risk, \nidentifying potential mitigating actions that reduce the impact of the risk \nand seeking external guidance if required. Potential emerging risks are \nmonitored and assessed regularly during the year by the Audit & Risk \nCommittee for their relevance and significance.\nThe Audit & Risk Committee regularly assesses the Group’s emerging \nand principal risks and considers that its assessment is robust. The Audit \n& Risk Committee reports to the Board following its assessments. A \nconsolidated Group strategic risk report was prepared for review by the \nELT and was recommended to the Board for approval in early 2023.\nInternal control\nThe Group assurance framework is the basis on which the Group \nControls and Internal Audit teams base their annual plan. The controls \nplan for 2022 was defined, communicated and agreed with operating \ncompanies, and the teams made progress on the delivery of the plan. \nThe teams support the creation and maintenance of a robust financial \ncontrol environment, and they raise controls awareness across SIG \nby providing operating company and Group functions with practical \nand hands-on support and advice. Group Internal Audit proposed and \ndelivered a rolling audit plan for 2022 across the Group, together with  \na branch audit programme.

Detailed control frameworks are in place for key processes \nand management is actively working to embed these in all parts of \nthe Group and to enhance our risk-based approach to continuous \nmonitoring of control effectiveness. I am confident this will continue  \ninto 2023.\nThe Committee’s terms of delegation from the Board already included \na number of risk matters and, beyond the formal scope of delegation to \nthe Committee, it has in practice included principal risk areas within its \nambit for some time. During the year the decision was taken to formalise \nthe Committee’s remit with regard to risk and to update the Committee’s \nname accordingly to the “Audit & Risk Committee”. \nThe Committee held four meetings in 2022. I also had regular meetings \nwith the CFO, General Counsel & Company Secretary, Group Director \nof Audit and Risk, Group Financial Controller, and the external Auditor \nto discuss key financial, control and risk issues and to review agenda \nitems and papers for forthcoming Committee meetings. In addition to \nthe ongoing review of key judgements applied to financial statements, \nassurance reports and risk registers, the Committee’s work during the \nyear covered the following key areas:\n•\treview of the work of the Group Controls team as it continues to \nsupport development and formalisation of the controls framework \nacross the Group. The activities of the team in 2022 included the \ncontinued enhancement and documentation of RACMs across the \noperating companies covering nine key financial processes (order \nto cash; procure to pay; HR & payroll; cash management; inventory \nmanagement; supplier rebates; customer rebates; fixed assets; \nand financial close), reviews over Group functions to identify and \ndocument process-level and entity-level controls, and working with \neach operating company to identify, document and build out the ITGC \nenvironment;\n•\tconsideration of the adequacy and robustness of the risk management \nframework to ensure that the organisation’s principal risks and \nuncertainties are identified and assessed, and actions implemented to \nmitigate either the likelihood of risks arising or the potential impact of \nrisks materialising;\n•\tTCFDs became the standard of climate-related reporting for premium \nlisted companies with accounting periods beginning on or after  \n1 January 2021. The Committee has again carefully examined the four \npillars and 11 recommended disclosures to determine the Group’s \nability to report against each of them and I am pleased to say that SIG \nhas reported against all this year;\n•\toversight of the development of a standalone sanctions policy to \nensure that the Group was compliant with the sanctions implemented \nfollowing the invasion of Ukraine. This also included the development of \nprotocols and procedures to identify and mitigate potential risk posed \nby third parties with whom the Group engaged; and\n•\tthe Committee also monitored the increasing risk to cyber security. \nAreas under review included business continuity, cyber and data \nsecurity and ITGCs.

      "text": "Significant financial judgements \nThe Committee considered a number of significant issues during the year. These related to areas requiring management to exercise particular \njudgement or a high degree of estimation. The Committee assesses whether the judgements and estimates made by management are reasonable \nand appropriate. The issues and how they were addressed by the Committee are set out below:\nKey financial reporting and significant financial judgements  \nconsidered in relation to the financial statements\nHow the issue was addressed by the Committee\nCarrying value of goodwill \nand intangible assets\nThe carrying value of goodwill and intangible \nassets is reviewed at the mid-year point and at \nyear end. The Group estimates a recoverable \namount for each individual cash-generating unit \n(“CGU”) based on forecast revenues, operating \nmargins and discount rate risk adjusted where \nappropriate.\nThe results of the 2022 impairment review have been reviewed. \nThe Committee noted the continued increase in headroom due \nto the strong trading performance and increased forecast \nprofits over the next three years for most CGUs. An impairment \nwas, however, recognised in Benelux given ongoing operational \nissues faced and losses incurred during the year. The Committee \nconsidered the appropriateness of the assumptions and the \nsensitivity analysis performed. \nRecognition of deferred  \ntax assets\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused \ntax attributes to the extent that it is probable \nthat taxable profit will be available against which \nthe attributes can be utilised. The Group has \nsignificant potential deferred tax assets which \nare currently unrecognised relating mainly to \ncumulative UK tax losses and other deductible \ntemporary differences.\nThe Committee considered the judgement made that there is \nnot sufficient convincing evidence at 31 December 2022 that \nsufficient future taxable profits will be available to allow the \nutilisation of the deductible temporary differences, considering \nthe forecast taxable profits of the UK tax group, the timing of \npotential unwind of the deductible timing differences and \ncurrent macroeconomic uncertainty, and is satisfied with the \njudgement made.\nRecognition and \nmeasurement of supplier \nrebate income\nProcedures and controls are in place to ensure \nthat the reporting, reviewing and accounting for \nsupplier rebate income is properly managed  \nand that supplier rebates are recognised \nappropriately in the Consolidated financial \nstatements.\nThe Committee considered the adequacy of work performed in \nthe year to gain assurance that procedures and controls in \nplace were effective. \nDisclosure of Other items\nThe Group presents income statement items in \nthe middle column of the Consolidated income \nstatement, entitled Other items, when they are \nsignificant in size and nature, and either do not \nform part of the trading activities of the Group  \nor where their separate presentation enhances \nunderstanding of the financial performance  \nof the Group.\nThe Committee carefully considered the judgements made  \nin the separate disclosure of Other items. In particular, the \nCommittee sought to ensure that the treatment followed \nconsistent principles and that reporting in the Consolidated \nfinancial statements is suitably clear and understandable.\nGoing concern basis and \nviability statement\nThe Group is required to assess if it has access \nto sufficient resources to continue as a going \nconcern and assess the period of viability.\nThe Committee considered the review of going concern and \nlonger-term viability performed by management and reviewed \nthe financial statement disclosures. On the basis of the \nfinancing the Group has in place and the Group’s latest \nfinancial forecasts, the Committee is satisfied with the \nconclusions over going concern and longer-term viability. \nContingent liability \ndisclosure\nThe Group discloses contingent liabilities of \nwhich it is aware at the date of signing the \nfinancial statements. Subsequent to the \nyear-end, additional independent technical \nexpert input has been obtained relating to legal \nproceedings being brought by a customer in \nBelgium, which may give rise to a possible \nfurther obligation and is disclosed as a \ncontingent liability in Note 29 to the \nConsolidated financial statements.\nThe Committee considered the supporting information in \nrelation to the ongoing claim, the additional input obtained and \nthe potential impact this may have. On the basis that this is a \npossible future obligation whose existence will be confirmed \nonly by the occurrence of future events not wholly within the \ncontrol of the Group, the Committee is satisfied that the \nconclusions reached and the disclosures included in the  \nAnnual Report and Accounts are appropriate. \n97\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

Internal audit forms \nan independent and objective assessment as to whether risks have been \nadequately identified, adequate internal controls are in place to manage \nthose risks, and whether the controls are working effectively.\nThe Committee reviewed the remit, organisation, and resources of the \nfunction, together with the internal audit plan. The internal audit plan \nwas regularly reviewed during the year to ensure it remained aligned to \nthe key risks of the business and that the function was appropriately \nresourced. \nGroup Internal Audit undertakes independent and objective assessments \nto determine whether risks had been adequately identified, adequate \ninternal controls are in place to manage those risks, and those controls \nare working effectively. External resources continue to provide co-\nsourced support, when necessary, to Group Internal Audit to cover \nspecialist areas.\nAudit reports were presented to the Committee with areas of weakness \nresulting in action plans being developed and follow-up reports required \nto ensure that actions had been completed appropriately. The results of \nall audits have been presented to the Committee during the year, and \nfollow-up audit checks undertaken to establish that actions have been \ncompleted appropriately.\nExamples of internal audit reports issued during the year include:\n•\tUK HR and payroll internal control operational effectiveness testing;\n•\tGroup Treasury internal control operational effectiveness testing;\n•\tSIG Poland, capex, investment appraisal process reviews; and\n•\tSIG France SAP S/4HANA project review. \nConsistent with previous years, the Committee agreed the process for \nthe evaluation of the performance of the Group Internal Audit function \nwhich involved the circulation of a questionnaire tailored for several \nparticipating stakeholder groups. The questionnaire was sent to the \nCommittee, Executive Directors, Managing Directors and Finance \nDirectors of the operating companies, the external Auditor, and other key \nindividuals in functional areas. Members of the Internal Audit team were \nalso asked to complete a questionnaire by way of self-assessment. \nThe evaluation found that the Group Internal Audit function adds value, \nmaintains its independence, provides a broad range of assurance and is \neffective overall.\nThe areas of focus for 2023 were agreed by the Committee and include:\n1. \u0007continued focus on the timeliness of management’s response and \nimplementation of agreed actions;\n2. \u0007further develop the team induction process to ensure all team \nmembers are familiar with all business operations across the Group, \nincluding activities conducted only by certain operating companies; \nand\n3. review potential for greater use of data analytics in internal auditing. \nOversight of external Auditor\nErnst & Young LLP were appointed as the Group’s external Auditor \nin July 2018 following a tender. Shareholders formally approved their \nre-appointment at the Annual General Meeting in May 2022. There is \nno intention to conduct any re-tendering exercise currently, but this \nwill be reviewed annually, taking into account the performance and \neffectiveness of the Auditor, as assessed by the Committee.\nThe lead audit partner at Ernst & Young LLP completes his maximum \nterm of office following the conclusion of the audit of the 2022 financial \nstatements. During the year, meetings were held with other partners at \nErnst & Young LLP following which it was agreed that Mr Adrian Roberts \nwill replace Mr Colin Brown as the lead audit partner, with effect from \nthe conclusion of the 2022 audit. Mr Roberts observed a number of key \nmeetings during the 2022 audit process to ensure he is familiar with the \nGroup and its business, ahead of assuming the role of lead audit partner.\nExternal Auditor performance evaluation\nFor the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group assessed the external \nAuditor’s performance using a questionnaire sent to key finance and \nnon-finance stakeholders across the Group, a commentary-based \nsurvey of Committee members and a review of other published \ninformation on audit quality.\nThe questionnaire was sent to the Finance Director and Financial \nController of all in-scope operating companies together with all key \nmembers of the Group finance team and others who had involvement \nwith the Auditor, including Tax and Treasury, Company Secretariat, HR, \nRisk and Internal Audit. The questionnaire comprised 38 questions \ncovering a range of topics including the audit firm itself, the partner role \nand involvement, the audit team, audit planning and execution, fees, \ncommunication and governance and independence, with respondents \nasked to rate the Auditor on a scale of 1 to 5 and to provide any \nadditional comments alongside their ratings.\nOverall, the ratings were broadly consistent with or slightly higher than \nthe ratings for the previous year across all areas. The most notable \nincrease was in the area of the audit fee, which was the lowest scoring \narea last year. This is a result of higher ratings at Group level and in the \nUK, France and Germany, and a reduced level of overruns for 2021 \nfollowing smoother audit processes in most locations.\nResults from the feedback process have been shared with the external \nAuditor and a number of actions taken to address matters raised. The \nCommittee, having reviewed the performance and effectiveness of \nthe external Auditor, was satisfied with the independence, objectivity, \nexpertise, resources and general effectiveness of Ernst & Young LLP  \nand that the Group is subject to a rigorous audit process.\nExternal Auditor independence assessment\nThe Committee monitors the need for the external Auditor to have an \nappropriate degree of independence and objectivity.\nThe external Auditor reports to the Committee each year on the actions \ntaken to comply with professional and regulatory requirements and best \npractice designed to ensure its independence, including the rotation of \nkey members of the external audit team. Ernst & Young LLP has formally \nconfirmed its independence to the Committee in respect of the period \ncovered by these Consolidated financial statements.\n99\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

      "text": "Policy on non-audit services\nThe Group has a policy with regard to the provision of audit and non-\naudit services by the external Auditor, which operated throughout 2022. \nThe policy is based on the principle that the external Auditor should \nundertake non-audit services only where they are the most appropriate \nand cost-effective provider of the service, and where the provision \nof non-audit services does not impair, and could not reasonably be \nperceived to impair, the external Auditor’s independence and objectivity. \nIt categorises such services as auditor-permitted services, auditor-\nexcluded services and auditor-authorised services. The fees permissible \nfor non-audit services should not exceed 70% of the average audit fees \npaid to the Group’s external Auditor in the last three consecutive financial \nyears. The policy was reviewed during 2022 and will be reviewed \nannually and can be viewed on the Group’s website (www.sigplc.com). \nIt defines the types of services falling under each category and sets out \nthe criteria to be met and the internal approvals required prior to the \ncommencement of any auditor-authorised services. In all cases, any \ninstruction must be pre-approved by the CFO and the Committee Chair \nbefore the external Auditor is engaged. The external Auditor cannot be \nengaged to perform any assignment where the output is then subject \nto their review as external Auditor. The Committee regularly reviews \nan analysis of all services provided by the external Auditor. The policy \nand the external Auditor’s fees are reviewed and set annually by the \nCommittee and are approved by the Board. \nThe total fees payable by the Group to its external Auditor for non-audit \nservices in 2022 were £0.2m, primarily the interim review (2021: £0.4m). \nThe total fees payable to the external Auditor for audit services in respect \nof the same period were £2.7m (2021: £2.6m). Current year costs  \ninclude £0.1m in relation to the 2021 audit (2021: £0.3m in relation  \nto the 2020 audit).\nThe ratio of audit to non-audit fee was 13:1 in respect of the audit for \nthe current year.

Following this, the Committee \nhas reviewed the contents of this year’s Annual Report and Accounts \nand advised the Board that, in its view, the Annual Report and Accounts, \ntaken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the \nnecessary information to enable shareholders to assess the position and \nperformance, strategy and business model of the Group.\nIn reaching this conclusion the Committee has considered the following:\n•\tthe preparation of the Annual Report is a collaborative process \nbetween the Finance, Investor Relations, Legal, Company Secretariat, \nHuman Resources and Communications functions within the Group, \nensuring the appropriate professional input to each section.

Continuing market challenges regarding supply shortages \nand escalating price inflation have been managed well, although it is \nacknowledged that these issues are not yet behind us with inflation  \nbeing felt across Europe. Throughout the year the Group has continued \nto retain focus on core disciplines which has helped us to grow, \nimprove margins and regain market share. In addition, the search and \nsubsequent transition to a new CEO has proceeded smoothly with  \nSteve Francis stepping down and Gavin Slark taking up the position  \nfrom 1 February 2023. \nGroup performance \nMetric\n2022\n2021\nRevenue\n£2,744.5m\n£2,291.4m\nLike-for-like sales\n17%\n24%\nGross margin\n25.9%\n26.3%\nUnderlying operating profit\n£80.2m\n£41.4m\nAverage trade working capital to sales ratio\n14.6%\n13.8%\nUnderlying operating margin\n2.9%\n1.8%\nPerformance in 2022\nOverall, performance for the year was ahead of plan with the Group \nachieving a 2.9% underlying operating margin with momentum to \nimprove margins towards 5% over the medium term. Underlying \noperating profit almost doubled to £80.2m from £41.4m in 2021 and  \nthe Group also delivered a positive free cash flow for the year, an \nimportant milestone.\nFrance once again delivered a strong performance, delivering an \noperating margin of 5.2% and £35.8m of underlying operating profit. The \ngood progress in UK Interiors has continued, with the business delivering \n23% LFL revenue growth and moving back to profitability. UK Exteriors \ncontinued to trade well against some strong comparators despite \nsoftening in the RMI market. Underlying operating profit was however \nlower than 2021, due primarily to a £5m one-off loss as a result of its \nlargest customer Avonside going into administration. Germany, under \nnew, experienced and energetic leadership for well over a year now, \nperformed well and is creating the conditions for continued profitable \ngrowth. Our Polish business received multiple industry level accolades \nand is a standout performer in all respects across the Group. Benelux \nreported some good growth and began to recover market share, but \nmore work remains to be done to get the business fully back on track \nand profitable. Ireland delivered a resilient performance in a slightly \nweaker market. \nThe Group has been aided by inflationary tailwinds, but it is to the credit \nof our teams, and especially our highly engaged branches, that inflation \nhas been successfully managed whilst retaining our market position. \nPricing and commercial capability has been enhanced in each operating \ncompany.\nCash flow received much attention during the year and as noted we \ndelivered positive free cash flow. Working capital management is key to \nthis, and we focus and incentivise the businesses to ensure a sustainable \nand efficient approach. Behaviourally our teams are rightly keen to deliver \nfor the customer and, cognisant of the recent supply challenges faced \nacross the industry, they have tended to operate with caution in running \nwith slightly higher levels of stock. A continuous focus on improving \nworking capital management capability will remain important in  \ncoming years. \nNet debt was well managed during the year, and caution has been \nexercised in potential M&A activity. The accretive acquisitions undertaken \nin 2022 are performing to plan. Capital has been focused on branch \nupgrades and selectively on new branches, and in addition the timing of \nlease renewals has influenced post-IFRS 16 net debt. Heading into more \nuncertain times management’s focus on the balance sheet will continue \nto be important. Leverage continues on its downward trajectory towards \nour initial target of <2.5x on a post-IFRS 16 basis.\nIn the digital and e-commerce arena our Polish business has developed \nan outstanding trade-based model for customers to transact online, \nwith significant effects on typical basket size and volumes. Learnings \nfrom the Polish team are being shared across the Group, and indeed \nmodernisation in all its forms will be the subject of targets for each of  \nour operating company MDs in the years to come.\nManagement across the Group have taken on the sustainability \nchallenge – not only delivering effective TCFD reporting, but creating net \nzero roadmaps at a Group and operating company level and engaging \nwith local teams to address our sustainability challenges. Further work \nis being done to define product and service opportunities within the \nsustainability agenda. GHG emissions per £m of revenue decreased to \n17.5 metric tonnes from 23.0 metric tonnes in 2021, with total emissions \n9% lower than 2021 and 17% lower than the last pre-Covid-19 “normal” \nyear of 2019. Customer NPS improved again in 2022 with a 6-point \nincrease to +46, with employee NPS showing an 11-point improvement \nto +14. Whilst the LTIFR continues to show a downward trend to 11.1, \nthere is more work to do in this area and it will continue to be a key focus \nin 2023.\nTurning to the individual performance of the Chief Executive Officer and \nChief Financial Officer, clear objectives were set at the start of the year \nand agreed with the Committee. The Group’s performance management \nsystem supported the Committee’s consideration of personal \nperformance. More detail can be found on pages 122 and 123. \nCorporate governance and remuneration\nThe Committee sets high standards in corporate governance, and during \nthe year the Committee:\n•\twrote to our largest shareholders to understand their views on our \nproposed amendments to the remuneration policy and welcomed their \nfeedback;\n•\treviewed and approved remuneration proposals for Steve Francis \non his stepping down from the Board in February 2023 and the \nrecruitment of our new CEO, Gavin Slark;\n•\treviewed the effectiveness of the advice received from Korn Ferry in \nsupporting the Committee. The Committee is satisfied with the high-\nquality support and advice it receives from Korn Ferry;\n•\tconsidered the role of Bruno Deschamps, who is a member of the \nCommittee in line with the Relationship Agreement with CD&R. Whilst \nBruno is not considered independent under the Corporate Governance \nCode, the Committee believes Bruno’s contributions to the working of \nthe Committee are very positive and non-partisan, and demonstrate \nhis experience in considering remuneration, incentivisation and target-\nsetting issues for all levels of employees in the workforce – not just the \nExecutive Leadership Team;\n•\tengaged with employees on executive remuneration, from receiving \nfeedback via the employee engagement survey and key management \npersonnel who hold “townhall” meetings and directly engage with \nemployees on a day-to-day basis; \n102\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

It noted the areas of \ncommitment, focus and improvement being led by each operating \ncompany Managing Director and Human Resources Director; \n•\tapproved funding for the independently managed Employee Benefit \nTrust (“EBT”) to buy shares in the market; and\n•\tformally reviewed an analysis of the underpin and windfall tests that \napply to the Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”) awards.\nAn internal evaluation of the Committee was conducted for 2022 and \nfurther details can be found on page 87.\nRemuneration decisions\nThere were no matters that the Committee felt warranted the exercise  \nof its discretion during the year. \nChange of CEO\nFollowing three years leading and delivering the turnaround of SIG,  \nSteve Francis stepped down from the CEO role and from the Board  \non 1 February 2023 and was succeeded by Gavin Slark. \nSteve Francis has been treated as a good leaver under the incentive \nplans by the Committee reflecting the nature of the succession planning \nand his departure. Accordingly, his RSP Awards will be pro-rated to \nreflect the shortened period of his employment relative to their three-year \nterm. Annual bonus will be able to be earned for the part of the 2023 \nfinancial year that he is an employee and deferred bonuses will also run \ntheir normal course. There will be no acceleration of any vesting periods \nand the additional two-year holding periods will continue to apply. His \nsix-month notice period completed on 8 March 2023, and he will be \navailable under the terms of a consultancy agreement to assist until  \nthe end of April 2023. This ensures adequate continuity exists as  \nGavin settles into his role.\nAhead of the decision to offer the role of CEO to Gavin Slark, the \nRemuneration Committee discussed the proposed remuneration \npackage, with input from our remuneration advisors and the Chair. \nGavin Slark’s remuneration package is in accordance with our \nDirectors’ remuneration policy and provides incentives that are aligned \nto our strategy and commensurate with his role, responsibilities, and \nexperience. This package was necessary in a competitive market to \nsecure his recruitment and reflects his previous experience and level of \nremuneration. In summary, his base salary has been set at £675,000, \nwith the next review not expected until 1 January 2024.\nBenefits will be aligned with policy, including a car allowance of £23,000 \nper annum and pension allowances set in line with the workforce rate at \n5% of salary. \nIncentives will be aligned with our proposed policy with Gavin receiving a \npotential annual bonus of up to 150% of base salary, a third of which will \nbe deferred for three years. The RSP grant will also align with policy at \n125% of base salary. \nProposed remuneration policy \nAt the 2023 AGM, we are proposing an amended remuneration policy. This policy is substantially similar to the previous policy with no material \nchanges to our approach to remuneration. Our proposed changes and the rationale for each change has been included below. \nElement \nChanges to policy\nRationale\nPension \nPension contribution for all Executive Directors aligned at no more than \nthe rate applicable to the majority of the UK workforce.\nRemoved reference to a specific rate to clarify that the rate applied will be \nno higher than the prevailing workforce rate at the time i.e. it may change as \nthe workforce rate changes. \nAnnual  \nbonus plan\nRemoval of two-year holding period from deferred shares under the \nannual bonus plan.\nThis will align us with market practice and will ensure Executive Directors \ncan benefit from their shareholdings in a more timely manner.\nAllowing targets to be set for less than a financial year.\nThis flexibility may be useful in periods of significant uncertainty, for example, \nbut would not be the norm.\nSimplification of deferral to represent a third being deferred for  \nthree years.\nSimplifying the deferral amounts so they are more easily tracked and are \nconsistent regardless of the amount of bonus earned in the year. \nMalus and \nclawback\nRevisions to the circumstances and ability to operate through service \ncontracts (for example) are to be included.\nThis will align us with market practice and Investment Association guidance.\nNotice  \nperiods\nClarification that the notice period for the Executive Directors can be \nshortened or lengthened within the 12-month maximum.\nThis is to clarify that the notice period may be adjusted through a new \nservice contract during the policy period as long as it does not exceed a  \n12-month period. \nSalary increases\nThroughout our businesses we have implemented an annual salary \nreview. The Committee determined that there would be no salary \nincrease for the CEO due to his impending departure, and a salary \nincrease for the CFO for 2023 of 5%. The Committee also determined \nthat the Chairman’s fee would rise by 4%. The majority of the UK \nworkforce received a minimum increase of 6%. In consideration of the \nprevailing increase in the cost of living, we operated a tapering effect \nin the UK with those earning less than £40,000 receiving a minimum of \n6% whilst those on minimum wage received 11.37% to take them above \nthe new national minimum wage rate announced for 2023. The cost of \nliving impact has been considered in all our geographies and appropriate \nadjustments made to annual salary reviews, as well as additional one-off \ncash payments to support where possible. In the UK, for example, we \nawarded £500 to those earning less than £40,500. \nAnnual bonus outcomes for 2022\nIn reviewing the overall remuneration outcomes, the Committee ensured \nthey were reflective of the business performance and the experience \nof our stakeholders. The Committee was comfortable that the bonuses \nwere appropriate in this context, and we determined that the CEO and \nCFO should be awarded 96.5 percent and 94.6 percent of maximum \nrespectively.\n103\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

There is a logical \nflow of similar KPIs in the incentive schemes that apply to different parts of the workforce.\n•\tEngagement of Remuneration Committee members with the workforce on a wide range of topics including \nremuneration takes place.\nSimplicity – remuneration \nstructures should avoid \ncomplexity and their rationale \nand operation should be easy  \nto understand.\n•\tThe performance conditions for the annual bonus plan are based on the Group’s KPIs. \n•\tTo ensure simplicity, reward is aligned with the delivery of the key markers that indicate the successful \nimplementation of strategy.\n•\tRestricted shares are a simple mechanism and avoid the setting of long-term performance conditions which \ntend to inherently make remuneration more complex. \nRisk – remuneration \narrangements should ensure \nreputational and other risks \nfrom excessive rewards, and \nbehavioural risks that can arise \nfrom target-based incentive \nplans, are identified and \nmitigated.\nThe remuneration policy includes: \n•\tsetting defined limits on the maximum awards which can be earned; \n•\trequiring the deferral of a substantial proportion of the incentives in shares for a material period of time; \n•\taligning the performance conditions with the strategy of the Group;\n•\tensuring a focus on long-term sustainable performance through the RSP; and\n•\tensuring there is sufficient flexibility to adjust payments through malus and clawback and an overriding \ndiscretion to depart from formulaic outcomes. \nThese elements mitigate against the risk of target-based incentives by: \n•\tlimiting the maximum value that can be earned; \n•\tdeferring the value in shares for the long term, which helps ensure that the performance earning the award was \nsustainable and thereby discourages short-term behaviours; \n•\taligning any reward to the agreed strategy of the Group; \n•\tsupporting a focus on the sustainability of the performance over the longer term through the use of an RSP; \n•\treducing the awards or cancelling them if the behaviours giving rise to the awards are inappropriate; and\n•\treducing the awards or cancelling them, if it appears that the criteria on which the award was based do not \nreflect the underlying performance of the Group.\nPredictability – the range of \npossible values of rewards to \nindividual directors and any other \nlimits or discretions should be \nidentified and explained at the \ntime of approving the policy.\n•\tThe remuneration policy sets out clearly the range of values, limits and discretions in respect of the \nremuneration of management. \n•\tThe RSP increases the predictability of the rewards received by management.\nProportionality – the link \nbetween individual awards, \nthe delivery of strategy and \nthe long-term performance \nof the Group should be clear. \nOutcomes should not reward \npoor performance.\n•\tThe remuneration policy sets out clearly the range of values and discretions in respect of the remuneration  \nof management. In a competitive market for quality leaders the Group pays sufficiently to attract, incentivise  \nand retain.\n•\tThe primary value of an RSP discounted vs a traditional LTIP is in share price appreciation over time and is \ntherefore aligned with the development of a sustainable business and shareholder value.\nAlignment to culture – \nincentive schemes should drive \nbehaviours consistent with \nGroup purpose, values and \nstrategy.\t\n•\tThe annual bonus plan drives behaviours consistent with SIG’s strategy and there is a logical flow of similar \nKPIs through the incentive schemes that apply to the workforce.\n•\tThe RSP drives behaviours consistent with the Group’s purpose and values which are focused on the  \nlong-term future of the business.\n106\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

The levels and types of remuneration vary across \nthe Group depending on the employee’s level of seniority, country of \noperation and role. In the UK, the Group operates a broad range of \nbenefits including an all-employee Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”). \nIt is important to highlight that the Committee is not looking for a \nhomogeneous approach across the Group. However, when conducting \nits review, it pays particular attention to:\n•\twhether the element of remuneration is consistent with the Group \nremuneration principles (see opposite);\n•\tif there are differences, they are objectively justifiable; and\n•\tif the approach seems fair and equitable in the context of other \nemployees.\n107\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

You can find the full remuneration policy in the Company’s Notice of General \nMeeting dated 29 October 2020 at www.sigplc.com/investors/information-for-shareholders/agm-notices-and-results. Our amended \nremuneration policy, which will apply from the 2023 AGM, is detailed in the policy section of this annual report. \nThe Group’s policy is to provide remuneration packages that fairly reward the Executive Directors for the contribution they make to the business and \nthat are appropriately competitive to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior managers of the right calibre. A significant proportion \nof remuneration takes the form of variable pay, which is linked to the achievement of specific and stretching targets that align with the creation of \nshareholder value and the Group’s strategic goals.\nIn order to avoid any conflict of interest, remuneration is managed through well-defined processes ensuring no individual is involved in the decision-\nmaking process related to their own remuneration. In particular, the remuneration of all Executive Directors is set and approved by the Committee; \nnone of the Executive Directors are involved in the determination of their own remuneration arrangements. The Committee also receives support from \nexternal advisors and evaluates the support provided by these advisors annually to ensure that advice is independent, appropriate and cost-effective.\nElement and link to strategy\nHow we implemented the policy in 2022\nHow we will implement the policy in 2023\nBase salary\nProvides a base level of remuneration to support \nrecruitment and retention of Executive Directors with \nthe necessary experience and expertise to deliver \nthe Group’s strategy.\nExecutive Director salaries for 2022 were as \nfollows:\n•\tCEO – £564,543 \n•\tCFO – £392,044\nThe general employee base salary increase in the  \nUK was 3%.\nThe CFO’s salary for 2023 will increase by 5% to \n£411,646.\nThe CEO’s salary has been set on appointment at \n£675,000.\nThe general UK employee base salary increase \nwas 5.91%. 75% of employees received a minimum \nincrease of 6%.\nPension\nProvides a fair level of pension provision for all \nemployees.\nThe Executive Directors received a pension \nallowance of 5% of salary.

Once approved, the amended remuneration policy may operate for up to three years.\nSubject to approval by shareholders at the 2023 AGM, this policy will be effective for the 2023 financial year and so will apply to incentive awards \nwith performance periods beginning on 1 January 2023. Payments to Directors can only be made if they are consistent with a shareholder approved \npolicy or amendment to the policy. The amended remuneration policy has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of UK company law \nand regulations. It also meets the relevant requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules and describes how the Board has applied \nthe principles of good governance as set out in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.\nThe Committee has continued with a degree of flexibility to ensure the practical application of the amended remuneration policy. Where such \ndiscretion is reserved, the extent to which it may be applied is described. The purpose of the amended remuneration policy remains to attract, retain \nand motivate the Group’s leaders and ensure they are focused on delivering business priorities within a framework designed to promote the long-term \nsuccess of the Group, aligned with shareholder interests.\nChanges in the amended remuneration policy from the current policy (approved by shareholders in 2020)\nThe following table sets out the material changes and the rationale:\nElement\nChanges to policy\nRationale\nPension \nPension contribution for all Executive Directors aligned at \nno more than the rate applicable to the majority of the UK \nworkforce.\nRemoved reference to a specific rate to clarify that the rate \napplied will be no more than the prevailing rate at the time  \ni.e. it may change as the workforce rate changes. \nAnnual bonus plan\nRemoval of two-year holding period from deferred shares \nunder the annual bonus plan.\nThis will align us with market practice and will ensure Executive \nDirectors can benefit from their shareholdings in a more  \ntimely manner.\nAllowing targets to be set for less than a financial year.\nThis flexibility may be useful in periods of significant uncertainty, \nfor example, but would not be the norm. \nSimplification of deferral to represent a third being deferred \nfor three years.\nSimplifying the deferral amounts so they are more easily \ntracked and are consistent regardless of the amount of bonus \nearned in the year. \nMalus and \nclawback\nRevisions to the circumstances and ability to operate through \nservice contracts (for example) are to be included.\nThis will align us with market practice and the Investment \nAssociation guidance. \nNotice periods\nClarification that the notice period for the Executive Directors \ncan be shortened or lengthened within the 12-month \nmaximum. \nThis is to clarify that the notice period may be adjusted through \na new service contract during the policy period as long as it \ndoes not exceed a 12-month period. \nConsiderations when setting the amended remuneration policy\nIn setting the amended remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and senior management, the Committee has taken into account the following:\n•\tthe need to maintain a clear link between the overall reward policy and the specific performance of the Group;\n•\tthe need to achieve alignment to the Group’s strategy both in the short and long term;\n•\tthe requirement for remuneration to be competitive, with a significant proportion dependent on risk-assessed performance targets;\n•\tthe responsibilities of each individual’s role and their individual experience and performance;\n•\tthe need to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior management when determining remuneration packages, including an \nappropriate proportion of fixed and variable pay;\n•\tthe need to be compliant with the regulatory framework applicable to the Group;\n•\tpay and benefits practice and employment conditions both within the Group as a whole and within the sector in which it operates; and\n•\tperiodic external comparisons to examine current market trends and practices and equivalent roles in companies of similar size, business \ncomplexity and geographical scope. \nProposed amendments  \nto the remuneration policy\nRemuneration\n2\n1\n3\n4\n5\n110\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

The Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure a \npreferred candidate with the appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role. In setting the remuneration for new recruits, the Committee will \nhave regard to guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or enhanced short-term or long-term incentive payments, as well as giving \nconsideration for the appropriateness of any performance measures associated with an award. The Group’s policy when setting remuneration for the \nappointment of new Directors is summarised in the table below:\nSalary, benefits  \nand pension\nSalary, benefits and pension will be set in line with the policy for existing Executive Directors. Maximum pension \ncontribution will be aligned to that of the majority of employees.\nAnnual bonus\nMaximum annual participation will be set in line with the Group’s policy for existing Executive Directors and will not exceed \n150% of salary.\nRestricted shares\nMaximum annual participation will be set in line with the Group’s policy for existing Executive Directors and will not exceed \n125% of salary for restricted shares.\nMaximum variable\nThe maximum variable remuneration which may be granted is the sum of the annual bonus and restricted shares award \n(excluding the value of any buyouts) which is 275% of salary.\n“Buy out” of \nincentives forfeited \non cessation of \nemployment\nWhere the Committee determines that the individual circumstances of recruitment justifies the provision of a buyout, the \nequivalent value of any incentives that will be forfeited on cessation of an Executive Director’s previous employment will be \ncalculated taking into account the following:\n• the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the Executive Director’s cessation of employment;\n• the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the likelihood of them being satisfied; and\n• any other terms and condition having a material effect on their value (“lapsed value”).\nThe Committee may then grant up to the same value as the lapsed value, where possible, under the Group’s incentive \nplans. To the extent that it is not possible or practical to provide the buyout within the terms of the Group’s existing \nincentive plans, a bespoke arrangement would be used.\nRelocation policies\nIn instances where the new Executive Director is required to relocate or spend significant time away from their normal \nresidence, the Group may provide one-off compensation to reflect the cost of relocation for the Executive Director. The \nlevel of the relocation package will be assessed on a case-by-case basis but will take into consideration any cost of living \ndifferences/housing allowance and schooling and will not exceed a period of two years from recruitment.\nWhere an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the remuneration policy set out above would apply from the date of promotion but there would \nbe no retrospective application of the remuneration policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements. Accordingly, \nprevailing elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured and form part of the ongoing remuneration of the \nperson concerned. These would be disclosed to shareholders in the remuneration report for the relevant financial year.\nThe Group’s policy when setting fees for the appointment of a new Chair or Non-Executive Directors is to apply the policy which applies to the current \nChair or Non-Executive Directors.\nWhere an interim CEO or deputy CEO are appointed but without being a Director of the Company, the remuneration policy set out above will apply \nfrom appointment but there will be no retrospective application of the remuneration policy, therefore any existing remuneration arrangements, \nsubsisting incentive awards and notice period are permitted to continue for up to the earlier of 12 months from appointment or the next date of award/\nreview date.

The report provides an \noverview of how employee pay compares to the market and any material changes during the year and includes detailed analysis of basic pay and \nvariable pay changes within the UK.\nWhile the Group does not directly consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing Executive Director pay and formulating the remuneration \npolicy, the Group does receive an update and feedback from the broader employee population on an annual basis using an engagement survey, \nwhich collates information relating to remuneration, and consults a representative sample of employees on executive remuneration as part of the \nworkforce engagement agenda. The Group does not use remuneration comparison measurements.\nThe Group aims to provide a remuneration package for all employees that is market competitive and operates the same core structure as for the \nExecutive Directors. The Group operates employee share and variable pay plans, with pension provisions provided for all Executive Directors and \nemployees. In addition, any salary increases for Executive Directors are expected to be generally in line with those for UK-based employees.  \nThe Committee annually publishes information relating to “Fairness, diversity and wider workforce considerations” as part of the Directors’ \nremuneration report.\nConsideration of shareholder views\nThe Committee takes the views of shareholders seriously and these views are taken into account in shaping remuneration policy and practice. \nShareholder views are considered when evaluating and setting remuneration strategy and the Committee welcomes an open dialogue with its \nshareholders on all aspects of remuneration. The Committee consulted its major shareholders and the main shareholder representative bodies IA, ISS \nand Glass Lewis on the proposed amended remuneration policy. The Committee is grateful for the time taken to consider the Committee proposals \nand provide feedback.

To ensure simplicity, reward is \naligned with the delivery of the key markers that indicate the successful implementation of strategy.\n•\tRestricted shares are a simple mechanism and avoid the setting of long-term performance conditions which \ntend to inherently make the remuneration more complex.\nRisk – remuneration \narrangements should ensure \nreputational and other risks \nfrom excessive rewards, and \nbehavioural risks that can arise \nfrom target-based incentive \nplans, are identified and \nmitigated.\nThe amended remuneration policy includes:\n•\tsetting defined limits on the maximum awards which can be earned;\n•\trequiring the deferral of a substantial proportion of the incentives in shares for a material period of time;\n•\taligning the performance conditions with the strategy of the Group;\n•\tensuring a focus on long-term sustainable performance through the RSP; and\n•\tensuring there is sufficient flexibility to adjust payments through malus and clawback and an overriding \ndiscretion to depart from formulaic outcomes.\nThese elements mitigate against the risk of target-based incentives by:\n•\tlimiting the maximum value that can be earned;\n•\tdeferring the value in shares for the long term which helps ensure that the performance earning the award was \nsustainable and thereby discouraging short-term behaviours;\n•\taligning any reward to the agreed strategy of the Group;\n•\tthe use of an RSP supports a focus on the sustainability of the performance over the longer term;\n•\treducing the awards or cancelling them if the behaviours giving rise to the awards are inappropriate; and\n•\treducing the awards or cancelling them, if it appears that the criteria on which the award was based do not \nreflect the underlying performance of the Group.\nPredictability – the range of \npossible values of rewards to \nindividual directors and any other \nlimits or discretions should be \nidentified and explained at the \ntime of approving the policy.\n•\tThe amended remuneration policy sets out clearly the range of values, limits and discretions in respect of the \nremuneration of management.\n•\tThe introduction of an RSP increases the predictability of the rewards received by management.\nProportionality – the link \nbetween individual awards, \nthe delivery of strategy and \nthe long-term performance \nof the Group should be clear. \nOutcomes should not reward \npoor performance.\n•\tThe amended remuneration policy sets out clearly the range of values and discretions in respect of the \nremuneration of management.\n•\tThe introduction of an RSP increases the predictability of the rewards received by Executive Directors, and \nthe bonus plan, being based on annual targets, operates over a more predictable time cycle compared with \ntraditional LTIPs thereby allowing the Committee to more effectively ensure desirable remuneration outcomes for \nall stakeholders.\nAlignment to culture – incentive \nschemes should drive behaviours \nconsistent with Group purpose, \nvalues and strategy.\n•\tThe bonus plan drives behaviours consistent with SIG’s strategy.\n•\tThe RSP drives behaviours consistent with the Group’s purpose and values which are focused on the long-term \nfuture of the business.\nDirectors’ remuneration report | Proposed amendments to the remuneration policy\nRemuneration\n2\n1\n3\n4\n5\n120\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

We also undertake additional pay analysis, such as gender pay reporting, to ensure we can identify, and, if appropriate, \naddress any pay issues that arise. The ratio is driven by the differences in the structure of the pay of our CEO, which is made up of a higher proportion \nof variable pay, versus that of our wider workforce employees. This reflects the diverse range of roles and skillsets required to effectively operate our \norganisation; from the operational employees in our distribution centres, to, for example, specialist technical roles in our IT departments. What is \nimportant from our perspective is that this ratio is influenced only by the differences in structure, and not by divergence in fixed pay between the  \nCEO and wider workforce.\nRelative importance of the spend on pay\nThe table below shows the percentage change in total employee pay expenditure and shareholder distribution (i.e. dividends and share buybacks) \nfrom the financial year ended 31 December 2021 to the financial year ended 31 December 2022.\n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\n% Change\nDistribution to shareholders\n—\n—\n—\nEmployee remuneration1\n331.7\n303.2\n9.4%\n1.\t Continuing operations employee remuneration. \nThe Company has declared that no final dividend would be paid for 2022 and no interim dividend was paid in 2022 (2021: nil).\nAdvisors to the Remuneration Committee \nExternal\nTo ensure that the Group’s remuneration practices are in line with best practice, the Committee appointed independent external remuneration \nadvisors, Korn Ferry, through a competitive tender process in 2021.

The \nCommittee reviews the objectivity and independence of the advice it receives from its advisor at a private meeting each year.

      "text": "Directors’ Responsibilities \nStatement\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the \nFinancial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\nCompany law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements \nfor each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to \nprepare the Group Financial Statements, in accordance with UK adopted \ninternational accounting standards. The Directors have elected to \nprepare the Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with \nUnited Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting \nStandard 101, “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom \nGenerally Accepted Accounting Practice) as applied in accordance \nwith the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Under company law \nthe Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they \nare satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, \nfinancial position and profit or loss of the Company for that period.\nIn preparing the Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors are \nrequired to:\n•\tselect suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n•\tmake judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable  \nand prudent;\n•\tstate whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been \nfollowed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained  \nin the Financial Statements; and\n•\tprepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless \nit is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in \nbusiness.\nIn preparing the Group Financial Statements, International Accounting \nStandard 1 requires that Directors:\n•\tProperly select and apply accounting policies;\n•\tPresent information, including accounting policies, in a manner \nthat provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable \ninformation;\n•\tProvide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific \nrequirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the \nimpact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the \nentity’s financial position and financial performance; and\n•\tMake an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a  \ngoing concern.\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records \nthat are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and \ndisclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position \nof the Group at that time and enable them to ensure that the Financial \nStatements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also \nresponsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for \ntaking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and \nother irregularities.\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the \ncorporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. \nLegislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and \ndissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in  \nother jurisdictions.\nResponsibility statement \nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n•\tThe Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant \nfinancial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, \nliabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the \nundertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n•\tThe Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and \nperformance of the business and the position of the Company, and the \nundertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together \nwith a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\nThis responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors on \n7 March 2023 and is signed on its behalf by:\nGavin Slark\nChief Executive Officer\n7 March 2023\nIan Ashton\nChief Financial Officer\n7 March 2023\nCorporate governance\n131\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

      "text": "Statement of significant accounting policies\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\nThe significant accounting policies adopted in this Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 are set out below.\nBasis of preparation\nThe Consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards. \nThe Consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for derivative financial instruments and \nunquoted investments which are stated at their fair value. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Consolidated financial \nstatements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. \nThe qualifying partnership, The SIG 2018 Scottish Limited Partnership, which is included in these Consolidated financial statements, is entitled to \nexemption under Regulation 7(1) from the requirements of Regulations 4 to 6 of Part 2 of The Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008 in relation to \npreparation and audit of annual financial statements of the partnership. Advantage has been taken of the exemption conferred by this regulation.\nThe subsidiary of the Company, SIG Building Systems Limited (registered number 07976470), is entitled to exemption from audit under s479A of the \nCompanies Act 2006 relating to subsidiary companies.\nThe Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as set out below.\nIn preparing the Consolidated financial statements management has considered the impact of climate change, particularly in the context of the \nfinancial statements as a whole, in addition to disclosures included in the Strategic report this year. This included an assessment of the impact on \nthe carrying value of non-current assets and the impact on forecasts used in the impairment review and the assessments of going concern and \nlonger term viability. These considerations did not have a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates, consistent with the \nassessment that climate change is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s going concern assessment to 31 March 2024 nor the \nviability of the Group over the next three years.\nGoing concern\nThe Group closely monitors its funding position throughout the year, including monitoring compliance with covenants and available facilities to ensure \nit has sufficient headroom to fund operations.\nThe Group’s financing facilities comprise a €300m fixed rate bond (secured notes), due November 2026, and £90m Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”) \nwhich expires in May 2026. One of the trading businesses also has a £2.9m bank loan repayable over the period to June 2026. The secured notes are \nsubject to incurrence based covenants only, and the RCF has a leverage maintenance covenant which is only effective if the facility is over 40% drawn \nat a quarter end reporting date. The RCF was undrawn at 31 December 2022.\nThe Group has significant available liquidity and on the basis of current forecasts is expected to remain in compliance with all banking covenants \nthroughout the forecast period to 31 March 2024. \nThe Directors have considered the Group’s forecasts which support the view that the Group will be able to continue to operate within its banking \nfacilities and comply with its banking covenants. The Directors have considered the following principal risks and uncertainties that could potentially \nimpact the Group’s ability to fund its future activities and adhere to its banking covenants, including:\n•\thigh levels of product inflation, and current economic and political uncertainties across Europe, all potentially impacting market demand;\n•\tpotentially recessionary conditions in the coming year; and\n•\tmaterial shortages impacting our ability to meet demand and hence having an impact on forecast sales.\nThe forecasts on which the going concern assessment is based have been subject to sensitivity analysis and stress testing to assess the impact of \nthe above risks and the Directors have also reviewed mitigating actions that could be taken. Under a scenario including a combination of the above \nresulting in a 73% reduction in underlying operating profit from the base forecast for the going concern period, the analysis shows that sufficient cash \nwould be available without triggering a covenant breach. Further details are also included in the Viability statement on pages 66 and 67.\nThe Directors have considered the impact of climate-related matters on the going concern assessment and this is not expected to have a significant \nimpact on the Group’s going concern assessment to 31 March 2024. \nOn consideration of the above, the Directors believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the forecast \nperiod to 31 March 2024 and the Directors therefore consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 2022 Consolidated \nfinancial statements.\nNew standards, interpretations and amendments adopted \nThe following amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2022, but have not had a material impact on the Consolidated financial \nstatements of the Group:\n•\tAmendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations: reference to the Conceptual Framework\n•\tAmendment to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: proceeds before intended use\n•\tAmendment to IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets: costs of fulfilling a contract\n138\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2022 reporting periods and \nhave not been early adopted by the Group. None of these are expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting \nperiods or on foreseeable future transactions.\nDisclosure restatements\nDisclosure of discount rates used in value in use calculation \nDuring the preparation of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts an error was identified in the comparative disclosures in relation to pre-tax discount \nrates used in the value in use calculation in Note 11. The discount rates disclosed were post-tax rates instead of the pre-tax rates as required by IAS \n36 “Impairment of assets”. The prior year comparatives for the pre-tax discount rate assumption used in the value in use calculation and the change \nrequired for carrying value to equal recoverable amount have been restated to show the correct amounts. This does not impact any of the primary \nstatements or other notes to the Consolidated financial statements.\nAged analysis of expected credit loss provision\nAn error was also identified in the comparative disclosures in relation to the aged analysis of the expected credit loss provision and expected credit \nloss rates in Note 15. The comparative for the analysis of the expected credit loss provision across the aged categories of trade receivables has \nbeen restated to present on a consistent basis with the current year with a corresponding restatement of the expected credit loss rate applied to \neach category. This does not impact the total expected credit loss provision and does not impact any of the primary statements or other notes to the \nfinancial statements. \nBasis of consolidation\nThe Consolidated financial statements incorporate the Financial statements of the Company and each of its subsidiary undertakings after eliminating \nall significant intercompany transactions and balances. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from \nor to the date on which control passed.\nChanges in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of \nthe Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference \nbetween the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly \nin equity and attributed to the shareholders of the Company.\nProfit and loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the previous \ncarrying amount of the net assets (including goodwill and intangible assets) of the businesses.\nGoodwill and business combinations\nAll business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of \nthe acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of identifiable assets (including intangible assets) and liabilities of the business acquired.\nGoodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently \nwhen there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-\ngenerating units (“CGUs”) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying \namount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other \nassets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

Income and expense items are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange for the year as an approximation where actual rates \ndo not fluctuate significantly. \nExchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations, and on foreign currency borrowings, to the \nextent that they hedge the Group’s investment in such operations, are reported in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nOn the disposal of a foreign operation, all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation are reclassified to the \nConsolidated income statement.\nConsolidated income statement disclosure\nIncome statement items are presented in the middle column of the Consolidated income statement entitled Other items where they are significant in \nsize and nature, and either they do not form part of the trading activities of the Group, or their separate presentation enhances understanding of the \nfinancial performance of the Group. Items classified as Other Items are as follows: \n•\tCosts related to acquisitions\n\t \u0007The Group has made a number of acquisitions in the current and previous years. There are a number of specific costs relating to these acquisitions \nwhich make comparison of performance of the businesses and segments difficult. Therefore the following items are recorded as Other items to \nprovide a more comparable view of the businesses and enhance the clarity of the performance of the Group and its businesses to the readers of \nthe Consolidated financial statements: \n\t (i) amortisation of intangible assets acquired through business combinations; \n\t (ii) expenses related to contingent consideration required to be treated as remuneration for acquired businesses; \n\t (iii) costs and credits arising from the re-estimation of deferred and contingent consideration payable in respect of acquisitions; and\n\t (iv) costs related to the acquisition of businesses.\n•\tImpairment charges\n\t \u0007Impairment charges related to non-current assets are non-cash items and tend to be significant in size. The presentation of these as Other items \nfurther enhances the understanding of the ongoing performance of the Group. Impairments of property, intangible assets and other tangible \nfixed assets are included in Other items if related to a fundamental restructuring project or other fundamental project or if significant in size. Other \nimpairments are included in underlying results.\n•\tProfits and losses on agreed sale or closure of non-core businesses and associated impairment charges\n\t \u0007The gain or loss on the sale or closure of businesses tends to be significant in size and irregular in nature and is related to businesses that will not \nbe part of the continuing Group. The gain or loss on the sale or closure of these businesses is therefore included within Other items.\n•\tNet operating losses attributable to businesses identified as non-core\n\t \u0007Operating results from businesses identified as non-core do not form part of the ongoing trading activities of the Group and they are therefore \nrecorded separately in Other items in order to enhance the understanding of the ongoing financial performance of the Group and its businesses. \nNon-core businesses are those businesses that have been closed or disposed of or where the Board has resolved to close or dispose of the \nbusiness by the end of the reporting period and which don’t meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation. The presentation is \napplied retrospectively, so businesses classified as non-core after the period end but before the Consolidated financial statements are signed are \nincluded in the Other items column in the reporting period, and prior year comparatives are restated for businesses identified as non-core after \nsigning of the prior year Annual Report and Accounts. There are currently no businesses classified as non-core.\n•\tNet restructuring costs\n\t \u0007Restructuring costs are classified as Other Items if they relate to a fundamental change in the organisational structure of the Group or a \nfundamental change in the operating model of a business within the Group. Costs may include redundancy, property closure costs and \nconsultancy costs, which are significant in size and will not be incurred under the ongoing structure or operating model of the Group. These \ncosts are therefore recorded as Other items in order to provide a better understanding of the ongoing financial performance of the Group. Careful \nconsideration is applied by management in assessing whether these costs relate to fundamental restructuring and changing the structure and \noperating model of the business as opposed to costs incurred in the normal course of business. \n•\tCosts associated with refinancing\n\t \u0007Costs associated with the refinancing and changes to debt facility agreements during the current and prior year are included within Other items  \nas they are significant in size, do not form part of the underlying trading activities and will not be incurred on an ongoing basis. \n•\tCloud computing customisation and configuration costs\n\t \u0007Costs incurred in relation to the implementation of Software as a Service (“SaaS”) arrangements which are recognised as expenses in the \nconsolidated income statement are included within Other items if they relate to significant strategic projects and are considered to meet the Group’s \ndefinition of Other items.\nStatement of significant accounting policies\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n140\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "•\tOther specific items\n\t \u0007Other specific items are recorded in Other items where they do not form part of the underlying trading activities of the Group in order to enhance \nthe understanding of the financial performance of the Group. This includes, for example, profit on sale of property not related to ongoing operations \n(i.e. related to a branch or business closure) or property sold as part of a fundamental restructuring programme. Profit on the sale of property in \nconnection with branch or office moves in the normal course of business is included within underlying results. A full breakdown of other specific \nitems is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated financial statements. \n•\tOther items within finance income and finance costs\n\t \u0007The unwinding of provision discounting for provisions that have been included as Other Items is included within Other Items consistent with the \nclassification of the provision. Other provision discounting is included within underlying finance costs. \n•\tTaxation\n\t \u0007The taxation effect of Other Items and tax adjustments in respect of previous years’ Other Items are shown within Other items in order to enhance \nthe understanding of the underlying tax position of the Group.\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. \nThe Group recognises revenue when it transfers control over a product or service to a customer.\na) Sale of goods\nThe majority of the Group’s revenue arises from contracts with customers for the sale of goods, with one performance obligation. Revenue is \nrecognised at the point in time that control of the goods passes to the customer, usually on delivery to the customer. Standard payment terms  \nvary across the different businesses but generally range from 8 to 60 days from end of month. The amount of revenue recognised is impacted  \nby the following:\nVolume rebates\nThe Group provides retrospective volume rebates to certain customers, which give rise to variable consideration. The Group estimates the expected \nvolume rebates using an expected value approach based on expected volumes and thresholds in the contracts. The Group then applies the \nconstraint regarding variable consideration and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not \noccur. Expected volume rebates due to customers are recognised as a reduction to trade receivables. \nEarly settlement discounts\nEarly settlement discounts are estimated using the expected value approach based on past experience and are recognised at the time of recognising \nthe revenue, subject to the constraint regarding variable consideration that it is highly probable that a change in estimate would not result in a \nsignificant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognised. \nb) Construction contracts\nThe Group has contracts for the provision of industrial services which fall under the category of “construction contracts”.\n\u0007The Group’s business in Ireland provides industrial painting, coating and repair services. Revenue from these contracts is recognised over time, as \nthe entity’s performance enhances a customer-controlled asset, using an output method to measure progress towards completion, based on agreed \nrates and/or valuation schedules agreed with the customer which confirm the amounts invoiced each month, depending on individual contract terms.\n\u0007Any earned consideration that is conditional is recorded as a contract asset. A contract asset becomes a receivable when receipt is conditional only \non the passage of time. Therefore, revenue recognised from construction contracts described above which has not yet been invoiced is recognised \nas a contract asset, which is shown as a separate line item on the Consolidated balance sheet rather than as part of trade and other receivables (£nil \nin 2022 and £nil in 2021). Invoices are raised as the contract progresses based on agreed milestones, rates or valuation schedules depending on the \nterms of individual contracts, with subsequent payment in accordance with agreed payment terms.\nc) Presentation and disclosure requirements\nThe Group has disaggregated revenue recognised from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing and \nuncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The Group has also disclosed information about the relationship between \nthe disclosure of disaggregated revenue and the revenue information disclosed for each reportable segment. Refer to Note 1 for the disclosure on \ndisaggregated revenue.\nSupplier rebates\nSupplier rebate income is significant to the Group’s results, with a substantial proportion of purchases covered by rebate agreements. \nSome supplier rebate agreements are non-coterminous with the Group’s financial year, and firm confirmation of amounts due may not be received \nuntil after the balance sheet date.\nWhere the Group relies on estimates, these are made with reference to contracts or other agreements, management forecasts and detailed \noperational workbooks. Supplier rebate income estimates are regularly reviewed by senior management.\n141\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

      "text": "Supplier rebates continued\nOutstanding amounts at the balance sheet date are included in trade payables when the Group has the right to offset against amounts owing to \nthe supplier and therefore settles on a net basis, in line with IAS 32 criteria. Where the supplier rebates are not netted off the amounts owing to that \nsupplier, the outstanding amount is included within prepayments and accrued income. The carrying value of inventory is reduced by the associated \namount where the inventory has yet to be sold at the balance sheet date.\nOperating profit\nOperating profit is stated after charging distribution costs, selling and marketing costs and administrative expenses, but before finance income and \nfinance costs.\nTaxation\nIncome tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises both current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated \nincome statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in the Consolidated \nstatement of comprehensive income or the Consolidated statement of changes in equity.\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date, and \nany adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when \nthey relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\nUncertain tax treatments are accounted for in accordance with IFRIC 23. The Group determines whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment \nseparately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments and uses the approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.\nDeferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and \nliabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.\nIn accordance with IAS 12, the following temporary differences are not provided for:\n•\tgoodwill not deductible for taxation purposes;\n•\tthe initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; or\n•\tdifferences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future and the Group is able to \ncontrol the reversal.\nThe amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, \nusing tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be \nutilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\nShare-based payment transactions\nEmployees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services \nas consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled transactions). Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of \ngrant based on the Group’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. The fair value determined is then expensed in the Consolidated \nincome statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of the options is measured \nusing the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo option pricing model as appropriate.\nThe amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest.\nFor equity-settled share options, at each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimate of the number of share options expected to vest \nas a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the \nConsolidated income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.\nService and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood \nof the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market \nperformance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without an associated service \nrequirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate \nexpensing of an award unless there are also service and/or performance conditions.\nNo expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. \nWhere awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting \ncondition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.\nThe EBT) purchases shares in the Company in order to satisfy awards made under the Company’s share plans. The EBT is included in the \nConsolidated financial statements of the Group. Shares held by the EBT which are not vested and beneficially owned by employees are treated as \ntreasury shares and a deduction is computed in the Company’s issued share capital for the purpose of calculating earnings per share. \nStatement of significant accounting policies\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n142\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "Intangible assets\nThe Group recognises intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The Group recognises two types of intangible \nasset: acquired and purchased. Acquired intangible assets arise as a result of applying IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” which requires the separate \nrecognition of intangible assets from goodwill on all business combinations. Purchased intangible assets relate primarily to software that is separable \nfrom any associated hardware.\nIntangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives as follows:\nAmortisation period\nCurrent average useful life\nCustomer relationships\nLife of the relationship\n7 to 10 years\nNon-compete contracts\nLife of the contract\n3 years\nComputer software\nUseful life of the software\n3 to 10 years\nAssets in the course of construction are carried at cost, with amortisation commencing once the assets are ready for their intended use. \nSoftware as a service (“SaaS”) arrangements\nSaaS arrangements are arrangements in which the Group does not currently control the underlying software used in the arrangement. These \narrangements are accounted for as a service contract over the contract period. The Group’s policy in relation to costs incurred to configure or \ncustomise the software to specific requirements is as follows:\n•\tWhere costs incurred to configure or customise SaaS arrangements result in the creation of a resource which is identifiable, and where the Group \nhas the power to obtain the future economic benefit flowing from the underlying resource and to restrict the access of others to those benefits, \nsuch costs are capitalised as separate software intangible assets and amortised over the useful life of the software on a straight-line basis. \n•\tWhere costs incurred to configure or customise do not result in the recognition of an intangible software asset then those costs that provide the \nGroup with a distinct service (in addition to the SaaS access) are recognised as expenses when the supplier provides the services. When such \ncosts incurred do not provide a distinct service, the costs are expensed as incurred. Costs are included within Other items in the Consolidated \nincome statement if they relate to significant strategic projects and are considered to meet the Group’s definition of Other items.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is shown at original cost to the Group less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.\nDepreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line \nbasis over their estimated useful lives as follows:\nCurrent estimate of useful life\nFreehold buildings\n50 years\nLeasehold properties and improvements\nPeriod of lease (3 to 25 years)\nPlant and machinery (including motor vehicles)\n3 to 8 years or length of lease\nFreehold land is not depreciated.\nResidual values, which are based on market rates, are reassessed annually.\nAssets in the course of construction are carried at cost, with depreciation charged on the same basis as all other assets once those assets are ready \nfor their intended use. \nInvestment property\nInvestment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition the Group has chosen to apply \nthe cost model. Investment properties are therefore recognised at cost and depreciated over the useful life and are impaired when appropriate in \naccordance with IAS 16 “Property, plant and equipment”. \nTransfers are made to or from investment property only when there is a change in use. If owner-occupied property becomes an investment property, \nthe Group accounts for such property in accordance with the policy stated under property, plant and equipment up to the date of change in use. \nBorrowing costs\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take \na substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such a time as the assets are \nsubstantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Consolidated income statement in the period in \nwhich they are incurred.\nInterest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured \nreliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the \nrate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial \nrecognition.\n143\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

      "text": "Leases and hire purchase agreements\nLeases and hire purchase agreements are recognised in accordance with IFRS 16 “Leases”.\na) The Group’s leasing activities\nThe group leases various offices, warehouses, branches, equipment and cars. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 3 to 10 years \nbut may have extension or early termination options. Certain property leases have a term of 25 years. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual \nbasis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants. \nb) How leases are accounted for\nA lease liability is recognised based on the discounted present value of total future lease payments, with a corresponding right-of-use asset including \nany initial direct costs recognised and depreciated over the lease term. The lease payments are discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing \nrate or the interest rate implicit in the lease. The Group remeasures lease liabilities and right-of-use assets when there is a change of lease term, lease \npayments or a change in the assessment of exercising of a purchase option. The impact of these changes is included within modifications in Note 23.\nWhere a lease liability relates to an onerous lease contract the right-of-use asset is assessed for impairment. Payments due under the lease continue \nto be included in the lease liability, therefore a separate provision is no longer required. The lease liability is also remeasured upon the occurrence \nof certain events, which is generally also recognised as an adjustment to the right of-use asset. Provisions for short-term onerous lease contracts \ncontinue to be recognised.\ni) Definition of a lease\nA lease is a contract (i.e. an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations), or part of a contract, that \nconveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. It is determined whether a contract is a \nlease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract. \nUnder IFRS 16, an identified asset can be either implicitly or explicitly specified in a contract.\nii) Lease term\nIn accordance with IFRS 16, the lease term is defined as the non-cancellable period of the lease, together with: \n•\tperiods covered by an option to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and \n•\tperiods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. \niii) Variable lease payments\nVariable lease payments based on an index or a rate are part of the lease liability. Variable lease payments are initially measured using the index or \nthe rate at the commencement date. Forecast future changes in rates are not included; these are only taken into account at the point in time at which \nlease payments change.\nThe Group has a few property leases where rentals are based on an index but with a cap and collar, and for such leases the minimum future increase \nis included in the initial recognition of the lease liability where relevant. \nOther variable payments, for example additional costs based on usage or vehicle mileage, are not included in the lease liability.\niv) Asset restoration costs\nWhere there is an obligation under a lease contract to dismantle and/or restore the asset to its original condition, provision is made for this in \naccordance with IAS 37, and the initial carrying amount of this provision is included within fixed assets on inception of the lease. The liability continues \nto be recorded as a separate provision on the balance sheet (i.e. it is not included in the IFRS 16 lease liability).\nv) Exemptions\nThe Group has certain assets with lease terms of 12 months or less and leases of equipment with low value. The Group applies the “short-term lease” \nand “lease of low-value assets” recognition exemptions for these leases.\nThe Group has considered the amendments within the Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS 16) Standard allowing companies \nwith rent concessions meeting the criteria in the amendment to choose to take advantage of the practical expedient not to assess whether a rent \nconcession is a lease modification as all of the following conditions were met:\n•\tthe change in lease payments results in revised consideration for the lease that is substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration for the \nlease immediately preceding the change; \n•\tany reduction in lease payments affects only payments due on or before 30 June 2022; and \n•\tthere is no substantive change to other terms and conditions of the lease. \nThe only changes as a result of Covid-19 have been changes in the timing of payments (for example from quarterly to monthly) and there are therefore \nno significant amounts recognised in the Consolidated income statement from Covid-19 related rent concessions during the year. \nStatement of significant accounting policies\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n144\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (including an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads, supplier rebates and discounts) and net \nrealisable value. The cost formula used in measuring inventories is either a weighted average cost, or a first-in first-out basis, depending on the most \nappropriate method for each particular business. Most businesses use weighted average, with the exception of Poland and Ireland, where first in first \nout is used.\nNet realisable value is based on estimated normal selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred up to completion and disposal. Provision is \nmade for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.\nBank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and \ncash equivalents for the purposes of the Consolidated cash flow statement.\nLease payments are presented as follows in the Consolidated cash flow statement:\n•\tshort term lease payments and payments for leases of low-value assets that are not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities are \npresented within cash flows from operating activities;\n•\tpayments for the interest element of recognised lease liabilities are included in ‘Finance costs paid’ within cash flows from financing activities; and \n•\tpayments for the principal element of recognised lease liabilities are presented within cash flows from financing activities\nCash flows in relation to the settlement of amounts payable for previous purchases of businesses related to consideration dependent on vendors \nremaining within the business are classified as an operating cash flow. Cash flows in relation to contingent or deferred consideration not dependent \non vendors remaining within the business are classified as a cash flow from investing activities. \nFinancial assets\nFinancial assets are classified as either financial assets subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through profit and loss (“FVPL”) or fair \nvalue through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”). \nThe classification at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for \nmanaging them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the \npractical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit \nor loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical \nexpedient are measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15.\nThe Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:\n•\tthe financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n•\tthe contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the \nprincipal amount outstanding.\nThe Group’s financial assets are all measured at amortised cost, except for derivative financial instruments (“FVPL”) and unquoted investments \n(“FVOCI”).\nFinancial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses \nare recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired. The Group’s financial assets include trade receivables, deferred \nconsideration and cash and cash equivalents. \nImpairment of financial assets\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) for all debt instruments held at amortised cost. ECLs are based on the \ndifference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, \ndiscounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies the standard’s \nsimplified approach and calculates ECLs based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on the \nGroup’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward looking factors specific to the debtors and economic environment. \n145\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

      "text": "Financial assets continued\nDerecognition\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed \nfrom the Group’s consolidated balance sheet when:\n•\tthe rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or\n•\tthe Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without \nmaterial delay to a third party under a “pass-through” arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards  \nof the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of \nthe asset.\nTrade receivables that are factored out to banks and other financial institutions without recourse to the Group are derecognised at the point of \nfactoring as the risks and rewards of the receivables have been fully transferred. In assessing whether the receivables qualify for derecognition, the \nGroup has considered the receivables and receivable insurance contracts as two separate units of account. Therefore, the insurance is not included \nas part of the derecognition assessment on the basis that the insurance is not similar to the receivables. The Group has elected to recognise cash \ninflows from the sale of factored receivables as an operating cash flow.\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified at initial recognition as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as \nderivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities, except for derivative financial instruments \n(see below), are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest \nrate (“EIR”) method. \nA financial obligation is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability \nis replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an \nexchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. Where a modification of a financial \nliability does not result in derecognition, the amortised cost of the financial liability is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated \nfuture contractual cash flows that are discounted at the loan’s original EIR. Any consequent adjustment (gain or loss on modification) is recognised \nimmediately in profit or loss. The gain or loss on modification will unwind over the remaining term of the liability, with the movement recognised in \nfinance costs. \nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition and only if the \ncriteria in IFRS 9 are satisfied. The Group has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss. \nWhen determining the fair value of financial liabilities, the expected future cash flows are discounted using an appropriate interest rate.\nDebt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.\nOffsetting of financial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Consolidated balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable \nlegal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities \nsimultaneously. \nDerivative financial instruments\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, and cross-currency swaps to \nhedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational and financing activities. In accordance with its \ntreasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, any derivative financial instruments \nthat do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments. Derivatives are classified as non-current assets or non-current \nliabilities if the remaining maturity of the derivatives is more than 12 months and they are not expected to be otherwise realised or settled within 12 \nmonths. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised immediately at fair value. Subsequent to their initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are \nthen stated at their fair value. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is derived from “mark-to-market” valuations obtained from the Group’s \nrelationship banks. \nStatement of significant accounting policies\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n146\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained \nin equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in \nequity is transferred to the Consolidated income statement in the period. \nFor the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:\n•\tfair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised commitment;\n•\tcash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised \nasset or liability or a highly probably forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment; or\n•\thedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.\nAt the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which it wishes to apply hedge \naccounting, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction. \nThe documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will \nassess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and \nhow the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:\n•\tthere is “an economic relationship” between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;\n•\tthe effect of credit risk does not “dominate the value changes” that result from that economic relationship; and\n•\tthe hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the \nquantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\nHedges that meet all the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as described below:\nFair value hedges\nThe change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and \nis recognised in the Consolidated income statement within Other items. The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is also recognised in \nthe Consolidated income statement within Other items.\nCash flow hedges\nThe effective part of any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the \ncash flow hedging reserve. When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the \nassociated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. \nIf a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or financial liability, the associated gains or losses that \nwere previously recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income are reclassified into the Consolidated income statement in the \nsame period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the Consolidated income statement.\nFor cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of any gain or loss is recognised immediately as fair value gains or losses on derivative financial \ninstruments and is included as part of finance income or finance costs within Other items in the Consolidated income statement. The Group \ndesignates only the spot element of forward contracts as a hedging instrument. The forward element is recognised in other comprehensive income \nand accumulated in a separate component of equity under cost of hedging reserve.\nHedges of net investment in foreign operations \nThe portion of any gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge \nis recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of any gain or loss is recognised immediately as fair \nvalue gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and is included as part of finance income or finance costs within Other items within the \nConsolidated income statement. Gains and losses deferred in the foreign currency translation reserve are recognised immediately in the Consolidated \nincome statement when foreign operations are disposed of.\n147\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

      "text": "Provisions\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that a transfer of \neconomic benefit will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money \nis material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is \nused, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. \nLeasehold dilapidations\nProvisions are recognised in relation to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties to their original state of repair. The provision is \ncalculated based on both the liability to rectify or reinstate leasehold improvements and modifications carried out on the inception of the lease, \nrecognised on inception with a corresponding fixed asset, and the liability to rectify general wear and tear which is recognised as incurred over the life \nof the lease. The provision recognised is based on estimated expected value using current cost estimates and therefore the net impact of inflation and \ndiscounting to present value is not considered material.\nOnerous contracts\nIf the Group has a contract that is onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognised and measured as a provision. An onerous contract \nis a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.\nPension schemes\nSIG operates four defined benefit pension schemes. The Group’s net obligation in respect of these defined benefit pension schemes is calculated \nseparately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in both current and prior \nperiods. That benefit is discounted using an appropriate discount rate to determine its present value and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.\nWhere the benefits of the plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense \nin the Consolidated income statement, at the earlier of when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs and when the entity recognises related \nrestructuring costs or termination benefits. \nThe full service cost of the pension schemes is charged to operating profit. Net interest costs on defined benefit pension schemes are recognised \nin the Consolidated income statement. Discretionary contributions made by employees or third parties reduce service costs upon payment of these \ncontributions into the plan.\nAny actuarial gain or loss arising is charged through the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and comprises the difference between the \nexpected returns on assets and those actually achieved, any changes in the actuarial assumptions for demographics and any changes in the financial \nassumptions used in the valuations.\nThe pension scheme deficit is recognised in full and presented on the face of the Consolidated balance sheet. The associated deferred tax asset is \nrecognised within non-current assets in the Consolidated balance sheet.\nFor defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the Consolidated income statement in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement \nbenefits is the contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are included \nwithin either accruals or prepayments in the Consolidated balance sheet.\nDividends\nDividends proposed by the Board of Directors that have not been paid by the end of the year are not recognised in the Consolidated financial \nstatements until they have been approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.\nSegmental reporting\nIn accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”, the Group identifies its reportable segments based on the components of the business on which \nfinancial information is regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to assess performance and make decisions \nabout how resources are allocated. For SIG, the CODM is considered to be the Executive Leadership Team. Reported operating segments are \nconsistent with those reported in the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts.\nStatement of significant accounting policies\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n148\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\nIn the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described on pages 138 to 148, the Directors are required to make judgements (other \nthan those involving estimates) that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised and to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying \namounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical \nexperience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in \nwhich the change takes place if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both \ncurrent and future periods.\nCritical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies\nThe following are the critical judgements that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have had  \na significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated financial statements. The judgements involving estimations are dealt with \nseparately below.\nClassification of Other items in the Consolidated income statement\nAs described in the Statement of significant accounting policies, certain items are presented in the separate column of the Consolidated income \nstatement entitled Other items where they are significant in size or nature, and either they do not form part of the trading activities of the Group or \ntheir separate presentation enhances understanding of the financial performance of the Group. The nature and amounts of the items included in \nOther items, together with the overall impact on the results for the year, is disclosed in Note 2 of the Consolidated financial statements.\nRecognition of deferred tax assets\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax attributes to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the \nattributes can be utilised, after consideration of available taxable temporary differences. The Group has £74.1m (2021: £77.9m) of potential deferred \ntax assets relating to cumulative tax losses and other deductible timing differences in the UK and Benelux, which are currently unrecognised as \nit is not considered probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to allow the utilisation of the deductible temporary differences. \nAlthough the UK trading businesses have returned to profitability in the current year, the UK tax group remains in a taxable loss position and there \nis not considered to be sufficient convincing evidence that future taxable profits will be available at 31 December 2022. This required significant \nmanagement judgement to determine the likely timing and level of future taxable profits and whether sufficient, convincing evidence was available at \n31 December 2022 to recognise the previously unrecognised deferred tax assets. If the Group were able to recognise all unrecognised deferred tax \nassets, profit and equity would have increased by £74.1m. Further details are disclosed in Note 22.\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of the assets and liabilities within \nthe next financial year are detailed below. \nPost-employment benefits\nThe Group operates four defined benefit pension schemes. All post-employment benefits associated with these schemes have been accounted for \nin accordance with IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. As detailed within the Statement of significant accounting policies, in accordance with IAS 19, all \nactuarial gains and losses have been recognised immediately through the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nFor all defined benefit pension schemes, pension valuations have been performed using specialist advice obtained from independent qualified \nactuaries. In performing these valuations, significant actuarial assumptions have been made to determine the defined benefit obligation, in particular \nwith regard to discount rate, inflation and mortality. Management considers the key assumption to be the discount rate applied. In determining the \nappropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds excluding university bonds. If the discount rate  \nwere to be increased/decreased by 0.1%, this would decrease/increase the Group’s gross pension scheme deficit by £1.4m as disclosed in  \nNote 28. At 31 December 2022 the Group’s retirement benefit obligations were £23.0m (2021: £10.7m). \nImpairment of goodwill\nThe Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may be required. Determining whether \ngoodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated, including all related assets. The key \nestimates made in the value in use calculation are those regarding discount rates, sales growth rates, and expected changes to selling prices and \ndirect costs to reflect the operational gearing of the business. The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market \nassessments of the time value of money for the Group and that also include a risk premium to factor in a certain element of risk over and above that \nalready included in the forecast cash flows where considered necessary (for example the turnaround risk associated with achievement of the Return \nto Growth strategy in certain CGUs). \nThe Group performs goodwill impairment reviews by forecasting cash flows based upon management’s three year projections, which include forecast \nsales growth based on management’s best estimates and external data (construction PMI data and construction market growth forecasts), gross \nmargin assumptions based on management’s best estimates and previous experience, with annual growth rates based upon country specific inflation \nexpectations (1.6%-2.5%) applied thereafter into perpetuity. Assumptions regarding sales and operating profit growth, gross margin, and discount rate \nare considered to be the key areas of estimation in the impairment review process, and appropriate sensitivities have been performed and disclosed \nin Note 11. Impairments are allocated initially against the value of any goodwill held within a CGU, with any remaining impairment applied to intangible \nassets, right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment on a pro rata basis.\n149\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

      "text": "Impairment of goodwill continued\nThe carrying amount of relevant non-current assets at 31 December 2022 is £491.7m (2021: £434.6.m) including right-of-use assets recognised in \naccordance with IFRS 16. The most recent results of the impairment review process are disclosed in Note 11. An impairment charge of £9.9m was \nrecognised in relation to the Benelux CGU in 2021, but continued operational challenges and a delay in progress from initiatives implemented to \nturn the business around has led to a further reduction in forecast future cashflows over the next three years, and as a result an impairment charge \nof £15.8m has been recognised at 31 December 2022. The carrying value of non-current assets associated with all the other Group’s CGUs is \nconsidered supportable at 31 December 2022. Whilst the Directors consider the assumptions used in the impairment review to be realistic, if actual \nresults are different from expectations then it is possible that the value of goodwill included in the Consolidated balance sheet could become impaired \nfurther. The remaining carrying value of goodwill is £134.2m. Sensitivities are disclosed in Note 11. These indicate reasonably possible scenarios \nwhich could lead to further impairment.\nOther areas of estimation uncertainty\nThe following areas of estimation uncertainty are not presented to comply with the requirements of paragraph 125 of IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial \nStatements” as it is not expected there is a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next \nfinancial year. They are presented as additional disclosure of estimates used in the financial statements.\nRebates receivable\nSupplier rebate income is significant to the Group’s result, with a substantial proportion of purchases covered by rebate agreements. Supplier rebate \nincome affects the recorded value of cost of sales, trade payables, trade and other receivables, and inventories. The amounts payable under rebate \nagreements are often subject to negotiation after the balance sheet date. At the balance sheet date, the Directors estimate the amount of rebate that \nwill become payable by and due to the Group under these agreements based upon prices, volumes and product mix. The Group has recognised \nincome from supplier rebates of £349.5m from continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: £261.4m). At 31 December 2022 \ntrade payables is presented net of £48.4m (2021: £29.8m) due from suppliers in respect of supplier rebates where the Group has the right to net \nsettlement, and included within prepayments and accrued income is £77.5m (2021: £58.2m) due in relation to supplier rebates where there is no right \nto offset against trade payable balances. The majority of these balances relate to agreements which are coterminous with the financial year end and \ntherefore this reduces the level of estimation involved. Based on experience in the current year, the amount received is not expected to vary from the \namount recorded by more than £2.0m (2021: £1.0m). \nProvisions against receivables\nAt 31 December 2022 the Group has recognised trade receivables with a carrying value of £324.9m (2021: £287.7m). The Group recognises an \nallowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs)” in relation to trade receivables. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on the \nGroup’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward looking factors specific to the debtors and economic environment. Changes in the \neconomic environment or customer-specific circumstances could have an impact on the recoverability of amounts included on the Consolidated \nbalance sheet at 31 December 2022. The total allowance for ECLs recorded at 31 December 2022 is £19.1m (2021: £16.1m). The Group has \nexperienced a higher bad debt expense in the current year due to the administration of Avonside, a major UK roofing contractor and one of the \nGroup’s largest customers, together with an increase in loss rates in certain operating companies as a result of applying adjustments to reflect current \nand forward looking information given current economic conditions and expectations. The bad debt to sales ratio of the Group has varied by up to \n0.2% over recent periods (excluding Avonside), therefore this gives an indication that the bad debt experience could vary by c£5m based on current \nyear sales. Further detail on trade receivables and the allowance for ECLs recognised is disclosed in Note 15.\nDilapidations provisions\nThe Group has a significant number of leasehold properties with contractual obligations to reinstate the properties to their original state of repair at \nthe end of the lease contract. The Group has recognised a provision of £24.4m at 31 December 2022 (2021: £22.0m) in relation to this obligation \n(see Note 21). The total provision includes both the estimated cost of rectifying or reinstating leasehold modifications and improvements carried out, \nwhich is recognised at the inception of the lease with a corresponding asset recognised in fixed assets and depreciated over the term of the lease, \ntogether with the estimated cost of rectifying general wear and tear which is recognised as incurred over the life of the lease. Estimates are based \non a combination of a sample of assessments by third party independent property surveyors, internal assessments by the Group’s property experts \nand previous settlement history. Whilst the Directors consider the estimates to be reasonable based on latest available information, actual amounts \npayable could be different to the amount provided depending on specific circumstances of individual properties and counterparties at the expiry of \neach lease contract. The amount payable is not expected to be materially different to the amount provided in the following year but there could be \na material adjustment over a longer timescale. The provision is reassessed each year on the basis of latest information, which could also result in a \nchange in the value of the provision year-on-year of up to c10% based on past experience. \nLeases – estimating the incremental borrowing rate\nThe Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in leases, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) to measure lease \nliabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term and with a similar security, the funds necessary \nto obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore requires estimation when no \nobservable rates are available, such as for subsidiaries that do not enter into financing transactions. The Group estimates the IBR using observable \ninputs, such as market interest rates, when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates, such as the subsidiary’s stand-alone \ncredit rating.\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n150\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

The Group has chosen to account for investment property using the cost model. £nil (2021: \n£nil) has been recognised in rental income and £nil (2021: £0.3m) incurred in Other items during the year. The £0.3m charge in the prior year related to \nan impairment of the asset following an increase in future rent. The property is being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (25 \nyears). The property had a cost of £4.2m, accumulated deprecation of £0.3m and impairment of £2.8m on transfer to investment property at the end \nof 2018. Subsequent impairments have been recognised and the fair value of the investment property at 31 December 2022 is estimated to be £0.5m \n(2021: £0.5m) based on future expected rental returns.

The key assumptions for these calculations are those regarding \ndiscount rates, sales growth, gross margin and operating profit growth rates. These assumptions have been revised in the year in light of the current \neconomic environment and recent trading performance. Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each \nCGU, taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash \nflow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating segments and is derived from \nits weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), including the cost of lease debt in accordance with IFRS 16, with adjustments made to factor in the \namount and timing of future tax flows in order to reflect a pre-tax discount rate. Discount rates for certain CGUs also include a risk premium to factor \nin a certain element of risk over and above that already included in the forecast cash flows (for example the risk of delayed achievement of turnaround \nand growth). In respect of the other assumptions, external data and management’s best estimates are applied as described below. \nValue in use is determined by forecasting cash flows based upon management’s three year projections, which include forecast sales growth based \non management’s best estimates and external data (construction PMI data and construction market growth forecasts), gross margin assumptions \nbased on management’s best estimates and previous experience, with annual growth rates based upon country specific inflation expectations  \n(1.6%-2.5%) applied thereafter and into perpetuity. \nThe key assumptions used for each CGU are shown in the table on page 165 in the sensitivity analysis section.\nClimate-related matters: The Group monitors climate-related risks and opportunities, as described in the principal risks and uncertainties and \nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) sections of the strategic report and has considered the potential impact of climate change on the \nimpairment review. At the current time, no legislation has been passed that will impact the key assumptions used in the value in use calculations.  \nThe impact on revenue in terms of opportunities from continuing to expand the Group’s product offering in energy-saving products and initiatives \nsuch as developing partnerships with suppliers to encourage uptake of low carbon products and working with large customers such as housebuilders  \nto support them in their sustainability ambitions is factored into sales forecasts in the short and medium term if applicable and the impact is known \nas part of bottom up forecasting procedures, and the impact of transitioning the Group’s fleet to lower carbon fuel alternatives as and when leases \nexpire is also included in the forecasts, but there are no overriding changes to key assumptions built into the forecasts at the current time. There \nis not considered to be a significant risk of climate change causing a significant downturn in cashflows across the Group and therefore no specific \nsensitivities relating to climate change are considered necessary over and above the sensitivities already performed below. \t\n2022 impairment review results\nThe results of the impairment review carried out at 31 December 2022 indicated that the carrying value of goodwill and other assets associated with \nthe Benelux CGU was not supportable. An impairment charge of £9.9m was recognised in relation to this CGU at 31 December 2021, but continued \noperational challenges and delayed progress from initiatives implemented to turn the business around has led to a further reduction in forecast future \ncashflows over the next three years for this CGU. As a result, an impairment charge of £15.8m has been recognised at 31 December 2022, which has \nbeen allocated against goodwill (£3.6m), tangible fixed assets (£2.5m) and right-of-use assets (£9.7m). The Benelux CGU is a reportable segment as \ndisclosed in Note 1, and the charge has been included within Other items in the consolidated income statement. The recoverable amount of the CGU \nis £26.3m, based on the value in use calculation. The carrying value of all other CGUs remains supportable. \n164\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

The other % changes in assumptions shown \nabove were not considered to be reasonably possible scenarios, but this additional voluntary information over and above that required by IAS 36 was \nincluded in order to provide a full picture of the level of headroom and sensitivity to changes in assumptions for each CGU.

The increase in the \ncurrent year is mainly due to the loss from the administration of Avonside, a major UK roofing contractor and one of the Group’s largest customers, \ntogether with an increase in loss rates in certain operating companies as a result of applying adjustments to reflect current and forward looking \ninformation given current economic conditions and expectations.\nDays past due\n31 December 2022\n< 30 days\n£m\n30-60 days\n£m\n61-90 days\n£m\n> 91 days\n£m\nTotal\n£m\nECL rate\n1.0%\n8.2%\n17.4%\n54.4%\nTotal gross carrying amount\n 310.0\n34.3\n8.6\n21.7\n374.6\nECL\n3.0\n2.8\n1.5\n11.8\n19.1\nDays past due\n31 December 2021 (restated)1\n< 30 days\n£m\n30-60 days\n£m\n61-90 days\n£m\n> 91 days\n£m\nTotal\n£m\nECL rate\n0.6%\n6.5%\n15.4%\n60.4%\nTotal gross carrying amount\n 269.7 \n 30.5 \n 8.9 \n 18.2 \n 327.3 \nECL\n1.7\n2.0\n1.4\n11.0\n 16.1 \n1.\t \u0007The prior year comparative for the analysis of the expected credit loss provision and expected credit loss rate across the aged categories of trade receivables has been restated to \npresent on a consistent basis with the current year, as disclosed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies.\nThe Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.\nIncluded within trade receivables is a managed pool of customer balances of £52.8m (2021: £41.1m) pledged as security in relation to the asset \nbacked funding arrangement implemented in relation to the UK defined benefit pension plan. See Note 28 for further details.\nTransfer of trade receivables\nConsistent with previous years, the Group sold without recourse trade receivables to banks and other financial institutions for cash proceeds. These \ntrade receivables of £37.8m (2021: £32.8m) have been derecognised from the Consolidated balance sheet, because the Group has transferred the \nrisks and rewards.\nCredit risk management\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Trade receivable credit \nexposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are set, reviewed and approved by operational management on a regular basis. \t\nTrade receivables consist of a large number of typically small to medium sized customers, spread across a number of different market sectors and \ngeographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and to determine whether the credit risk \nhas increased since initial recognition. Where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased. \nThe Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer, with no single customer representing more than 1% of the \nGroup’s revenue. \n171\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

Financial assets, liabilities, financial risk management and derivatives\nThe Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, lease liabilities, deferred consideration and trade and \nother payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group’s principal financial assets include trade \nreceivables and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. \na) Financial assets\nThe Group holds the following financial assets: \n \nNote\n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\nFinancial assets at amortised cost:\n\t Trade receivables\n15\n 324.9 \n 287.7 \n\t Cash at bank and on hand\n 130.1 \n 145.1 \nFinancial asset at fair value through OCI:\n\t Unquoted equity investment\n 0.2 \n — \nDerivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments\n18d\n 1.6 \n 0.2 \nDerivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments\n 0.2 \n — \nTotal\n 457.0 \n 433.0 \nThe interest received on cash deposits is at variable rates of interest of up to 3.42% (2021: 0.17%). \nThe Directors consider that the fair values of cash at bank and on hand and trade receivables approximate their carrying value, largely due to the \nshort-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value is not significantly different to the carrying amount. \nThe Group’s credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings \nassigned by international credit rating agencies. Information about the Group’s exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables is given in Note 15.\nOf the above cash at bank on hand, £2.6m (2021: £56.3m) is denominated in Sterling, £110.9m (2021: £79.4m) in Euros, £15.3m (2021: £8.7m) in \nPolish Zloty, and £1.3m (2021: £0.7m) in other currencies.\nThe financial asset at fair value through OCI is an investment in equity shares of a non-listed company. The Group holds a non-controlling interest  \nof 17% in the company. The investment is designated at fair value through OCI as it is considered strategic in nature.\n173\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

The objectives of the Group’s financial risk \nmanagement policies are to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet the Group’s operational and strategic needs and the management of financial risk at \noptimal cost. \nThe Group is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Group Board oversees the management of these \nrisks. The Board manages the risks through implementation of the Group treasury policy, supported by the Group Tax and Treasury Committee, \nwhich monitors and reviews the activities of the Group Treasury Function to ensure they are performed in accordance with the policy and reports to \nthe Board on a regular basis. It is Group policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that SIG is unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. In order to minimise this risk, SIG seeks to balance certainty \nof funding and a flexible, cost-effective borrowing structure. The key sources of finance are note holders, being professional institutional investors, \nand a RCF with principal banks. The Group also maintains cash balances which are more than sufficient to meet the requirements of the working \ncapital cycle taking into account the seasonality of the business.\nTo manage liquidity risk the Group prepares and reviews rolling weekly cash flow forecasts, actual cash and debt positions along with available \nfacilities and headroom which are reported weekly and monitored by Group management. In addition, full annual three-year forecasts are prepared \nincluding cash flow and headroom forecasts. The Group is in a good liquidity position and at 31 December 2022 held cash of £130.1m (2021: \n£145.1m), and had £90m (2021: £50.0m) additional headroom from the RCF that matures in May 2026.\nForeign currency risk\nThe Group has a number of overseas businesses whose revenues and costs are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which they \noperate. 58.2% of the Group’s 2022 continuing revenues (2021: 59%) were in foreign currencies, being primarily Euros and Polish Zloty. The Group \nfaces a translation risk in respect of changes to the exchange rates between the reporting currencies of these operations and Sterling and has \ndecided not to hedge the income statement translational risk arising from these income streams.\nThe Consolidated balance sheet of the Group is inherently exposed to movements in the sterling value of its net investments in foreign businesses. \nFor currencies where the Group has significant exposure, the Group seeks to hold financial liabilities and derivatives in the same currency to partially \nhedge the net investment values.\nThe Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to manage the exposures arising from cross currency transactions (Note 18d ii).\n175\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

Strict policies are in place in order to minimise \ncounterparty credit risk associated with these assets. A list of approved deposit counterparties is maintained and counterparty credit limits, based \non published credit ratings and CDS spreads, are in place. These limits, and the position against these limits, are reviewed and reported on a regular \nbasis. Sovereign credit ratings are also monitored, and country limits for investment assets are in place. If necessary, funds are repatriated to the UK.\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group has exposure to movements in interest rates on its outstanding debt, financial derivatives and cash balances. To reduce this risk the \nGroup monitors its mix of fixed and floating rate debt and, if required, transacts derivative financial instruments to manage this mix where appropriate. \nSIG has a policy of aiming to fix at least 50% of its average net debt over the medium term. The percentage of gross debt at fixed rates of interest \nat 31 December 2022 is 99.4% (2021: 99.5%). The percentage of available gross debt at fixed rates of interest at 31 December 2022 (including the \nundrawn RCF) is 85.3% (2021: 90.7%).\nd) Hedging activities and derivatives\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risks relating to its ongoing business operations. In order to manage the Group’s exposure \nto exchange rate and interest rate changes, the Group utilises currency derivative financial instruments. The fair values of these derivative financial \ninstruments are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the \nbalance sheet date.\nThe Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Where derivatives meet the hedge accounting criteria under the \nrules of IFRS 9, movements in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive \nincome. Where the criteria for hedge accounting are not met, movements are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. Financial instruments \nare presented as current assets or liabilities to the extent they are expected to be settled within 12 months after the end of the reporting period. \t\nThe Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 \nbased on the degree to which the fair value is observable:\n•\tLevel 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\tLevel 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or \nliability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n•\tLevel 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on \nobservable market data (unobservable inputs).\nAll of the financial instruments below are categorised as Level 2.\ni) Net investment hedges\nThe Group has investments in euro denominated subsidiaries. At 31 December 2022 the Group held €300m (2021: €300m) of direct euro-\ndenominated debt through its secured notes. This borrowing is being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to the euro foreign exchange risk on \ninvestments in euro denominated subsidiaries. Gains or losses on retranslation of the borrowing are transferred to OCI to offset any gains or losses on \ntranslation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instruments as the net investment in euro denominated assets \ncreates a translation risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the euro denominated debt. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 \nas the underlying risk of the hedging instrument is identical to the hedged risk component. Hedge ineffectiveness will arise when the amount of the \ninvestment in euro denominated subsidiaries becomes lower than the amount of the euro denominated debt.\n176\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

Sensitivity Analysis\nIFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Group’s profit or loss and other equity of reasonably possible \nfluctuations in market rates.\nThis sensitivity analysis has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the following hypothetical variations in market rates on the fair value of the Group’s \nfinancial assets and liabilities:\n(i)\t\t a 1% (100 basis points) increase or decrease in market interest rates; and\n(ii)\t a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all other currencies to which the Group is exposed.\na) Interest rate sensitivity\nThe Group is currently exposed to sterling and euro interest rates. The Group also has a minimal exposure to Polish zloty interest rates. In order to \nillustrate the Group’s sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in each \nrespective interest rate.

Payments against the deficit will be deductible for tax purposes on a paid basis and the Group expects to receive the tax benefit, therefore \nthe associated deferred tax asset has been recognised. \nThe Group has cumulative tax losses and other deductible temporary differences of £289.0m (2021: £258.2m) in the UK and £7.3m (2021: £4.2m) in \nBenelux for which no deferred asset is currently recognised as it is not considered probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to \nallow the utilisation of the deductible temporary differences. For the UK, although the trading businesses have returned to profitability in the current \nyear, the UK tax group remains in a taxable loss position and there is not considered to be sufficient convincing evidence that future taxable profits \nwill be available at 31 December 2022. If the Group were to recognise all unrecognised deferred tax assets, profit and equity would have increased by \n£74.1m. The deductible temporary differences are available indefinitely. \nAt the balance sheet date, no deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences relating to undistributed profits of the overseas subsidiaries \nwhich aggregate to £186m (2021: £143m). The Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is \nprobable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nThe UK Budget 2021 announced an increase to the UK’s main corporation tax rate to 25%, which is due to be effective from 1 April 2023. These \nchanges were substantively enacted at 31 December 2021 and were reflected in the measurement of deferred tax balances at the prior period end. \nThis did not have a significant impact as deferred assets are currently not recognised in the UK as noted above.\nThe Group has considered the impact of climate-related matters on future taxable profits when assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets. \nAt present, the impact of climate-related matters is not considered significant to forecast results and therefore no specific assumptions relating to \nclimate change are currently built into the forecasts. \n184\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

Retirement benefit obligations\nThe Group operates a number of pension schemes, four (2021: four) of which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable salary. Of these \nschemes, one (2021: one) has assets held in a separate trustee administered fund and three (2021: three) are overseas book reserve schemes. The \nGroup also operates a number of defined contribution schemes, all of which are independently managed. \nThere is one pension plan in The Netherlands which is classified as a multi-employer defined benefit scheme under IAS 19, but is recognised in \nthe Consolidated financial statements as a defined contribution scheme since the pension fund is not able to provide sufficient information to allow \nSIG’s share of the assets and liabilities to be separately identified. Therefore, the Group’s annual pension expense for this scheme (the industry-wide \npension plan for the construction materials industry (“BPF HiBiN”)), is equal to the required contribution each year. The coverage ratio of the multi-\nemployer union plan increased to 109% as at 31 December 2022 (2021: 102.5%). The pension premium percentage was increased to 25.2% (2021: \n22.2%). The coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the fund’s assets by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based upon market interest rates. \nThe Company’s participation in this scheme represents c0.1% of the total members. The Company is not liable for other participants’ obligations, and \nthere is no agreed allocation of surplus or deficit on withdrawal from the scheme or on winding up of the scheme. The Company is not aware of any \nplanned changes to contributions or benefits at the current time.\nThe Group’s total pension charge for the year, including amounts charged to interest and Other items, was £7.4m (2021: £6.9m), of which a charge of \n£0.2m (2021: £0.6m) related to defined benefit pension schemes and £7.2m (2021: £6.3m) related to defined contribution schemes. \n188\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "Defined benefit pension scheme valuations\nIn accordance with IAS 19 the Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the Consolidated statement  \nof comprehensive income.\nThe actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends \nthe rate of contribution payable each year. The last formal actuarial valuation of the SIG plc Retirement Benefits Plan, the UK scheme which is the \nlargest scheme of the Group, as at 31 December 2019 was concluded in March 2021 and showed that the market value of the scheme’s assets was \n£196.3m and their actuarial value covered 102% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable \nsalaries. As part of the funding discussions the Group paid an additional one-off contribution of £2.5m into the Plan in July 2021 to accelerate plans to \nachieve a secondary funding target. On 30 June 2016 the UK defined benefit pension scheme was closed to future benefit accrual. The next triennial \nvaluation as at 31 December 2022 will commence shortly. \nIn 2018 an asset-backed funding arrangement was put in place to fund the triennial pension deficit identified by the previous valuation as at 31 \nDecember 2016 and to increase security of the Plan. The asset backed funding arrangement transfers certain rights over a managed pool of certain \ncustomer receivables of one of the Group’s subsidiary companies to a partnership and provides a mechanism to settle future funding commitments \nfrom receipts from higher quality trade receivables to ensure contributions to the Plan of £2.5m per annum for up to 20 years (as may be required and \nsubject to certain discretions). The balance of receivables assigned to the managed pool is disclosed in Note 15. The level of customer receivables \nassigned to the managed pool has increased by £10.7m during the year in order to provide additional security to the Trustees following the refinancing \nof the Group’s debt in 2021 with associated security changes. This does not change the level of annual distribution or commitment to the Plan. \nThe partnership is controlled by the Group and is therefore included within the consolidated financial statements. The receivables continue to be \nrecognised on the consolidated balance sheet, and the Plan’s interest in the partnership is a non-transferable financial asset issued by the Group, \nand therefore does not constitute a plan asset for the Group. Distribution of income to the partners of the partnership, which forms the contribution to \nthe Plan, is at the discretion of the General Partner, a subsidiary of the Group. There is however a guarantee in place which ensures that the Group’s \nsubsidiary, SIG Trading Limited, will make an equivalent contribution to the Plan if the partnership does not effect the discretionary distribution. The \nGroup is therefore committed to making a contribution of £2.5m per annum until the structure terminates at the end of 20 years or earlier if certain \nagreed funding levels are reached. \nThe Trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme. The Trustees of \nthe pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.\nThe other three schemes are book reserve schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension \nscheme but makes a reserve in its accounts. Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets. The liabilities of the schemes are met \nby the sponsoring companies. \nThe schemes typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk. The risk relating to \nbenefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members on death in service is reinsured by an external insurance company.\nInvestment risk\nThe present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high \nquality corporate bond yields; if the return on plan assets falls below this rate, it will create a plan deficit. Currently the plan has \nrelatively balanced investments in line with the Trustees’ Statement of Investment Principles between equity securities and debt \ninstruments. Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the Trustees of the pension fund consider it appropriate that a \nreasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in growth assets to leverage the return generated by the fund. \nInterest rate risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the \nplan’s bond holdings.\nLongevity risk\nThe present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan \nparticipants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the \nplan’s liability.\nSalary risk\nThe present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, \nan increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. However, a pensionable salary cap was introduced \nfrom 1 July 2012 of 2.5% per annum.\nConsolidated income statement charges\nThe pension charge for the year, including amounts charged to interest of £nil (2021: £0.2m) relating to the defined benefit pension schemes, was \n£0.2m (2021: £0.6m). This is net of £0.3m credit included within Other items relating to the member options exercise undertaken during the year.\nIn accordance with IAS 19, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the \nincrease in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets. The actuarial valuations described previously have been updated \nat 31 December 2022 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19. Investments have been \nvalued, for this purpose, at fair value.\nThe UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new members and has an age profile that is rising. The three overseas book reserve schemes remain \nopen to new members.\n189\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

Retirement benefit obligations continued\nConsolidated balance sheet liability\nThe balance sheet position in respect of the four defined benefit schemes can be summarised as follows:\n2022 \n£m \n2021 \n£m\nPension liability before taxation\n(23.0)\n(10.7)\nRelated deferred tax asset\n 1.7\n 2.1 \nPension liability after taxation\n(21.3)\n(8.6)\nThe actuarial loss of £14.3m (2021: £9.1m gain) for the year, together with the associated deferred tax charge of £0.5m (2021: £0.1m credit) has been \nrecognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. In addition a deferred tax credit of £nil (2021: £0.4m credit) has been recognised \nin the Consolidated income statement.\nOf the above pension liability before taxation, £15.7m (2021: £2.2m) relates to wholly or partly funded schemes and £7.3m (2021: £8.5m) relates to the \noverseas unfunded schemes. The liability in relation to the UK scheme has increased during the year due to an increase in gilt yields causing a loss \non scheme assets, partially offset by a reduction in the liabilities due to an increase in the discount rate, reflecting a significant increase in corporate \nbond yields over the period.\nThe movement in the pension liability before taxation in the year can be summarised as follows:\n2022 \n£m \n2021 \n£m\nPension liability at 1 January \n(10.7)\n(25.1)\nCurrent service cost\n(0.5)\n(0.4)\nPayment of unfunded benefits\n 0.3 \n 0.3 \nContributions\n 2.5 \n 5.0 \nNet finance cost\n — \n(0.2)\nPast service credit – plan amendment (included within Other items)\n 0.3 \n — \nActuarial (loss)/gain\n(14.3)\n 9.1 \nEffect of changes in exchange rates\n(0.6)\n 0.6 \nPension liability at 31 December\n(23.0)\n(10.7)\nThe principal assumptions used for the IAS 19 actuarial valuation of the UK scheme (the largest scheme of the Group) were:\n2022 \n% \n2021 \n%\nRate of increase in salaries1\nn/a\nn/a\nRate of fixed increase of pensions in payment\n1.9%\n2.0%\nRate of increase of LPI pensions in payment\n3.0%\n3.2%\nDiscount rate\n4.9%\n1.8%\nInflation assumption\n3.2%\n3.4%\n1.\t \u0007Upon closure of the UK defined benefit scheme to future benefit accrual the accrued benefits of active members ceased to be linked to their final salary and will instead revalue in \ndeferment broadly in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index.\nDeferred pensions are revalued to retirement in line with the schemes’ rules and statutory requirements, with the inflation assumption used for LPI \nrevaluation in deferment.\nWithin the principal plan the life expectancy for a male employee beyond the normal retirement age of 65 is 22.5 years (2021: 22.6 years). The life \nexpectancy on retirement at age 65 of a male employee currently aged 45 years is 22.9 years (2021: 23.1 years). The life expectancy for a female \nemployee beyond the normal retirement age of 65 is 23.9 years (2021: 24.0 years). The life expectancy on retirement at age 65 of a female employee \ncurrently aged 45 years is 25.5 years (2021: 25.6 years).\nThe sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of \nthe reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. If the discount rate were to be increased/decreased by 0.1%, this would decrease/\nincrease the Group’s gross pension scheme deficit by c£1.4m. If the rate of inflation increased/decreased by 0.1% this would increase/decrease the \nGroup’s gross pension scheme deficit by c£0.4m. If the life expectancy for employees increased by one year the Group’s gross pension scheme \ndeficit would increase by c£4.5m. The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit \nobligation as it is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\nThe average duration of the defined benefit scheme obligation at 31 December 2022 is 16 years (2021: 17 years).\n190\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "Independent auditor’s report\nto the members of SIG plc\nAn overview of the scope of the parent company and Group audits\nTailoring the scope\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each company \nwithin the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We consider size, risk profile, the \norganisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment, the potential impact of climate change \nand other factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each component.\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant \naccounts in the financial statements, we selected eight components covering entities within the United Kingdom (including the parent company), \nFrance, Germany, Poland, and Ireland which represent the principal business units within the Group.\nOf the eight components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of five components (“full scope components”) which \nwere selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining three components (“specific scope components”), we performed audit \nprocedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in \nthe financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. \nThe reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 92% (2021: 90%) of the Group’s underlying operating profit, being \nthe measure used to calculate materiality, 99% (2021: 94% of the Group’s underlying loss before tax) of the Group’s underlying profit before tax, 91% \n(2021: 92%) of the Group’s Revenue and 89% (2021: 88%) of the Group’s Total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed \n56% (2021: 40%) of the Group’s underlying operating profit, 48% (2021: 47% of the Group’s underlying loss before tax) of the Group’s underlying profit \nbefore tax, 71% (2021: 72%) of the Group’s Revenue and 69% (2021: 77%) of the Group’s Total assets. The specific scope components contributed \n36% (2021: 50%) of the Group’s underlying operating profit, 51% (2021: 47% of the Group’s underlying loss before tax) of the Group’s underlying profit \nbefore tax, 20% (2021: 20%) of the Group’s Revenue and 20% (2021: 11%) of the Group’s Total assets. The audit scope of these components may \nnot have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the \nGroup. We also instructed two locations to perform specified procedures over certain aspects of revenue, receivables, and cash.\nOf the remaining components that together represent 8% of the Group’s underlying operating profit, none are individually greater than 5% of the \nGroup’s underlying operating profit. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review, review of internal audit \nreports, testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations and foreign currency translation recalculations to respond to any potential \nrisks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements. \nChanges from the prior year \nThe Group scope was consistent with the prior year.\nInvolvement with component teams \nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by \nus, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction. Of the five \nfull scope components, audit procedures were performed on three of these directly by the primary audit team and two by component audit teams. \nOf the three specific scope components, audit procedures were performed by component audit teams for all. Where the work was performed by \ncomponent auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained \nas a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.\nThe Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor, and \nother Group Partners and team members, visit all full scope and other key locations. During the current year’s audit cycle, visits and in-person \nmeetings were undertaken by the primary audit team with the component teams in France, Germany and Ireland. These visits involved discussing \nthe audit approach with the component team and any issues arising from their work, meeting with local management, and reviewing relevant audit \nworking papers on risk areas. The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams, where appropriate, during various stages of the \naudit, reviewed relevant working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. At critical periods of the audit, we \nincreased the use of online collaboration tools to facilitate team meetings, information sharing and the evaluation, review and oversight of component \nteams. We requested more detailed deliverables from component teams, and we utilised fully the interactive capability of EY Canvas, our global audit \nworkflow tool, to review remotely the relevant underlying work performed. The Senior Statutory Auditor is responsible for the UK component teams. \nFor the UK components, communication has been maintained throughout the audit covering the same areas described above applicable to all non-\nUK component teams. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the \nGroup financial statements.\n198\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "Climate change \nThere remains increased interest from stakeholders as to how climate change will impact companies. The Group has determined that the most \nsignificant future impact from climate change on its operations will be the removal of fossil fuels from the Group’s fleet of vehicles. These effects are \nexplained on pages 47 to 53 in the required Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures and on pages 56 to 61 in the principal risks and \nuncertainties. They have also explained their climate commitments on pages 26 to 36, including ‘Net zero carbon by 2035 at the latest’ and ‘Zero SIG \nwaste to landfill by 2025’. All of these disclosures form part of the “Other information,” rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures \non these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our \nknowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on “Other information”. \nIn planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the Group’s business and any consequential material \nimpact on its financial statements. \nThe Group has explained in the Statement of significant accounting policies how they have assessed the impact of climate change on the carrying \nvalue of non-current assets and the impact on forecasts used in the impairment review and the assessments of going concern and longer term \nviability. Management concluded these considerations did not have a material impact on the Group in the current year or over the next three years.\nOur audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the financial statements was focused on evaluating management’s assessment of \nthe impact of climate risk, physical and transition, and their climate commitments. As part of this evaluation, we performed our own risk assessment, \nsupported by our climate change internal specialists, to determine the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements from climate change \nwhich needed to be considered in our audit.\nWe also challenged the Directors’ considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated \ndisclosures. Where considerations of climate change were relevant to our assessment of going concern, these are described above.\nBased on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or to impact a key  \naudit matter.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current \nperiod and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters \nincluded those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the \nengagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and \nwe do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n199\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

This \nassessment includes intangible  \nassets, PPE, and ROUA.\nImpairment tests are performed \nwhere indicators of impairment \nexist. Impairment tests can include \nsignificant areas of estimation \nuncertainty and judgement over the \nfuture performance of the business, \nfor example forecast future trading \nresults and cashflows and specific \nassumptions such as discount rates \nand long-term growth rates.\nChanges to assumptions or adverse \nperformance could have a significant \nimpact on the available headroom and \nany impairment that may be required. \nIn the current year, this risk specifically \nrelates to the Benelux cash-generating \nunit (“CGU”). Additionally, indicators \nmay exist that reversal of previously \nrecorded impairment is appropriate.  \nIn the current year, this risk specifically \nrelates to the UK Interiors CGU.\nIndicators of Impairment or Reversal of Impairment\nWe audited management’s impairment assessment including their consideration of \nindicators for impairment or reversal of impairment. We considered whether other \nindicators existed which were not identified by management.\nValuation Model\nWe understood the methodology behind, and tested, the discounted cash-flow \nmodel used by management to perform the impairment test for each of the relevant \nCGUs per the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. \nWe tested the clerical accuracy of the model and challenged the allocation of central \nassets and forecasting risk adjustments through understanding the rationale for their \ninclusion and reviewing management’s calculations. \nWe identified and walked through key controls in the impairment process identified \nby management, including the budgeting process.\nWe challenged whether any ‘indicators’ of impairment reversal exist and whether they \nare sufficiently satisfied in order to recognise any reversal of previous impairment \ncharges.\nKey assumptions in the valuation\nWe evaluated the key underlying assumptions within the VIU calculation including the \nforecasts, discount rates, and long-term growth rates.\nWe evaluated the impact of cost-inflation, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and \nclimate risk on the assumptions.\nWe challenged the underlying forecast in management’s 2023 budgets and 2024-\n2025 medium-term plan. Our challenge focused on the cost-inflation pressures and \ngrowth assumptions.\nWe benchmarked the discount rate calculation and long-term growth rates applied, \nusing our internal valuation experts. We considered if management’s assumptions \nare within an acceptable range based on comparative market data.\nWe applied sensitivities to the long-term growth rates used in the model by \nbenchmarking to alternative source of evidence, we noted management’s rates were \ncomparable and the model was not overly sensitive to this change.\nFor the Benelux CGU, we performed our own sensitivities on the key assumptions to \nunderstand whether a reasonable change in assumptions would materially change \nthe conclusions reached by management. \nFor the UK Interiors CGU, we challenged management as to whether current \nperformance, and status of the turnaround plan, represented a reason to reverse \nprevious impairments of PPE and ROUA recorded in 2020.\nDisclosures\nWe assessed the disclosures against the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of \nAssets, in particular the requirement to disclose further sensitivities for CGUs where a \nreasonably possible change in a key assumption would cause an impairment.\nWe also assessed the disclosure within the key judgements and estimation \nuncertainty section of the financial statements.\nThe primary audit team performed audit procedures over this risk area covering \n100% of the risk amount.\nAn impairment charge of £15.8m against \nBenelux goodwill, PPE and ROUA has \nbeen appropriately recorded.\nDue to the challenging economic \nenvironment, the sensitivity to a \ndownside case and current profitability \nlevels not yet reaching pre-impairment \nlevels, we agree there is insufficient \nevidence to support a reversal of \nprevious impairment in the UK  \nInteriors CGU.\nWe reviewed the disclosures included \nwithin the financial statements and \nconsider them appropriate. \n200\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

There is opportunity through \nmanagement override of controls or \nerror to either overstate or understate \nthe balance of supplier rebates \nrecognised.\nWe focused our audit procedures on the areas where management apply judgement \nand estimation, where the processing is either manual or more complex, and \nwhere the value is high. In particular, where amounts receivable are tiered based \non volumes purchased or where volumes are estimated, for example where \narrangements span the year end.\nWe performed walkthroughs to understand the key processes used to record \nsupplier rebate transactions and identified key controls.\nWe performed analytical reviews to understand unusual movements in income \nstatement and balance sheet accounts period on period, including ageing analysis.\nWe selected a sample of suppliers, in order to obtain independent confirmations to \nconfirm key terms, income recognised and the year end receivable.\nUsing the confirmations received, we reconciled income recognised in the period and \nthe receivable recorded at the year end.\nWhere third party vendor confirmations could not be obtained for the sample, we:\n•\t Obtained and reviewed the agreement signed by both parties.\n•\t Validated the purchase volumes used in the calculation of income through sample \ntesting to supporting documentation.\n•\t Recalculated the year-end rebate receivable and income recognised in the year \nbased on the validated volumes and the terms of the signed agreement.\nUsing data extracted from the accounting system, we tested the appropriateness of \na sample of journal entries and other adjustments to supplier rebate accounts in the \nbalance sheet and income statement.\nWe reviewed the appropriateness of the critical accounting judgements and key \nsources of estimation uncertainty disclosed in respect of supplier rebate amounts \nrecorded in the income statement and balance sheet.\nWe performed the above audit procedures over this risk area at eight full and specific \nscope locations, which covered 97% of the risk amount associated to supplier rebate \nincome, and 95% of the risk amount associated to supplier rebates receivable.\nThe income recognised in the year and \nthe balance sheet position at year end \nare appropriately recorded.\nWe reviewed the disclosures included \nwithin the financial statements and \nconsider them appropriate.\nIn the prior year, our auditor’s report included key audit matters in relation to potential impairment of investments in subsidiary undertakings and the \nrecoverability of receivables due from subsidiary undertakings in the parent company, and classification of Other Items in the Income Statement. \nIn the current year, we consider these risks to have reduced versus the prior year given the improved financial performance of the Group and the \nreduction in the level of Other Items recognised in the Income Statement.\nOur application of materiality\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in \nforming our audit opinion. \nMateriality\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be £3.5m (2021: £3.0m), which is 4.4% of underlying operating profit (2021: 0.5% of gross margin). We \nbelieve that underlying operating profit provides us with the most relevant performance measures to the stakeholders of the Group and is therefore an \nappropriate basis for materiality. The increase in materiality year on year is reflective of the improved financial performance of the Group. The basis of \nmateriality represents a change versus the prior year and was selected because underlying operating profit is a key focus for management and those \ncharged with governance and, due to the improvement in operating profit versus the prior year, was a more appropriate measure upon which to base \nmateriality, and gave a materiality value reflective of the performance of the Group. \nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be £3.5m (2021: £3.0m), which is 1.0% (2021: 1.0%) of equity being £4.3m, however we have \ncapped this at the materiality for the Group.\nDuring the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality but this did not result in any changes.\n201\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a \nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise \nfrom fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. \nExplanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, \noutlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not \ndetecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through \ncollusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and \nmanagement. \n•\tWe obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant, \nwhich are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements, are those that relate to the reporting framework (UK adopted \nInternational Accounting Standards, the Companies Act 2006 and the UK Corporate Governance Code) and the relevant tax compliance \nregulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.\n•\tWe understood how SIG plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal \nand compliance procedures, and the Company Secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of minutes of meetings of the Board of \nDirectors, Remuneration Committee, Nominations Committee, and the Audit and Risk Committee (which we also observed in attendance). We also \nconsidered the results of our audit procedures across the Group.\n•\tWe assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with \nmanagement from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was a susceptibility to fraud. We also considered \nperformance targets and their propensity to influence efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and \ncontrols that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management \nmonitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified \nfraud risk. These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements \nwere free from fraud and error.\n203\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

      "text": "Basis of accounting\nThe separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared under the \nhistorical cost convention except for derivative financial instruments which are stated at their fair value. \nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at \nthe measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair \nvalue of an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those \ncharacteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement purposes in these financial \nstatements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions that \nare within the scope of IAS 17, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in IAS 2 \nor value in use in IAS 36. Categorisation of fair value is set out in the Consolidated financial statements on pages 145 to 147.\nThe separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (“FRS \n101”) and the Companies Acts 2006 as applicable to companies using FRS 101. FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework for a qualifying \nentity that would otherwise apply the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK adopted international accounting standards in \nconformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The Company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 101.\nGoing concern\nThe Company closely monitors its funding position throughout the year, including monitoring compliance with covenants and available facilities to \nensure it has sufficient headroom to fund operations.\nThe Company’s financing facilities comprise a €300m fixed rate bond (secured notes), due November 2026, and £90m RCF which expires in May 2026. \nThe secured notes are subject to incurrence based covenants only, and the RCF has a leverage maintenance covenant which is only effective if the \nfacility is over 40% drawn at a quarter end reporting date. The RCF was undrawn at 31 December 2022.\nThe Company has significant available liquidity and on the basis of current forecasts is expected to remain in compliance with all banking covenants \nthroughout the forecast period to 31 March 2024. \nThe Company has no trading operations and therefore its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the trading of its subsidiaries and the \nforecasts for the Group as a whole. The Directors have considered the Group’s forecasts which support the view that the Group and Company will be \nable to continue to operate within its banking facilities and comply with its banking covenants. The Directors have considered the following principal \nrisks and uncertainties that could potentially impact the Group and Company’s ability to fund its future activities and adhere to its banking covenants, \nincluding:\n•\thigh levels of product inflation, and current economic and political uncertainties across Europe, all potentially impacting market demand;\n•\tpotentially recessionary conditions in the coming year; and\n•\tmaterial shortages impacting our ability to meet demand and hence having an impact on forecast sales.\nThe forecasts on which the going concern assessment is based have been subject to sensitivity analysis and stress testing to assess the impact of \nthe above risks and the Directors have also reviewed mitigating actions that could be taken. Details are set out in the Viability statement review on \npages 66 and 67.\nThe Directors have considered the impact of climate-related matters on the going concern assessment, but the impact on the Company is not \nconsidered to create any material uncertainties related to events or conditions that could cast significant doubt upon the Company’s ability to \ncontinue as a going concern. \nOn consideration of the above, the Directors believe that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the forecast \nperiod to 31 March 2024 and the Directors therefore consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 2022 financial statements.\nNew standards, interpretations and amendments adopted\nA number of amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2022, but do not have an impact on the financial statements of the Company. \nThe Company has not early adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective. \nExemptions applied in accordance with FRS 101\t\nThe following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with FRS 101:\n•\tthe requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”\n•\tthe requirements of IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”\n•\tthe requirements of paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 ”Fair Value Measurement”\n•\tthe requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” to present comparative information in respect of:\n(i)\t paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1 and\n(ii)\t (paragraph 73(e) of IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment”\nCompany statement of significant accounting policies\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n208\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

The judgements involving estimations are dealt with separately below.\nRecognition of deferred tax assets\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax attributes losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which \nthe attributes losses can be utilised, after consideration of available taxable temporary differences. The Company has £10.6m (2021: £10.7m) of \npotential deferred tax assets relating to cumulative UK tax losses and other deductible timing differences which are currently unrecognised as \nthere is not considered to be sufficient convincing evidence at 31 December 2022 that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to allow the \nutilisation of the deductible temporary differences, in particular given the cumulative historic and current year tax loss position in the UK. This required \nsignificant management judgement to determine the likely timing and level of future taxable profits and whether sufficient, convincing evidence was \navailable at 31 December 2022 to recognise the previously unrecognised deferred tax assets. If the Company were able to recognise all unrecognised \ndeferred tax assets, profit and equity would have increased by £10.6m. Further details are disclosed in Note 13. \nThe key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of the assets and liabilities \nrecognised by the Company within the next financial year are detailed below. \n209\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nStrategic report\nGovernance\nFinancials"

      "text": "Company statement of significant accounting policies\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\nImpairment of fixed asset investments\nDetermining whether the Company’s investments are impaired requires an estimation of the investments’ value in use. The key estimates made in the \nvalue in use calculation in relation to trading subsidiaries are those regarding discount rates, sales growth rates, gross margin and long term operating \nprofit growth. The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money for the Group. \nThe Company performs investment impairment reviews by forecasting cash flows based upon the following year’s budget as a base, taking into \naccount current economic conditions. The carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries at the balance sheet date was £267.6m (2021: £267.6m). \nOf the £267.6m net book value at 31 December 2022, £263.7m relates to the Company’s investment in SIG Trading Limited, the largest UK trading \nsubsidiary, and therefore assumptions regarding sales, gross margin and operating profit growth of this subsidiary are considered to be the key \nareas of estimation in the impairment review process. At 31 December 2022 the carrying value is supported by the future operating cashflows and no \nfurther impairments are recognised. No reversal of the previous impairment is recognised as there is not sufficient evidence that the factors leading to \nthe impairment in previous years no longer exist and that the reverse indicators of impairment are sufficiently satisfied at 31 December 2022.\nWhilst the Directors consider the assumptions used in the impairment review to be realistic, if actual results are different from expectations then it is \npossible that the value of the investment included in the Company balance sheet could become impaired further. Further details on the assumptions \nand sensitivities in relation to the forecast future cash flows of this subsidiary are provided in Note 11 of the Consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings\nAt 31 December 2022 the Company has recognised amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings of £574.6m (2021: £492.3m). The Company \nrecognises an allowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) in relation to amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings based on the ability to repay \namounts repayable on demand and whether there has been any significant change in credit risk. An ECL provision of £74.0m has been recognised \nat 31 December 2022 (2021: £169.9m) based on estimates regarding the future cash flows from subsidiaries and taking account of the time value of \nmoney. Changes in the economic environment or circumstances specific to individual subsidiaries could have an impact on recoverability of amounts \nincluded on the Company balance sheet at 31 December 2022 and level of ECL provision required in the future. \n210\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

During the year a final \nsettlement was agreed with the Landlord, with the remaining unused provision being released to the profit and loss account.\nThe onerous lease provision relates to a vacant property. The future rental costs are included in the lease liability, with the right-of-use asset impaired \nto reflect the future cost not covered through sublease income. During the year a final settlement was agreed with the Landlord, with the remaining \nunused provision being released to the profit and loss account.\nThe onerous contract provision relates to licence fee commitments where no future economic benefit is expected to be obtained, principally in relation \nto the SAP S/4HANA implementation following the change in scope of the project in previous years. The remaining cost will be incurred in 2023.\n13. Deferred tax\nDeferred tax has not been recognised on trading losses and other deductible temporary differences of £42.4m (2021: £42.2m) carried forward on the \nbasis that the realisation of their future economic benefit is uncertain. The unrecognised potential deferred tax asset in relation to this is £10.6m (2021: \n£10.7m). At the balance sheet date, no deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences relating to undistributed profits of the overseas \nsubsidiaries. The Company is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not \nreverse in the foreseeable future. The value of the losses has increased in the year due to the main rate of UK corporation tax increasing from 19%  \nto 25%.\n14.

Capital and reserves continued\nc) Reserves\nDetails of all movements in reserves are shown in the Company statement of changes in equity.\nThe share premium represents the amounts above the nominal value received for shares sold.\nThe share option reserve represents the cumulative equity-settled share option charge under IFRS 2 “Share-based payments” less the value of any \nshare options that have been exercised.\nThe cash flow hedging and cost of hedging reserves represents movements in the Consolidated balance sheet as a result of movements in the fair \nvalue of cash flow hedges which are taken directly to reserves as detailed in the Statement of significant accounting policies.\nThe merger reserve principally represents the premium on ordinary shares issued in a previous year through the use of a cash box structure. \nThe Company maintains its positive distributable reserves position and continues to review the Group structure to optimise reserves. At 31 December \n2022 the Company had distributable reserves of £247.3m (2021: £190.2m). \n15. Guarantees and contingent liabilities\na) Guarantees\nAt 31 December 2022 the Company had provided guarantees of £nil (2021: £nil) on behalf of its subsidiary undertakings.\nb) Contingent liabilities\nAs at the balance sheet date, the Company had outstanding obligations under a standby letter of credit of up to £5.2m (2021: £4.7m). This standby \nletter of credit, issued by HSBC Bank plc, is in respect of the Group’s insurance arrangements. \nAs disclosed in the Statement of significant accounting policies, SIG Building Systems Limited have taken advantage of the exemption available under \nSection 479A of the Companies Act 2006 in respect of the requirement for audit. As a condition of the exemption, the Company has guaranteed the \nyear end liabilities of the entity until they are settled in full.\n16. Related party transactions\nRemuneration of key management personnel\nThe total remuneration of the Directors of the Group Board, who the Company considered to be its key management personnel, is provided in the \naudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 121 to 126. In addition, the Company recognised a share-based payment charge under \nIFRS 2 of £2.0m (2021: £0.7m) with a credit to the share option reserve of £2.0m (2021: £0.7m).\n216\nSIG  Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

These protected forests are then able \nto continue absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, \nreferred to as REDD (Reduced Emissions from \nDeforestation and forest Degradation). This is now \nrecognised as one of the most cost-effective and \nswiftest ways to arrest the rise in atmospheric CO2 \nand global warming effects. Additional to the carbon \nbenefits is the flora and fauna this land preserves, \nincluding a number of species identified at risk of \nextinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\nThis is to certify that by using Carbon Balanced Paper \nfor the SIG plc Annual Report, SIG plc has balanced \nthrough World Land Trust the equivalent of 393kg of \ncarbon dioxide.
