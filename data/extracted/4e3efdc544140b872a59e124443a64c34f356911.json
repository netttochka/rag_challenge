      "text": "Guaranty Bancshares realized strong financial \nresults during the year. Total loans for the Company \ngrew $470.1 million during the year, to a record high \nof $2.4 billion. Total deposits ended the year with \ngrowth of $10.3 million and, likewise, a new record \ntotal of $2.7 billion. One of our primary goals for \n2022 was to exceed the previous year’s net income, \nwhich was a tall order given that 2021 included over \n$7.8 million in PPP-related extraordinary income \nand a reverse provision to our loan loss reserves of \n$1.7 million. I’m pleased to say we achieved this goal.\nThe Company generated net income of $40.4 \nmillion, compared to $39.8 million in the prior year, \na $641,000 or a 1.6% increase. We accomplished this \nresult even after taking a $3.4 million provision for \npotential future loan losses during the last quarter \nof the year. We felt this provision, while no credit \nlosses were imminent or identified, was prudent \ngiven the forecast of a possible recession in 2023.\nIt was a tough year for the stock market in \n2022, and our stock price was no exception. While \nwe certainly added significant intrinsic value to \nour Company, our total return for the year was \ndisappointing at -5.5%, including the $0.88 per \nshare dividend. This compares to a total return on \nthe NASDAQ of -32.5%, S&P 500 of -18.1%, and our \nbenchmark S&P Small Cap Banks Index of -11.8%. \nWhile it’s nice to be down less than other indexes, it \ndoesn’t change the economics for our shareholders. \nHowever, we remain poised to repurchase shares at \nThe past year was eventful, to say the least, and many positive developments have continued \nto drive our Company’s growth and progress. However, as we entered the first quarter of 2023, we \nwitnessed two bank failures, concerns about the health of the overall banking system and continued \ndiscussions of a recession. In the midst of these economic uncertainties and challenges, we remain \ncommitted to delivering value to our shareholders while fairly and consistently serving our customers \nand clients, as we have for 110 years. I will comment on the banking industry issues further into my \nletter, provide data that highlights how Guaranty is different from the banks that have had trouble \nand will explain the various strengths of our Company. But before that, I will start by reporting on the \nfinancial results and achievements of 2022.\nD E A R  F E L L O W  S H A R E H O L D E R S ,\n4\ndiscounted prices when opportunities are favorable \nfor shareholders. In 2022, we repurchased 2% of our \ncommon shares outstanding. These transactions \nwill continue to be very accretive to our remaining \nshareholders in the coming years, and we maintain \nexcess capital to repeat this strategy when the \nopportunity is right.\nWe all witnessed interest rates soar in 2022 as \nthe Fed made significant policy changes to key \ninterest rates in an effort to combat inflation. The \nFed increased interest rates seven times during the \nyear for a total of 425 basis points or 4.25%. The \nvelocity of this increase was unprecedented in \nrecent history. The speed of these rate increases \nover the year created several challenges for \nmanaging the balance sheet of a bank and created \nsignificant \nunrealized \nlosses \non \ngovernment \nsecurities held in banks. The Fed’s rapid monetary \npolicy changes also created significant liquidity \nand funding challenges for many banks, primarily \ndue to these unrealized losses. We saw the impact \nof these factors play out in March 2023 with two \nbank failures and one voluntary bank closure.\nGuaranty is in a stronger position because we \nmaintained our discipline and did not chase small \nincremental earnings over the last two years at the \nexpense of taking on significant interest rate risk on \nour balance sheet. The issue of duration mismatch in \nassets versus liabilities is at the heart of the recent \nbank failures and problems that some banks are \nhaving. Duration mismatch occurs as banks make \nlong-term, fixed-rate loans or buy long duration \ngovernment bonds, but issue short-term deposits \nto fund those loans. This works well until rates go \nup, however, and if rates go up materially, and the \nbank has too much concentration in these assets, \nit can be catastrophic. These failures to properly \nmanage interest rate and liquidity risks are nothing \nnew to banking. They were also at the root of the \nsavings and loan failures in the 1980’s. At Guaranty, \nwe took a more conservative approach to managing \nour liquidity in 2022. We sacrificed some earnings \nby maintaining large balances of cash rather than \ninvesting significant portions of that liquidity in \nlong term securities with yields between 1% and \n2% at the time. We believed rates could go up, \nand even if they didn’t, we weren’t willing to take \nthe significant interest rate and liquidity risk those \ninvestments required for minimal increases in short \nterm earnings. As a result, Guaranty weathered \nthis increasing rate environment with a moderate \nimpact to our balance sheet and liquidity. We held \nonly modest levels of long duration government \nsecurities as a percentage of our total assets and \ncapital, which positioned us to successfully navigate \nthe rapid change in rates, without a significant \nnegative impact to our balance sheet and capital. \nUnrealized losses on all government securities held \nby our Bank is a moderate 18% of total capital, and \nour liquidity remains strong.\n5\nIN THE MIDST OF THESE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND \nCHALLENGES, WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO DELIVERING VALUE TO OUR \nSHAREHOLDERS WHILE FAIRLY AND CONSISTENTLY SERVING OUR \nCUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS, AS WE HAVE FOR 110 YEARS.\nTY ABSTON, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD & CEO"

      "text": "86\n33.6609° N   |  95.5555° W\nHISTORIC DOWNTOWN PARIS, TEXAS\nAnother weakness exposed during the recent \nbank failures is the risk of an overly concentrated \ndeposit base, which can mirror the risk of an overly \nconcentrated loan portfolio. One of the troubled \nbanks had nearly 90% of their deposits in uninsured \naccounts. In comparison, Guaranty has uninsured \ndeposits of 29%. We also have a very granular deposit \nbase with 83,753 total deposit accounts carrying \nan average balance of $31,914. This granularity is a \nsignificant strength in determining the stability of a \nbank’s deposit base. Likewise, our loan portfolio, by \ndesign, is very granular. The average loan balance of \nthe entire loan portfolio is $204,000. As of year-end, \nwe had only 12 loans with committed balances over \n$10 million, only two of which were over $20 million, \nand and no loans over our internally set loan limit \nof $30 million, which is significantly below our legal \nloan limit of $54 million. This intentional granularity \nand diversification of our loan portfolio is a strength \nthat adds significant resilience during an economic \ndownturn. Much like holding additional liquidity, \nmaintaining a conservative position in our loan \nportfolio often comes at the expense of lower \nannual earnings than a more concentrated and \nless granular portfolio would generate. However, \nwe are not willing to take on that riskier profile \nfor whatever marginal improvements in earnings \nit would generate.\nWe will continue to manage our balance sheet \nwith an eye toward successfully managing risks, while \nstriving to achieve a fair return for our shareholders. \nAs I’ve said before, in a highly leveraged and \ncyclical business like banking, there’s no way to \nachieve consistency in financial performance while \nmaintaining a constant “risk-on” mentality. A risk-on \nphilosophy will maximize returns during periods of \neconomic expansion, but you often give back some \nof those returns when the economy contracts. In \nextreme cases, as we have seen this year, you can \nend up giving back all of your returns. Discipline \nis required to moderate risk when necessary, even \nwhen doing so seems overly cautious at the time. \nOur number one goal as management is to provide \nfair returns for our shareholders on a consistent \nbasis, and to limit the significant swings in financial \nperformance that are so often witnessed in banks.\nObjectives for 2023 are to remain focused \non customer needs, with a strong emphasis on \nmanaging risks at all levels given the economic \nenvironment. In 2023 and beyond, we will continue \nbuilding our management team to prepare for future \ngrowth cycles and management succession. We are \nin the process of updating our five-year strategic \nplan, which serves as a roadmap for future goals, \nprojected financial results, and strategic direction. \nIn each five-year strategic plan iteration, we hold \n9\nourselves accountable for obtaining the goals we \nset, which always appear lofty at the beginning of \nthe plan. However, to date, our team has always \nfound ways to get the job done and successfully \nexecute on each plan!\nAs I have also stated many times over the years, \nthe key to Guaranty’s past and future success lies in \nour ability to recruit and employ the right people. \nThese individuals promote our core values and \nculture, while thinking like an owner and staying \nfocused on achieving results. This has been the \nfoundation of our success for more than 50 years. \nIt is not a complicated formula, but it does require \ndaily effort to maintain and execute. As past \nleaders leave the company, new leaders have to \nstep up into those roles, a process that becomes \nmore complicated as our company grows. Growth \nadds complexity in banking. Year after year, we \nstrive to maintain our core values and culture while \ndeveloping leaders at all levels within the Company \nwho can meet this challenge.\nDuring 2022, three individuals retired from our \nCompany that I’d like to highlight. Bill Priefert, who \nis Chairman and CEO of Priefert Manufacturing in \nMount Pleasant, retired from our Company and \nthe Bank’s board of directors after 40 years of \nservice. Sara Neal, our Real Estate Department \nManager, retired after 41 years with our Bank. Joe \nRose, former President of our Bogata bank location \nand key member of our credit administration \ndepartment, retired after 38 years with the Bank. \nThese three individuals represent the best that is \nGuaranty, and we thank them for their dedication \nand commitment to helping make Guaranty what it \nis today. They have the qualities that our Company’s \nnew leaders should strive to emulate.\nIn conclusion, we are very pleased with our \n2022 results. While we expect some challenges and \nheadwinds in 2023, with projections of an economic \nslowdown, we also remain open to potential \nopportunities. Many economists forecast much \nslower growth in most industries and further layoffs \nby companies as they right-size their operations \nfor the slower economic environment. We are very \nblessed to be in the state of Texas, which continues \nto enjoy a vibrant economy and should ride through \nan economic downturn much stronger than other \nstates. For all the reasons listed above, Guaranty \nremains well-positioned to navigate this uncertain \nenvironment successfully. We’ve built a robust \nfranchise, with a banking footprint that covers the \nmajority of the growth areas in Texas. I remain very \noptimistic about our future prospects.\nThank you, fellow shareholders, for your continued \ninvestment, support, and confidence in Guaranty \nBancshares and Guaranty Bank & Trust.\nTY ABSTON\nCHAIRMAN OF THE \nBOARD & CEO\n7"

These for­\nward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about \nour industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are \ninherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are \nnot guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. \nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date \nmade, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking \nstatements. Such factors include, without limitation, the “Risk Factors” referenced in our most recent Annual Report on \nForm 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, other risks and uncertainties listed from time to time \nin our reports and documents filed with the SEC, and the following factors: business and economic conditions generally \nand in the financial services industry, nationally and within our current and future geographic market areas; economic, \nmarket, operational, liquidity, credit and interest rate risks associated with our business; natural disasters and adverse \nweather, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks, an outbreak of hostilities, a public health outbreak (such as COVID-19) or \nother international or domestic calamities, and other matters beyond our control; the composition of our loan portfolio, \nincluding deteriorating asset quality and higher loan charge-offs; the laws and regulations applicable to our business; \nour ability to achieve organic loan and deposit growth and the composition of such growth; increased competition in the \nfinancial services industry, nationally, regionally or locally; our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends; our ability \nto raise additional capital to execute our business plan; acquisitions and integrations of acquired businesses; systems fail­\nures or interruptions involving our information technology and telecommunications systems or third-party services; the \ncomposition of our management team and our ability to attract and retain key personnel; the fiscal position of the U.S. \nfederal government and the soundness of other financial institutions; and the amount of nonperforming and classified \nassets we hold. We can give no assurance that any goal or plan or expectation set forth in forward-looking statements \ncan be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. The forward-looking state­\nments are made as of the date of this Annual Report, and we do not intend, and assume no obligation, to update any \nforward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect \nthe occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law.\nDIVIDENDS CALENDAR\nDividends on Guaranty Bancshares, Inc. common stock are payable, if paid, quarterly.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS\nWhitley Penn\n8343 Douglas Avenue\nSuite 400\nDallas, Texas 75225\nTRANSFER AGENT\nComputershare Investor Services\nP.
