Business\nUnless the context otherwise requires, for purposes of this section, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company,” “the Company” or “Senti” refer to\nSenti Biosciences, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nOverview\nWe are a preclinical biotechnology company developing next-generation cell and gene therapies engineered with our gene circuit platform technologies to\nfight challenging diseases. Our mission is to create a new generation of smarter medicines that outmaneuver complex diseases using novel and unprecedented\napproaches. To accomplish this mission, we have built a synthetic biology platform that we believe may enable us to program next-generation cell and gene\ntherapies with what we refer to as “gene circuits.” These gene circuits, which we created from novel and proprietary combinations of genetic parts, are\ndesigned to reprogram cells with biological logic to sense inputs, compute decisions and respond to their respective cellular environments. We aim to design\nand optimize gene circuits and to improve the “intelligence” of cell and gene therapies in order to enhance their therapeutic effectiveness against a broad range\nof diseases that conventional medicines are unable to address. Our gene circuit platform technologies are designed to be applied in a modality-agnostic\nmanner, with applicability to natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), stem cells including induced Pluripotent Stem Cells\n(iPSCs) Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs), in vivo gene therapy, such as adeno associated virus (AAV), and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA).\nOur internal pipeline is focused on using these gene circuits we engineer onto off-the-shelf healthy adult donor derived NK cells to create chimeric\nantigen receptor (CAR) NK cells to potentially address the high unmet need in multiple oncology indications. All of our current product candidates are in\npreclinical development. We expect to file an investigational new drug application, or IND, for our lead product candidate SENTI-202 in the second half of\n2023.\nKey Challenges to Existing Disease Treatments and Our Gene Circuit Solutions\nKey Challenges to Existing Disease Treatments\nDiseases often involve complex biological interactions, which limit the effectiveness of existing therapeutics that have single mechanisms of action and\nare unable to adapt to dynamic disease states. We characterize these key challenges in the following four categories:\nDisease Evasion: Disease pathologies are multifaceted. For example, diseases can evade the immune system or acquire resistance to single-\ntarget treatments by activating other biological pathways. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of many solid tumors suppresses cancer-\nfighting immune cells via multiple pathways. A gene or cell therapy with the ability to activate multiple anti-tumor pathways within a single\nproduct could help limit disease evasion and may improve the durability of responses to treatment.\nTarget Heterogeneity: Many diseases are heterogeneous and express antigens that are also present on healthy cells. The overlap of antigen\nexpression on diseased and healthy cells limits the ability of existing therapies to target diseased cells at therapeutically relevant doses due to\nundesirable effects against healthy cells. For example, most cancers do not have a single antigen target that is uniformly expressed on all\ncancer cells with limited to no expression on non-cancerous cells. Thus, the ability to precisely distinguish between diseased cells and healthy\ncells has been a central challenge to date with current therapeutic approaches that do not encode logic, such as monoclonal antibodies,\nantibody-drug conjugates and single-target CAR therapies. Modalities that can respond to multiple biomarkers, rather than just a single one,\nhave the potential to open up the opportunity for more precise and efficacious medicines.\n5"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nNarrow Therapeutic Window: Once administered to a patient, conventional medicines, including cell and gene therapies, cannot be tuned up\nor down, which makes it difficult to find the optimal dose, especially for diseases that have a narrow therapeutic window. The ability to create\ntherapeutics that can be titrated or regulated in vivo in the patient may lead to enhanced efficacy and safety.\nDynamic Disease Conditions: Disease conditions are dynamic and vary in space and time. For example, diseases may manifest only in\ncertain tissues, or have a waxing and waning progression over time. Conventional therapies (i) are static, (ii) have a predefined activity around\na single mechanism of action that cannot be modified post-administration and (iii) do not adapt to these dynamic conditions, thus limiting their\nefficacy, specificity and safety. For example, current cell and gene therapies are not dynamic or highly specific, thus limiting the indications\nthat they can address. Developing dynamic therapeutics that are able to sense, and respond to, these spatially or temporally varying conditions\nwould address this challenge.\nOur Gene Circuit Solutions\nIn our pursuit to create a new generation of smarter medicines, we have built a toolbox of proprietary gene circuit platform technologies that we believe\nmay enhance the risk benefit paradigm of cell and gene therapy products. Four core categories of gene circuits comprise our gene circuit platform: Multi-\nArming, Logic Gating, Regulator Dials and Smart Sensors. Each of our gene circuit platform technologies is designed to confer greater clinical and\ntherapeutic activity, precision and control to cell and gene therapies.\nWe believe that our core gene circuit platform technologies may enable us to engineer smarter medicines. These technologies can be categorized as\nfollows:\nMulti-Arming: Multi-Arming gene circuits are designed to incorporate multiple payloads into a single cell or gene therapy product. These\ngene circuits are intended to activate various biological pathways in complementary ways to prevent diseases from evading single-target\ntreatments, and thereby potentially improve treatment efficacy. Existing combination therapies that target complex diseases require the\napplication of multiple individual drugs, which is difficult due to research, clinical development, regulatory and pharmacology barriers.\nLogic Gating: Logic Gating gene circuits are designed to enable cell and gene therapies to control their therapeutic activity in response to the\npresence or absence of multiple disease biomarkers. Below are examples of Logic Gates applied to cancer, although Logic Gating may also be\napplied to various other disease indications.\n6"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nNOT GATE: NOT GATE gene circuits are designed to widen the therapeutic window by enabling effective killing of cancer\ncells while preserving healthy cells. The NOT GATE functions by recognizing Protective Antigens (PAs), or antigens that are\nselectively expressed on healthy cells and not on cancer cells, thus limiting on-target, off-tumor killing. By protecting healthy\ncells, the NOT GATE has the potential to enable more effective on-target, on-tumor killing of tumor cells that express Tumor-\nAssociated Antigens (TAAs). Generally, existing cancer drugs target only a single antigen, which means they can only be\neffectively and safely used in situations where that antigen is uniquely expressed on tumors and not in healthy cells, or where the\non- target, off-tumor effects are tolerable.\nOR GATE: OR GATE gene circuits are designed to address tumor heterogeneity and limit antigen escape. The OR GATE\nfunctions by killing tumor cells that express any one of multiple antigens. Generally, current medicines are unable to address\nmore than one target at a time and are thus susceptible to tumor evasion.\nRegulator Dial: Regulator Dial gene circuits are designed to enable the precise tuning of therapeutic activity from a cell or gene therapy\nproduct. For example, this can be implemented by regulating therapeutic payload expression in response to varying concentrations of FDA-\napproved drugs. Regulator Dials are expected to enable the exogenous regulation of next-generation cell and gene therapies even after they\nhave been delivered in vivo. Existing cell and gene therapies cannot be modulated once they have been delivered into patients.\nSmart Sensor: A Smart Sensor is a gene circuit, or combination of gene circuits, designed to precisely detect distinct cell types or disease\nenvironments, and thus distinguish between the “disease state” and “healthy state.” For example, Smart Sensors can be engineered to detect\nwhether certain conditions, or disease biomarkers, are present before responding with a specific therapeutic response. Conventional medicines\nare generally unable to dynamically change their behavior in response to cell or disease specific conditions.\nThe rationale behind each gene circuit technology is explained in detail below:\n Multi-Arming\nMulti-Arming gene circuits are designed to incorporate multiple payloads into a single cell or gene therapy product. These gene circuits are intended to\nactivate various biological pathways in complementary ways to prevent diseases from evading single-target treatments, and thereby improve treatment\nefficacy. Existing combination therapies that target complex diseases require the application of multiple individual drugs, which is difficult due to research,\nclinical development, regulatory and pharmacology barriers.\nBackground: The Need for Targeting Multiple Biological Pathways\nMany diseases are difficult to treat because they result from the dysfunction of numerous biological pathways, or they evolve strategies to evade single-\ntarget therapies. Combination therapies involving multiple distinct drugs are being used to tackle this problem, but manufacturing, developing and delivering\nmultiple individual drugs into the body is challenging.\nOur Gene Circuit Solution: Multi-Arming\nWe believe our Multi-Arming gene circuits can be used to create a single cell or gene therapy product candidate that includes multiple payloads capable\nof combating multiple disease pathways more effectively. Multi-Arming gene circuits can be controlled by any of our other gene circuit technologies,\nincluding Regulator Dials, Logic Gates and Smart Sensors, to achieve conditional therapeutic activity.\nOur Calibrated Release (cr) Technology\nCytokines and other immune stimulatory proteins may be useful in overcoming the immunosuppressive TME in solid tumors by activating endogenous\nanti-tumor immune cells and to provide support for adoptive cell therapies.\n7"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nHowever, traditional approaches to use cytokines in combination with adoptive cell therapies have relied on systemic injection of cytokines or\nengineering the cell therapies themselves to secrete the cytokines or to display them on the cell surface. Systemic injection of cytokines has been challenging\ndue to poor tumor penetration and the risk of systemic immune toxicity. Engineering cell therapies to secrete cytokines has the potential to activate\nendogenous immune cells, but these secreted cytokines may not provide optimal stimulation of the cell therapies themselves. Engineering cell therapies to\ndisplay cytokines on the cell surface can stimulate the cell therapies themselves, but may not provide optimal activation of endogenous immune cells.\nTo overcome these limitations, we have created a novel engineered protein technology called calibrated release (cr). Our cr engineered cytokines are\nengineered with a designed protease cleavage site. These cr cytokines are expressed by our engineered cells and are released from the cell in a calibrated\nfashion via a protease ubiquitously expressed by the cell, wherein the release rate is calibrated by engineering modifications to the protease cleavage site. We\nbelieve this platform is translatable to various proteins, including IL-15 and IL-12.\nWe are using this approach to optimize IL-15 in our CAR–NK product candidates to simultaneously stimulate surrounding immune cells and promote\nCAR-NK cell expansion, persistence, and tumor killing.\nAs shown in the figure below, crIL-15 is functional when cleaved and released into the supernatant, resulting in activation of pSTAT5 signaling in T cells\nfrom resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells or PBMCs. In the left panel below, comparable pSTAT5 induction was observed in T cells exposed to\nsupernatant from engineered CAR-NK cells that expressed either crIL-15 or recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15), demonstrating benefits of crIL-15 in\nactivating other immune cells.\nFurthermore, in the right panel, crIL-15 was shown to improve serials cancer cell killing with a 3-round serial killing assay. Our engineered SENTI CAR-\nNK cells armed with our crIL-15 or with rhIL-15, or unengineered NK cells were co-cultured with tumor cells, which were added at hour 0, hour 96, and hour\n168, to repeatedly challenge the effector cells with new cancer target cells. While all three NK cells showed tumor cell killing at the first challenge, crIL-15\nengineered CAR-NK cells retained cancer cell killing even at the third challenge in contrast to the remaining two conditions. We believe this data shows the\npotential of our calibrated release technology platform to functionally enhance the killing activity of CAR-NK cells in challenging conditions.\n8"

This capability has the potential to enable more accurate and efficient targeting of heterogeneous diseased cells while sparing\nhealthy ones. Our initial product candidates for oncology will utilize our NOT GATE and OR GATE gene circuit technology. Furthermore, we believe this\ntechnology can be utilized across a broad range of oncology indications. To this end, we have established a proprietary Tumor-Associated Antigen, or TAA,\nand Protective Antigen, or PA, Paired Discovery Platform as detailed later in the Tumor-Associated Antigen and Protective Antigen Paired Discovery\nPlatform section to enable the expansion of our Logic Gating approach against novel Tumor-Associated Antigen and Protective Antigen pairs across multiple\ncancer indications.\n NOT GATE\nBackground: The Need for Precision Targeting\nThe expression of a single CAR in T cells or NK cells can redirect them to kill cancer cells that express a specific surface antigen. This technology has led\nto breakthrough therapies for B cell malignancies and multiple myeloma, where targeting of tissue-lineage antigens – CD19 or B Cell Maturation Antigen, or\nBCMA – rather than Tumor-Associated Antigens, is tolerated. Beyond these initial applications, the lack of uniquely specific tumor antigens presents a great\nchallenge because on-target, off-tumor toxicity to vital tissues significantly limits the cancer indications addressable by single-target CAR-NK or CAR-T\ntherapies. Similar limitations are faced by monoclonal antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates that rely on a single target to distinguish cancer cells from\nhealthy ones.\n9"

We believe this feature enables a widened therapeutic window\nand aggressive treatment of cancers with the potential for enhanced efficacy and reduced risk of undesirable side effects, as well as the expansion of cell\ntherapies into cancer indications where there are no ideal Tumor-Associated Antigens. We are currently leveraging our NOT GATE gene circuit technology in\nour SENTI-202 and SENTI-401 CAR-NK programs in liquid and solid tumors. Furthermore, we believe the NOT GATE has the potential to significantly\nincrease the applicability of CAR-NK cells against a wide range of liquid and solid tumors that currently do not have ideal Tumor-Associated Antigen targets\nand are thus currently unaddressed.\nAs shown in the figure below, we have engineered NK cells with a synthetic NOT GATE gene circuit, where an activating CAR, or aCAR, can drive the\nkilling of cancer cells presenting an activating, Tumor-Associated Antigen, shown in green, while an inhibitory CAR, or iCAR, can suppress cytotoxicity\nagainst normal healthy cells that express both the activating Tumor-Associated Antigen and a Protective Antigen, shown in purple.\nFuture Applications and Alternate Gene Circuits\nWe believe the potentially enhanced precision enabled by our NOT GATE gene circuit technology may improve the therapeutic window, and thus the\npotential efficacy and safety, of our product candidates against the cancer types targeted by our pipeline.

For example, the development of targeted acute\nmyeloid leukemia, or AML treatments is difficult due to more than 200 types of chromosome translocations and mutations having been identified in patients.\nThus, therapies targeting a single AML-associated antigen are often insufficient to kill all of the tumor subsets, including both AML leukemic stem cells, or\nLSCs, and blasts. Consequently, most AML patients treated with these therapies die from disease relapse and progression due to incomplete therapeutic\nactivity. Additionally, due to the highly mutagenic nature of cancer cells, targeting single antigens allows for cancers to more easily escape or acquire\nresistance to treatment. For\n10"

Many\nof those patients who relapse toward the latter end of the twelve-month period have cancers that have been associated with loss of the CD19 epitope.\nThese clinical observations demonstrate the potential benefit of developing therapeutics that are capable of simultaneously targeting multiple Tumor-\nAssociated Antigens across heterogeneous cancers using OR GATE gene circuit technology.\nOur Logic Gating Solution: OR GATE\nOur OR GATE gene circuits are designed to simultaneously target multiple Tumor-Associated Antigens. We are currently leveraging our OR GATE gene\ncircuit technology in our SENTI-202 CAR-NK program for liquid tumors.\n Regulator Dial\nOur Regulator Dial gene circuits are designed to enable the precise tuning of therapeutic activity from a cell or gene therapy product. For example, this\ncan be implemented by regulating therapeutic payload expression in response to varying concentrations of FDA-approved drugs. Regulator Dials are designed\nto enable the exogenous regulation of next-generation cell and gene therapies in vivo even after they have been delivered. We have generated numerous\nRegulator Dial gene circuits that have the potential to be controlled by a variety of FDA-approved small molecule oral drugs, and that are designed to\nimplement various control behaviors, such as ON switches, OFF switches and rheostats.\nBackground: The Need for Dynamic Regulation\nExisting cell and gene therapies cannot be regulated once they are delivered into the patient. This lack of in vivo control makes it difficult to control\ndosing within the ideal therapeutic window. This problem makes it challenging to expand cell and gene therapies to many disease indications and to engineer\nthese products to have increased potency and safety. As a result, gene therapies have focused on indications where constitutive expression is acceptable, rather\nthan diseases where expression of the therapeutic payload must be regulated within a specific range or be toggled on and off over a period of time. As another\nexample, CAR-T cell therapies for oncology have exhibited clinical toxicity due to lack of control post-infusion.\nThe efficacy of adoptive cell therapies in solid tumors is hampered by the poor persistence and dysfunction of these cell therapies in the\nimmunosuppressive TME. Inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, have been shown in preclinical studies to enhance CAR-mediated effector functions and\nstimulate the innate immune response to further support tumor killing. However, clinical trials involving systemic use of IL-12 have demonstrated severe\nunexpected toxicity, limiting its clinical application. Overexpressing IL-12 from adoptive T cell therapies using a poorly regulated promoter has also resulted\nin significant clinical toxicities. Beyond toxicity issues, persistent stimulation by inflammatory cytokines has been associated with cell exhaustion and may\nlimit anti-tumor activity. Thus, we believe a mechanism to dynamically regulate cytokine production by armored CAR-immune cells could enable enhanced\nanti-tumor activity without triggering unacceptable levels of toxicity in patients.\nOur Gene Circuit Solution: Regulator Dial\nOne example of our Regulator Dial gene circuit technology is a system designed to regulate gene expression through FDA-approved orally dosed\nnonstructural protein 3, or NS3, inhibitors. This type of Regulator Dial consists of a synthetic drug-regulated transcription factor and a synthetic promoter\nresponsive to this regulated transcription factor. In the absence of the drug, the transcription factor is inactive, and no therapeutic protein is produced from the\nengineered cells. In the presence of the drug, the small molecule triggers expression of the therapeutic protein in a\n11"

Immune-deficient NSG mice received NK cells engineered with our\nRegulator Dial gene circuit, followed by dosing of the small molecule that controls release of IL-12. We measured circulating levels of IL-12 and found a\ncorrelation between increasing levels in response to the small molecule which could be elicited with repeat dosing. This data demonstrates the potential that\ncrIL-12 expression from engineered NK cells can be regulated in a repeated ON/OFF/ON fashion through the GRZ small molecule.\n Smart Sensor\nA Smart Sensor is a gene circuit, or combination of gene circuits, designed to precisely detect cell type or disease environments, and thus distinguish\nbetween the “disease state” and “healthy state.” For example, Smart Sensors can be engineered to detect whether certain conditions, or disease biomarkers, are\npresent before responding with a specific therapeutic response. Conventional medicines are generally unable to dynamically change their behavior in response\nto cell or disease specific conditions.\nDiseases change over time and location in the body. Existing therapies are often unable to dynamically change their behavior in response to disease\nconditions or concentrate their activity only to specific places. Smart Sensors can be designed to sense diverse biomarkers that are specific to disease or cell\nstates, including cell-surface antigens, soluble disease markers, metabolites, transcription factors, microRNAs and others. For example, we have created\nartificial receptors that are displayed on the surface of engineered cells and activate gene expression within these cells when they encounter specific cytokines\nor small molecule chemicals. We have also designed gene regulatory elements such as promoters and RNA elements that respond to specific intracellular\nsignals, such as transcription factors and microRNAs.\nBackground: The Need for Novel Sensors in Smart Medicine\nCell and gene therapies have long held out the promise of curing a myriad of diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders. These therapies are\ngenerally comprised of three components: (i) the vector, which is used to deliver the transgene into cells; (ii) the promoter, which is a regulatory DNA\nsequence that drives expression of the transgene; and (iii) a transgene, which is the therapeutic payload.\nWhile early successes in the field have led to recently approved gene therapies, it remains challenging to precisely target gene expression only in diseased\ncells. This is a significant limitation because many genetic disorders require controlled or targeted activity in certain cell types in order to correct diseases\nwhile preventing undesirable side effects. Similarly, in cancer gene therapy, it is important to achieve selective killing in cancer cells while sparing healthy\ntissues. Engineering viral vectors that are biased toward specific cell types is limited by the availability of a unique feature on the outside of the target cell that\na viral vector can harness.\nAdditionally, many of the promoters used in current gene therapies are not disease, cell or tissue specific and thus lack the ability to dynamically regulate\ntherapeutic protein production in response to the disease state or location.\nOur Smart Sensors Solution: Cell Type or Cell State Specific Conditional Synthetic Promoters\nOur solution to address these limitations is to construct Smart Sensors that are selectively activated by cell type or cell state. For example, these Smart\nSensors are synthetic promoters that sense internal control mechanisms that cells already possess, such as transcription factors. Transcription factors modulate\nregulatory elements encoded in the DNA sequence of promoters to direct gene transcription to occur in a specific cell type, or even a specific cell state.\n12"

Furthermore, NK cells have been engineered with CARs to enhance their targeted killing activity. We leverage these features to create\nLogic Gated CAR-NKs, such as OR GATE CAR-NKs that enhance the killing of heterogeneous tumors and NOT GATE CAR-NKs that spare\nhealthy cells from undesired toxicity and thereby potentially improve on- target, on-tumor killing.\n•\nImmune Activation: NK cells have been shown to support robust activation of anti-tumor immune pathways through pro-inflammatory cytokine and\nchemokine secretion. We leverage this feature with our Multi-Arming gene circuits to further improve their ability to trigger endogenous,\ncomplementary anti-tumor activity by engaging the rest of the tumor immunity cycle.\n•\nValidated Clinical Activity and Tolerability: Approximately 70 global peripheral blood derived off-the-shelf, as in healthy donor-derived,\nunengineered CAR-NK cells have been shown in the clinical setting to have the potential to promote anti-tumor activity along with relatively low\nrisks of graft versus host disease, or GvHD, severe cytokine release syndrome, or CRS, and neurotoxicity.\n•\nOff-the-Shelf Manufacturing for Broad Patient Access: We have established proprietary protocols to derive NK cells from healthy donors,\nmanufacture them at scale with a projected low cost, and cryopreserve them with high retained viability post-thaw.

FLT3 is highly expressed on LSCs, while CD33 is highly\nexpressed on AML blasts. AML is a heterogeneous disease composed of both AML LSCs and blasts.

AML is a\ntype of acute leukemia characterized by an accumulation of malignant immature white blood cells. It is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults,\nconstituting 80% to 85% of cases, and is the second most common—as well as the deadliest—in children. Due to the absence of highly efficacious therapies,\nAML has poor prognosis with a low five-year survival rate at just 30.5%.\nPatients with CD33 and/or FLT3 expressing malignancies, which includes myeloid malignancies such as AML, have a grim prognosis and a high unmet\nneed. At diagnosis, the 5-year survival for patients with AML is 30.5% in the US (SEER 2022). As noted, AML is typically a disease of the elderly with a\nmedian age of diagnosis being approximately 65 years. The treatment at diagnosis for the majority of patients who cannot tolerate the toxicities of intensive\nchemotherapy, ie, older, unfit patients, includes either hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara C, also known as cytarabine), as\nmonotherapy or in combination with venetoclax, or best supportive care (NCCN AML 2022). In younger, fitter patients, the goal of treatment is to induce a\ncomplete remission (CR) with intensive chemotherapy and consolidate with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Treatment is combined with\nthe respective targeted agents in patients who have CD33‑positive disease or a FLT3‑mutated disease (Mylotarg USPI; Rydapt USPI; Xospata USPI). Other\ntherapies for AML include targeted\n16"

Despite these therapies\nbeing recently approved for patients with AML, the prognosis continues to be poor with the majority of patients refractory to or relapsing from front-line\ntherapy and a median overall survival (OS) of 5 months at relapse (Brandwein 2020).\nDevelopment of targeted AML treatments is difficult due to the fact that the disease is highly heterogeneous, with more than 200 types of chromosome\ntranslocations and mutations having been identified in AML patients. Therapies targeting a single Tumor-Associated Antigen are therefore often insufficient to\nkill all of the cancer cell subsets in AML, leading to eventual disease relapse. To drive patients into deeper remissions and prevent relapses, therapies designed\nto target multiple AML antigens are needed. Additionally, recent studies suggest relapse is associated with the less targeted AML subpopulation of LSCs.\nThus, the development of therapies targeting AML LSCs is sorely needed, but this has been challenging because LSC targets are often expressed on healthy\ncells, such as HSCs, leading to on-target, off-tumor treatment-induced toxicities.\nCAR Cell Therapy for AML\nThe therapeutic administration of CAR cell therapies has considerably advanced the treatment of certain cancers, such as B-cell malignancies. However,\nthe successes of CAR cell therapies have not yet translated to successful treatment of AML, in part due to the absence of AML-specific target antigens. Due to\ntheir nonrestrictive expression, most AML antigens are also expressed on healthy HSCs or myeloid cells. Thus, on-target, off-tumor killing effects of the\ntherapy may lead to the ablation of hematopoietic stem, progenitor or myeloid cells. This off-tumor killing of HSCs leads to serious clinical sequelae including\nsepsis and febrile neutropenia contributing to morbidity and mortality. Thus, the identification of antigens that enable more robust targeting of AML cells,\nincluding LSCs, along with new strategies to reduce off-target killing of HSCs, are critically needed to realize the promise of CAR cell therapies for AML\ntreatment. These described challenges also extend to other potential AML therapeutic modalities, such as antibodies and bispecific T cell engagers.\nSENTI-202 Approach to AML\nOur SENTI-202 off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells are engineered with gene circuits that are designed to enable identification of cancerous versus healthy cells\nusing NOT GATE + OR GATE logic decisions, and potentially improved persistence and more durable antitumor functions. SENTI-202 combines two\ndifferent Logic Gates, and crIL-15 expression, as follows:\n1.\nAn iCAR NOT GATE gene circuit to prevent CAR-mediated killing of cells expressing either FLT3 or CD33 and a Protective Antigen, EMCN. The\nEMCN iCAR is intended to suppress CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity against healthy HSCs, reducing the risk of potential life-threatening bone marrow\ntoxicity and potentially increasing the therapeutic window and on-target, on-tumor activity.\n2.\nAn aCAR OR GATE gene circuit to activate CAR-mediated killing of AML cells expressing either or both of the Tumor-Associated Antigens FLT3\nand CD33, thus increasing the targeting of both AML LSCs and blasts.\n3.\nA crIL-15 gene circuit to simultaneously stimulate surrounding immune cells and promote NK cell expansion, persistence and tumor killing.\nThe following figure illustrates the design of SENTI-202 Logic Gating gene circuits to kill AML LSCs and blasts, while sparing healthy HSCs via (FLT3\nOR CD33) NOT EMCN logic. Based on the medical community’s substantial clinical experience from autologous and allogeneic-bone marrow\ntransplantations.\nUsing our proprietary Tumor-Associated Antigen and Protective Antigen Paired Discovery Platform, we identified FLT3 and CD33 as desirable TAAs for\nan OR GATE gene circuit to have the potential for comprehensive CAR-mediated killing of AML, including AML LSCs and blasts.

This validates EMCN’s potential as a Protective Antigen to protect HSCs from\npotential on-target, off-tumor CAR-NK mediated toxicity. The rationale for utilizing EMCN as the Protective Antigen is further bolstered by a previous\nfinding in the literature that identified EMCN as a marker of the key cell type for repopulating the blood and immune systems.\nUpon selection of EMCN as our primary Protective Antigen target, we next incorporated binders for the FLT3 activating CAR (aCAR) and the EMCN\nProtective Antigen into our internal NOT GATE (iCAR) discovery and development platform in order to best identify the optimal iCAR architecture for the\nSENTI-202 program. Using different FLT3 NOT EMCN CAR-NK cells (primary NK cells engineered to co-express the same FLT3 aCAR with one of dozens\nof different proprietary EMCN iCARs), we performed an in vitro cytotoxicity protection assay screen using target cells that expressed only the FLT3 Tumor-\nAssociated Antigen and not the EMCN PA or target cells that expressed both the FLT3 Tumor-Associated Antigen and the EMCN PA. This latter target cell\npopulation should be protected from aCAR-mediated killing if the particular iCAR is functional. Using this approach, we identified multiple functional\nEMCN iCAR architectures that enabled robust target cell killing in the absence of the PA (model cancer cells) and provided significant antigen-dependent\ntarget cell protection in the presence of the EMCN PA (model healthy cells).\nAML cell line or healthy primary hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were co-cultured with either a CAR-NK cell that only expressed the activating CAR\n(i.e. CD33 and/or FLT3 CAR) or SENTI-202 (i.e., with the activating CAR and the EMCN-recognising inhibitory CAR).

Our proprietary crIL-15 gene circuit is designed to promote NK\ncell expansion, persistence, and tumor killing. We believe that the ability of crIL-15 to secrete active IL-15 into the TME in a calibrated fashion should also\nenable stimulation of endogenous immune cells within the tumor microenvironment in solid tumor settings.\nDevelopment Plan and Key Next Steps for SENTI-301A\nWe have demonstrated in preclinical studies the full gene circuit components of SENTI-301A In January 2023, we paused development of SENTI-301A\nfor financial, not scientific considerations, and we are planning to pursue potential partnering opportunities or future clinical development, especially in\nterritories within Asia where HCC is more prevalent than in the United States. Accordingly, we are actively pursuing strategic geographic partnerships for the\nclinical development of SENTI-301A.\nOur Gene Circuit Application Outside of Oncology\nIn addition to our off-the-shelf CAR-NK programs, we have discovery stage programs focused on gene therapies for tissue-directed targets and cell\ntherapies for regenerative medicines. In particular, we have entered into collaborations with Spark Therapeutics, Inc (subsidiary of Roche Holding AG) for the\ndesign of Smart Sensors for disease- and tissue-specific gene therapy, and with Bluerock Therapeutics LP (subsidiary of Bayer AG) for the use of Smart\nSensors and Regulator Dials for regenerative medicines. The following pipeline chart depicts our discovery stage programs under the two collaborations.\nPortfolio Expansion Opportunities\nOur Discovery Stage Programs\nWe believe our gene circuits can be readily adapted to new disease contexts to enable a variety of additional CAR-NK product candidates that address\nimportant cancers. For example, there are additional opportunities for the application of the NOT GATE gene circuit toward other solid and/or liquid tumor\nindications beyond SENTI-401. Toward that end, we have developed a Tumor-Associated Antigen and Protective Antigen Paired Discovery Platform to\nidentify future opportunities.\nOur platform has the potential to enable the development of multiple product candidates that harness the full breadth of our gene circuit platform beyond\nLogic Gating and Multi-Arming of off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells within oncology. Our additional discovery efforts are focused on a diverse set of cell and gene\ntherapy applications outside of oncology. In particular, we have entered into collaborations with Spark Therapeutics, Inc.

We have built a generalizable bioinformatics pipeline that uses RNA transcriptomics data to discover and prioritize\ntumor and healthy tissue Protective Antigens. We identify Tumor-Associated Antigens that are highly expressed in cancer cells with as little healthy tissue\nexpression as possible, for example Tumor-Associated Antigen A in the figure below. We then identify healthy tissue selective Protective Antigens, for\nexample Protective Antigen E in the figure below, that can protect those healthy tissues that express the Tumor-Associated Antigens, for example Tissues 2\nand 5 in the figure below. This process looks at differences in Protective Antigen gene expression in healthy versus tumor tissue. Leads are selected based on\nthe co-expression of Tumor-Associated Antigens and Protective Antigens in healthy tissues, the localization of the Protective Antigens to the cell surface,\nProtective Antigen topology (presence of extracellular domain) and Protective Antigen-specific antibody availability. Prioritized Tumor-Associated Antigen\nand Protective Antigen pairs are further validated in primary cancer and primary healthy tissue samples. We leveraged this platform to identify the Protective\nAntigen targets for the SENTI-202 and SENTI-401 programs, thus demonstrating our ability to target both liquid and solid tumors. This approach allows us to\npotentially expand our NOT GATE approach to additional cancer indications in which existing single-target approaches, such as monoclonal antibodies,\nantibody-drug conjugates and single-target CAR cells, are inadequate due to a lack of specificity for cancer cells.\nManufacturing\nManufacturing capabilities are central to our business strategy, because they can enable us to control the quality and supply of our off-the-shelf CAR-NK\ncell therapies for clinical studies and ultimately commercialization. A key advantage of off-the-shelf cell therapies, versus autologous products that use each\npatient’s own cells, is the ability to manufacture large batches of drug product from healthy donor cells that can be produced in advance of clinical use, and\nthen stored in frozen vials. Upon commercialization, we expect to be able to make our cell therapies, if approved, broadly accessible in an off-the-shelf\nmanner to cancer patients.\n29"

Purified NK cells are subsequently cryopreserved and\ncharacterized for consistent performance, including assays for cell phenotype, transduction efficiency, cell expansion capability and anti-tumor cytotoxicity.\nFor our initial SENTI-202, SENTI-401, and SENTI-301A product candidates, we plan to derive Starting Cells from leukapheresis products collected from\nqualified healthy donors. From each leukapheresis collection, we intend to isolate and cryopreserve hundreds of millions of Starting Cells to support multiple\nproduct production batches. We believe that peripheral blood derived leukapheresis products are an attractive starting material source due to (i) a mature and\nvalidated commercial supply chain, (ii) the large number of purified NK cells per collection and (iii) our ability to characterize the NK cells prior to initiation\nof manufacturing. An analysis of over a dozen recent isolations performed from different healthy donors demonstrated that our process achieved greater than\n95% NK cell purity, greater than 90% viability and up to 500 million NK cells per collection. We select for preferred donors with high expansion potential in\nour CAR-NK process, which allows us to generate ~70 trillion NK cells from a single donor collection, as shown in the figures below.\n30"

On a specific day post activation, the activated cells undergo our vector\ntransduction process to genetically incorporate our gene circuits.

In this location, we have approximately 10,000 square feet dedicated to manufacturing development labs. We have established research\nand development teams with extensive experience in cell and gene therapy manufacturing operations, including vector process development, cell process\ndevelopment, analytical development, quality control and quality assurance. In June 2021, we signed a lease agreement for a property in Alameda, California\nwith approximately 92,000 square feet for development as a state-of-the-art Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, facility to support clinical and\ncommercial-scale manufacturing of multiple off-the-shelf CAR-NK cell product candidates. This manufacturing facility is designed as a customized end-to-\nend manufacturing solution to give us the ability to isolate NK cells, engineer these cells with proprietary gene circuits, perform cell culture expansion in large\nbatches, and cryopreserve and store the final cGMP products. In January 2023, we initiated the technology transfer of SENTI-202 to our cGMP manufacturing\nfacility as part of our goal to provide clinical-scale manufacturing for off-the-shelf CAR-NK cell product candidates. We anticipate that this facility will be\nsuitable to support initial clinical trials for our lead product candidates.

The foregoing\nlicense is subject to (i) certain rights of the United States government, including an irrevocable, non-exclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the\ngovernment to practice all licensed patent rights throughout the world and (ii) the NCI’s reserved rights to grant a non-exclusive license to practice the\nlicensed patent rights for purposes of internal research (and not for purposes of commercial manufacture or distribution) at an academic or corporate facility.\nThe NCI GPC3 Agreement will expire, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, on the expiration of all licensed patent\nrights that claim the applicable licensed product in the applicable country. Licensed patent rights are currently expected to expire in 2033, absent any patent\nterm extension or adjustment. We may terminate the NCI GPC3 Agreement in its entirety or with respect to a country for any reason by providing 60 days’\nprior written notice to the NCI. The NCI may terminate the NCI GPC3 Agreement if (i) we breach any material obligations under the NCI GPC3 Agreement\nand fail to cure such breach within 90 days after receiving written notice thereof, or (ii) if the NCI reasonably determines that (a) we are not executing the\ncommercial development plan, including the milestones specified therein, (b) we have willfully made a false statement or omitted a material fact in our license\napplication or any report to the NCI, (c) we have committed a material breach of a covenant or agreement to the NCI, (d) we are not keeping the licensed\nproducts or licensed services reasonably available to the public after commercial use commences, (e) we cannot reasonably satisfy unmet health and safety\nneeds, (f) we cannot reasonably justify a failure to comply with the domestic production requirement or (g) we have been found by a court to have violated\nantitrust laws in connection with our performance under the NCI GPC3 Agreement, in each case of (a) through (f), where we fail to alleviate the NCI’s\nconcerns in 90 days. Additionally, the NCI reserves the right to terminate or modify the NCI GPC3 Agreement if the NCI determines that such action is\nnecessary to meet the requirements for public use specified by federal regulations issued after the date of the license and these requirements are not reasonably\nsatisfied by us.\nPotential Collaboration Related to Gene Circuits and GMP Manufacturing\nWe may seek to leverage our manufacturing capabilities and cGMP facility to enable us to expand the application of our gene circuit technology through a\npartnership in the biomanufacturing space. While we intend to use our proprietary gene circuit technology and manufacturing facility primarily for therapeutic\nproduct development and commercialization, our technology and facility can also be applied to noncompetitive biomanufacturing applications, which we\nbelieve is an approach well-suited for partnering. A potential biomanufacturing partnership could involve retaining operational control and manufacturing\nsupply of our therapeutic candidates, while our partner could control part of the facility for its own use. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able\nto enter into a biomanufacturing partnership on acceptable terms, or at all. We currently have no agreements or commitments for a manufacturing partnership,\nand we could determine to advance our manufacturing plans without a partner.\n38"

We are also aware of other companies that\nare focused on the application of engineered CAR-based immune cell therapies, including NK cells, to oncology, and such competitors include Allogene\nTherapeutics, Inc., Artiva Biotherapeutics, Inc., Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Century Therapeutics, Inc., Caribou Biosciences,\nInc., Catamaran Bio, Inc., Cytovia Therapeutics, Inc., Fate Therapeutics, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Lyell Immunopharma, Inc., Nkarta, Inc., Sana\nBiotechnology, Inc., Shoreline Biosciences, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company and Vor Biopharma Inc. Some of these companies may have substantially\ngreater financial and other resources than we have, such as larger research and development staff and well- established marketing and salesforces. Mergers and\nacquisitions in the biotechnology industry may result in even greater resource concentration among a smaller number of competitors. Smaller or early-stage\ncompanies may also prove to be significant competitors, either alone or through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nThese companies compete with us in recruiting scientific and managerial talent. Our success will partially depend on our ability to obtain, maintain,\nenforce and defend patents and other intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates. Our competitors may obtain FDA or other regulatory\napproval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market\nposition before we are able to enter the market. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize\nproducts that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may\ndevelop.\nIntellectual Property\nIntellectual property is the foundation of our company and not only defines who we are, but is the lens through which we implement our business strategy\nand research and development. Our overall strategy is to own and control all intellectual property related to our gene circuits. We protect our proprietary\ntechnology and intellectual property rights through a combination of wholly-owned patent rights, licensed patent rights in particular fields of use, trademark\nrights, trade secrets and know-how, contractual provisions and confidentiality procedures. Our general strategy includes protecting our proprietary technology\nand intellectual property rights domestically and in certain key foreign markets. We continually grow and supplement our intellectual property portfolio with\nnew filings and applications not only to strengthen the protection of proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, but also to protect and support the\ndevelopment and commercialization of current and future product candidates. In addition, we seek to protect our technological innovations and branding\nefforts by filing new patent and trademark applications at the appropriate time and in strategically relevant jurisdictions.\nOur patent portfolio relates to our ongoing research and development activities and includes a combination of patents and pending patent applications\nlicensed from third parties, pending patent applications jointly owned with third parties, and patent applications solely owned by us. The patents and pending\npatent applications in our portfolio can be categorized as relating to our gene circuit platform technologies, including Logic Gating gene circuits, Multi-\nArming gene circuits, Regulator Dial gene circuits and Smart Sensor gene circuits; our product candidates, including SENTI-202, SENTI-301A and SENTI-\n401, as well as other possible pipeline product candidates; and alternative technologies, and our patents and patent application include claims directed to\ncompositions, methods (including preparation, use, or treatment), processes, dosing and formulations. As of February 19, 2023, our in-licensed and owned\npatent portfolio consists of over 11 issued patents and 148 pending patent applications, of which we own or co-own 3 patents and 120 pending patent\napplications, and have licensed 8 patents and 28 pending patent applications.\nThe term of a patent in our patent portfolio varies depending upon a number of factors such as the date of filing of the patent application, the date of\npatent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States\nare effective for 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date of the patent application to which the patent claims priority.

In addition, in certain instances, the patent term of a\nU.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for extension to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of clinical trials\nand the FDA regulatory review period, such extension is referred to as patent term extension (PTE). The restoration period cannot be longer than five years,\nand the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. Similar provisions are available in Europe and\ncertain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. However there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities,\nincluding the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such\nextensions. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from\nthe earliest non-provisional filing date of the patent application to which the patent claims priority. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a\nproduct-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of\nregulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.\nWe also utilize trademark rights to protect our brand and have filed trademark applications for the marks “SENTI,” “SENTI BIOSCIENCES,” “SENTI\nBIO,” and Senti’s “S” logo in the United States and in certain marks in foreign countries. As of February 19, 2023, we own two United States trademark\nregistrations, five pending and/or allowed United States trademark applications, five foreign trademark registrations, and one pending foreign trademark\napplication. We have also registered multiple internet domain names to further supplement the protection of our brand.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries,\nextensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling,\npackaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, sampling post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting\nof biologics such as those we are developing. Any product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in\nthe United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in those foreign countries. Generally, our activities in\nother countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important\ndifferences.\nU.S. Biologics Regulation\nIn the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and\nother federal, state, local and foreign statutes and their implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent\ncompliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The\nprocess required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n•\ncompletion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements, or\nGLP;\n•\nsubmission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;\n•\napproval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;\n•\nperformance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice,\nor GCP, regulations and any additional requirements for the\n40"

Preclinical tests, also referred to as\nnonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and\nactivity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.\nPrior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for\nauthorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational\nplan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND also includes results of animal\nand in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing\nand controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before\nhuman clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period,\nraises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA\nmust resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA\nauthorization to begin a clinical trial. We anticipate filing an IND for Senti-202 in the second half of 2023.\nIn addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving\nrecombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are subject to oversight of institutional biosafety committees, or IBCs, as set forth in the National Institutes of\nHealth, or NIH, Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision\nof human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing\nrecombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health\nor the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the\nresearch in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research,\nmany companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.\nClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance\nwith GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials\nare conducted under protocols\n41"

A\nseparate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent\nprotocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical\ntrial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. An IRB is charged with protecting\nthe welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are\nreasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her\nlegal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time\non various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated\nobjectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety\nmonitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from\nthe study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of\nefficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.\nFor purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:\n•\nPhase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies\nare designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects\nassociated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening\ndiseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human\ntesting is often conducted in patients.\n•\nPhase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary\nefficacy, optimal dosages, dose tolerance and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical\ntrials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.\n•\nPhase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant\nevidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are\nintended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two\nadequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.\nIn some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information\nabout the product in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. Completion of these so-called Phase 4 studies may also be\nmade a condition to approval of the BLA.\nConcurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics\nof the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The\nmanufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for\ntesting the safety, purity and potency of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be\nconducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\n42"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nBLA Submission and Review by the FDA\nAssuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development,\nnonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The\nBLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings,\ntogether with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from\ncompany-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including\nstudies initiated by independent investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the\nsafety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial\napplication user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.\nWithin 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA\naccepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request\nadditional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review\nbefore the FDA accepts it for filing.\nOnce a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application\nqualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be\nextended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe,\npure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety,\npurity and potency. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. An advisory committee is a\npanel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the\napplication should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such\nrecommendations carefully when making decisions.\nBefore approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an\napplication unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of\nthe product within required specifications. For a product candidate that is also a human cellular or tissue product, the FDA also will not approve the\napplication if the manufacturer is not in compliance with cGTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls\nused for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for\nimplantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based\nproducts are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require\ntissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally,\nbefore approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application,\nmanufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing\nor information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy\nthe regulatory criteria for approval.\nAfter the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be\nproduced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product\nwith specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not\nbe approved in its present form. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines\nthat the data supporting the application are inadequate\n43"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nto support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed\nlabeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for\nadditional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional\ntesting or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor must\nresubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the\nFDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.\nIf regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for\nwhich such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the\nbenefits of the product outweigh its risks, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. A REMS is a safety strategy implemented to manage a known or\npotential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could\ninclude medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other\nrisk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls\nand specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or\nif problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess\nand monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-\nmarketing studies.\nExpedited Development and Review Programs\nThe FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, new biological products are\neligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet\nmedical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being\nstudied. The sponsor of a new biologic may request that the FDA designate the biologic as a fast track product at any time during the clinical development of\nthe product. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product\ndevelopment and, once a BLA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling\nreview, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a\nschedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the\nsponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.\nA product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to\nexpedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the\nproduct candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on\none or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the\nfast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to\nexpedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.\nAny marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or\nbreakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and\naccelerated approval. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory\nalternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will\nattempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the\nreview. For\n44"

Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of\n2022, or FDORA, the FDA may require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of\napproval for a product granted accelerated approval. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a\nbiologic or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies\nfail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise\ninformed by FDA, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be\nsubmitted to FDA for review during the pre-approval period.\nIn 2017, the FDA established a new regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation, which is intended to facilitate an efficient\ndevelopment program for, and expedite review of, any biologic that meets the following criteria: (i) the biologic qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a\ncell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited\nexceptions; (ii) the biologic is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (iii) preliminary clinical\nevidence indicates that the biologic has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. RMAT designation provides all the\nbenefits of breakthrough therapy designation, including more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and\neligibility for rolling review and priority review. Product candidates granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a\nsurrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of clinical\ntrial sites, including through expansion of trials to additional sites. RMAT-designated products that receive accelerated approval may, as appropriate, fulfill\ntheir post-approval requirements through submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence (such as\nelectronic health records); through the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or via post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy\nprior to approval of such therapy.\nFast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and RMAT designation, do not change the standards for\napproval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later\ndecide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nOrphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or\ncondition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the\nUnited States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be\nrecovered from sales in the United States for that biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan\ndrug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does\nnot convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.\n45"

In addition, if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular drug\nor biologic for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve\nany other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a\nshowing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown\nthat it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was\ndesignated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug\nor biologic for a different disease or condition. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has\nexclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also\ncould block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our\nproduct candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.\nA designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received\norphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for\ndesignation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with\norphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the\nrare disease or condition.\nPost-Approval Requirements\nBiologics are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping,\nreporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most\nchanges to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are\ncontinuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of\napproved biological products, and those supplying products, ingredients, and components of them, are required to register their establishments with the FDA\nand certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements\nand other laws, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Manufacturers and other parties\ninvolved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA\nof counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly,\nmanufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Changes to the\nmanufacturing process or facility are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being\nimplemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any\nthird-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production\nand quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.\nThe FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product\nreaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with\nmanufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information;\nimposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS\nprogram. Other potential consequences include, among other things:\n•\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n46"

Discovery of\npreviously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse\npublicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or\ncriminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including\nthe addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.\nThe FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and\nefficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively\nenforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against\ncompanies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory\nagencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or\ncurtailed. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential\ncivil and criminal penalties. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or\nuntitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts,\nmandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Physicians\nmay prescribe, in their independent professional and medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and\nthat differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label\nuses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The\nFDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.\nBiosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity\nThe Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which\ncreated an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product.\nThe FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.\nBiosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of\nsafety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is\nbiosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in\nany given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the\n47"

However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures\nof biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated\napproval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.\nUnder the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product\nwas first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which\nthe reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference\nproduct if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled\nclinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as\ninterchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by\npharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.\nA biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing\nexclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based\non the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. The BPCIA is complex and continues\nto be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period.\nOther aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the\nultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.\nCoverage and Reimbursement\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for\nthese products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations.\nEven if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a\nsufficient return on our investment. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations,\ndecide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels.\nThere is also significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products and coverage may be more limited\nthan the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In the United States, the principal decisions\nabout reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department\nof Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors\ntend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:\n•\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n•\nsafe, effective and medically necessary;\n•\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n•\ncost-effective; and\n•\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nNet prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future\nrelaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Increasingly, third-\nparty payors are\n48"

We\ncannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of\nreimbursement. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average\nsales price, or ASP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for\ndrugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs.\nWe expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward\npressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us\nfrom being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-\napproval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will\nbe enacted, or whether existing regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals or\nclearances of our product candidates, if any, may be.\nIn addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing\ndrug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal\nproducts for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain\nreimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular\nproduct candidate to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of\ndirect or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has\nprice controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product\ncandidates. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be\nsignificantly lower.\nHealthcare Reform\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and\nprivate insurers, and significantly impacted the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Among the provisions of the ACA, of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical\nand biotechnology industry are the following:\n•\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average\nmanufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and a cap on the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average\nManufacturer Price;\n•\nextension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; and\n•\na Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of\napplicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered\nunder Medicare Part D.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted.\n•\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent legislation, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress that include\naggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which remain in effect through 2031. Due to the Statutory Pay-As-\nYou-Go Act of 2010,\n49"

The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to\nseveral providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\n•\nOn April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group\nmarketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.\n•\nOn May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access\ncertain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under\ncertain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA\nexpanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result\nof the Right to Try Act.\n•\nOn May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning\nJanuary 1, 2020.\nAdditionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there\nhas been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S.\nCongressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing,\nreduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. The Inflation Reduction\nAct of 2022, or IRA, includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket spending\ncap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries from $7,050 to $2,000 starting in 2025, thereby effectively eliminating the coverage gap; impose new manufacturer\nfinancial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D; allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost\ndrugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition; require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than\ninflation; and delay until January 1, 2032 the implementation of the HHS rebate rule that would have limited the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can\ncharge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease\ndesignation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple\napproved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet\nknown.\nIn addition, President Biden has issued multiple executive orders that have sought to reduce prescription drug costs. In addition, in February 2023, HHS\nissued a proposal in response to an October 2022 executive order from President Biden that includes a proposed prescription drug pricing model that will test\nwhether targeted Medicare payment adjustments will sufficiently incentivize manufacturers to complete confirmatory trials for drugs approved through FDA’s\naccelerated approval pathway. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become\neffective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they\nwill continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.\nThere has also been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For\nexample, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring\nmore transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program\nreimbursement methodologies for drug products.\nAt the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and\nbiological product pricing, including price or patient\n50"

In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are\nincreasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other\nhealth care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing, which could\nnegatively affect our business, financial conditions, results of operation and prospects.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and\nstate governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our current or future product candidates or\nadditional pricing pressures.\nAny denial in coverage or reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar denial or reduction in\npayments from private payors, which may prevent us from being able to generate sufficient revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. It is\nnot clear how other future potential changes to the ACA will change the reimbursement model and market outlook for our current and future product\ncandidates.\nOther U.S. Healthcare Laws\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors, among others, will play a primary role in the prescription and recommendation of any product\ncandidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with third-party payors, providers and customers, among others, may expose us to\nbroadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations in the future that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and\nrelationships through which we market, sell and distribute our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.

A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific\nintent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to\nthree times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs;\n•\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and\ncivil monetary penalties laws, that impose penalties against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal\ngovernment, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to\nthe federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a referral made in violation\nof the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; Manufacturers can be held liable\nunder the federal False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission\nof false or fraudulent claims.

HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to\nmake civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for\ndamages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil\nactions.

In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be\nsubmitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is\napproved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed.\nThe requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all\ncases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in\nthe Declaration of Helsinki.\nTo obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing\nauthorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of,\namong other things, country-specific document requirements. The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the\nEuropean Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years\nof market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a\ngeneric application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data\nmay be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be\nconsidered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving\norphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication\nmay be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No\nextension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.\nThe criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of\nRegulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening\nor chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is\nmade, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment;\nand (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such\na method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal\nproducts are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of\nmarket exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing\nauthorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if\nthe designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the\nduration of, the regulatory review and approval process.\nThe 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for\norphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization\nmay be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:\n•\nThe second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;\n•\nThe applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or\n•\nThe applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.\nFor other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of\nclinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from\n53"

Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before you decide to invest in common stock, you should consider carefully the risks\ndescribed below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes\nappearing in this Annual Report. We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this Annual Report. Factors that\ncould cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Annual Report are any of the risks described in this Item 1A below. Any of these factors\ncould result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or\nthat we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of\noperations and financial condition would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could\ndecline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe risk factors set forth below represent a summary of some of the principal risk factors which potential investors in our securities should be aware of.\nAlthough each of these risks is important, this list is not and is not intended to be a substitute for investors reviewing all of the information in this Annual\nReport, including all risk factors which follow this summary.\n•\nWe are a preclinical stage biotechnology company with a history of losses.

If our remediation of the material weakness is not effective, or\nif we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we\nmay not be able to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a\nresult, the value of our common stock.\n•\nMembers of our management team have limited experience in managing the day-to-day operations of a public company and, as a result, we may\nincur additional expenses associated with the management of our company.\n•\nOur history of recurring losses and anticipated expenditures raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern requires that we obtain sufficient funding to finance our operations.\n•\nWe may not achieve the intended objectives of our strategic prioritization plan announced in January 2023.\n55"

We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future\nand may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are a preclinical stage biotechnology company with a history of losses. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to\nresearch and development, preclinical studies, building our management team and building our intellectual property portfolio, and we have incurred\nsignificant operating losses. Our net losses were $58.2 million and $55.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $173.3 million. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with\nour research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. To date, we have not generated any revenue\nfrom product sales, and we have not sought or obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate. Furthermore, we do not expect to generate any revenue\nfrom product sales for the foreseeable future, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the cost of\nresearch and development, preclinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing and the regulatory approval process for our current and potential future product\ncandidates.\nWe expect our net losses to increase substantially as we:\n•\ncontinue to advance our gene circuit platform technologies;\n•\ncontinue preclinical development of our current and future product candidates and initiate additional preclinical studies;\n•\ncommence clinical trials of our current and future product candidates;\n•\nestablish our manufacturing capability, including developing our contract development and manufacturing organization relationships and\nbuilding our internal manufacturing facilities;\n•\nacquire and license technologies aligned with our gene circuit platform technologies;\n•\nseek regulatory approval of our current and future product candidates;\n•\nexpand our operational, financial, and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to support our preclinical and\nclinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts;\n•\ncontinue to develop, maintain, expand, and defend our intellectual property portfolio; and\n•\nincur additional legal, accounting, or other expenses in operating our business, including the additional costs associated with operating as\npublic company.\nHowever, the amount of our future losses is uncertain.

If we are unable to raise capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be forced to\nrestructure our business or delay, reduce, or terminate our research and product development programs, future commercialization efforts or other\noperations.\nWe will need substantial additional funds to advance development of product candidates and our gene circuit platform, and we cannot guarantee that we\nwill have sufficient funds available in the future to develop and commercialize our current or potential future product candidates and technologies.\nThe development of biotechnology product candidates is capital-intensive. If any of our current or potential future product candidates enter and advance\nthrough preclinical studies and clinical trials, we will need substantial additional funds to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and\nsales capabilities. We have used substantial funds to develop our gene circuit platform, SENTI-202, SENTI-301A, SENTI-401 and other potential product\ncandidates, and we will require significant funds to continue to develop our platform and conduct further research and development, including preclinical\nstudies and clinical trials. In addition, we expect to incur significant additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $98.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our future capital requirements and the period for\nwhich our existing resources will support our operations may vary significantly from what we expect.

Any additional capital raising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our\nability to develop and commercialize our current and future product candidates, if approved.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms acceptable to us, if\nat all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed, and we may need\nto significantly modify our operational plans, or else we may not be able to continue as a going concern beyond twelve months from the issuance date of this\nForm 10-K.

In the future, we may have to delay, reduce the\nscope of or suspend one or more of our preclinical studies, clinical trials, research and development programs or commercialization efforts. Further, if we are\nunable to continue as a going concern, we might have to liquidate our assets, and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be\nsignificantly lower than the values reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the\ndevelopment and commercialization of our current and potential future product candidates and the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third\nparties to participate in their development and commercialization, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating\nexpenditures associated with our current and anticipated preclinical studies and clinical trials, including related manufacturing costs.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to\nrelinquish valuable rights to our current and potential future product candidates, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that\nmay not be favorable to us. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity or convertible debt offerings, the ownership interest of our\nexisting stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders’\nrights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as\nincurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Moreover, the issuance of additional securities by us, whether equity or debt, or\nthe market perception that such issuances are likely to occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to realize revenue from product sales or royalties from licensed products for the foreseeable future, if at all, and unless and until our\ncurrent and potential future product candidates are clinically tested, approved for commercialization and successfully marketed.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.

The material weakness related to a lack of sufficient and adequate resources in the finance and accounting function that\nresulted in a lack of formalized risk assessment process, lack of segregation of duties, and ineffective process level control activities over the management\nreview of journal entries, account reconciliations and non-routine transactions.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility\nthat a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe implemented a risk assessment process and measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the control\ndeficiencies that led to the material weakness, including hiring additional accounting personnel. However, the process of designing and implementing effective\ninternal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to\nexpend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. Moreover, the\nrules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant\ndocumentation, testing, and remediation. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our financial reporting, we will need to commit significant resources,\nimplement and strengthen existing disclosure processes controls, reporting systems, and procedures, train personnel and provide additional management\noversight, all of which may divert attention away from other matters that are important to our business.\nWe cannot be certain that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control\ndeficiencies that led to our material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material\nweaknesses. In addition, an independent registered public accounting firm has not yet performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting,\nthough such an evaluation will be required when we lose our status as an “emerging growth company” and become an “accelerated filer” or a “large\naccelerated filer.” When an evaluation by an independent registered public accounting firm is performed, such firm may issue a report that is qualified if it is\nnot satisfied with our controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated, or reviewed.\nOur testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial\nreporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. A material weakness in internal controls could result in our failure to detect a material misstatement of\nour annual or quarterly consolidated financial statements or disclosures. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal\ncontrols over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting,\ninvestors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the shares of our\ncommon stock.\nWe cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. If\nwe are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or identify any\nadditional material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be negatively impacted, we may be unable to maintain compliance\nwith securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose\nconfidence in our financial reporting and our stock price may decline as a result. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely\nmanner or with adequate compliance, our independent registered public accounting firm when required may issue an adverse opinion due to ineffective\ninternal controls over financial reporting, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. As a result, there\ncould be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we may\nbe required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel. Any such action could negatively affect our results\nof operations and cash flows.\n60"

As a result, we may need to\nobtain outside assistance from legal, accounting, investor relations, or other professionals that could be more costly than planned. We also plan to hire\nadditional personnel to comply with additional SEC reporting requirements. These compliance costs will make some activities significantly more time-\nconsuming and costly. If we lack cash resources to cover these costs in the future, our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of\nsecurities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our potential results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards (“ NOLs”) and credits to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nOur NOLs could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities because of their limited duration or because of restrictions under\nU.S. tax law. NOLs generated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 are permitted to be carried forward for 20 taxable years under applicable U.S.\nfederal income tax law. Under current U.S. federal income tax law, NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 may not be carried back.\nMoreover, NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such NOLs\ngenerally will be limited in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 to 80% of current year taxable income. As of December 31, 2022, we had NOLs\nfor U.S. federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $100.7 million and $55.0 million, respectively,, a portion of which expire beginning in 2036 if\nnot utilized. NOLs for U.S. federal tax reporting purposes of approximately $97.2 million have an indefinite life.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change”\n(defined under Section 382 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in a corporation’s equity\nownership by certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable\nincome. We have not determined whether our NOLs are limited under Section 382 of the Code. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and\nmay experience ownership changes in the future, including as a result of the Merger or subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which are outside\nour control). Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that\ndue to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to\nreduce future income tax liabilities, including for state tax purposes. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected\non our balance sheets, even if we attain profitability, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us and could adversely affect our\noperating results and financial condition.\nChanges in tax law may adversely affect us or our investors.\nThe U.S. rules dealing with federal, state, and local taxation are constantly under review by those involved in the legislative process, as well as by the\nU.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. For\nexample, under Section 174 of the Code, in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, expenses that are incurred for research and development in the\nU.S. will be capitalized and amortized, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow. In recent years, many such changes have been made and change\nare likely to continue to occur in the future. Future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial conditions, or\nresults of operations. The existence, timing, and content of new tax laws are unpredictable, and could cause an increase in our or our shareholders’ tax liability\nor require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law. We urge investors to consult\nwith their legal and tax advisers regarding the implications of potential changes in tax laws on an investment in our common stock.\nIt is not possible to predict the number of shares of our common stock, if any, that we may sell to Chardan Capital Markets LLC, or Chardan, under\nour common stock Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement,\n61"

If we\ncannot sell securities under the Purchase Agreement, we may be required to utilize more costly and time-consuming means of accessing the capital markets,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cash position.\nBecause the purchase price per share of common stock to be paid by Chardan for the common stock that we may elect to sell to Chardan under the\nPurchase Agreement will fluctuate based on the market prices of our common stock at the time we elect to sell shares to Chardan pursuant to the Purchase\nAgreement it is not possible for us to predict, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and prior to any such sales, the number of shares of common\nstock that we will sell to Chardan under the Purchase Agreement, the purchase price per share that Chardan will pay for shares of common stock purchased\nfrom us under the Purchase Agreement, or the aggregate gross proceeds that we will receive from those purchases by Chardan under the Purchase Agreement.\nThe actual number of shares of our common stock issuable will vary depending on the then current market price of shares of our common stock sold to\nChardan and the number of shares of common stock we ultimately elect to sell to Chardan under the Purchase Agreement. If it becomes necessary for us to\nissue and sell to Chardan under the Purchase Agreement more than the 8,727,049 shares of common stock we registered pursuant to the Purchase Agreement,\nin order to receive aggregate gross proceeds equal to $50.0 million under the Purchase Agreement, we will have to file with the SEC one or more additional\nregistration statements to register under the Securities Act the resale by Chardan of any such additional shares of common stock we wish to sell from time to\ntime under the Purchase Agreement, which the SEC must declare effective, in each case before we may elect to sell any additional shares of our common\nstock under the Purchase Agreement. Under applicable Nasdaq rules, in no event may we issue to Chardan more than 19.99% of the total number of shares of\ncommon stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement, unless we obtain prior stockholder approval or if such\napproval is not required in accordance with the applicable Nasdaq rules. In addition, Chardan is not obligated to buy any common stock under the Purchase\nAgreement if such shares, when aggregated with all other shares of our common stock then beneficially owned by Chardan and its affiliates (as calculated\npursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-3 promulgated thereunder), would result in Chardan beneficially owning common stock in excess\nof 4.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Our inability to access a portion or the full amount available under the Purchase Agreement, in the\nabsence of any other financing sources, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operation.\nInvestors who buy common stock from Chardan at different times will likely pay different prices.\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the timing, price and number of shares sold to Chardan will vary depending on when we choose to sell shares, if any,\nto Chardan.

As a result, investors who purchase shares\nfrom Chardan at different times will likely pay different prices for those shares, and so may experience different levels of dilution and in some cases\nsubstantial dilution and different outcomes in their investment results. Investors may experience a decline in the value of the shares they purchase from\nChardan as a result of future sales made by us to Chardan at prices lower than the prices such investors paid for their shares from Chardan.\nThe sale or issuance of shares of our common stock to Chardan will result in additional outstanding shares and the resale of shares of our common\nstock by Chardan that it acquires pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of shares of our\ncommon stock to decrease.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, we have issued 400,000 shares of common stock to Chardan under the Purchase Agreement, including 100,000 shares\nissued to Chardan as consideration for its execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement. The shares of common stock issuable under the Purchase\nAgreement may be sold by us to Chardan at our sole discretion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions in the Purchase Agreement, from time to time,\nuntil the earliest to occur of (i) October 1, 2025, (ii) the date on which Chardan has purchased the Total Commitment pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, (iii)\nthe date on which our common stock fails to be listed or quoted on Nasdaq or any successor market, and (iv) the date on which, pursuant to or within the\nmeaning of any bankruptcy law, we commence a voluntary case or any person or entity commences a proceeding against us, a custodian is appointed for us or\nfor all or substantially all of our property, or we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors. The purchase price for shares of our common stock\nthat we may sell to Chardan under the Purchase Agreement will fluctuate based on the trading price of shares of our common stock. Depending on market\nliquidity at the time, sales of shares of our common stock may cause the trading price of shares of our common stock to decrease. We generally have the right\nto control the timing and amount of any future sales of shares of our common stock to Chardan. Additional sales of shares of our common stock, if any, to\nChardan will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide to sell to Chardan all or some of the\nadditional shares of our common stock that may be available for us to sell pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. If and when we do sell shares of our common\nstock to Chardan, after Chardan has acquired shares of our common stock, Chardan may resell all, some or none of such shares of common stock at any time\nor from time to time in its discretion. Therefore, sales to Chardan by us could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of shares of our\ncommon stock. In addition, if we sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Chardan under the Purchase Agreement, or if investors expect\nthat we will do so, the actual sales of shares of our common stock or the mere existence of our arrangement with Chardan may make it more difficult for us to\nsell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect such sales.\nWe may use our cash resources, including proceeds from sales of our common stock made pursuant to the Purchase Agreement in ways with which\nyou may not agree or in ways which may not yield a significant return.\nWe have broad discretion over the use of capital we have raised, including proceeds from sales of our common stock made pursuant to the Purchase\nAgreement, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of any decision to invest in our common stock, to assess whether the proceeds are being used\nappropriately. Accordingly, you will have to rely on the judgment of our management with respect to the use of these funds, with only limited information\nregarding management’s specific intentions. We may spend all or a portion of the net proceeds of our prior financing activities, including sales of our common\nstock under the Purchase Agreement, in ways that are not what our stockholders may desire or that may not yield favorable results. Because of the number and\nvariability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. The failure by\nus to apply these funds effectively could harm our business, and the net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not increase our operating results\nor enhance the value of our common stock.\nAdverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults, or non-performance by\nfinancial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely\n63"

For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon\nValley Bank (“SVB”) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (“FDIC”) as receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership. Although a\nstatement by the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC indicated that all depositors of SVB would have access to all of their money\nafter only one business day of closure, including funds held in uninsured deposit accounts, borrowers under credit agreements, letters of credit and certain\nother financial instruments with SVB, Signature Bank or any other financial institution that is placed into receivership by the FDIC may be unable to access\nundrawn amounts thereunder. We have two letters of credit held with SVB in an aggregate amount of $3.3 million related to our facility lease. Due to the\nreceivership of SVB, we may be unable to access such funds. In addition, if any of our suppliers or other parties with whom we conduct business are unable to\naccess funds pursuant to such instruments or lending arrangements with such a financial institution, such parties’ ability to pay their obligations to us or to\nenter into new commercial arrangements requiring additional payments to us could be adversely affected. In this regard, counterparties to SVB credit\nagreements and arrangements, and third parties such as beneficiaries of letters of credit (among others), may experience direct impacts from the closure of\nSVB and uncertainty remains over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry. Similar impacts have occurred in the past, such as during the\n2008-2010 financial crisis.\nInflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously issued government securities with interest rates below\ncurrent market interest rates. Although the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board have announced a program to provide up to $25\nbillion of loans to financial institutions secured by certain of such government securities held by financial institutions to mitigate the risk of potential losses on\nthe sale of such instruments, widespread demands for customer withdrawals or other liquidity needs of financial institutions for immediately liquidity may\nexceed the capacity of such program. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board will provide\naccess to uninsured funds in the future in the event of the closure of other banks or financial institutions, or that they would do so in a timely fashion.\nAlthough we assess our banking relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in\namounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect the\nCompany, the financial institutions with which we have or may enter into credit agreements or arrangements directly, or the financial services industry or\neconomy in general. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various\ntypes of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns\nor negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions with which we\nhave or may enter into financial or business relationships, but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry\ngenerally.\nThe results of events or concerns that involve one or more of these factors could include a variety of material and adverse impacts on our current and\nprojected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. These could include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n•\nDelayed access to deposits or other financial assets or the uninsured loss of deposits or other financial assets;\n•\nDelayed or lost access to other working capital sources and/or delays, inability or reductions in our ability to enter into new credit facilities\nor access other working capital resources;\n64"

One or all of our current product candidates\nmay fail in clinical development or suffer delays that materially and adversely affect their commercial viability.\nWe have no products on the market or that have gained regulatory approval or that have entered clinical trials. None of our product candidates has ever\nbeen tested in humans. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends on obtaining regulatory approvals for and successfully commercializing product\ncandidates, either alone or with collaborators.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our product candidates, we or a collaborator must conduct extensive preclinical\nstudies, followed by clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency, or efficacy of our product candidates in humans. There is no guarantee that\nthe FDA will permit us to conduct clinical trials. Further, we cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of our preclinical studies and cannot\npredict if the FDA or other regulatory authorities will accept our proposed clinical programs, our clinical protocols or if the outcome of our preclinical studies\nwill ultimately support the further development of our preclinical programs or testing in humans. As a result, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit\nIND or similar applications for our proposed clinical programs on the timelines we expect, if at all, and we cannot be sure that submission of INDs or similar\napplications will result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities allowing clinical trials for any of our product candidates to begin.\nOur current product candidates are in preclinical development and we are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of product candidates\nbased on novel approaches, targets and mechanisms of action. Although we anticipate initiating clinical trials for our lead product candidates, there is no\nguarantee that we will be able to proceed with clinical development of any of these product candidates or that any product candidate will demonstrate a\nclinical benefit once we advance these candidates to testing in patients. Accordingly, you should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties,\ndelays and difficulties frequently encountered by preclinical stage biotechnology companies such as ours.\nWe may not be able to access the financial resources to continue development of, or to enter into any collaborations for, any of our current or potential\nfuture product candidates. This may be exacerbated if we experience any issues that delay or prevent regulatory approval of, or our ability to commercialize, a\nproduct candidate, such as:\n•\nnegative or inconclusive results from our preclinical studies or clinical trials or the clinical trials of others for product candidates similar t\nours, leading to a decision or requirement to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or abandon any or all of our programs\n65"

As an example, while the Tumor-Associated Antigen (“TAA”) CD33 has been clinically validated as a target for an approved\nantibody-drug conjugate therapy, it has not been clinically validated as a target for CAR-NK or CAR-T therapies, and may not prove to be a clinically\nsufficient target for the CAR-NK therapies we are developing. As a result of these uncertainties related to our gene circuit platform technologies and our\nproduct candidates, we may never succeed in developing a marketable product based on our current product candidates. If any of our current or potential\nfuture product candidates prove to be ineffective, unsafe or commercially unviable, our entire pipeline could have little, if any, value, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur gene circuit platform technologies are based on novel technologies that are unproven and may not result in approvable or marketable products,\nwhich exposes us to unforeseen risks and makes it difficult for us to predict the time and cost of product development and potential for regulatory\napproval.\nWe are seeking to identify and develop a broad pipeline of product candidates using our gene circuit platform technologies. The scientific research that\nforms the basis of our efforts to develop product candidates with our platforms is still ongoing. We are not aware of any FDA approved therapeutics utilizing\nsimilar technologies as ours. Further, the scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing therapeutic treatments based on our platform technologies\nis preliminary. As a result, we are exposed to a number of unforeseen risks and it is difficult to predict the types of challenges and risks that we may encounter\nduring development of our product candidates. For example, we have not tested any of our current product candidates in humans, and our current data is\nlimited to animal models and preclinical cell lines, the results of which may not translate into humans. Further, relevant animal models and assays may not\naccurately predict the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans, and we may encounter significant challenges creating appropriate models and\nassays for demonstrating the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. In addition, our gene circuit technologies have potential safety risks.\nGiven the novelty of our technologies, we intend to work closely with the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities to evaluate our proposed\napproaches to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates; however, due to a lack of comparable experiences, the regulatory pathway with the FDA\nand comparable regulatory authorities may be more complex and time-consuming relative to other more well-known therapeutics. Even if we obtain human\ndata to support our product candidates, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies may lack experience in evaluating the safety and efficacy of our\nproduct candidates developed using our platforms, which could result in a longer than expected regulatory review process, increase our expected development\ncosts, and delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates. The validation process takes time and resources, may require independent third-party\nanalyses, and may not be accepted or approved by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We cannot be certain that our approach will lead to\nthe development of approvable or marketable products, alone or in combination with other therapies.\nThe occurrence of serious complications or side effects in connection with the use of our product candidates, either in clinical trials or post-approval,\ncould lead to discontinuation of our clinical development programs, refusal of regulatory authorities to approve our product candidates, or, post-approval,\nrevocation of marketing authorizations or refusal to approve applications for new indications, which could severely harm our business, prospects,\noperating results, and financial condition.\nUndesirable side effects caused by any of our current or potential future product candidates could cause regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt\nclinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. While we\nhave not yet initiated clinical trials for SENTI-202, SENTI-404, or any other product candidate, it is likely that there will be side effects associated with their\nuse. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of these side effects. For example, if the NOT GATE gene\ncircuit, as described below, engineered into one of our product candidates, such as SENTI-202, does not provide a clinically sufficient level of inhibition, it\nmay kill healthy cells that it has been designed to preserve or may cause systemic immune cytotoxicity. It is possible that safety events or concerns such as\nthese or others could negatively affect the development of our product candidates, including adversely impacting patient enrollment among the patient\npopulations that we intend to treat.

Such side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to\ncomplete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. To date, we have not observed any such effects in our preclinical studies, but there can be no\nguarantee that our current or future product candidates will not cause such effects in clinical trials. Any of these occurrences may materially and adversely\nimpact our business and financial condition and impair our ability to generate revenues.\nFurther, clinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. With a limited number of patients and limited duration of\nexposure, rare and severe side effects of a product candidate may only be uncovered when a significantly large number of patients are exposed to the product\ncandidate or when patients are exposed for a longer period of time.\nIn the event that any of our current or potential future product candidates receives regulatory approval and we or others identify undesirable side effects\ncaused by one of these products, any of the following events could occur, which could result in the loss of significant revenue to us and materially and\nadversely impact our results of operations and business:\n• regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or seize the product;\n• we may be required to recall the product or change the way the product is administered to patients;\n• additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product or any\ncomponent thereof;\n• we may be subject to fines, injunctions, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n• regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a “black box” warning or a contraindication;\n• we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n• we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n• the product may become less competitive; and\n• our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could\nsignificantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use and expand our gene circuit platform to expand our pipeline of product candidates.\nA key element of our strategy is to use and advance our gene circuit platform to design, test and build our portfolio of product candidates focused on\nallogeneic gene circuit-equipped CAR-NK cell therapies for the treatment of cancer. Although our research and development efforts to date have resulted in\nour discovery and preclinical development of SENTI-202, SENTI-401 and other potential product candidates, none of these product candidates has advanced\nto clinical development. We cannot assure you that any of our existing product candidates will advance to clinical trials or, if they do, that such trials will\ndemonstrate these product candidates to be safe or effective therapeutics, and we may not be able to successfully develop any product candidates. Even if we\nare successful in expanding our pipeline of product candidates, any additional product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development\nor generate acceptable clinical data, including as a result of being shown to have unacceptable effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are\nunlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities or achieve market acceptance.

If we fail to identify additional potential product candidates, our\nbusiness could be materially harmed.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our efforts will focus on the planned clinical trials and potential approval of the current and potential future product\ncandidates we are evaluating, a key element of our strategy is to discover, develop, manufacture and globally commercialize additional targeted therapies\nbeyond our current product candidates to treat various conditions and in a variety of therapeutic areas. Even if we identify investigational therapies that\ninitially show promise, we may fail to successfully develop and commercialize such products for many reasons, including the following:\n•\nthe research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential investigational therapies;\n•\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our investigational therapies obsolete;\n•\ninvestigational therapies we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties’ patents or other exclusive rights;\n•\nan investigational therapy may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely t\nbe effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n•\nit may take greater human and financial resources than we will possess to identify additional therapeutic opportunities for our product\ncandidates or to develop suitable potential product candidates through internal research programs, thereby limiting our ability to develop,\ndiversify and expand our product portfolio;\n•\nan investigational therapy may not be capable of being produced in clinical or commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n•\nan approved product may not be accepted as safe and effective by trial participants, the medical community or third-party payors.\nIdentifying new investigational therapies requires substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any investigational therapies are\nultimately identified. Because we have limited financial and human resources, we may initially focus on research programs and product candidates for a\nlimited set of indications. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to\nhave greater commercial potential or a greater likelihood of success. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial\nproducts or profitable market opportunities. For example, if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product\ncandidate or technology, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate or technology through collaborations, licensing or other royalty\narrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product\ncandidate or technology.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that we will ever be able to identify additional therapeutic opportunities for our product candidates or to develop\nsuitable potential product candidates through internal research programs, which could materially adversely affect our future growth and prospects.

While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored\nby institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject\nto the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.\nInterim, topline and preliminary data that we announce or publish from time to time for any clinical trials that we initiate may change as more patient\ndata become available or as additional analyses are conducted, and as the data are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in\nmaterial changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose interim, preliminary or topline data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which is based on a\npreliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review\nof the data related to the particular trial. We also make assumptions, estimates, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not\nhave received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the interim, preliminary or topline results that we report may differ\nfrom future results of the same trials, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully\nevaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary\ndata we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. From time to time, we may also\ndisclose interim, preliminary or topline data from our clinical studies. Interim, topline or preliminary data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject\nto the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse\ndifferences between preliminary, topline or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may\ninterpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the\nparticular product candidate or product and the value of our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a\nparticular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or\notherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with\nrespect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular product, product candidate or our business. If the topline data that\nwe report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and\ncommercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\n71"

The actual timing of these events can vary dramatically due to a number of factors such as delays or failures in our or any future collaborators’\nproduct candidate discovery and development programs, the amount of time, effort and resources committed by us and any future collaborators, and the\nnumerous uncertainties inherent in the development of therapies. As a result, there can be no assurance that our or any future collaborators’ programs will\nadvance or be completed in the time frames we or they announce or expect. If we or any collaborators fail to achieve one or more of these milestones or other\nkey events as planned, our business could be materially adversely affected, and the price of our common stock could decline.\nClinical trials are expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement.\nHuman clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. Because\nour current and potential future product candidates are based on new technologies and discovery approaches, we expect that they will require extensive\nresearch and development and have substantial manufacturing and processing costs. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us to\nperform additional testing before commencing clinical trials and be hesitant to allow us to enroll patients impacted with our targeted disease indications in our\nfuture clinical trials. If we are unable to enroll patients impacted by our targeted disease indications in our future clinical trials, we would be delayed in\nobtaining potential proof-of-concept data in humans, which could extend our development timelines. In addition, costs to treat patients and to treat potential\nside effects that may result from our product candidates may be significant. Accordingly, our clinical trial costs are likely to be high and could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely\naffected.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue any clinical trials for our current or potential future product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a\nsufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. We cannot predict how difficult it will\nbe to enroll patients for trials in the indications we are studying. We may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of\nreasons. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including:\n•\nthe severity of the disease under investigation;\n•\nthe patient eligibility criteria defined in the clinical trial protocol;\n•\nthe size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial’s primary endpoints;\n•\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n•\nwillingness of physicians to refer their patients to our clinical trials;\n•\nour ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n72"

Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect\nto conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are\navailable for our clinical trials at such clinical trial sites. Additionally, because some of our clinical trials will be in patients with advanced disease who may\nexperience disease progression or adverse events independent from our product candidates, such patients may be unevaluable for purposes of the trial and, as a\nresult, we may require additional enrollment.

These changes may require us to renegotiate terms with CROs or resubmit clinical trial protocols\nto IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. Our clinical trials may be suspended or terminated\nat any time by us, the FDA, other regulatory authorities, the IRB overseeing the clinical trial at issue, any of our clinical trial sites with respect to that site, or\nus.\nAny failure or significant delay in commencing or completing clinical trials for our product candidates, any failure to obtain positive results from clinical\ntrials, any safety concerns related to our product candidates, or any requirement to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates\nbeyond those that we currently contemplate would adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval and our commercial prospects and ability to\ngenerate product revenue will be diminished.\nIf we decide to seek orphan drug designation for one or more of our product candidates, we may be unsuccessful or may be unable to maintain the\nbenefits associated with orphan drug designation for our current or future product candidates that we may develop.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product candidate as an orphan drug if it is a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare\ndisease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or where there is no\nreasonable expectation that the cost of developing the product will be recovered from sales in the United States. We may seek orphan drug designation for\ncertain indications for our product candidates in the future. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug\nnor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. Orphan drug designation can entitle a party to financial incentives such as\nopportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers.\nIn addition, if a product candidate with an orphan drug designation receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such\ndesignation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same\ndrug for the same indication for seven years. The FDA may reduce the seven-year exclusivity if the same drug from a competitor demonstrates clinical\nsuperiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability\nof sufficient quantities of the orphan product to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Even if one of our\nproduct candidates receives orphan exclusivity, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same\nindication or disease.\nIn addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated\nindication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure\nsufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a\nproduct, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for\nthe same condition, and while we may seek orphan drug designation for our product candidates, we may never receive such designations. In addition, the FDA\nmay reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act and its regulations and policies. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and\npolicies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug\nregulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to conduct, or contract with others to conduct, animal testing in the future, which could harm our research and development\nactivities.\nCertain laws and regulations relating to drug development require us to test our product candidates on animals before initiating clinical trials involving\nhumans. Animal testing activities have been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. Animal rights groups and other organizations and individuals\nhave attempted to stop animal testing activities by pressing for legislation and regulation in these areas and by disrupting these activities through\n75"

To the extent the activities of these groups are successful, our research and development activities may be interrupted or delayed.\nRisks Related to Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies, and plan to rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials, and those third parties may not\nperform satisfactorily.\nWe expect to rely on third-party clinical investigators, CROs, clinical data management organizations and consultants to design, conduct, supervise and\nmonitor certain preclinical studies and any clinical trials. Because we intend to rely on these third parties and will not have the ability to conduct certain\npreclinical studies or clinical trials independently, we will have less control over the timing, quality and other aspects of such preclinical studies and clinical\ntrials than we would have had we conducted them on our own. These investigators, CROs and consultants will not be our employees and we will have limited\ncontrol over the amount of time and resources that they dedicate to our programs. Some of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any\ntime. We also expect to have to negotiate budgets and contracts with CROs, clinical trial sites and contract manufacturing organizations and we may not be\nable to do so on favorable terms, which may result in delays to our development timelines and increased costs. If we need to enter into alternative\narrangements with, or replace or add any third parties, it would involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus, or involve a\ntransition period, and may delay our drug development activities, as well as materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines.\nThese third parties may have contractual relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, which may draw time and resources from\nour programs. The third parties with which we may contract might not be diligent, careful or timely in conducting our preclinical studies or clinical trials,\nresulting in the preclinical studies or clinical trials being delayed or unsuccessful.\nDespite our reliance on third parties, we will ultimately be responsible for ensuring that each of our studies and trials is conducted in accordance with\napplicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards, including good laboratory practice, or GLP, good clinical practice, or GCP,\ncGMP, and cGTP. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general\ninvestigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require us to comply with GCP standards, regulations for\nconducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are reliable and accurate and that the rights, integrity\nand confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors,\nprincipal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs, clinical sites and investigators fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical\ndata generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or other regulatory authorities may require\nus to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. There can be no assurance that upon inspection by a given regulatory\nauthority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials substantially comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must\nbe conducted with product candidates produced under cGMP regulations and will require a large number of test patients. Our failure or any failure by these\nthird parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients, may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the\nregulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates FDA regulatory requirements as well as federal or\nstate healthcare laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nIf third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory\nrequirements or our stated protocols, or if these third parties need to be replaced, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing\napprovals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.

Conversely,\nany failure to enter any collaboration or other strategic transaction that would be beneficial to us could delay the development and potential commercialization\nof our product candidates and technologies and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of any product candidate or technology that reaches market.\nIn addition, to the extent that any future collaborators terminate a collaboration agreement, we may be forced to independently develop our current and\nfuture product candidates and technologies, including funding preclinical studies or clinical trials, assuming marketing and distribution costs and maintaining,\nenforcing and defending intellectual property rights, or, in certain instances, abandon product candidates and technologies altogether, any of which could result\nin a change to our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing\nThe manufacturing of our product candidates is complex. We may encounter difficulties in production. If we encounter any such difficulties, our\nability to supply our product candidates for clinical trials or, if approved, for commercial sale, could be delayed or halted entirely.\nThe manufacture of biopharmaceutical products is complex and requires significant expertise, including the development of advanced manufacturing\ntechniques and process controls. The process of manufacturing our product candidates is also extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination,\nequipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment, operator error, contamination and inconsistency in yields, variability in product\ncharacteristics and difficulties in scaling the production process. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced\nproduction yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or the\nmanufacturing facilities in which they are made, the facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the\ncontamination. As a result of the complexities, the cost to manufacture biologics in general, and our cell-based product candidates in particular, is generally\nhigher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds, and the manufacturing process is less reliable and is more difficult to reproduce.\nAny adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our product candidates, if any are approved, may result in shipment delays, inventory\nshortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our products. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and\nincur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing\nalternatives. Furthermore, it is too early to estimate our cost of goods sold. The actual cost to manufacture our product candidates could be greater than we\nexpect because we are early in our development efforts.\nConstruction of our planned in-house manufacturing may be delayed or, even if completed, supply of our product candidates for preclinical and\nclinical development may become limited or interrupted or may not be of satisfactory quantity or quality, and we will experience delays if we are unable to\noperate our own manufacturing facility and are required to relay on third-party back-up manufacturers.\nA key to our strategy is operating our own manufacturing facility. We initiated construction in June 2021 of a dedicated in-house facility to support\nclinical and commercial-scale production of allogeneic NK cell product candidates in accordance with cGMP and cGTP requirements. We anticipate that this\nfacility will become operational in time to support initial clinical trials for our lead product candidates.

As such, we cannot assure that our preclinical or\nfuture clinical development product supplies and commercial supplies will not be limited or interrupted. In particular, any change in our plans to construct and\noperate our own facility, including any decision to rely on third-party back-up manufacturers, could require significant effort and expertise because there may\nbe a limited number, if any, of qualified third-party replacements. We do not currently have arrangements in place for a redundant or second-source supply in\nthe event our planned facility does not become operational. Any delays in manufacturing our product candidates could impede, delay, limit or prevent our drug\ndevelopment efforts, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, we may pursue a biomanufacturing\npartnership in which we grant a third party certain rights to use our manufacturing facility for the manufacture of third parties’ products or product candidates,\nwhich could divert our manufacturing capacity and management resources from the manufacture of our product candidates.\nWe do not currently produce our product candidates in quantities sufficient for preclinical and clinical development, and we do not currently have\narrangements with any third parties to produce them for us. We cannot be sure that the manufacturing processes employed by us or the technologies that we\nincorporate for manufacturing will result in viable or scalable yields of our product candidates that will be safe, effective, and meet market demand.\nThe manufacturing process for a product candidate is subject to FDA and other regulatory authority review. We and any third-party manufacturers we\nmay contract with must meet applicable manufacturing requirements and undergo rigorous facility and process validation tests required by regulatory\nauthorities in order to comply with regulatory standards, such as cGMP and cGTP. In the event that we or any third-party manufacturer fails to comply with\nsuch requirements or to perform obligations in relation to quality, timing or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials becomes limited or\ninterrupted for other reasons, we may be forced to or enter into an agreement with another third party, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, or\nat all. In some cases, the technical skills or technology required to manufacture our current and future product candidates may be difficult or impossible to\ntransfer to a third party and a feasible alternative may not exist. If we are required to change manufacturing facilities or manufacturers for any reason, we will\nbe required to verify that the new facilities and procedures comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. We will also need\nto verify, such as through a manufacturing comparability study, that any new manufacturing process will produce our product candidate according to the\nspecifications previously submitted to the FDA or another regulatory authority. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturing could\nnegatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget. In addition, changes in manufacturers often involve changes in\nmanufacturing procedures and processes, which could require that we conduct bridging studies between our prior clinical supply used in our clinical trials and\nthat of any new manufacturer. We may be unsuccessful in demonstrating the comparability of clinical supplies which could require the conduct of additional\nclinical trials.\nIf we receive regulatory approval for any product candidate and we are unable to for any reason to produce sufficient quantities of the product in our own\nfacility, and we are unable to obtain or maintain third-party manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to commercialize the\nproduct candidate successfully. Our or a third party’s failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements and comply with cGMP and cGTP could adversely\naffect our business in a number of ways, including:\n•\nan inability to initiate or continue clinical trials of product candidates under development;\n•\ndelay in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for product candidates;\n•\nloss of the cooperation of potential future collaborators;\n•\nsubjecting third-party manufacturing facilities or our potential future manufacturing facilities to additional inspections by regulatory\nauthorities;\n•\nrequirements to cease distribution or to recall batches of product candidates; and\n80"

We have never operated a cGMP facility before.\nIn order to conduct clinical trials for our current and potential future product candidates or to commercialize any approved product candidates, we will\nneed to manufacture large quantities of these product candidates. We expect to use our in-house manufacturing facility to produce required quantities of our\nproduct candidates. We, or any manufacturing partners, may be unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any current or potential future\nproduct candidate in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition, quality issues may arise during scale-up activities and may result in lower yields\nthan initially expected. While we believe our planned cGMP facility will be sufficiently scalable to produce commercial quantities, any significant revisions to\nthe manufacturing process may create delays, which could negatively impact our overall development timelines. In addition, we have never operated a cGMP\nfacility before. We may encounter difficulties in operating the facility or meeting the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that we have not\nanticipated. If we cannot successfully scale the manufacture of any current or potential future product candidate in sufficient quality and quantity, the\ndevelopment, testing, clinical trials and commercialization of that product candidate may be delayed or infeasible and regulatory approval or commercial\nlaunch of any potential resulting product may be delayed or not obtained, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe are exposed to a number of risks related to our supply chain for the materials required to manufacture our product candidates.\nManufacturing our product candidates is highly complex and requires sourcing specialty materials. Many of the risks associated with the complexity of\nmanufacturing our final products are applicable to the manufacture and supply of the raw materials. In particular, these starting materials are subject to\ninconsistency in yields, variability in characteristics, contamination, difficulties in scaling the production process and defects. Similar minor deviations in the\nmanufacturing process for these starting materials could result in supply disruption and reduced production yields for our final product. In addition, we rely on\nthird parties for the supply of these materials exposing us to similar risks of reliance on third parties as described above with respect to the manufacturing and\nsupply of our drug products.\nOur manufacturing processes requires many reagents, some of which are drug substance intermediates used in our manufacturing processes to bring about\nchemical or biological reactions, and other specialty materials and equipment, some of which are manufactured or supplied by small companies with limited\nresources and experience to support commercial production. We currently depend on a limited number of vendors for certain materials and equipment used in\nthe manufacture of our product candidates. Some of these suppliers may not have the capacity to support commercial products manufactured under cGMP by\nbiopharmaceutical firms or may otherwise be ill-equipped to support our needs. Reagents and other key materials from these suppliers may have inconsistent\nattributes and introduce variability into our manufactured product candidates, which may contribute to variable patient outcomes and possible adverse events.\nWe also do not have supply contracts with many of these suppliers and may not be able to obtain supply contracts with them on acceptable terms or at all.\nAccordingly, we may experience delays in receiving key materials and equipment to support clinical or commercial manufacturing.\nFor some of these reagents, equipment, and materials, we rely and may in the future rely on sole source vendors or a limited number of vendors. An\ninability to continue to source product from any of these suppliers, which could be due to regulatory actions or requirements affecting the supplier, adverse\nfinancial or other strategic developments experienced by a supplier, labor disputes or shortages, unexpected demands, or quality issues, could adversely affect\nour ability to satisfy demand for our product candidates, which could adversely and materially affect our product sales and operating results or our ability to\nconduct clinical trials, either of which could significantly harm our business.

These problems may include\nworkforce reductions, employee absenteeism and attrition, and supply chain failures or delays relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other events\naffecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities.\nAs we continue to develop and scale our manufacturing process, we expect that we will need to obtain rights to and supplies of certain materials and\nequipment to be used as part of that process. We may not be able to obtain rights to such materials on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and if we are\nunable to alter our process in a commercially viable manner to avoid the use of such materials or find a suitable substitute, it would have a material adverse\neffect on our business. Even if we are able to alter our process so as to use other materials or equipment, such a change may lead to a delay in our clinical\ndevelopment and/or commercialization plans. If such a change occurs for a product candidate that is already in clinical testing, the change may require us to\nperform both comparability studies and to collect additional data from patients prior to undertaking more advanced clinical trials.\nChanges in methods of product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in the need to perform new clinical trials, which would require\nadditional costs and cause delay.\nAs product candidates are developed through preclinical to late-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various\naspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize yield and\nmanufacturing batch size, minimize costs and achieve consistent quality and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended\nobjectives. Any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of ongoing, planned or future clinical trials\nconducted with the altered materials. This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or\nmore clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate\nrevenue.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nIf the market opportunities for our current and potential future product candidates, including SENTI 202 and SENTI-401, are smaller than we\nbelieve they are, our future product revenues may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.\nOur understanding of the number of people who suffer from diseases that our current product candidates may be able to treat are based on estimates.\nThese estimates may prove to be incorrect, and new studies may reduce the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients in the\nUnited States or elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our current or potential future product\ncandidates or patients may become increasingly difficult to identify and access, all of which would adversely affect our business prospects and financial\ncondition. In particular, the treatable population for our candidates may further be reduced if our estimates of addressable populations are erroneous or sub-\npopulations of patients do not derive benefit from our product candidates.\nFurther, there are several factors that could contribute to making the actual number of patients who receive our current or potential future product\ncandidates less than the potentially addressable market. These include the lack of widespread availability of, and limited reimbursement for, new therapies in\nmany underdeveloped markets.\nWe face competition from companies that have developed or may develop product candidates for the treatment of the diseases that we may target,\nincluding companies developing novel therapies and platform technologies. If these companies develop platform technologies or product candidates more\nrapidly than we do, or\n82"

We compete with a variety of large pharmaceutical companies,\nmultinational biopharmaceutical companies, other biopharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, as well as technology and/or\ntherapeutics being developed at universities and other research institutions. Our competitors are often larger and better funded than we are. Our competitors\nhave developed, are developing or will develop product candidates and processes competitive with ours. Competitive therapeutic treatments include those that\nhave already been approved and accepted by the medical community and any new treatments that are currently in development or that enter the market. We\nbelieve that a significant number of product candidates are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for the\ntreatment of conditions for which we may try to develop product candidates. There is intense and rapidly evolving competition in the biotechnology and\nbiopharmaceutical fields. We believe that while our gene circuit platform, its associated intellectual property portfolio, the characteristics of our current and\npotential future product candidates and our scientific and technical know-how together give us a competitive advantage in this space, competition from many\nsources remains.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and supply resources or experience than we do. If\nwe successfully obtain approval for any product candidate, we will face competition based on many different factors, including the safety and effectiveness of\nour product candidates, the ease with which our product candidates can be administered, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these product\ncandidates, the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, price, reimbursement coverage and patent position. Competing\nproducts and product candidates could present superior treatment alternatives, including by being more effective, safer, less expensive or marketed and sold\nmore effectively than any products we may develop. Competitive products and product candidates may make any product we develop obsolete or\nnoncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing such product. Such competitors could also recruit our employees, which\ncould negatively impact our level of expertise and our ability to execute our business plan.\nAny inability to attract and retain qualified key management, technical personnel and employees would impair our ability to implement our business\nplan.\nOur success largely depends on the continued service of key executive management, advisors and other specialized personnel, including Timothy Lu, our\nChief Executive Officer, Philip Lee, our Chief Technology Officer, Kanya Rajangam, our Chief Medical and Development Officer, and Deborah Knobelman,\nour Chief Financial Officer. Our senior management may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain “key person” insurance for any\nof our employees. The loss of one or more members of our executive team, management team or other key employees or advisors could delay our research\nand development programs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific and clinical personnel and, if we progress the development of any of our product candidates,\ncommercialization, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, will be critical to our success. The loss of the services of members of our senior\nmanagement or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our\nability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing members of our senior management and key employees may be difficult and\nmay take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to\nsuccessfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize our product candidates. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract,\nretain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level and senior managers, as well as junior, mid-level and senior scientific and medical personnel. Competition\nto hire from this limited candidate pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the\ncompetition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific\nand clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to\nassist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy.

As our current and potential future product candidates enter and advance through preclinical\nstudies and any clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities or contract with other organizations to\nprovide these capabilities for us.\nTo manage our anticipated future growth, we will continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational, and financial systems, expand our\nfacilities, and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the complexity in managing a company\nwith such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. In\naddition, we have limited experience in managing the manufacturing processes necessary for making cell and gene therapies. The expansion of our operations\nmay lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution\nof our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nIn addition, future growth imposes significant added responsibilities on members of management, including: identifying, recruiting, integrating,\nmaintaining, and motivating additional employees; managing our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical and FDA review process for\nour product candidates, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and improving our operational, financial and\nmanagement controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nWe may also experience difficulties in the discovery and development of potential future product candidates using our gene circuit platform if we are\nunable to meet demand as we grow our operations. In the future, we also expect to have to manage additional relationships with collaborators, suppliers and\nother organizations. Our ability to manage our operations and future growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management\ncontrols, reporting systems and procedures and secure adequate facilities for our operational needs. We may not be able to implement improvements to our\nmanagement information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls.\nOur strategic re-prioritization plan announced in January, 2023 may not result in the full anticipated benefits or may limit or disrupt our operations.\nIn January 2023, we announced a pipeline re-prioritization plan to streamline our internal research and development efforts, and focus our internal\nresources on SENTI-202 and SENTI-401, and, with potential partners, to develop gene circuits for other programs. We may not realize the potential benefits,\nsavings, cash runway extensions or improvements in our cost structure from our re-prioritization efforts due to unexpected difficulties, delays, or costs. In\nparticular, we may not be able to enter into partnerships for SENTI-301A or other programs that we do not intend to develop internally on acceptable terms or\nwithin the timeframes that we expect, and we may be forced to dedicate additional time and resources to the maintenance of these programs or to our efforts to\nsecure partnerships. If we are unable to realize anticipated cost savings from the reorganization, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely\naffected. Furthermore, implementing changes to our corporate strategy may be disruptive to our operations. For example, we may engage in workforce\nreductions that could yield unexpected consequences, such as turnover beyond planned reductions or increased difficulty in our day-to-day operations. Any\nworkforce reductions could harm our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel who are critical to our business. Any failure to attract or retain qualified\npersonnel could prevent us from successfully executing key technical and scientific initiatives.\nIf any of our product candidates is approved for marketing and commercialization in the future and we are unable to develop sales, marketing and\ndistribution capabilities on our own or enter into agreements with third\n84"

We maintain quantities of various flammable\nand toxic chemicals in our facilities that are required for our research, development and manufacturing activities. We are subject to federal, state and local\nlaws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We believe our procedures for storing,\nhandling and disposing of these materials in our facilities comply with the relevant guidelines of the state of California and the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply\nwith the standards mandated by applicable regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident\noccurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety\nlaws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of animals and biohazardous\nmaterials. Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting\nfrom the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Although we have some environmental liability\ninsurance covering certain of our facilities, we may not maintain adequate insurance for all environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted\nagainst us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our\noperations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or\nregulations.\nOur business, operations and clinical development plans and timelines could be adversely affected by global economic and political developments,\nincluding high inflation and capital market disruption, the war in Ukraine, economic sanctions and economic slowdowns or recessions, the COVID-19\npandemic, or the manufacturing, clinical trial and other business activities performed by us or by third parties with whom we may conduct business,\nincluding our anticipated contract manufacturers, CROs, shippers and others.\nAny global financial crisis or slowdown could cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Similarly, any global health epidemic,\nsuch as the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause disruptions in our operations and in the operations of third-party manufacturers, CROs, and other third-parties\non whom we rely. More recently, the global economy has been impacted by increasing interest rates and high inflation, as well as by the war in Ukraine and\nthe possibility of a wider European or global conflict. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including a\nreduced ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. Additionally, a weak or declining economy or international trade disputes\ncould strain our suppliers, some of whom are located outside the United States, potentially resulting in supply disruption. Also, the global COVID-19\npandemic and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact on businesses and commerce worldwide. In connection with\nCOVID-19, we implemented work-from-home policies for most employees. The effects of government orders and our work-from-home policies may\nnegatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length\nand severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course.\nIf our relationships with our suppliers or other vendors are terminated or scaled back as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics, we\nmay not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative suppliers or vendors or do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner.

However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and to the extent the\nCOVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects, it may also have the effect of\nheightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nMarket volatility and economic downturns may harm our business and results of operations and negatively affect our stock price.\nOur overall performance depends, in part, on worldwide economic conditions. In recent months, we have observed increased economic uncertainty in the\nUnited States and abroad. Impacts of such economic weakness include:\n•\ndeclining overall demand for goods and services, leading to reduced profitability;\n•\nreduced credit availability;\n•\nhigher borrowing costs;\n•\nreduced liquidity;\n•\nvolatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets; and\n•\nbankruptcies.\nThese developments could lead to supply chain disruption, inflation, higher interest rates, and uncertainty about business continuity, which may adversely\naffect our business and our results of operations and negatively affect our stock price.\nRecent volatility in capital markets and lower market prices for our securities may affect our ability to access new capital through sales of shares of\nour common stock or issuance of indebtedness, which may harm our\n89"

Our future capital requirements may be significantly different\nfrom our current estimates and will depend on many factors, including the need to:\n•\nfinance unanticipated working capital requirements;\n•\ndevelop or enhance our technological infrastructure and our existing solutions;\n•\npursue acquisitions or other strategic relationships; and\n•\nrespond to competitive pressures.\nAccordingly, we may need to pursue equity or debt financings to meet our capital needs. With uncertainty in the capital markets and other factors, such\nfinancing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities,\nour existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to\nthose of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-\nraising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business\nopportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, we could face significant\nlimitations on our ability to invest in our operations and otherwise suffer harm to our business.\nRising inflation rates could negatively impact our revenues and profitability if increases in the prices of our products or a decrease in consumer\nspending results in lower sales. In addition, if our costs increase and we are not able to pass along these price increases to our customers, our net income\nwould be adversely affected, and the adverse impact may be material.\nInflation rates, particularly in the United States, have increased recently to levels not seen in years. Increased inflation may result in decreased demand for\nour products and services, increased operating costs (including our labor costs), reduced liquidity, and limitations on our ability to access credit or otherwise\nraise debt and equity capital. In addition, the United States Federal Reserve has raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about\ninflation. Increases in interest rates, especially if coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further\nincreasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our technology and current or future product candidates, or if our\nintellectual property rights are inadequate, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours, and we\nmay not be able to compete effectively in our market or successfully commercialize any product candidates we may develop.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection for our owned and in-licensed intellectual property rights and proprietary\ntechnology. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements, including in-licenses of intellectual\nproperty rights and biologic materials of others, to protect our current or future platform technologies, product candidates, methods used to manufacture our\ncurrent or future product candidates and methods for treating patients using our current or future product candidates.\nWe own or in-license patents and patent applications relating to our platform technologies and product candidates. There is no guarantee that any patents\ncovering our platform technologies or product candidates will issue from the patent applications we own, in-license or may file in the future, or, if they do, that\nthe issued claims\n90"

Further, there cannot be any\nassurance that such patents issued will not be infringed, designed around, invalidated by third parties or effectively prevent others from commercializing\ncompetitive technologies, products or product candidates.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive, complex and time-consuming. Patent license negotiations also can be complex and protracted, with uncertain\nresults. We may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce or license all necessary or desirable patents and patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a\ntimely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent\nprotection. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents, and, even if they do issue as patents, such patents may not\ncover our current or future technologies or product candidates in the United States or in other countries or provide sufficient protection from competitors. In\naddition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance.\nWe do not have exclusive control over the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications under certain of our in-license agreements, and we may\nnot have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the rights to patents, that we out-license to third\nparties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. Even if\nour owned or in-licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent\ncompetitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by\ndeveloping similar or alternative product candidates in a non-infringing manner.\nFurther, although we make reasonable efforts to ensure patentability of our inventions, we cannot guarantee that all of the potentially relevant prior art\nrelating to our owned or in-licensed patents and patent applications has been found. For example, publications of discoveries in scientific literature often lag\nbehind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, and in\nsome cases not at all. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that\ncould cover our platform technologies, our product candidates, or the use of our technologies. We thus cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors\nwere the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In addition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, might require that the\nterm of a patent issuing from a pending patent application be disclaimed and limited to the term of another patent that is commonly owned or names a\ncommon inventor. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our owned or in-licensed patent applications has been found. For this\nreason, and because there is no guarantee that any prior art search is absolutely correct and comprehensive, we may be unaware of prior art that could be used\nto invalidate an issued patent or to prevent our owned or in-licensed patent applications from issuing as patents. Invalidation of any of our patent rights,\nincluding in-licensed patent rights, could materially harm our business.\nMoreover, the patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain because they may involve complex legal and factual\nconsiderations that have, in recent years, been the subject of legal development and change. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation, both inside and\noutside of the United States, is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other jurisdictions may diminish\nour ability to protect our platform technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop\nthird parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property will\ndepend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our platform technology, product candidates, inventions and improvements.\nWe cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent\napplications we may file or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us or our licensors in the future will be\ncommercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Additionally, third parties, including our former\nemployees and collaborators, may challenge the ownership or inventorship of our patent rights to claim that they are entitled to ownership and inventorship\ninterest, and we may not be successful in defending against such claims. However, we are not currently facing any such challenges. Moreover, issued patents\ndo not guarantee the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products.

The standards applied by the USPTO and\nforeign patent offices in granting patents are not always certain and moreover, are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no\nuniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in patents. Our pending and future patent applications may not\nresult in patents being issued in the United States or in other jurisdictions which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from\ncommercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other\ncountries may diminish the value of our owned or in-licensed patent applications or narrow the scope of any patent protection we may obtain from our owned\nor in-licensed patent applications. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nFurther, patents and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and\nuncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and any\nfuture product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit\nour ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidate\nand any future product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive\nadvantages against competitors or other parties with similar technology. Additionally, our competitors may initiate legal proceedings, such as declaratory\njudgment actions in federal court or reexaminations or an inter partes review at the USPTO in an attempt to invalidate or narrow the scope of our patents.\nHowever, we are not currently facing any such proceedings. Furthermore, our competitors or other parties may independently develop similar technologies\nthat are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates\nand any future product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it\nis possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product candidate may expire or remain in force\nfor only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.\nEven if patents do successfully issue from our owned or in-licensed patent application, and even if such patents cover our current or any future\ntechnologies or product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed,\ninvalidated, or held unenforceable. Any successful challenge to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of rights\nnecessary for the successful commercialization of any current or future technologies or product candidates that we may develop. Likewise, if patent\napplications we own or have in-licensed with respect to our development programs and current or future technologies or product candidates fail to issue, if\ntheir breadth or strength is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity, other companies could be dissuaded from collaborating with us to\ndevelop current or future technologies or product candidates. Lack of valid and enforceable patent protection could threaten our ability to commercialize\ncurrent or future products and could prevent us from maintaining exclusivity with respect to the invention or feature claimed in the patent applications. Any\nfailure to obtain or any loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business and ability to achieve profitability. We may be unable to\nprevent competitors from entering the market with a product that is similar or identical to any of our current or potential future product candidates or from\nutilizing technologies similar to those in our gene circuit platform technologies.\nThe filing of a patent application or the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its ownership, inventorship, scope, patentability, validity or\nenforceability. Issued patents and patent applications may be challenged in the courts and in the patent office in the United States and abroad. For example, our\npatent applications or patent applications filed by our licensors, or any patents that grant therefrom, may be challenged through third-party submissions,\nopposition or derivation proceedings. By further example, any issued patents that may result from our owned or in-licensed patent applications may be\nchallenged through reexamination, inter partes review or post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO, or in declaratory judgment actions or\ncounterclaims. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could prevent the issuance of, reduce the scope of, invalidate or\nrender\n92"

In addition, if the breadth or strength of\nprotection provided by any patents that might result from our owned or in-licensed patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from\ncollaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future platforms or product candidates. Any of the foregoing could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nMoreover, we currently co-own certain patent applications with third parties and may in the future co-own additional patents and patent applications with\nthird parties. If we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third-party co-owners’ interest in such patents or patent application, such co-owners\nmay be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. We\nmay need the cooperation of any such co-owners to enforce such patents against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us. Any of the\nforegoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business prospects and financial conditions.\nOur in-licensed patent rights may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties, such as the U.S. government. In addition, our rights in\nsuch inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture product candidates embodying such inventions in the United States. Any exercise by\nthe U.S. government of such rights could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our product candidates and technologies may be dependent on third parties.\nWhile we normally seek to obtain the right to control prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the patents relating to our product candidates and\ntechnologies, there may be times when the filing and prosecution activities for patents and patent applications relating to our product candidates and\ntechnologies are controlled by our licensors or collaborators. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications to which we are licensed.\nEven if patents are issued in respect of these patent applications, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation\nagainst other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would.\nIf any of our licensors or collaborators fail to prosecute, maintain and enforce such patents and patent applications in a manner consistent with the best\ninterests of our business, including by payment of all applicable fees for patents covering our product candidates and technologies, we could lose our rights to\nthe intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates and technologies\nmay be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing product candidates. In addition, even\nwhere we have the right to control patent prosecution of patents and patent applications we have licensed to and from third parties, we may still be adversely\naffected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of our licensees, our current and future licensors and their counsel that took place prior to the date upon which\nwe assumed control over patent prosecution.\nOur licensed European patents and patent applications could be challenged in the recently-created Unified Patent Court, or UPC, for the European Union,\nthat is expected to be fully ratified in 2023. Under our current license agreements, we may not have the final or sole decision as to whether we are able to opt\nout certain of our in-licensed European patents and patent applications from the UPC. Our licensors may decide not to opt out of the UPC, which would\nsubject our in-licensed European patents and patent applications to the jurisdiction of the UPC. Furthermore, even if our licensors decide to opt out of the\nUPC, we cannot guarantee that our licensors will comply with the legal formalities and requirements for properly opting out of the UPC. Thus, we cannot be\ncertain that our in-licensed European patents and patent applications will not fall under the jurisdiction of the UPC. Under the UPC, a single European patent\nwould be valid and enforceable in numerous European countries. A challenge to the validity of a European patent in a central revocation proceeding under the\nUPC, if successful, could result in a loss of patent protection in numerous European countries, which could have a material adverse impact on our business\nand our ability to commercialize or license our technology and product candidates.\n93"

It is possible that the licensors’ infringement proceeding(s) or\ndefense activities may be less vigorous than had we conducted them ourselves.\nWe may be unable to acquire or in-license any relevant third-party intellectual property rights that we identify as necessary or important to our\nbusiness operations.\nBecause our development programs may in the future require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business may depend in\npart on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these third-party proprietary rights. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of\nuse, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our product candidates. The licensing of\nthird-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual\nproperty rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital\nresources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to\nassign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an\nappropriate return on our investment or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the\nsame technologies licensed to us. If we are unable to license such technology, or if we are forced to license such technology on unfavorable terms, our\nbusiness could be materially harmed. If we are unable to obtain a necessary license, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected current or\nfuture product candidates, which could materially harm our business, and the third parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an\ninjunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties or other forms of compensation. Any of the foregoing\ncould harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFurther, our licensors may retain certain rights under their agreements with us, including the right to use the underlying technology for noncommercial\nacademic and research use, to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology, and to make customary scientific and scholarly\ndisclosures of information relating to the technology. It is difficult to monitor whether our licensors limit their use of the technology to these uses, and we\ncould incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights to our licensed technology in the event of misuse.\nAdditionally, some intellectual property that we have in-licensed or that we own may have been discovered through government funded programs and\nthus may be subject to federal regulations such as “march-in” rights, certain reporting requirements and a preference for U.S.-based companies. Compliance\nwith such regulations may limit our exclusive rights, and limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. manufacturers.\nAs a result, the U.S. government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current or future product candidates pursuant to the\nBayh-Dole Act of 1980, or Bayh-Dole Act, and implementing regulations. These U.S. government rights in certain inventions developed under a government-\nfunded program include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the\nU.S. government may have the right to require us or our licensors to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to\na third party if it determines that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public\nhealth or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations (also referred to as “march-in\nrights”).\nMore specifically, certain currently in-licensed patents that cover certain split, universal and programmable chimeric antigen receptor technology may be\nsubject to march-in-rights. This technology is not embodied in any of our current product candidates. In addition, certain currently in-licensed patents that\ncover certain components and process for regulating the expression of a fusion protein with the use of a protease inhibitor are subject to march-in-rights,\nwhich technology can be embodied in certain regulator dial gene circuits. We also own a patent family claiming an invention made under research partially\nfunded by the federal government. Such invention covers mesenchymal stem cells that express combinations of immune effectors for autoimmunity. While the\nforegoing\n94"

The U.S. government also has the right to take title to these\ninventions made through government funded programs if we, or the applicable licensor, fail to disclose the invention to the government and fail to file an\napplication to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. These time limits have recently been changed by regulation, and may change in the\nfuture. Intellectual property generated under a government-funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may\nrequire us or the applicable licensor to expend substantial resources. In addition, the U.S. government requires that any products embodying the subject\ninvention or produced through the use of the subject invention be manufactured substantially in the United States. The manufacturing preference requirement\ncan be waived if the owner of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to\npotential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not\ncommercially feasible. This preference for U.S. manufacturers may limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. product manufacturers for products covered by\nsuch intellectual property. To the extent any of our current or future intellectual property is generated through the use of U.S. government funding, the\nprovisions of the Bayh-Dole Act may similarly apply.\nWe currently, and in the future may continue to, enter into agreements involving licenses or collaborations that provide for access or sharing of\nintellectual property. These intellectual property-related agreements may impose certain obligations and restrictions on our ability to develop and\ncommercialize our product candidates and technologies that are the subject of such licenses.\nWe license rights from third parties to use certain intellectual property relevant to one or more of our current and future product candidates. In the future,\nwe may need to obtain additional licenses from others to advance our research and development activities or allow the commercialization of our current and\nfuture product candidates we may identify and pursue. These existing license agreements impose, and any future license agreements we enter into are likely to\nimpose, various development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement or other\nobligations on us. For example, we are a party to three license agreements with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by the\nNational Cancer Institute, or NCI, for intellectual property relevant to our product candidates. For a more detailed description of the license agreements with\nNCI, see the section titled “Business—Material License and Collaboration Agreements” in this Form 10-K.\nIn addition, certain of our future agreements with third parties may limit or delay our ability to consummate certain transactions, may impact the value of\nthose transactions, or may limit our ability to pursue certain activities. For example, we may in the future enter into license agreements that are not assignable\nor transferable, or that require the licensor’s express consent in order for an assignment or transfer to take place.\nFurther, we or our licensors, if any, may fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization\nactivities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, we may miss potential opportunities to strengthen our patent position. It is\npossible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, for example with respect to\nproper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope, or requests for patent term adjustments. If we or our licensors fail to establish, maintain or protect such\npatents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our licensors are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the\nprosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. If there are material defects in the form, preparation,\nprosecution, or enforcement of our patents or patent applications, such patents may be invalid and/or unenforceable, and such applications may never result in\nvalid, enforceable patents. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nFurthermore, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense of patents and patent\napplications that we license from third parties. In certain circumstances, our licensed patent rights are subject to our reimbursing our licensors for their patent\nprosecution and maintenance costs. If our licensors and future licensors fail to prosecute, maintain, enforce and defend patents we may license, or lose rights\nto licensed patents or patent applications, our licensed rights may be reduced or eliminated.

Our predecessors or\nlicensors do and may retain certain rights under their agreements with us, including the right to use the underlying technology for non-commercial academic\nand research use, to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology, and to make customary scientific and scholarly disclosures of\ninformation relating to the technology.

License termination or\nmodification could result in our inability to develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by the licensed intellectual property or could enable a\ncompetitor to gain access to the licensed intellectual property.\nIn certain circumstances, our licensed patent rights are subject to our reimbursing our licensors for their patent prosecution and maintenance costs. If our\nlicensors and future licensors fail to prosecute, maintain, enforce and defend patents we may license, or lose rights to licensed patents or patent applications,\nour licensed rights may be reduced or eliminated.

In addition, while we cannot\ncurrently determine the amount of the royalty obligations we would be required to pay on sales of future products if infringement or misappropriation were\nfound, those amounts could be significant. The amount of our future royalty obligations will depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in\nproducts that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any.

The resolution of any contract\ninterpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or\nincrease what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our\nability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the\naffected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, while we currently do not have any liens, security interests, or other encumbrances on the intellectual property that we own, we may, in the\nfuture, need to obtain a loan or a line of credit that will require that we put up our intellectual property as collateral to our lenders or creditors. If we do so, and\nwe violate the terms of any such loan or credit agreement, our lenders or creditors may take possession of such intellectual property, including the rights to\nreceive proceeds derived from such intellectual property.\nPatent terms may not be able to protect our competitive position for an adequate period of time with respect to our current or future technologies or\nproduct candidates.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. The term of individual patents and applications in our portfolio depends upon the legal term of patents in the countries in\nwhich they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-\nprovisional patent application. Extensions of patent term may be available, but there is no guarantee that we would have patents eligible for extension, or that\nwe would succeed in obtaining any particular extension, and no guarantee any such extension\n97"

In the United\nStates, the term of a patent may be eligible for patent term adjustment, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for delays incurred at the\nUSPTO during the patent prosecution process. In addition, for patents that cover an FDA-approved drug, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term\nRestoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. While the length\nof the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review, patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a\npatent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent per approved drug—and only those claims covering the approved\ndrug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it—may be extended under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Similar provisions are available in Europe and\nother foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval or\napplicable approval in other jurisdictions, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products in the United States and\nother jurisdiction where such extensions are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States,\nwill agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. We also may not be granted an\nextension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable\ndeadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. If we are unable to obtain patent term\nextension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for the applicable product\ncandidate will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products\ncould be reduced. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may be able to launch their products earlier by taking advantage of our investment in development\nand clinical trials along with our clinical and preclinical data. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to achieve profitability.\nThe life of a patent and the protection it affords are limited. As a result, our owned and in-licensed patent portfolio provides us with limited rights that\nmay not last for a sufficient period of time to exclude others from commercializing product candidates similar or identical to ours. Even if patents covering our\nproduct candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars.\nFor example, given the large amount of time required for the research, development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents\nprotecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may\nnot provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nChanges in U.S. patent law or the patent law of other countries or jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our\nability to protect our current or any future technologies or product candidates.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States or elsewhere could increase the uncertainties and costs\nsurrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. The United States has enacted and implemented wide-\nranging patent reform legislation. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the “Leahy-Smith Act”) was signed into law, which could\nincrease the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or in licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of any future\nowned or in-licensed issued patents. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect\nthe way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect patent litigation and switch the U.S. patent system from a “first-to-invent” system to\na “first-to-file” system. Under a first-to-file system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application\ngenerally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. A third party that files a patent\napplication in the USPTO after March 16, 2013, but before us, could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the\ninvention before it was made by such third party. This will require us to be cognizant of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Since patent\napplications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we or our\nlicensors were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product candidates\n98"

The Leahy-Smith Act also allows third-party submission of\nprior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and sets forth additional procedures to challenge the validity of a patent by USPTO-administered post-grant\nproceedings, including derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review and interference proceedings. The USPTO developed additional\nregulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-\nSmith Act, and, in particular, the first-to-file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith\nAct will have on the operation of our business. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the\nprosecution of our owned or in-licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued owned or in-licensed patents, all of which could have\na material adverse impact on our business prospects and financial condition.\nAs referenced above, for example, courts in the U.S. continue to refine the heavily fact-and-circumstance-dependent jurisprudence defining the scope of\npatent protection available for therapeutics, narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent\nowners in certain situations. This creates uncertainty about our ability to obtain patents in the future and the value of such patents. In addition, the patent\npositions of companies in the development and commercialization of pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have\nnarrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of\nevents has created uncertainty with respect to the validity and enforceability of patents, once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the\nfederal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could have a material adverse effect on our\nexisting patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future. We cannot provide assurance that future developments in\nU.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO will not adversely impact our owned or in-licensed patents or patent applications. The laws and regulations\ngoverning patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our and our licensors’ ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing owned\nor in-licensed patents and patents that we might obtain or in-license in the future. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or\njurisdictions or changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or\nregulations may have a material adverse effect on our and our licensors’ ability to obtain new patents or to protect and enforce our owned or in-licensed\npatents or patents that we may obtain or in-license in the future.\nWe may be subject to lawsuits or litigation to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could result in substantial costs and\nliability and prevent us from commercializing our potential products.\nThird parties may attempt to invalidate our or our licensors’ intellectual property rights via procedures including but not limited to patent infringement\nlawsuits, declaratory judgment actions, interferences, oppositions and inter partes reexamination proceedings before the USPTO, U.S. courts and foreign\npatent offices or foreign courts. An adverse determination in any such submission or proceeding could reduce the scope or enforceability of, or invalidate, our\npatent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the\nevidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO\nproceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a\ndistrict court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated\nif first challenged by the third party in a district court action. Even if such rights are not directly challenged, disputes could lead to the weakening of our or our\nlicensors’ intellectual property rights. Our defense against any attempt by third parties to circumvent or invalidate our intellectual property rights could be\ncostly to us, could require significant time and attention of our management, and could have a material and adverse impact on our profitability, financial\ncondition and prospects or ability to successfully compete.\nWe or our licensors may find it necessary to pursue claims or to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our owned or in-licensed patent or other intellectual\nproperty rights. The cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to our owned or in-licensed patent or other intellectual\nproperty rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, particularly in a foreign jurisdiction, and any litigation or other proceeding would\n99"

Such litigation or proceedings could materially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for\ndevelopment activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. Some of our competitors may be able to more effectively sustain the costs of\ncomplex patent litigation because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or\nother proceedings could delay our research and development efforts and materially limit our ability to continue our operations.\nIf we or our licensors were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates or our technology,\nthe defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging\ninvalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for\nexample, claiming patent-ineligible subject matter, lack of novelty, indefiniteness, lack of written description, non-enablement, anticipation or obviousness.\nGrounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the\nUSPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. The outcome of such invalidity and unenforceability claims is unpredictable. With respect to the\nvalidity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we or our licensors and the patent examiner were unaware\nduring prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we could lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the\npatent protection for one or more of our product candidates or certain aspects of our platform technologies. Such a loss of patent protection could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not\nprotect our product candidates and technologies if competitors or third parties design around such product candidates and technologies without legally\ninfringing, misappropriating or violating our owned or in-licensed patents or other intellectual property rights.\nOur European patents and patent applications could be challenged in the UPC. Though we may decide to opt out our European patents and patent\napplications from the UPC, if certain formalities and requirements are not met, our European patents and patent applications could be challenged for non-\ncompliance and brought under the jurisdiction of the UPC. Potentially, a single proceeding under the UPC could result in loss of patent protection in numerous\nEuropean countries rather than each validated country separately. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business and\nour ability to commercialize or license our technology and product candidates.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could negatively impact our business.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on current or future technologies or product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be\nprohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States.\nIn addition, the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be\nable to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our\ninventions in and into the United States or other countries. Competitors or other third parties may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not\nobtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export infringing product candidates to territories where we have patent protection\nor licenses, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These product candidates may compete with our products, and our patents or other\nintellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain\ncountries, including certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating\nto biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of any owned and in-licensed patents we may obtain in other countries, or the\nmarketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our owned or in-licensed\nintellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and could divert our efforts and attention from other aspects\nof our\n100"

Such proceedings could also put any owned or in-licensed patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our owned or in-\nlicensed patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors. We or our licensors may not\nprevail in any lawsuits or other adversarial proceedings that we or our licensors initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be\ncommercially meaningful. Accordingly, our and our licensors’ efforts to enforce such intellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be\ninadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or in-license.\nFurther, many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition,\nmany countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have\nlimited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of its patents. If we or any of our licensors are forced to grant a license to third parties with\nrespect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position in the relevant jurisdiction may be impaired and our business prospects may be\nmaterially adversely affected.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating or violating their intellectual property rights, the\noutcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, upon our ability or the ability of our potential future collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our\ncurrent or any future product candidates and to use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating or violating the proprietary and\nintellectual property rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other\nintellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter\npartes review proceedings before the USPTO, U.S. courts, foreign patent offices or foreign courts. As the field of gene and cell therapies advances, patent\napplications are being processed by national patent offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which patents will issue, and, if they do, there is\nuncertainty as to when, to whom, and with what claims. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time consuming and could:\n•\nresult in costly litigation that may cause negative publicity;\n•\ndivert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n•\ncause development delays;\n•\nprevent us from commercializing any of our product candidates until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed \na court of law;\n•\nrequire us to develop non-infringing technology, which may not be possible on a cost-effective basis;\n•\nsubject us to substantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product candidate or technology\nissue infringes on or violates the third party’s rights, and, if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay\ntreble damages and the patent owner’s attorneys’ fees; or\n•\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or which\nmight be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same technology.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater\nresources.

As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that we may be subject to\nclaims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may also be currently pending\npatent applications that may later result in issued patents that our technology or product candidates may infringe. Further, we cannot guarantee that we are\naware of all patents and patent applications potentially relevant to our technology or products. We may not be aware of potentially relevant third-party patents\nor applications for several reasons. For example, U.S. applications filed before November 29, 2000, and certain U.S. applications filed after that date that will\nnot be filed outside the U.S. remain confidential until a patent issues. Patent applications filed in the United States (after November 29, 2000) and elsewhere\nare published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the\npriority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our product candidates or platform technologies could have been filed by others without our knowledge.\nAny such patent application may have priority over our patent applications or patents, which could require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such\ntechnologies. Additionally, claims pending in patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner\nthat could cover our platform, our product candidates or the use of our technologies.\nAlthough no third party has asserted a claim of patent infringement against us as of the date of this Annual Report, others may hold proprietary rights that\ncould prevent our product candidates from being marketed. We or our licensors, or any future strategic collaborator, may be party to, or be threatened with,\nadversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current or any potential future product candidates and\ntechnologies, including derivation, reexamination, inter partes review or post-grant review before the USPTO and similar proceedings in jurisdictions outside\nof the United States such as opposition proceedings. In some instances, we may be required to indemnify our licensors for the costs associated with any such\nadversarial proceedings or litigation. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us, our licensors or our strategic collaborators based on existing\npatents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of their merit. There is a risk that third parties may choose to engage in litigation or other\nadversarial proceedings with us, our licensors or our strategic collaborators to enforce or otherwise assert their patent rights. Even if we believe such claims\nare without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are not invalid, enforceable and infringed, which could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our ability to utilize our platform technologies or to commercialize our current or any future product candidates. In order to\nsuccessfully challenge the validity of any such U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity by presenting clear and\nconvincing evidence of invalidity. There is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction, even if presented with evidence we believe to be clear and\nconvincing, would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent.\nFurther, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such adversarial proceedings or litigation. If we are unable to\nsuccessfully settle future claims on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to engage in or to continue costly, unpredictable and time-consuming litigation\nand may be prevented from or experience substantial delays in marketing our product candidates. If we, or our licensors, or any future strategic collaborators\nare found to infringe, misappropriate or violate a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay damages, including treble\ndamages and attorney’s fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed. In addition, we, or our licensors, or any future strategic collaborators may choose to\nseek, or be required to seek, a license from a third party, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if a license can be\nobtained on commercially reasonable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual\nproperty rights licensed to us, and we could be required to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. Parties making claims against us may obtain\ninjunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our current or future product candidates.\nWe could be forced, including by court order, to cease utilizing, developing, manufacturing and commercializing our platform technologies or product\ncandidates deemed to be infringing. We may be forced to redesign current or future technologies or products. Defense of these claims, regardless of their\nmerit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. Any of\n102"

If such third parties refuse to grant us a license to such patent rights on reasonable terms or at all, we may be required to expend significant time and\nresources to redesign our technology, product candidates or the methods for manufacturing our product candidates, or to develop or license replacement\ntechnology, all of which may not be commercially or technically feasible. In such case, we may not be able to market such technology or product candidates\nand may not be able to perform research and development or other activities covered by these patents. This could have a material adverse effect on our ability\nto commercialize our product candidates and our business and financial condition.\nLastly, if our technology or products are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, these third parties may assert infringement\nclaims against our licensees and other parties with whom we have business relationships, and we may be required to indemnify those parties for any damages\nthey suffer as a result of these claims. The claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of licensees and other parties\nregardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of those parties or may be required to\nobtain licenses for the products they use.\nIntellectual property litigation may lead to unfavorable publicity that harms our reputation and causes the market price of our shares of our common\nstock to decline.\nDuring the course of any intellectual property litigation, there could be public announcements of the initiation of the litigation as well as results of\nhearings, rulings on motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as\nnegative, the perceived value of our existing product candidates, approved products, programs or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the\nmarket price of shares of our common stock may decline. Such announcements could also harm our reputation or the market for our future products, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIntellectual property rights of third parties could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our current or future technologies or product\ncandidates, and we might be required to litigate or obtain licenses from third parties to develop or market our current or future technologies or product\ncandidates, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nBecause the gene and cell therapy landscape is still evolving, it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate without infringing,\nmisappropriating or violating third-party rights. The scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and\nthe patent’s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect. For example, we may\nincorrectly determine that our products are not covered by a third-party patent or may incorrectly predict whether a third-party’s pending application will issue\nwith claims of relevant scope. Also, our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be\nincorrect.\nThere are numerous companies that have pending patent applications and issued patents broadly covering gene and cell therapy generally or covering\nrelated inventions that may be relevant for product candidates that we wish to develop. We are aware of third-party patents and patent applications that claim\naspects of our current or potential future product candidates and modifications that we may need to apply to our current or potential future product candidates.\nThere are also many issued patents that claim inventions that may be relevant to products we wish to develop. The holders of such patents may be able to\nblock our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtain a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a\nlicense may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or it may be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to\nthe same intellectual property.\nOur competitive position may materially suffer if patents issued to third parties or other third-party intellectual property rights cover our current or future\ntechnologies, product candidates or elements thereof or our manufacture or uses relevant to our development plans.

There also may be pending patent applications of which we are not aware that may\nresult in issued patents, which could be alleged to be infringed by our current or future technologies or product candidates. If such an infringement claim\nshould successfully be brought, we may be required to pay substantial damages or be forced to abandon our current or future technologies or product\ncandidates or to seek a license from any patent holders. No assurances can be given that a license will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nThird-party intellectual property right holders may also actively bring infringement, misappropriation, or other claims alleging violations of intellectual\nproperty rights against us. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such claims. If we are unable to successfully\nsettle future claims on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to engage in or to continue costly, unpredictable and time-consuming litigation and may be\nprevented from or experience substantial delays in marketing our product candidates. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced to pay\ndamages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing any of our current or future technologies or product candidates that are held\nto be infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third-party intellectual property rights.

Elements of our product candidates, including processes for\ntheir preparation and manufacture, may involve proprietary know-how, information, or technology that is not covered by patents, and thus for these aspects we\nmay consider trade secrets and know-how to be our primary intellectual property. Our trade secrets include, for example, certain program specific synthesis,\nformulations, patient selection strategies and certain aspects of our research.\nTrade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect trade secrets and confidential and unpatented know-how, in part, by entering\ninto non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to such knowledge, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside\nscientific collaborators, contract research organizations, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality\nand invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants under which they are obligated to maintain confidentiality and to assign\ntheir inventions to us. However, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties, and we cannot be certain that our\ntrade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access (such as through a\ncybersecurity breach) to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Moreover, individuals with whom we\nhave such agreements may not comply with their terms. Any of these parties may breach such agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including\nour trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breaches. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as\nphysical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties.\nWe may also become involved in inventorship disputes relating to inventions and patents developed by our employees or consultants under such\nagreements. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret, or securing title to an employee-or consultant-developed\ninvention if a dispute arises, is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the United States and\ncertain foreign jurisdictions disfavor or are unwilling to protect trade secrets. We may need to share our\n104"

In addition, many of our employees or consultants and our licensors’ employees or\nconsultants were previously employed at universities or biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors.\nWe may be subject to claims that one or more of these employees or consultants or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other\nproprietary information of third parties, including former employers of our employees and consultants. Litigation or arbitration may be necessary to defend\nagainst these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or\npersonnel or may be enjoined from using such intellectual property. Any such proceedings and possible aftermath would likely divert significant resources\nfrom our core business, including distracting our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. A loss of key research personnel or\ntheir work product could limit our ability to commercialize, or prevent us from commercializing, our current or future technologies or product candidates,\nwhich could materially harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against any such claims, litigation or arbitration could result in substantial\ncosts and could be a distraction to management.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in-licensed\npatents as an inventor or co-inventor, or in our trade secrets or other intellectual property as a contributor to its development. The failure to name the proper\ninventors on a patent application can result in the patents issuing thereon being unenforceable. Inventorship disputes may arise from conflicting views\nregarding the contributions of different individuals named as inventors, the effects of foreign laws where foreign nationals are involved in the development of\nthe subject matter of the patent, conflicting obligations of third parties involved in developing our product candidates or as a result of questions regarding co-\nownership of potential joint inventions. For example, we or our licensors may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees,\nconsultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging\ninventorship or our or our licensors’ ownership of our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. Alternatively, or additionally,\nwe may enter into agreements to clarify the scope of our rights in such intellectual property. If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in\naddition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property\nthat is important to our product candidates. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a\ndistraction to management and other employees.\nAlso, our licensors may have relied on third-party consultants or collaborators or on funds from third parties, such as the U.S. government, such that our\nlicensors are not the sole and exclusive owners of the patents we in-licensed. If other third parties have ownership rights or other rights to our in-licensed\npatents, they may be able to license such patents to our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology.

The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment\nagreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the\nownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other\nrequirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these\nrequirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO\nand various government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our owned and in-licensed patents or applications and any patent\nrights we may own or in-license in the future. The USPTO and various non-U.S. patent offices require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee\npayment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply with\nthese requirements, and we are also dependent on our licensors to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to our in-licensed\nintellectual property. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse, including due to the effect of the COVID-19 on us, our patent counsel or other applicable patent\nmaintenance vendors, can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which\nnon-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant\njurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to\nrespond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In such an event,\npotential competitors might be able to enter the market with similar or identical product candidates or platforms, which could have a material adverse effect on\nour business prospects and financial condition.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our\nbusiness may be adversely affected.\nWe use and will continue to use registered and/or unregistered trademarks or trade names to brand and market ourselves and our products. Our trademarks\nor trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our\nrights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names, which we use for name recognition by potential collaborators or\ncustomers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand\nidentity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of\nother trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to\nestablish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business may be materially adversely\naffected.\nWe may also license our trademarks and trade names to third parties, such as distributors.

Further, a clinical trial may\nbe suspended or terminated by us, our collaborators, the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, the Data Safety Monitoring Board\nfor such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with\nregulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in\nthe imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug or therapeutic biologic,\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nMoreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash or equity\ncompensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or a\nregulatory authority concludes that the financial relationship may have affected the interpretation of the trial, the integrity of the data generated at the\napplicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection of the\nmarketing application we submit. Any such delay or rejection could prevent or delay us from commercializing our current or future product candidates.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of any of our current or potential future product candidates, the\ncommercial prospects of such product candidate will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from such product candidates will be delayed. In\naddition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to\ncommence product sales and generate revenue. Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also\nultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our current or potential future product candidates.\nWe may be unable to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approval and, as a result, be unable to commercialize our current or potential future product\ncandidates.\nOur current and any potential future product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research,\ntesting, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing,\nmarketing and distribution of therapeutic biologics. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required to\nbe successfully completed in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug or therapeutic biologic can be marketed. Satisfaction of these and\nother regulatory requirements is costly, time-consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. It is possible that none of the product candidates we\nmay develop will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us or our potential future collaborators to begin selling them.\nWe have very limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA\nand other regulatory authorities. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the\ncommencement of clinical trials, depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. The standards that the FDA and its foreign\ncounterparts use when regulating us require judgment and can change, which makes it difficult to predict with certainty how they will be applied. Any analysis\nwe perform of data from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or\nprevent regulatory approval. We may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, for example, from future\nlegislation or administrative action, or from changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review\nin the United States and other jurisdictions.

Further, we and our potential future collaborators may never receive approval to market and commercialize any\nproduct candidate. Even if we or a potential future collaborator obtains regulatory approval, the approval may be for targets, disease indications or patient\npopulations that are not as broad as we intended or desired or may require labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings.\nOnce a product obtains regulatory approval, numerous post approval requirements apply, including periodic monitoring and reporting obligations, review\nof promotional material, reports on ongoing clinical trials and adverse events and inspections of manufacturing facilities. In addition, material changes to\napproved products, including any changes to the manufacturing process or labeling, require further review by the appropriate authorities before marketing.\nApprovals may also be withdrawn or revoked due to safety, effectiveness or potency concerns, including as a result of adverse events reported in patients or\nongoing clinical trials, or failure to comply with cGMP. In addition to revocation or withdrawal of approvals, we and our partners may be subject to warnings,\nfines, recalls, criminal prosecution or other sanctions if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements. If we or our partners are unable to obtain or maintain\nregulatory approvals for our products and product candidates, our business, financial position, results of operations and future growth prospects will be\nnegatively impacted and we or our partners may be subject to sanctions. If any of our product candidates prove to be ineffective, unsafe or commercially\nunviable, we may have to re-engineer our current or potential future product candidates, and our entire pipeline could have little, if any, value, which could\nrequire us to change our focus and approach to product candidate discovery and therapeutic development, which would have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe will also be subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and\nmarketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries and may include all of the\nrisks associated with FDA approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, the\ntime required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining\nregulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nIf we succeed in developing any products, we intend to market them in the United States as well as the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions. In\norder to market and sell our products in other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory\nrequirements.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain\nregulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the\nregulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA or EMA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory\nauthorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval\nprocedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from those in the United States, including\nadditional preclinical studies or clinical trials as clinical trials conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other\njurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in\nthat jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval.\nObtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us\nand could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we or any partner we work with fail to comply with the regulatory\nrequirements in international markets or fail to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced, and our ability to realize the full\nmarket potential of our product candidates will be harmed.\n110"

Although the FDA may\naccept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of this data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the FDA. In cases\nwhere data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will not approve the application\non the basis of foreign data alone unless (i) those data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; (ii) the studies were performed by\nclinical investigators of recognized competence; and (iii) the data are considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA\nconsiders such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. For studies that are\nconducted only at sites outside of the United States and not subject to an IND, the FDA requires the clinical trial to have been conducted in accordance with\nGCPs, and the FDA must be able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an on-site inspection if it deems such inspection necessary. For such\nstudies not subject to an IND, the FDA generally does not provide advance comment on the clinical protocols for the studies, and therefore there is an\nadditional potential risk that the FDA could determine that the study design or protocol for a non-U.S. clinical trial was inadequate, which could require us to\nconduct additional clinical trials. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data from clinical trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA\ndoes not accept data from our clinical trials of our product candidates, it would likely result in the need for additional clinical trials, which would be costly and\ntime consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of our product candidates.\nMany foreign regulatory bodies have similar approval requirements.

These\nrequirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP and\ngood clinical practices for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, manufacturers and manufacturers’ facilities are required to comply\nwith extensive FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform\nto cGMP and cGTP regulations and applicable product tracking and tracing requirements.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with a product candidate, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our\nthird-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n•\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product candidate, withdrawal of the product candidate from the market or voluntar\nor mandatory product recalls;\n•\nfines, warning letters, untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;\n•\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic collaborators;\n•\nsuspension or revocation of product approvals;\n•\nsuspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n•\nproduct seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n•\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue.\nThe FDA has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) as part of a biologics license application, or BLA, or after\napproval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved product, such as limiting prescribing to certain\nphysicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated\npatients to enroll in a registry.\nFurthermore, the FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Products may be\npromoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. While physicians may prescribe, in their independent\nprofessional medical judgment, products for off-label uses as the FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of drug treatments, the FDA\ndoes restrict a manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. Companies may only share truthful and not misleading\ninformation that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations\nprohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability\nincluding, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. The federal government has\nlevied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label\npromotion.\n112"

The FDA’s and other regulatory\nauthorities’ policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product\ncandidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in\nthe United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are\nnot able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability,\nwhich would adversely affect our business.\nAny product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nThe Affordable Care Act includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated\napproval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, an\napplication for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the\nFDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until twelve years from the date on which the reference product\nwas first licensed. During this twelve-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA\napproves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to\ndemonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The law is complex. The BPCIA could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial\nprospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that any of our future product candidates approved as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for the twelve-year period of\nexclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to Congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider our\nproduct candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Other\naspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. Moreover, the extent to\nwhich a biosimilar, once approved, could be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for\nnon-biological products will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe United States and several other jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the\nhealthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell any of our product candidates profitably, if approved. Among policy-makers and payers in the\nUnited States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems, with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs,\nimproving quality and expanding access to healthcare. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has\nbeen significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future.

We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or\ninterpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition,\nincreased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent\nproduct labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such\norganizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate\npayment for our product candidates, if approved.. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty\ndrug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation\ndesigned to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship\nbetween pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.\nWe expect that the healthcare reform measures that have been adopted and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and\nin additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and could harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement\nfrom Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment\nmeasures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nFailure to comply with health and data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or\ncriminal penalties), private litigation or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe may collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect and share personal information, health information and\nother sensitive information to develop our products, to operate our business, for clinical trial purposes, for legal and marketing purposes, and for other\nbusiness-related purposes.\nWe and any potential future collaborators, partners or service providers may be subject to federal, state and foreign data protection laws, regulations and\nregulatory guidance, the number and scope of which is changing, subject to differing applications and interpretations, and which may be inconsistent among\njurisdictions, or in conflict with other rules, laws or contractual obligations. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including\nfederal health information privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), state data breach notification laws, state\nhealth information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and\nother personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of any future potential collaborators or service providers.\nIn addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject\nto privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, or other privacy and data security laws. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to\ncivil or criminal penalties if we obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is\nnot authorized or permitted by HIPAA, or if we otherwise violate applicable privacy and data security laws.\nInternational data protection laws, including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, and the UK’s implementation of the same, or GDPR, may also\napply to health-related and other personal information obtained outside of the United States. The GDPR imposes stringent data protection requirements for\nprocessing personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the UK, as well as potential fines for noncompliant companies of up\nto the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of annual global revenue. The GDPR imposes numerous requirements for the collection, use and disclosure\nof personal data, including stringent requirements\n114"

On June 4, 2021, the European Commission issued new forms of standard\ncontractual clauses (one of the primary mechanisms for U.S. companies to import personal information from Europe) for data transfers from controllers or\nprocessors in the EEA (or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EEA (and not subject to the GDPR). The new\nstandard contractual clauses do not apply in the UK, but the UK Information Commissioner’s Office issued a UK-specific transfer mechanism, the\nInternational Data Transfer Agreement. We are required to transition to the new forms of transfer mechanisms and doing so will require significant effort and\ncost. The new transfer mechanisms may also impact our business as companies based in Europe may be reluctant to utilize the new clauses to legitimize\ntransfers of personal information to third countries given the burdensome requirements of transfer impact assessments and the substantial obligations that the\nnew standard contractual clauses impose upon exporters. If we are investigated by a European data protection authority, we may face fines and other penalties.\nAny such investigation or charges by European data protection authorities could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract\nand retain new clients or pharmaceutical partners. We may also experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national clients or\npharmaceutical partners to continue to use our products due to the potential risk exposure as a result of the current (and, in particular, future) data protection\nobligations imposed on them by certain data protection authorities in interpretation of current law, including the GDPR. Such clients or pharmaceutical\npartners may also view any alternative approaches to compliance as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain, or otherwise objectionable and\ntherefore decide not to do business with us. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe GDPR has increased our responsibilities and potential liability in relation to personal data processed subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to\nput in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. In addition, any failure by us (or\nour business partners who handle personal data) to comply with GDPR and applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection of EEA\nmember states and the UK may result in regulators prohibiting our processing of the personal data of EEA and UK data subjects, which could impact our\noperations and ability to develop our products and provide our services, including interrupting or ending EEA and UK clinical trials.\nIn the U.S., state laws also govern the privacy and security of personal information and states are constantly adopting new laws or amending existing\nlaws, requiring attention to frequently changing regulatory requirements. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California\nPrivacy Rights Act (the “CCPA”) gives California residents expanded rights to access, correct, and delete their personal information, opt out of certain\npersonal information sharing and certain uses of sensitive data, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring\ncovered companies to provide disclosures to California consumers (as that term is broadly defined and includes any of our current or future employees who\nmay be California residents) and provide such residents ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for\nviolations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches and statutory damages, which is expected to increase data breach class action litigation and\nresult in significant exposure to costly legal judgments and settlements. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue\nsubstantive regulations which could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. Although the law includes limited exceptions for health-\nrelated information, including clinical trial data, such exceptions may not apply to all of our operations and processing activities. As we expand our operations\nand trials (both preclinical and clinical), the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. The CCPA has prompted the enactment of\nsimilar, comprehensive privacy and data protection legislation in other states, such as Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut, which will all become\neffective in 2023. Furthermore, a number of other U.S. states have proposed similar privacy and data protection legislation, and it is possible that certain of\nthese proposals will pass.

Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights, failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or breached our\ncontractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, result in regulatory actions and proceedings, in\naddition to private claims and litigation, and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nWe also are, or may be asserted to be, subject to the terms of our external and internal privacy and security policies, representations, certifications,\npublications and frameworks and contractual obligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection, information security and processing.

See section titled “Business -\nGovernment Regulation - Other U.S. Healthcare Laws.”\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and\nstate enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a\nnumber of investigations, prosecutions, convictions, and settlements in the healthcare industry.\nEnsuring that our internal operations and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will\ninvolve substantial costs.

If any of the above occur, our ability to operate\nour business and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements, regulatory authorities could limit or withdraw any marketing or\ncommercialization approvals we may receive and subject us to other penalties that could materially harm our business.\nEven if we receive marketing and commercialization approval of a product candidate, we will be subject to continuing regulatory requirements, including\nin relation to adverse patient experiences with the product and clinical results that are reported after a product is made commercially available, both in the\nUnited States and any foreign jurisdiction in which we seek regulatory approval. The FDA and other regulatory authorities have significant post- market\nauthority, including the authority to require labeling changes based on new safety information and to require post-market studies or clinical trials to evaluate\nsafety risks related to the use of a product or to require withdrawal of the product candidate from the market. The FDA and other regulatory authorities also\nhave the authority to require a REMS after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug or\ntherapeutic biologic. The manufacturer and manufacturing facilities we use to make a future product, if any, will also be subject to periodic review and\ninspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including for continued compliance with cGMP and cGTP requirements. The discovery of any new or\npreviously unknown problems with our third-party manufacturers, manufacturing processes or facilities may result in restrictions on the product candidate,\nmanufacturer or facility, including withdrawal of the product candidate from the market. We intend to rely on third-party manufacturers and we will not have\ncontrol over compliance with applicable rules and regulations by such manufacturers. Any product promotion and advertising will also be subject to\nregulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. If we or our existing or future collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with\napplicable continuing regulatory requirements in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions in which we seek to market our products, we or they may be subject to,\namong other things, fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, delay of approval or refusal by the FDA or other regulatory authorities to approve pending\napplications or supplements to approved applications, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, administrative detention\nof products, refusal to permit the import or export of products, operating restrictions, injunction, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nEven if we are able to commercialize any product candidate, such product candidate may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-\nparty coverage and reimbursement policies, which would harm our business.\nIn the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their\ntreatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical\nto new product acceptance. Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost employer-based insurance coverage, which may\nadversely affect our ability to commercialize our products. It is unclear what effect, if any, the American Rescue Plan will have on the number of covered\nindividuals.

Patients are unlikely to use our future products, if any, unless coverage is provided and\nreimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost.

Instead, the administering physician may or may not be\nreimbursed for providing the treatment or procedure in which our product is used.\nCost-containment is a priority in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere. As a result, government authorities and other third-party payors have\nattempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that\ndrug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Third-party payors\nalso may request additional clinical evidence beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, requiring a company to conduct expensive\npharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of its product. Commercial third-party payors often rely upon\nMedicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from\nMedicare determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products in the U.S. can differ significantly from payor to payor. We\ncannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, that the\nlevel of reimbursement will be adequate. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain\nmarketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize\nany product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nAdditionally, the regulations that govern regulatory approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drugs and therapeutic biologics vary widely from\ncountry to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug or therapeutic biologic before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing\nreview period begins after marketing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing\ngovernmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be\nsubject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able\nto generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product\ncandidates, even if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval.\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with such laws\ncan subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. §\n201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and possibly other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we\nconduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, third-party intermediaries, joint venture\npartners and collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public\nor private sector. We interact with officials and employees of government agencies and government-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. In\naddition, we may engage third-party intermediaries to promote our clinical research activities abroad or to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other\nregulatory approvals. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives,\ncontractors, collaborators and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities.\nWe adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and we expect to prepare and implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with such\ncode. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics mandates compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws applicable to our business throughout the\nworld.

If any of these additional shares are\nsold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership\nof our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nSignificant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including further development of our gene circuit platform,\npreparing IND or equivalent filings, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, commercialization efforts, expanded research and development activities\nand costs associated with operating a public company. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or\nmore transactions at prices and in a manner as determined from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities,\ninvestors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to existing stockholders, and new investors could gain\nrights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of shares of our common stock.\nPursuant to the Senti Biosciences, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan, our board of directors or compensation committee is authorized to grant stock options to our\nemployees, directors and consultants. Initially, the maximum aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued pursuant to stock awards\nunder the Incentive Plan was 2,492,735 shares of our common stock. Additionally, the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the\nIncentive Plan automatically increases on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2023 and continuing through and including January 1, 2032, by 5%\nof the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares determined by our\nboard of directors. Unless our board of directors elects not to increase the number of shares available for future grant each year, our stockholders may\nexperience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall. In addition, on August 5, 2022, out board of directors adopted the 2022 Inducement\nPlan, pursuant to which an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance. Our issuance of additional shares of common\nstock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank would, all else being equal, have the following effects:\n•\nthe amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease;\n122"

We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and\noperated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities\nthat judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. For example, our directors or executive\nofficers could inadvertently fail to disclose a new relationship or arrangement causing us to fail to make a required related party transaction disclosure.\nAdditionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the\ncontrols. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nReports published by analysts, including projections in those reports that differ from our actual results, could adversely affect the price and trading\nvolume of shares of our common stock.\nWe currently expect that securities research analysts will establish and publish their own periodic financial projections for our business. These projections\nmay vary widely and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections\nof these securities research analysts. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who write reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or\nunfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us\nregularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline. While we expect research analyst coverage, if no analysts commence coverage of us, the trading\nprice and volume for shares of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company will involve significant expenses and will require significant resources and management\nattention, which may divert from our business operations.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires the filing\nof annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to a public company’s business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other\nthings, that a public company establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we will incur significant legal, accounting\nand other expenses that we did not previously incur. Our entire management team and many of our other employees will need to devote substantial time to\ncompliance, and may not effectively or efficiently manage our transition into a public company.\nThese rules and regulations will result in us incurring substantial legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming\nand costly. For example, these rules and regulations will likely make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability\ninsurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a\nresult, it may be difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nProvisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (“Charter”), our amended and restated bylaws, or Bylaws, and Delaware\nlaw may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and\nmay prevent attempts by our\n123"

This exclusive forum provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim\nfor which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Stockholders cannot waive compliance with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other federal\nsecurities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder. Unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternate forum, the United States federal district\ncourts shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. In addition, our Bylaws\nprovide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to\nthese exclusive forum provisions; provided, however, that stockholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The forum selection provisions in our Bylaws may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders\nin pursuing any such claims and may limit our stockholders’ ability to litigate disputes with us in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us\nor our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees, even though an\naction, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. In addition, while the Delaware Supreme Court and other state courts have upheld the validity of federal\nforum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will\nenforce the federal forum provision. If the federal forum provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such\nmatters. The federal forum provision may also impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert that the provision is not enforceable or invalid.\nThe Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States may also reach different judgments or results than would\nother courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments\nmay be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our securities.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price\nrequirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our securities. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of the securities and would impair\nyour ability to sell or purchase the securities when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to\nrestore compliance with listing requirements would allow our securities to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our\nsecurities, prevent our securities from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing\nrequirements. Additionally, if our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an\ninter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more\nlimited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be\nestablished or sustained.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be investors’\nsole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth\nand development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be investors’ sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe may be at an increased risk of securities class action litigation.\nHistorically, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is\nespecially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we were\nto be sued, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\n125"

Average review times at the FDA have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition,\ngovernment funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid\nand unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs and biologics or modifications to approved\ndrugs and biologics to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last\nseveral years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such\nas the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.\nSince March 2020 when foreign and domestic inspections of facilities were largely placed on hold, the FDA has been working to resume pre-pandemic\nlevels of inspection activities, including routine surveillance, bioresearch monitoring and pre-approval inspections. Should the FDA determine that an\ninspection is necessary for approval and an inspection cannot be completed during the review cycle due to restrictions on travel, and the FDA does not\ndetermine a remote interactive evaluation to be adequate, the agency has stated that it generally intends to issue, depending on the circumstances, a complete\nresponse letter or defer action on the application until an inspection can be completed. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, a number of companies\nannounced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA’s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. Regulatory authorities\noutside the U.S. may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and may experience delays in their\nregulatory activities.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans\nmay not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur current operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area. Any unplanned event, such as earthquake, flood, fire, explosion, extreme weather\ncondition, medical epidemics, including any potential effects from the current global spread of COVID-19, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other\nnatural or man-made accidents or incidents that result in us being unable to fully utilize our facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract\nmanufacturers, may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis and have significant negative\nconsequences on our financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of our\nproduct candidates or interruption of our business operations. Natural disasters or pandemics such as the COVID-19 outbreak could further disrupt our\noperations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or\nother event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our research\nfacilities or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases,\nimpossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove\ninadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event.

Senti’s mission is to create a new generation of smarter therapies that can outmaneuver complex diseases in ways previously not\nimplemented by conventional medicines. To accomplish this mission, Senti has built a synthetic biology platform that it believes may enable it to program\nnext-generation cell and gene therapies with what it refers to as “gene circuits.” These gene circuits, which Senti created from novel and proprietary\ncombinations of genetic parts, are designed to reprogram cells with biological logic to sense inputs, compute decisions and respond to their respective cellular\nenvironments. Senti’s gene circuit platform technologies can be applied in a modality-agnostic manner, with applicability to natural killer (NK) cells, T cells,\ntumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (“TILs”), stem cells including Hematopoietic Stem Cells (“HSCs”), in vivo gene therapy and messenger ribonucleic acid\n(mRNA). All of Senti’s current product candidates are in preclinical development. Senti’s lead product candidates utilize allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor\n(“CAR”) NK cells outfitted with its gene circuit technologies in several oncology indications with currently high unmet needs. Senti expects to file\ninvestigational new drug applications (“INDs”) for multiple product candidates starting in 2023.\nWe have incurred net losses of $58.2 million and $55.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022\nand 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, of $98.6 million and $56.0 million, respectively, and an accumulated deficit of $173.3\nmillion and $115.1 million, respectively. Net cash flows used in operating activities were $34.9 million and $34.6 million during the years ended December\n31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and\nfrom general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe anticipate that our expenses and operating losses will increase substantially over the foreseeable future. The expected increase in expenses will be\ndriven in large part by our ongoing activities, if and as we:\n•\ncontinue to advance our gene circuit platform technologies;\n•\ncontinue preclinical development of our current and future product candidates and initiate additional preclinical studies;\n•\ncommence clinical studies of our current and future product candidates;\n•\nestablish our manufacturing capability, including developing our contract development and manufacturing relationships, and building our internal\nmanufacturing facilities;\n•\nacquire and license technologies aligned with our gene circuit platform technologies;\n130"

As a result of the\nMerger, Dynamics was renamed Senti Biosciences, Inc.\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), (1) each outstanding share of common stock of\nLegacy Senti was cancelled and converted into the right to receive approximately 0.1957 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share\n(“Common Stock”), and (2) each outstanding share of preferred stock of Legacy Senti was cancelled and converted into the aggregate number of shares of\nCommon Stock that would be issued upon conversion of the shares of Legacy Senti preferred stock based on the applicable conversion ratio immediately prior\nto the Effective Time, multiplied by approximately 0.1957, resulting in the issuance of a total of 23,163,614 shares of Common Stock. Prior holders of shares\nof Legacy Senti common stock and Legacy Senti preferred stock also received the contingent right to receive certain Earnout Shares (as defined below), for\neach share owned by each such Legacy Senti stockholder that was outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”). In addition,\ncertain investors purchased an aggregate of 5,060,000 shares of Common Stock (such investors, the “PIPE Investors”) in a private placement that closed\nconcurrently with the Closing for an aggregate purchase price of $50.6 million (the “PIPE Financing”). Additionally, at the Closing, 14,915,963 shares of\nCommon Stock were issued to Dynamics stockholders (reflecting actual redemptions by Dynamics public stockholders). Additionally, an unsecured\nconvertible promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $5,175,000 that was previously issued by Senti to Bayer Healthcare LLC for a purchase price\nof $5,175,000 on May 19, 2022 was automatically cancelled and exchanged for 517,500 shares of Common Stock.\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the Effective Time of the Merger, options to purchase shares of Legacy Senti common stock were\nconverted into options to purchase an aggregate of 1,667,546 shares of Common Stock.\nFollowing the Closing Date, former holders of Legacy Senti common stock and preferred stock may receive up to 2,000,000 additional shares of\nCommon Stock (“Earnout Shares”) in the aggregate in two equal tranches if the\n131"

Total\nrevenue consists of contract revenue related to research services provided to customers and grant income which is research funding received from grants.\nOur ability to generate product revenues will depend on our partners’ ability to replicate our results and the successful development and eventual\ncommercialization of our product candidates, which we do not expect for the foreseeable future, if ever. We may also look to generate revenue from\ncollaboration and license agreements in the future.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs consist primarily of costs incurred for the discovery and preclinical development of our product candidates, which\ninclude:\n•\nemployee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, and stock-based compensation expenses for employees engaged in research and\ndevelopment functions;\n•\nexpenses incurred in connection with research, laboratory consumables and preclinical studies;\n•\nthe cost of consultants engaged in research and development related services and the cost to manufacture drug products for use in our preclinical\nstudies and trials;\n•\nfacilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies;\n•\ncosts related to regulatory compliance; and\n•\nthe cost of annual license fees.\nWe have not historically tracked research and development expenses by program, with the exception of third-party research projects. We have various\nongoing early-stage research and product candidate discovery projects and going forward, we expect to have various products undergoing clinical trials. Our\ninternal resources, employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any one research or product candidate discovery project and are typically deployed\nacross multiple projects. As such, we do not maintain information regarding these costs incurred for these early-stage research and product candidate\ndiscovery programs on a project-specific basis.\nOur direct external development program expenses reflect external costs attributable to our preclinical development candidates selected for further\ndevelopment as well as investigational new drug applications (“INDs”)\n132"

There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of\nany of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this\ntime based on our stage of development. In addition, future regulatory factors beyond our control may impact our preclinical development programs. Product\ncandidates in clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in preclinical stages of development, primarily due to the increased\nsize and duration of clinical trials. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to\ncomplete the preclinical development of any of our product candidates. However, we expect that our research and development expenses and manufacturing\ncosts will increase substantially in connection with our planned preclinical and clinical development activities in the near term and in the future.\nThe successful development of our current and future product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to numerous risks and uncertainties, including\nthe following:\n•\nnegative or inconclusive results from our preclinical studies or clinical trials or the clinical trials of others for product candidates similar to ours,\nleading to a decision or requirement to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or abandon any or all of our programs;\n•\nproduct-related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using therapeutics similar to our product candidates;\n•\ndelays in submitting IND applications or comparable foreign applications, or delays or failures to obtain the necessary approvals from regulators to\ncommence a clinical trial, or a suspension or termination of a clinical trial once commenced;\n•\nconditions imposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or other regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical\ntrials;\n•\ndelays in enrolling research subjects in clinical trials;\n•\nhigh drop-out rates of research subjects;\n•\ninadequate supply or quality of product candidate components or materials or other supplies necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;\n•\nChemistry, manufacturing and control (“CMC”) challenges associated with manufacturing and scaling up biologic product candidates to ensure\nconsistent quality, stability, purity and potency among different batches used in clinical trials;\n•\ngreater-than-anticipated clinical trial costs;\n•\npoor potency or effectiveness of our product candidates during clinical trials;\n133"

We anticipate that we will continue to seek additional funding, though the precise timing of such may\nprove uncertain. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking\nstatement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. Our assumptions may prove to be inaccurate, and we could deplete our\ncapital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of testing and manufacturing product candidates in preclinical studies and clinical trials is\ncostly and the timing and expenses in these trials are uncertain.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n•\nthe scope, rate of progress, results and costs of drug discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product\ncandidates;\n•\nthe number and development requirements of product candidates that we may pursue, and other indications for our current product candidates that we\nmay pursue;\n•\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n•\nthe scope and costs of constructing and operating our planned cGMP facility and any commercial manufacturing activities;\n•\nthe cost associated with commercializing any approved product candidates;\n•\nthe cost and timing of developing our ability to establish sales and marketing capabilities, if any;\n•\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, enforcing and protecting our intellectual property rights, defending\nintellectual property-related claims and obtaining licenses to third-party intellectual property;\n•\nthe timing and amount of any milestone and royalty payments we are required to make under our present or future license agreements;\n•\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; and\n•\nthe extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies and associated intellectual property.\nIn order to improve our liquidity, management is actively pursuing additional financing. We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection\nwith ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our preclinical activities and clinical trials for our product candidates in development. Accordingly, we will\nneed to obtain substantial additional funding for continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, or on attractive terms, we could be\nforced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research or drug development programs or any future commercialization efforts. Although management continues to\npursue these plans, there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, if at\nall.\nAccounting standards require that management evaluate whether we have adequate financial resources to continue as a going concern beyond twelve\nmonths after the date that these consolidated financial statements are available to be issued.

The assumptions utilized in the calculation were based on the achievement of certain stock price milestones, including our current\ncommon stock price, expected volatility, risk-free rate, expected term and expected dividend yield.\nThe common stock price was based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date at the Reverse Recapitalization and each reporting\ndate.

The risk-free rate was determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the\nContingent Earnout Shares. The expected dividend yield was 0% based on the fact that we have never paid or declared dividends. The risk-free rate and\nexpected volatility requires significant judgment and actual results can differ from assumed and estimated amounts.\nDetermination of the Fair Value of Common Stock\nHistorically, for all periods prior to the Merger, we were required to estimate the fair value of our common stock underlying our share-based awards when\nperforming the fair value calculations using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Because our common stock is not currently publicly traded, the fair value\nof our common stock underlying our share-based awards has been determined on each grant date by our board of directors, with input from management,\nconsidering our most recently available third-party valuation of our common stock.\nIn the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, on each grant date, our board of directors has made a reasonable determination of the fair\nvalue of our common stock based on the information known to us on the date of grant, upon a review of any recent events and their potential impact on the\nestimated fair value per share of the common stock, and timely valuations from an independent third-party valuation in accordance with guidance provided by\nthe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Inc. Practice Aid: Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation,\n2013. In addition, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock, including:\n•\nthe estimated value of each security both outstanding and anticipated;\n•\nthe anticipated capital structure that will directly impact the value of the currently outstanding securities;\n•\nour results of operations and financial position;\n•\nthe status of our research and development efforts;\n•\nthe composition of, and changes to, our management team and board of directors;\n•\nthe lack of liquidity of our common stock as a private company;\n•\nour stage of development and business strategy and the material risks related to our business and industry;\n140"

In accordance with the Practice Aid, we considered various income, market or asset valuation methods.\nBased on our early stage of development and other relevant factors, we appropriately used different valuation methods including a hybrid of the option\npricing method, or OPM, and guideline transactions Backsolve method, a hybrid of the OPM and guideline public company methods or a hybrid of OPM,\nBacksolve method, and Monte Carlo simulation to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock for valuations performed through March 31, 2022.\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our common stock, our Board of Directors also considered the fact that our stockholders could not freely trade our\ncommon stock in the public markets. Accordingly, we applied discounts to reflect the lack of marketability of our common stock based on the weighted-\naverage expected time to liquidity.\nOur Board of Directors and management develop best estimates based on the application of these approaches and the assumptions underlying these\nvaluations, giving careful consideration to the advice from our third-party valuation expert. Such estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application\nof significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our equity-based\ncompensation expense could be materially different.\nValuation of Preferred Stock Tranche Liability\nOur Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock included an obligation whereby the investors agreed to buy, and the Company agreed to sell,\nadditional shares at a fixed price if certain agreed-upon milestones were achieved or at the election of investors. This obligation was determined to be a\nfreestanding financial instrument that should be accounted for as a liability at fair value, and until settlement, the preferred stock tranche liability was revalued\nat each reporting period with changes in the fair value recorded in earnings. Upon achieving specific milestones, and obtaining Board and stockholder\napproval, the tranches were called and settled on May 14, 2021. The liability was then extinguished and the fair value was reclassified to redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock.\nHistorically, we utilized the Monte Carlo valuation model and/or Black-Scholes option pricing model which incorporated assumptions and estimates, to\nvalue the preferred stock tranche feature prior to its settlement. Significant estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement included the\nestimated fair value per share of the underlying Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock, risk-free rate, expected dividend yield, time to liquidity,\nexpected volatility of the price of the underlying preferred stock and determining the type of option (call option and/or forward contract) and associated\nprobabilities. The most significant assumptions impacting the fair value of the preferred stock tranche feature included the estimated fair value of our Series B\nredeemable convertible preferred stock, the estimated probability of and time to liquidity for going public and staying-private, and the determination of the\ntype of option (call option and/or forward contract) and associated probability.\nHistorically, we determined the estimated fair value per share of the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock by taking into consideration the\nmost recent sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock as well as additional factors that we deemed relevant. We assessed these assumptions and\nestimates on a quarterly basis as additional information impacting the assumptions became available. The risk-free rate was determined by reference to the\nU.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the preferred stock tranche feature. We estimated a 0% dividend yield\nbased on the expected dividend yield and the fact that we\n141"

We estimated the time to liquidity by weighting potential timelines associated with reaching various pipeline\nmilestones and completing an initial public offering. Historically, we have been a private company and lack company-specific and implied volatility\ninformation of our stock. Therefore, we estimated our expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies\nin the biotechnology industry for the expected terms. The determination of the type of option is based on the payouts available to the holders of the tranche\nrights and the level of control the investors had over-exercising these rights.\nThese estimates involved inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we\nused significantly different assumptions or estimates, our preferred stock tranche liability could be materially different.\nRevenue from Contracts\nWe recognize revenue from contracts when our customer obtains control of the promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration\nwhich we have received or expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nOur revenues are primarily derived through our collaborative research, development and license agreements. The terms of these types of agreements may\ninclude (i) research and development services, (ii) licenses for our technology or programs, and (iii) services or obligations in connection with participation in\nresearch or steering committees. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: nonrefundable upfront and license\nfees, research funding, milestone and other contingent payments for the achievement of defined research, development and commercial-based events, as well\nas royalties on sales of any commercialized products. We assess whether the promises in its arrangements with customers are considered distinct performance\nobligations that should be accounted for separately. Judgment may be required to determine whether the research and development services are distinct from\nthe license to our intellectual property or participation on steering committees.\nArrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer’s discretion are generally considered options. If these\noptions provide a material right to the customer, they are considered performance obligations. The identification of material rights requires judgments related\nto the determination of the value of the underlying license relative to the option exercise price, including assumptions about the technical feasibility and the\nprobability of developing a candidate that would be subject to the option rights.\nThe transaction price in each arrangement is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) of each distinct performance obligation,\nwhich requires judgment. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when a license or service is not sold separately, SSP is determined using\ninformation that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. Due to the early stage of our licensed technology, the license of such technology\nis typically combined with research and development services and steering committee participation as one performance obligation. Changes in the key\nassumptions used to determine the SSP could have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple performance\nobligations.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS”) Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition to comply with\nnew or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company is an\n“emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, and has elected to not take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition\nperiod.\nWe expect to remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing\nof the Dynamics Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) (which occurred on May 25, 2021), (b) in which we have total annual revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c)\nin which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million\nas of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter and our net sales for the year exceed\n142"

In\nour opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in\nNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations, and has an accumulated\ndeficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these\nconsolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 22, 2023\n145"

Senti has built a synthetic biology platform that enables it\nto program next-generation cell and gene therapies with what the Company refers to as “gene circuits.” These gene circuits, which are created from novel and\nproprietary combinations of DNA sequences, reprogram cells with biological logic to sense inputs, compute decisions and respond to their cellular\nenvironments. The Company is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.\nOn June 8, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), Dynamics Special Purpose Acquisition Corp. (“Dynamics” or “DYNS”) consummated a merger pursuant to which\nExplore Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Dynamics, merged with and into Senti Sub I, Inc.,\nformerly named Senti Biosciences, Inc. (“Legacy Senti”), with Legacy Senti surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dynamics (such transactions, the\n“Merger,” and, collectively with the other transactions described in the merger agreement (as defined below, the “Reverse Recapitalization”)). As a result of\nthe Merger, Dynamics was renamed Senti Biosciences, Inc.\nRefer to Note 3, Reverse Recapitalization, for further details of the Merger.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) assuming the\nCompany will continue as a going concern. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal\ncourse of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities, and\nreported expenses that may be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to organizing and staffing, business planning, raising capital, and conducting preclinical studies\nand has not realized substantial revenues from its planned principal operations. To date, the Company raised aggregate gross proceeds of $298.8 million from\nthe Merger and PIPE Financing, the issuance of shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, the issuance of convertible notes and, to a less extent,\nthrough collaboration agreements and governmental grants.\nAt December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $173.3 million and $115.1 million, respectively. The\nCompany’s net losses were $58.2 million and $55.3 million for the years months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Substantially all of the\nCompany’s net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with the Company’s research and development programs and from general and administrative\ncosts associated with the Company’s operations. The Company expects to incur substantial operating losses and negative cash flows from operations for the\nforeseeable future as the Company advances its preclinical activities and clinical trials for its product candidates in development.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $98.6 million and $56.0 million. As of\nMarch 22, 2023, the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, there is uncertainty about whether\nthe Company’s combined cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund operations, including clinical trial expenses and capital\nexpenditure requirements, beyond twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements and therefore the Company concluded that substantial\ndoubt existed about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company’s continued existence is dependent upon management’s ability to raise capital and develop profitable operations. Management is devoting\nsubstantially all of its efforts to developing its business and raising capital and there can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts will be successful. No\nassurance can be given that management’s actions will result in profitable operations or the meeting of ongoing liquidity needs.\n151"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nSENTI BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States\nof America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Any reference in these notes to applicable\nguidance is meant to refer to the authoritative U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and as amended by Accounting\nStandards Updates (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Senti\nBiosciences, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company has\none business activity and operate in one reportable segment.\nUnless otherwise noted, the Company has retroactively adjusted all common and preferred share and related price information to give effect to the\nexchange ratio established in the Merger Agreement.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but\nare not limited to, the accrual for research and development expenses, the valuation of contingent earnout, the valuation of convertible notes, the valuation of\ncommon and redeemable convertible preferred stock, the valuation of preferred stock tranche liability, the valuation of stock-based compensation expense,\nstandalone selling price (“SSP”) and the determination of the incremental borrowing rate. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an\nongoing basis using historical experience and other factors and adjusts those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a significant concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term\ninvestments that are maintained in checking and money market accounts at one financial institution, which at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The\nCompany’s short-term investments, if any, are limited to certain types of debt securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, and institutions with\ninvestment-grade credit ratings, and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company\nhas not experienced any credit losses in such accounts or investments.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash equivalents consist of amounts deposited in money market funds and securities with original maturity dates of three months or less, which are stated\nat fair value.\nThe Company’s restricted cash consists of cash deposited with a financial institution as collateral for a letter of credit required under the Company’s\nheadquarters and research facility leases as well as employee contributions collected under employee stock purchase plan. The restricted cash is presented\nseparately from cash and cash equivalents and classified as non-current on the consolidated balance sheets, as the Company expects the cash to remain\nrestricted for a period greater than one year.\n152"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nSENTI BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that total to\nthe amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the Company:\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n57,621  $\n56,034 \nRestricted cash\n3,366 \n3,257 \nTotal\n$\n60,987  $\n59,291 \nShort-term Investments\nInvestments in marketable securities with original maturities less than 12 months from the balance sheet date, if any, are classified as short-term\ninvestments. Investments with original maturities of greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date, if any, are classified as long-term. The Company\nclassifies all of its investments as available-for-sale and records such assets at estimated fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, with unrealized gains\nand losses, if any, reported as a component of other comprehensive loss within the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, and as a\nseparate component of stockholders’ equity. These investments consist of corporate debt securities, U.S. Government securities, asset-based securities, and\ncommercial paper, which are subject to minimal credit and market risk. The Company uses the specific identification method to determine the amount of\nrealized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities and declines in the fair value of securities judged to\nbe other than temporary are included in other income or expense. Unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive loss. Interest on available-\nfor-sale securities is included in interest income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain assets and liabilities of the Company are carried at fair value under U.S. GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received\nfor an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs\nand minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure\nof fair value measurements as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 – Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices), such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices\nin markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable\nmarket data.\n•\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or\nliabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, and similar techniques.\nTo the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value\nrequires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in\nLevel 3. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe estimated fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade, and other receivables and accounts payable approximate\ntheir carrying values given their short-term nature.\nThe Company’s preferred stock tranche liability were carried at fair value from the date of issuance through their extinguishment in May 2021, and were\ndetermined using Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy described above.\n153"

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, which are as follows:\nSmall equipment\n2 years\nComputer equipment and software\n3 years\nLaboratory equipment\n5-7 years\nFurniture and fixtures\n5-7 years\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of the lease term and the useful life\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs incurred during the construction phase of a project or asset into construction-in-progress. Once the construction is\ncomplete and the asset is placed into service, the Company transfers its carrying value into the appropriate fixed asset category and begins depreciating the\nvalue over its useful life.\nWhen assets are retired or disposed of, any resulting gain or loss is included in net loss. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as\nincurred.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, net, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthat the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing their carrying value to the future net\nundiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic life. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the amount of any\nimpairment is measured as the difference between their carrying value and their fair value. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, the Company\namortizes the remaining carrying value over the revised shorter useful life.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets with\nright-of-use assets (“ROU”) representing the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities representing the Company’s\nobligation to make lease payments. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of\nlease payments over the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets also include the effect of any lease payments made prior to or on lease commencement and\nexcludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred, as applicable. As the implicit rate in the Company’s leases is typically unknown, the Company uses\nits incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments.\nThe Company gives consideration to its credit risk, the term of the lease, and total lease payments and adjusts for the impacts of collateral as necessary when\ncalculating its incremental borrowing rates. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the\nCompany will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments are recorded as\nan expense in the period incurred.\nThe Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for any leases within its existing classes of assets and, as a result, accounts for\nany lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Company has also elected not to apply the recognition requirement for leases with a\nterm of 12 months or less.\nRevenue Recognition\nContract Revenue\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The Company applies the following five steps to recognize\nrevenue: (i) identify the contract with a customer; (ii) identify the performance\n154"

A product or a service is distinct if both\n(i) the customer can benefit from the product or the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and (ii)\nthe Company’s promise to transfer the product or the service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Each distinct\npromise to transfer a product or a service is a unit of accounting for revenue recognition. If a promise to transfer a product or a service is not distinct from\nother promises in the contract, such promises should be combined into a single performance obligation. The assessment of each of these elements may require\nsignificant judgments.\nArrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer’s discretion are generally considered options. If these\noptions provide a material right to the customer, they are considered performance obligations. The identification of material rights requires judgments related\nto the determination of the value of the underlying license relative to the option exercise price, including assumptions about technical feasibility and the\nprobability of developing a candidate that would be subject to the option rights.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for the transfer of control of a product or a service to a\ncustomer. The Company’s agreements may include both fixed and variable consideration. Fixed payments are included in the transaction price, while variable\nconsideration, such as milestone payments and fees for research services, are estimated and constrained (if required) at the inception of the contract and\nevaluated on a periodic basis thereafter.\nIf a contract has multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the\nrelative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) of the performance obligation. The Company determines SSP at contract inception and at contract modification.\nDetermining the SSP for performance obligations requires significant judgment. Changes in the key assumptions used to determine the SSP could have a\nsignificant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple performance obligations.\nFor each distinct performance obligation, revenue is recognized as the Company transfers control of the product or the service applicable to such\nperformance obligations. In instances where the Company first receives consideration in advance of satisfying its performance obligation, the Company\nclassifies such consideration as deferred revenue until the Company satisfies such performance obligations. In instances where the Company first satisfies its\nperformance obligation prior to its receipt of consideration, the consideration is a contract asset recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nGrant Income\nThe Company receives government grants that reimburses the Company for certain allowable costs for funded projects. Grant income is recognized on a\nsystematic basis over the period in which the Company recognizes qualified research and development costs that grant is intended to compensate and there is\nreasonable assurance that the Company will meet the terms and conditions of the grant. This income is recorded as grant income in the consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nGrant payments received in excess of grant revenue earned are recognized as deferred revenue on the balance sheets, and grant income earned in excess\nof grant payments received is recognized as trade and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of salaries and other personnel-related expenses,\nincluding associated stock-based compensation expense, lab supplies and services, in-license and technology costs, consulting and sponsored research fees,\nfacility costs and depreciation expense.\n155"

The upfront payments to\nacquire a license, product, or rights, as well as any annual maintenance charges and future milestone payments, are immediately recognized as research and\ndevelopment expense provided that there is no alternative future use of the rights in other research and development projects.\nDeferred Offering Costs\nDeferred offering costs consists of incremental legal, accounting and other fees directly attributable to equity offerings. Deferred offering costs are\ncapitalized within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are offset against proceeds of the offering in the\nconsolidated statements of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity as a reduction of additional paid-in capital upon the completion of\nthe equity offering. In the event the equity offering is terminated, all of the deferred offering costs are expensed within the Company’s consolidated statements\nof operations and comprehensive loss. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company expensed zero and $2.2 million, respectively, of\npreviously deferred offering costs related to the suspended Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) within general and administrative expense on the consolidated\nstatement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded zero and $1.4 million, respectively, of deferred\noffering costs related to the SPAC merger. The amount was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company recognizes a liability with regard to loss contingencies when it believes it is probable a liability has occurred and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If some amount within a range of loss appears at the time to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the Company\naccrues that amount. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company accrues the minimum amount in the range.\nThe Company has not recorded any such liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nAccretion and Classification of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\nThe Company's redeemable convertible preferred stock was recorded based on proceeds received, net of the related preferred stock tranche liability and\nissuance costs, and is classified outside of stockholders' equity on the consolidated balance sheets because the holders of such shares have liquidation rights in\nthe event of a deemed liquidation that, in certain situations, are not solely within the control of the Company and would require the redemption of the then-\noutstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock. The Company's Series A and Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock were subject to liquidation,\ndissolution, or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary. Refer to Note 8, Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit), for further details.\nPreferred Stock Tranche Liability\nThe Company’s Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock included an obligation whereby the investors agreed to buy, and the Company agreed to\nsell additional shares at a fixed price in the event that certain agreed-upon milestones were achieved or at the election of investors. This obligation was\ndetermined to be a freestanding financial instrument that should be accounted for as a liability at fair value (Note 4). This preferred stock tranche liability was\nrevalued at each reporting period through settlement with changes in the fair value recorded as a change in preferred stock tranche liability in the consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss. The fair value at settlement was reclassified to redeemable convertible preferred stock at such time.\nContingent Earnout Equity\nIn connection with the Reverse Recapitalization and pursuant to the Merger dated as of June 8, 2022 by and among the Merger Sub and Legacy Senti,\nformer holder of the Legacy Senti common stock and Legacy Senti preferred stock are entitled to receive as additional consideration of up to 2,000,000 shares\nof the Company’s\n156"

The Contingent Earnout Shares are a form of dividend for holders of\nLegacy Senti common stock and Legacy Senti preferred stock. If there is a change of control within the three-year period following the closing of the Merger\nthat results in a per share price equal to or in excess of certain share price milestones not previously met, then the Company shall issue the earnout shares to\nthe holders of Legacy Senti common stock and preferred stock. In accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging, as certain terms of the contingent\nearnout shares were not indexed to the common stock, equity treatment is precluded and liability classification is required at the Reverse Recapitalization date\nand subsequently remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded as Change in fair value of contingent earnout liability in the\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. A portion of the earnout shares were granted to holders of Legacy Senti common stock that are\nsubject to repurchase, and as of the date of the Merger were accounted for as stock-based compensation expense and expensed as there was no remaining\nservice period.\nThe estimated fair value of the Contingent Earnout Shares was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation using a distribution of potential outcomes on a\nmonthly basis over a three-year period prioritizing the most reliable information available. The assumptions utilized in the calculation were based on the\nachievement of certain stock price milestones, including the current Company common stock price, expected volatility, risk-free rate, expected term and\nexpected dividend yield.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to employees and non-employees based on the grant date fair value of the awards.\nFor awards that vest solely based on continued service, stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations using the\nstraight-line method. For performance and market awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period using the\naccelerated attribution method. No compensation expense will be recognized for awards subject to performance conditions until it is probable that the\nperformance condition will be met.\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to purchase rights issued pursuant to its employee stock purchase plan on a straight-\nline basis over the offering period.\nThe Company has allowed specified option holders to exercise unvested options. The options that are exercised prior to vesting continue to vest according\nto the respective option agreement, and such unvested shares are subject to repurchase by the Company at the option holder’s original exercise price in the\nevent the option holder's service with the Company voluntarily or involuntarily terminates.\nThe Company records proceeds from the early exercise of options as a current and long-term liability in the consolidated balance sheets, and reclassifies\nthis liability to additional paid-in capital as the Company's repurchase right lapses. The shares purchased by the option holders pursuant to the early exercise\nof stock options are not deemed, for accounting purposes, to be outstanding until those shares have vested.\nNet Loss Per Share\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per share as the Company has issued shares that meet the definition of participating\nsecurities. The two-class method determines net loss per share for each class of common and participating securities according to dividends declared or\naccumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires loss available to common stockholders for the period to be\nallocated between common and participating securities based upon their respective rights to share in undistributed earnings as if all loss for the period had\nbeen distributed.\nBasic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by adjusting net\nloss attributable to common stockholders for an allocation of the undistributed earnings and dividing it by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares. For purposes of this\n157"

Accordingly, in periods in which the Company reports a net loss, such losses are not\nallocated to such participating securities. In periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to common stockholders, diluted net loss per share\nattributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, since dilutive common shares are not\nassumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the\nexpected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax\nrates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is\nrecognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making\nsuch a determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences,\nprojected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If management determines that the Company would be able to realize\nits deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, management would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation\nallowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (i) management determines whether it is more likely than not\nthat the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not\nrecognition threshold, management recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with\nthe related tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. Any accrued interest\nand penalties are included within the related tax liability. To date, there have been no interest charges or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business\nEntities about Government Assistance, which requires business entities to provide certain disclosures when they have received government assistance and use\na grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other accounting guidance. The ASU was effective January 1, 2022, and had no material impact on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04 Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 370-50),\nCompensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40); Issuer’s Accounting for\nCertain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force), which\nclarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options that remain equity\nclassified after modification or exchange. The ASU was effective January 1, 2022, and had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—\nContracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting\n158"

At the effective time of the Merger:\n•\neach outstanding share of Legacy Senti common stock was converted into approximately 0.1957 shares of the Company’s common stock;\n•\neach outstanding share of preferred stock of Legacy Senti was cancelled and converted into the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock that would be issued upon conversion of the shares of Legacy Senti preferred stock based on the applicable conversion ratio\nimmediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by approximately 0.1957;\n•\neach outstanding option to purchase Legacy Senti common stock was converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock equal to the number of shares of Legacy Senti common stock subject to such option multiplied by approximately 0.1957, rounded\ndown to the nearest whole share, at an exercise price per share equal to the current exercise price per share for such option divided by approximately\n0.1957, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; and\n•\nall shares of Dynamics Class A common stock were redesignated as common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company.\nFormer holders of the Legacy Senti common stock and preferred stock are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of 2,000,000 additional shares of the\nCompany’s common stock in the aggregate in two equal tranches of 1,000,000 shares if the volume-weighted average closing sale price of the common stock\nis greater than or equal to $15.00 and $20.00, respectively, for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading day period. The first and second tranche\nterm is two and three years, respectively, from the closing of the Merger. If there is a change of control within the three-year period following the closing of\nthe Merger that results in a per share price equal to or in excess of the $15.00 and $20.00 share price milestones not previously met, then the Company shall\nissue the earnout shares to the holders of Legacy Senti common stock and preferred stock. Refer to Note 8, Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit), for further details of\nthe contingent earnout liability.\nIn association with the Merger, Dynamics entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors (the “PIPE\nInvestors”), including S. Peter Lee, the father of Senti’s Chief Technology Officer. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, the PIPE Investors purchased an\naggregate of 5,060,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “PIPE Shares”) in a private placement at a price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate\npurchase price of $50.6 million (the “PIPE Financing”). The PIPE Financing was consummated in connection with the Merger.\nConcurrently with the closing of the Merger, the unsecured convertible promissory note (the “May 2022 Note”) in the principal amount of $5.2 million\nthat was previously issued by Legacy Senti to Bayer Healthcare LLC\n159"

Under this method of accounting, Dynamics was treated as the\nacquired company for financial reporting purposes and Legacy Senti was treated as the acquiror. This determination was primarily based on the fact that\nsubsequent to the Merger, the Legacy Senti stockholders hold a majority of the voting rights of the combined company, Legacy Senti comprises all of the\nongoing operations of the combined company, Legacy Senti comprises a majority of the carryover governing body of the combined company, and Legacy\nSenti’s senior management comprises all of the senior management of the combined company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger was treated\nas the equivalent of Legacy Senti issuing shares for the net assets of Dynamics, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Dynamics were stated at\nhistorical costs. No goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded. Operations prior to the Merger are those of Legacy Senti.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company raised $140.7 million in proceeds from the Merger and related PIPE Financing, including the Bayer\nconvertible note cancellation and exchange. Transaction costs totaling $23.5 million consisting of banking, legal, and other professional fees were deducted\nfrom the funds raised, of which $4.8 million was incurred by the Company and the remainder by Dynamics. In addition, there were no unpaid transaction costs\nincluded in accounts payable and accrued expenses as of December 31, 2022.\n160"

The Alameda lease provides for a tenant improvement allowance of up to $17.5 million for the costs relating to\nthe design, permitting and construction of the improvements, to be disbursed by the landlord no later than December 31, 2023. The Company is deemed to be\nthe accounting owner of the tenant improvements primarily because the Company is the principal in the construction and design of the assets, is responsible\nfor costs overruns and retains substantially all economic benefits from the leasehold improvements over their economic lives. Accordingly, the tenant\nimprovement allowance is considered an incentive and was deducted from the initial measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability.

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, in its sole\ndiscretion, to sell to Chardan up to the lesser of (i) $50.0 million of newly issued shares of the Company’s common stock, and (ii) the Exchange Cap (as\ndefined below) (subject to certain conditions and limitations), from time to time during the 36-month term of the Purchase Agreement. Under the applicable\nNASDAQ rules, the Company may not issue to Chardan under the Purchase Agreement more than 8,727,049 shares of common stock, which number of\nshares is equal to 19.99% of the common shares outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement unless certain exceptions are met\n(the “Exchange Cap”).

However, the total shares to be purchased on any day may\nnot exceed 20% of the trading volume, and the total purchase price on any day may not exceed $3.0 million. As consideration for Chardan’s commitment to\npurchase shares of common stock at the Company’s direction upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company\nissued 100,000 shares of its common stock to Chardan and paid a $0.4 million document preparation fee, upon execution of the Purchase Agreement. The\nCompany recognized an expense of $0.7 million within general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and\nComprehensive Loss for the Chardan related costs and legal fees incurred in connection with the agreement.\nOther than the issuance of the commitment shares of the Company’s common stock to Chardan, the Company issued 300,000 Class A common stock as\nof December 31, 2022 aggregating to net proceeds of $0.7 million under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement.\nContingent Earnout Equity\nFollowing the closing of the Merger, former holders of Legacy Senti common stock and preferred stock may receive up to 2,000,000 additional shares of\nthe Company’s common stock in the aggregate, in two equal tranches of 1,000,000 shares of common stock per tranche. The first and second tranches are\nissuable if the closing volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) per share of common stock quoted on the Nasdaq (or the exchange on which the shares of\ncommon stock are then listed) is greater or equal to $15.00 and $20.00, respectively over any twenty trading days within any thirty-day trading period. The\nfirst and second tranche term is two and three years, respectively, from the closing of the Merger.

Of this amount, $9.7 million was accounted for as a Contingent Earnout Liability because the triggering events that determine the number of\nContingent Earnout Shares required to be issued include events that are not solely indexed to the common stock of the Company.

Revenue\nThe Company’s revenue consists of amounts received related to research services provided to customers.\nContract Revenue\nIn May 2019, the Company entered into a collaborative development agreement. The Company determined that the agreement contained three distinct\npromises; research and development, design services, and intellectual property, which will be accounted for as a single combined performance obligation of\nresearch and development services recognized over time. The development agreement included $0.3 million of fixed consideration allocated to a single\nperformance obligation and an additional $0.3 million of variable consideration. At the inception of the development agreement, it was not probable that a\nsignificant reversal of revenue would not occur and therefore the variable consideration was fully constrained. Throughout the development agreement period,\nseveral parameters of the research and development services were changed, which increased the uncertainty of achieving the remaining performance\nobligations. Therefore, in December 2021, the contract asset of $0.3 million was reversed due to this increased uncertainty.\nIn April 2021, the Company entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Spark Therapeutics, Inc. (“Spark”). Under the agreement,\nthe Company will be responsible for a research program, which includes designing, building and testing five cell type specific-synthetic promoters for use in\ndeveloping certain gene therapies using the Company’s proprietary technology. The Company received an upfront payment from Spark of $3.0 million and\nSpark is obligated to reimburse the Company for costs and expenses incurred for the research program. The Company expected to complete the research\nprogram over a two-year period. In December 2022, the Company amended the research collaboration and license agreement to allow for an increase in\nbudget and a two-month extension of the research program. As there were no changes to performance obligations and the services to be provided are not\ndistinct from those already transferred, the transactions was accounted for as a contract modification and a cumulative catch-up of $(0.7) million was\nrecognized in December 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there is a total of $0.8 million remaining of the upfront payment to be recognized over the remaining\nperiod of the research program.\nThe Company assessed this agreement in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue Recognition (“ASC 606”) and concluded that the contract counterparty,\nSpark, is a customer. The Company identified only one combined performance obligation in the agreement, which is to perform research services, the related\njoint research plan and committees for the five specified promoters. The Company determined that the research activities for each of the five promoters are not\ndistinct given there is one single research plan that is performed by the same research team and research results for one promoter may provide insights for\nother promoters.\nPursuant to the agreement, once the research program is completed and the Company delivers a data package to Spark, Spark has 24 months (the\n“Evaluation Period”) to determine whether Spark will exercise its options to obtain field-limited, royalty-bearing licenses to develop, manufacture and\ncommercialize promoters corresponding to each of the five specified promoters being researched. For each licensed promoter option that is exercised, the\nCompany\n169"

Spark may generally\nterminate the agreement upon 90 days prior written notice or 180 days prior written notice if the licensed promoter is in clinical trials or is being\ncommercialized at the time of termination.\nThe Company evaluated Spark’s optional rights to license, develop, manufacture and commercialize each of the promoter profiles to determine whether\nthey provide Spark with any material rights to purchase the promoter licenses at an incremental discount. The Company’s proprietary technology used to\ndevelop the promoters is in the early stages of development, so technological feasibility and probability of developing a product is highly uncertain. As a\nresult, determining the SSP for the optional rights is subject to significant judgment. Given the subjectivity associated with determining the SSP for the right\nto a future license related to unproven technology at contract inception, the Company also evaluated whether the contract consideration associated with the\nresearch services represents the SSP for those services. The Company determined the transaction price, inclusive of the upfront payment and reimbursement of\ncosts and expenses incurred for the research program, is commensurate with SSP for the research being conducted given the specialized nature and reliance on\nproprietary technology. Based on the Company’s assessment of the optional consideration and the qualitative factors of feasibility and probability of\ndevelopment combined with the quantitative assessment that research services are priced at their SSP, the Company concluded that the license option does not\nprovide Spark with an incremental discount and therefore does not constitute a material right. The transaction price associated with the research services in\nthis agreement consists of the fixed upfront amount of $3.0 million and variable consideration.\nFor both collaboration agreements, the Company will recognize the transaction price as research and development services are provided, using a cost-\nbased input method to measure the progress toward completion of its performance obligation and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue to\nrecognize each period. The Company believes that the cost-based input method is the best measure of progress because other measurements would not reflect\nhow the Company transfers the control related to the performance obligation to our customers.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded revenue, which was previously included in the deferred revenue at the\nbeginning of each period, of $1.0 million and zero, respectively. Contract asset balances related to unbilled revenue for our collaboration agreements were\nzero as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and are presented within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nGrant Income\nIn 2021, the Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) awarded the Company a grant in the amount of $2.0 million over two years subject to meeting\ncertain terms and conditions. The purpose of the grant is to support the further development of SENTI-202 for acute myeloid leukemia towards clinical\ndevelopment.\nGrant income was recognized when qualified research and development costs were incurred and the Company obtained reasonable assurance that the\nterms and conditions of the grant were met.\nEntity-wide information\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, Customers A and B accounted for 77% and 23%, respectively, of revenue. During the years ended December\n31, 2021, when excluding the $0.3 million contract asset reversal for Customer C, Customers A and B accounted for 84% and 16%, respectively, of revenue.\nAll revenues were generated in the United States for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n10. Stock-Based Compensation\n2016 Stock Incentive Plan (as Amended and Restated)\nThe Company’s 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”) provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and restricted\nstock awards to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company.\nFollowing the Merger, the 2016 Plan was terminated. No additional stock awards will be granted under the 2016 Plan. All awards previously granted and\noutstanding as of the effective date of the Merger, were adjusted to reflect\n170"

The 2022 Plan provides for the grant of non-\nstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance awards and other forms of awards to\npersons not previously an employee of the Company and its affiliates.\nThe exercise price of an options granted under the 2022 Inducement Plan shall not be less than the fair market value of a common stock share on the date\nof grant.\nAwards granted under the 2022 Inducement Plan expire no later than ten years after the grant date.\nThe Company initially reserved 2,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2022 Inducement Plan.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the total number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2022 Inducement Plan is 1,379,691.\n2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nOn June 8, 2022, upon the Merger, the Company adopted a 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). The ESPP allows eligible employees to\npurchase shares of the Company's common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock on the first day of an offering or on\nthe date of purchase.

The board of directors determined the fair value of the common stock by considering a number of\nobjective and subjective factors, including: third-party valuations of the Company’s common stock, the valuation of comparable companies, the\nCompany’s operating and financial performance, and general and industry-specific economic outlook, amongst other factors. As of the closing of the\nMerger and going forward, the fair value of common stock will be based on the publicly traded market value.\nExpected Term — The expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock options are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the\nsimplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term). The expected term for the ESPP purchase rights\nis the length of the purchase period.\nVolatility — The expected volatility is based on the average historical volatility of comparable publicly-traded peer companies, over a period equal to the\nexpected term of the stock option grants, as the Company was not publicly traded prior to the Merger and does not have a trading history for its common\nstock for a sufficient period of time subsequent to the Merger.\nRisk-free Rate — The risk-free rate assumption is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding\nwith the expected term of the option.\nDividends — The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying dividends on common stock. Therefore, the\nCompany uses an expected dividend yield of zero.\nThe assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value of non-market based, stock options granted were as follows, presented on a weighted-average\nbasis:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\nExpected term (in years)\n5.8\n6.0\nExpected volatility\n78.8%\n82.3%\nRisk-free interest rate\n3.2%\n0.9%\nDividend yield\n—\n—\nThe assumptions used to determine the per-share fair value of shares to be granted under the ESPP were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\nFair value per share\n$0.85\n—\nFair value per share of Common Stock\n$1.63\n—\nExpected term (in years)\n1.3\n0\nExpected volatility\n88.2%\n—\nRisk-free interest rate\n3.8%\n—\nDividend yield\n—\n—\n174"

Pursuant to such agreements, the\nCompany may indemnify, hold harmless and defend an indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party. Some of the provisions will\nlimit losses to those arising from third-party actions. In some cases, the indemnification will continue after the termination of the agreement. The maximum\npotential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these provisions is not determinable. The Company has never incurred\nmaterial costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions and has never accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in\nits consolidated financial statements. The Company has also entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may require the\nCompany to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers to the fullest extent\npermitted by Delaware corporate law. The Company currently has directors’ and officers’ insurance.\n15. Related Parties\nPreferred Stockholders\nThe Company issued Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock and Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock in February 2018 and October\n2020, respectively, to certain related parties, including New Enterprise Associates 15, L.P. and its affiliates (“NEA”) and 8VC and its affiliates (“8VC”).\nIn February 2018, the outstanding convertible notes held by NEA and 8VC, as well as Dr. Timothy Lu, our Chief Executive Officer, converted into\nadditional shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock while in October 2020, the outstanding convertible notes held by NEA and 8VC\nconverted into additional shares of Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock, both in accordance with the terms of the note agreements.\nOn June 8, 2022, in conjunction with the Merger, each outstanding share of preferred stock of Legacy Senti was cancelled and converted into the aggregate\nnumber of shares of the Company’s common stock that would be issued upon conversion of the shares of Legacy Senti preferred stock based on the applicable\nconversion ratio immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share. As of December 31,\n2022, no shares of preferred stock remain outstanding.\nNEA\nNEA held 4,429,725 and zero shares of common stock as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. NEA held zero and 2,642,934\nshares of outstanding Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, as well as zero and\n536,791 shares of outstanding Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock, respectively. NEA held one of the seven seats on the Company’s Board of\nDirectors as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nBayer Healthcare LLC\nOn May 19, 2022, Legacy Senti issued to Bayer a $5.2 million unsecured convertible promissory note.

The Company is responsible for up to $10\nmillion in costs and expenses incurred in connection with the research plan and related activities to be conducted over a term of three years as specified in the\ncollaboration and option agreement. If the Company and BlueRock agree to add new research activities to the research plan, then BlueRock will be obligated\nto reimburse the Company for the costs and expenses incurred that, together with costs and expenses incurred under the initial research plan, exceed $10\nmillion.\nThe Company concluded that the Agreement is not within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, because the Company did not receive any\nconsideration and therefore, is not exposed to both significant risks and rewards for the arrangement. The Company also determined that the agreement is also\nnot currently within the scope of ASC 606 because the BlueRock Agreement does not currently meet the criteria of a contract with a customer, and will not be\nwithin the scope of ASC 606 until any consideration is paid. Potential future milestone payments and royalties are subject to BlueRock’s exercise of the\nBlueRock Option and execution of a commercial license agreement by both parties. Under the BlueRock Agreement, the specific financial terms for milestone\npayments and royalties will be negotiated and agreed to only after the option is exercised.\nAs of December 31, 2022, Bayer held 5,878,488 shares of the Company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2021, Bayer held 5,360,988 shares of\nSeries B redeemable convertible preferred stock and held one of the seven seats on the Board of Directors of Legacy Senti. Bayer’s parent company is Bayer\nAG, which served as the lead investor in our Series B financing through its Leaps by Bayer unit. Accordingly, Bayer is considered a related party.\n179"

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer and principal\naccounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) to determine whether such disclosure controls and procedures provide\nreasonable assurance that information to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and such information is accumulated and communicated to management,\nincluding our principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding\ndisclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures were developed through a process in which our management applied its judgment in assessing the costs and\nbenefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the control objectives. You should note that\nthe design of any system of disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon various assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot\nassure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.\nAs previously reported, in connection with our preparation and the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December\n31, 2021, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness, as defined under the Exchange Act and by the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States), in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness related to a lack of sufficient\nand adequate resources in the finance and accounting function that resulted in a lack of formalized risk assessment process, lack of segregation of duties, and\nineffective process level control activities over the management review of journal entries, account reconciliations and non-routine transactions. A material\nweakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nRemediation Efforts to Address the Material Weaknesses\nWe have taken a number of remediation actions during the year ended December 31, 2022, and are continuing with our efforts. Remediation actions taken\nduring the year and that continue include:\n•\nhiring personnel with appropriate levels of experience in accounting, technology, and internal controls;\n•\nengaging a professional accounting services firm to help us commence the documentation and assessment of our internal controls for complying with\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n•\nimplementing a risk assessment over financial reporting controls; and\n•\nimplementing new software tools.\nWhile significant progress has been made to enhance our internal control over financial reporting, we are still in the process of building and enhancing\nour processes, procedures, and controls. Additional time is required to complete the remediation of these material weaknesses and the assessment to ensure the\nsustainability of these remediation actions. We believe the above actions, when complete, will be effective in the remediation of the material weaknesses\ndescribed above. As such, we have not concluded that the material weaknesses have been fully remediated as of December 31, 2022, and therefore have\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022.\n180"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-\n15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nHowever, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors\nand all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the\ncontrol system are met. Furthermore, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be\nfaulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons,\nby collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential\nfuture conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAs disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed the Merger on June 8, 2022. Prior to the Merger, Dynamics, our predecessor,\nwas a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,\nrecapitalization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. As a result, previously existing internal controls are no longer applicable or\ncomprehensive enough as of the assessment date, because Dynamics’s operations prior to the Merger were insignificant compared to those of the consolidated\nentity post-Merger. As a result, management was unable, without incurring unreasonable effort or expense, to complete an assessment of our internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Accordingly, we are excluding management’s report on internal control over financial reporting pursuant to\nSection 215.02 of the SEC Division of Corporate Finance’s Regulation S-K Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations.\nItem 9B.

(the “Company,” “Senti,” “we,” “us,” and\n“our”) as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Annual Report” or “Form 10-K”) as specified in our Second Amended and Restated\nCertification of Incorporation (the “Charter”) and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”). Because the following description is only a summary,\nit does not contain all the information that may be important to you. For a complete description of the matters set forth in this exhibit titled “Description of\nSecurities,” you should refer to the Charter, the Bylaws, the Investor Rights and Lock-up Agreement dated June 8, 2022, by and among us and the parties\nlisted therein as Investors (the “Investor Rights and Lock-Up Agreement”) and the Registration Rights Agreement dated August 31, 2022 between us and\nChardan Capital Markets, LLC (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), which are included as exhibits to this Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.3 is a part,\nand to the applicable provisions of Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”).\nAuthorized and Outstanding Stock\nThe Charter authorizes the issuance of 510,000,000 shares, consisting of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and 10,000,000\nshares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value.\nCommon Stock\nThe Charter provides the following with respect to the rights, powers, preferences and privileges of our common stock.\nVoting Power\nExcept as otherwise required by law or as otherwise provided in any certificate of designation for any series of preferred stock, the holders of our common\nstock possess all voting power for the election of the directors and all other matters requiring stockholder action. Holders of our common stock are entitled to\none vote per share on matters to be voted on by stockholders.\nDividends\nHolders of our common stock will be entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors in its discretion\nout of funds legally available therefor. We have not historically paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends\nin the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and\ngeneral financial conditions. In no event will any stock dividends or stock splits or combinations of stock be declared or made on our common stock unless\nour common stock at the time outstanding are treated equally and identically.\nLiquidation, Dissolution and Winding Up\nIn the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, our net assets will be distributed pro rata to the holders of our common\nstock, subject to the rights of the holders of the preferred stock, if any.\nPreemptive or Other Rights\nThere are no sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock.\nTransfer Rights\nSubject to applicable law and the transfer restrictions set forth in Article IV of the Bylaws, shares of our common stock and the rights and obligations\nassociated therewith are fully transferable to any transferee.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Charter provides that shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors will be authorized to fix\ndesignations, powers, including voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights\nof the shares of each series of preferred stock and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof. Our board of directors will be able to, without\nstockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of our\ncommon stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the\neffect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of Senti or the removal of existing management. We have no preferred stock currently\noutstanding."

The Investor Rights and Lock-up Agreement also restricts the ability of each stockholder who is a party thereto to transfer its shares of our common\nstock (or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our common stock), subject to certain permitted transfers, for a period of one year\nfollowing June 8, 2022 (the “Lock-Up Period”); provided that (i) the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to any shares of our common stock purchased\npursuant to the subscription agreements, and (ii) if the last reported sale price of the shares of our common stock on Nasdaq, or any other national securities\nexchange on which the shares of our common stock are then traded, is greater than or equal to $12.00 per share over any 20 trading days within any\nconsecutive 30 trading day period following June 8, 2022, then, commencing at least 150 days after June 8, 2022, the Lock-Up Period shall be deemed to have\nexpired with respect to each stockholder’s shares of our common stock subject to the Lock-Up Period. A copy of the Investor Rights and Lock-up Agreement\nis incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.3 forms a part.\nWe and Chardan Capital Markets LLC (“Chardan”) entered into the Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to file a\nregistration statement registering the resale by Chardan of shares our common stock issued to it by us pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement,\ndated August 31, 2022, by and between us and Chardan and to maintain the effectiveness of such resale registration statement. A copy of the Registration\nRights Agreement is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.3 forms a part.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nCharter and Bylaws\nAmong other things, the Charter and Bylaws (as amended from time to time):\n•\npermit our board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate,\nincluding the right to approve an acquisition or other change of control;\n•\nprovide that our number of directors may be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n•\nprovide that, subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock to elect directors, directors may be removed only with cause by the holders of at\nleast 75% of all of our then-outstanding shares of the capital stock entitled to vote generally at an election of directors;\n•\nprovide that all vacancies, subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise\nrequired by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n•\nprovide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a\nmeeting of stockholders must provide advance notice in writing, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s notice;\n•\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the board;\n•\nprovide that our board of directors will be divided into three classes of directors, with the directors serving three-year terms, therefore making it more\ndifficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors; and\n•\nnot provide for cumulative voting rights, therefore allowing the holders of a majority of our common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors\nto elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose."

      "text": "Our Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new\nbusiness to be brought before meetings of our stockholders. These procedures provide that notice of stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to\nour corporate secretary prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received at our principal executive\noffices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year. Our Bylaws specify the\nrequirements as to form and content of all stockholders’ notices. These requirements may preclude stockholders from bringing matters before the stockholders\nat an annual or special meeting.\nThe combination of these provisions make it more difficult for the existing stockholders to replace our board of directors as well as for another party to obtain\ncontrol of us by replacing our board of directors. Because our board of directors will have the power to retain and discharge its officers, these provisions could\nalso make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management. In addition, the authorization of undesignated\npreferred stock will make it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success\nof any attempt to change the control of Senti.\nThese provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of our board of directors and its policies and to discourage\ncoercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to reduce our vulnerability to hostile takeovers and to discourage\ncertain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our\nshares and may have the effect of delaying changes in our control or management. As a consequence, these provisions may also inhibit fluctuations in the\nmarket price of our stock.\nCertain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. This statute prevents certain Delaware corporations, under certain circumstances, from engaging\nin a “business combination” with:\n•\na stockholder who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock (otherwise known as an “interested stockholder”);\n•\nan affiliate of an interested stockholder; or\n•\nan associate of an interested stockholder, for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.\nA “business combination” includes a merger or sale of more than 10% of a corporation’s assets. However, the above provisions of Section 203 would not\napply if:\n•\nthe relevant board of directors approves the transaction that made the stockholder an “interested stockholder,” prior to the date of the transaction;\n•\nafter the completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, that stockholder owned at least 85% of the\ncorporation’s voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, other than statutorily excluded shares of common stock; or\n•\non or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the initial business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a meeting of\nthe corporation’s stockholders, and not by written consent, by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by\nthe interested stockholder.\nThese provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing changes in control."

Such personality thus encumbered includes\nspecifically all trade and other fixtures for the purpose of this Section 20 and inventory, equipment, contract rights, accounts\nreceivable and the proceeds thereof. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Landlord may, in addition to all other remedies,\nwithout notice or demand except as provided below, exercise the rights afforded to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial\nCode of the state in which the Premises are located (the “UCC”). To the extent the UCC requires Landlord to give to Tenant notice\nof any act or event and such notice cannot be validly waived before a default occurs, then five (5) days’ prior written notice thereof\nshall be reasonable notice of the act or event. In order to perfect such security interest, Landlord may file any financing statement or\nother instrument necessary at Tenant’s expense at the state and county Uniform Commercial Code filing offices.

Landlord may\nalso file a copy of this Lease as a financing statement to perfect its security interest in the Collateral. Within ten (10) days following\nwritten request therefor, Tenant shall execute financing statements to be filed of record to perfect Landlord’s security interest in the\nCollateral.
