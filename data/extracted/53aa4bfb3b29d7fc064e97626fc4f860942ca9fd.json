      "text": "Starvest plc \n2022 Annual Report and Financial Statements \n2 \n \n \n \nChairman’s Statement \n \nI am pleased to present my annual statement to Shareholders for the year ended 30 September 2022 and the \ntwenty-second since the Company was formed in 2000.  \n \nResults for the year \nThe continuing impact of the global pandemic and the ongoing war in Eastern Europe and its effect on energy \nsupplies have dominated the financial news this year for Starvest and its portfolio companies. Starvest’s strategy \nto steer its portfolio toward precious metal investments in recent years has enabled the Company to position itself \nattractively for the current environment. Although improved investor sentiment boosted certain precious metal \nstocks and those of certain other natural resource companies, gold prices declined 5.5% for the year ended 30 \nSeptember 2022. The post-pandemic global economy and interest rate hikes, particularly in the US, have kept \nprices flat recently but we continue to believe that there is a solid foundation for precious metals going forward.   \n \nOur investment portfolio decreased approximately 56% in the year to 30 September 2022 to £6 million. However, \nthe discount to net asset value narrowed by 5 percentage points, from 34% to 29% as at 30 September 2022, \nwhich is a significant improvement for shareholders.  \n \nGreatland Gold plc (AIM:GGP) remains our primary investment, with its Havieron gold-copper discovery in \nAustralia. Havieron’s initial inferred resource increased from 4.2M oz gold equivalent* to 6.5M oz gold equivalent** \nduring the year. The company secured funding through to production, expanded its board, and delivered \noperational and financial improvements. While the share price has decreased over the last year, this is not \nuncommon for a company in pre-production and we continue to see potential gains here.  \n \nAriana Resources continues to expand its exploration and development footprint in Europe. As the Kiziltepe mine \nhas continued to meet production expectations, Ariana has focused on other projects in Turkey, such as Tavsan, \nwhich is scheduled for first production in H2 2023. The alliance with Newmont, via its West Tethyan holding, allows \nconsiderable scope to explore southeastern Europe over the next five years, and the recently acquired Kosovo \nlicence shows an interesting start to this US$2.5m agreement. Together with the Asgard Metals Fund, Ariana’s \nexploration and development projects have expanded considerably since the company’s founding twenty years \nago.  \n \nCora Gold continued to de-risk its Sanankoro project as it completed further drilling and increased its mineral \nresource estimate by 14% while completing a feasibility study. After year-end the company announced that it had \nreceived the Environmental Permit required for the project, a significant step forward.  \n \nWe believe that the long-term outlook for gold prices remains favourable and we remain committed to our \nstrategy. \n \n* GGP RNS dated 10 December 2020    ** GGP RNS dated 3 March 2022 \n \nInvesting policy \nThe Company’s investing policy is set forth on page 3 of this report and made available on our website, \nwww.starvest.co.uk.  \n \nTrading portfolio valuation \nA brief review of the major portfolio companies follows from page 6.

      "text": "Starvest plc \n2022 Annual Report and Financial Statements \n3 \n \n \n \nInvesting policy statement \n \nAbout us \nThe previous Board commenced to manage the Company as an investment company in January 2002, largely \ninvesting in the natural resources sector. Following the appointment of Callum Baxter as Chairman in 2015, the \nBoard continued to focus the Company’s investment strategy on the natural resources sector. \nCollectively, the current Board has significant experience investing in small-capitalisation new issues and pre-IPO \nopportunities in the natural resources and mineral exploration sectors. \n \nCompany objective \nThe Company was established as a source of early-stage finance to fledgling businesses to maximise the capital \nvalue of the Company and to generate benefits for Shareholders in the form of capital growth and modest \ndividends. \n \nInvesting strategy  \nNatural resources:  Whilst the Company’s investment mandate is not exclusively limited to natural resources, the \nBoard sees this sector as having considerable growth potential in the medium term. Historically, investments were \ngenerally made immediately prior to an initial public offering on AIM or AQSE as well as in the aftermarket.  As the \nnature of the public equity markets has changed since 2008, it is more likely that the future investment portfolio \nwill include companies that have completed an IPO but remain in the early stages of identifying or, with the \nappropriate financial backing, developing a commercial resource. \nDirect Projects: The Company’s strategy is to invest predominantly through ownership of equity stakes in target \ncompanies. However, the Company believes there may be opportunities to take direct interests in mining projects \nand subsequently to acquire equity positions in target companies on favourable terms in exchange for these direct \nproject interests. Those companies would therefore become Starvest investee companies. The projects will be \noperated by the investee company; Starvest does not intend to manage any projects. The addition of the Direct \nProject strategy to the Company’s Investing Policy was approved by shareholders at the Company’s annual \ngeneral meeting held 1 December 2017. \nInvestment size:  Initial investments are usually not greater than £100,000. Target companies invariably have an \nongoing need for additional funding to continue exploration and development. Therefore, after appropriate due \ndiligence, the Company may provide further funding support and make later market purchases, so that the total \ninvestment may exceed £100,000. \nHigh risk:  The business is inherently high risk and cyclical, dependent upon fluctuations in world economic activity \nwhich affects the demand for minerals. However, the Company affords investors the opportunity to participate in \ndiverse early-stage ventures, which the Board believes will offer the potential for significant returns for the \nforeseeable future. \nLack of liquidity:  Shares of investee companies typically trade in small volumes, even if they are quoted on AIM, \nAQSE, ASX, or TSX-V. Therefore, during the early phase following an investment, it is rarely possible to liquidate \na position at the quoted market price so investors must remain patient until the investee company develops and \nultimately attracts greater market interest. If and when an exploration company finds a large exploitable resource, \nit typically presents greater liquidity to patient investors as an acquisition target by a third party or as a much larger \nand more actively traded independent entity. \nSuccess rate:  Of the multiple investments held at any one time, it is expected that no more than five will prove \nto be ‘winners’; from half of the remainder we may expect to see modest share price improvements. Overall, we \nexpect that over time portfolio returns will be acceptable if not substantial. Accordingly, the Board is unable to give \nany estimate of the magnitude or timing of returns. \nProfit distribution:  When profits have been realised, and adequate cash is available, the Board intends to \ndistribute up to half the profits realised."

      "text": "Starvest plc \n2022 Annual Report and Financial Statements \n5 \n \n \n \nReview of trading portfolio \n \nIntroduction \nDuring the year to 30 September 2022, the portfolio comprised interests in the companies discussed below, as \nwell as other active companies that are not discussed herein.   \nThe economic shock of the global pandemic continued throughout 2022 and investors’ desire for traditional safe-\nhaven assets boosted precious metals stocks at times. However, supply chain issues and European conflict led \nto rising energy prices, broader-based inflation and a shift in economic policies which caused market reactions \nand precious metal price fluctuations as well as an overall decline year on year in metal prices when forecasts for \ngrowth were downgraded. In this environment, we believe our strategy to focus on investments in gold producers \nwill prove to be rewarding on a risk-adjusted basis for our shareholders. However, during the year to 30 September \n2022, the value of our trading portfolio decreased ~56% due to lower market prices for major positions. Including \nour cash position, our net asset value (“NAV”) and NAV per share decreased 53.4% and 53.7%, respectively, over \nthe 12-month period to 30 September 2022. Given that Starvest’s market capitalisation decreased approximately \n49%, the discount to NAV narrowed to 29% compared to 34% a year ago.  \n \nTransactions \nDuring the year the Company did not raise capital through placing or subscription.   \nThe Company disposed of its full holdings in Minera IRL during the year, along with a small portion of its positions \nin Greatland Gold (3.8m shares at an average price of 12.83p per share) and Ariana Resources (2.2m shares at \nan average price of 4.25p per share).  \n \nTrading portfolio valuation \nAlthough gold prices declined slightly (~5%) year on year, this change masked greater volatility during the 12-\nmonth period. The Company’s Net Asset Value decreased approximately 53% during the year to 30 September \n2022 to £6.6m and the Company made a loss before tax of £7,540,842 compared with a loss before tax of \n£3,861,014 in 2021. \nHowever, we are pleased that the Company traded at an improved discount to its NAV of 29% compared to 34% \nthe previous year.  \nAs part of routine operations, the Board regularly reviews its portfolio positions and may make adjustments to its \nholdings to take advantage of what it believes to be temporary weakness in prices for precious metals. \nAlternatively, the Board may consider strategic opportunities to better align the Company’s stock price with what \nit regards as the intrinsic value of the Company’s portfolio. \nGiven the availability of actual trading prices for many of our portfolio assets, we value our holdings using closing \nmarket quotes for the periods shown.  \nIn addition, the Company believes it has a strong financial position as it has no outstanding debt and is well-\npositioned to benefit from further strength in the natural resources sector through its exposure to early-stage \nprecious metal producers. We believe that worldwide economic growth and increasingly affluent consumers will \nfuel demand for motor cars, air conditioning, consumer goods, computers, together with materials required in \nswitching to ‘greener’ technologies and other items that require the development and exploitation of natural \nresources in order both to produce and power."

Copper, nickel, \nlead and zinc are all down year on year based on inflation and forecasted recessions.  \nOverall, investors are demonstrating greater interest in the natural resources sector, as the market looks forward \nto economic growth, ‘green’ technology investments, and further government stimulus via major infrastructure \nprojects; long-term natural resources are still vital commodities and demand is forecast to increase.  \n \nThe current market conditions allow for measured, strategic investment in undervalued, early-stage natural \nresource projects."

      "text": "Starvest plc \n2022 Annual Report and Financial Statements \n7 \n \n \n \nPortfolio review \n \nOur primary investments in companies include the following: \n \nGreatland Gold plc (www.greatlandgold.com) \nGreatland Gold plc (“Greatland”), an AIM-listed exploration company, represents by far the largest part of the \nCompany’s portfolio and holds six exploration projects, four in Western Australia and two in Tasmania. Greatland \nalso has farm-in and joint venture agreements in place with its major partner, Newcrest Mining Ltd. \n \nThe company, in conjunction with Newcrest, has continued to report excellent drilling results from the Havieron \nproject and increased its Initial Inferred Mineral Resource estimate, independently of Newcrest, from 4.2Moz AuEq \nto 6.5Moz AuEq in March 2022. The increased estimate was ratified in August 2022 when Newcrest released its \nown resource upgrade. Neither resource takes into account drilling carried out after February 2022, which could \nyield a significant increase in resource if included. Drilling to date has not yet closed off the deposit, with Havieron \nremaining open at depth and in multiple directions, allowing for significant resource growth in the future. \n \nIn addition, Greatland took several corporate and financial actions this year. Newcrest boosted its stake in \nHavieron to 70% but declined to exercise an option to acquire an additional 5% of the project. Greatland \nsubsequently raised US$35m in an over-subscribed placing and is well-funded to continue exploration and funding \nits part of the Havieron development. In September 2022, the company announced that two former Fortescue \nMetals Group executives would join the board in January 2023 and also added a former BHP executive, all of \nwhom add a new dynamic to Greatland’s leadership team and are able to take the company forward as a significant \nmid-tier developer in the near term. Around the same time, the company entered into a significant finance \nagreement, with a bank debt facility of A$200m committed through a syndicate of leading international banks and \nsecured a strategic equity investment of up to A$120m from Wyloo Metals, which will fund Greatland fully through \nto production.    \n \nSignificant activities since year end: Greatland announced that drilling permits have been granted on the Ernest \nGiles licence. Havieron drilling updates continue to confirm the potential to greatly expand the size of this deposit \nwith high-grade extensions to mineralisation in the Eastern Breccia, South East Crescent Zone and Northern \nBreccia. The mine decline is at over 900m development length and now in more competent rock. The feasibility \nstudy is due during 2023 and will likely include more up to date drilling data once completed thus further de-risking \nthe project.  \n \nGreatland entered into an option agreement to sell its two Tasmania exploration licences to Flynn Gold for an \ninitial purchase price of A$200,000 with deferred consideration and a royalty equal to 1% net smelter returns from \nany future production.  \n \n \nAriana Resources plc (www.arianaresources.com) \nAriana Resources PLC (“Ariana”) is a United Kingdom-based company engaged in the exploration, development \nand mining of epithermal gold-silver and porphyry copper-gold deposits in Turkey and exploration in Cyprus and \nsouth-east Europe along with investments in other projects through its metals development fund, Asgard Metals.  \n \nDuring the year Ariana reported revenue of US$177m at Zenit Madencilik, its investee company, from continued \nsuccessful production at the Kilitepe mine. Through the first half of 2022, with production of 13,378 oz Au, it was \non track to exceed the company’s annual guidance of 25,000 oz for the fifth year running. The company reported \nthat this will allow them to sustain its business, enable growth and maintain its dividend rate. For the six months \nto June 2022 (the latest published but unaudited accounts), Ariana earned £2.5m in profits before tax.  \n \nElsewhere in Turkey Ariana received a positive Environmental Impact Assessment at its Tavsan project which \nthey are working to develop as its second gold mine, with a targeted annual production rate of approximately \n30,000 oz Au. Construction of the mine is underway and scheduled for completion in H2 2023."

The company’s application to dewater the Llechfraith Shaft was rejected by Natural \nResources Wales but Alba have submitted additional supporting data and analysis and have extended the \nprogramme of ecological and species surveys. Regional exploration, with a view to near-mine resource \nexpansion, is also continuing, with an application for an unmanned aeromagnetic survey following up on \ngeochemical surveys carried out in 2019.  \nThe Company’s UK oil and gas investments at Horse Hill, where they hold a 11.8% stake, remains ongoing with \nproduction licences moving through legal channels and a Production Permit granted by the Environment Agency \nin May 2022.   \nThe Company’s Irish base metal licences have been extended through to May 2024, where they have three \nprincipal target areas for follow-up drilling.  \nAlba holds a 54% majority interest in AIM-listed GreenRoc Mining plc, which the company spun out in September \n2021. GreenRoc hold licences for graphite, black sands iron and multi-elements in Greenland and announced a \nmaiden JORC resource at its Amitsoq graphite deposit in March 2022 of 8.28Mt at 19.8% graphitic carbon. A \nrevised resource at the Thule Black Sands now stands at 19Mt at 8.9% in-situ ilmenite.  \nWith a reported £2 million in cash at its interim report at the end of May 2022 the company is well-funded to move \nforward this year.  \n \nSignificant activities since year end: The company spun out GreenRoc to advance its Greenland graphite project. \nMetallurgical test work showed that the material could potentially be used in the electric vehicle battery market. \nIn addition, the company appointed an adviser to assist in processing, sales and marketing going forward.

Its main projects are Tulu Kapi in Ethiopia and the Jibal Qutmanand Hawiah projects in Saudi \nArabia. \n \nOperation on the Tula Kapi Mine in Ethiopia continued throughout the year. The Ministry of Mines completed an \naudit and endorsed historical project costs incurred through 2020 of circa US$80m which will now be reported to \nthe Ethiopian central bank and allow for development banks to provide funds once the Ethiopian government \nratifies this report.  \n \nWhile awaiting regulatory permissions to re-activate exploration for near-mine expansion in Ethiopia, the company \nhas switched its main exploration efforts to Saudi Arabia. The Hawiah VMS Copper-Gold project has a JORC \nresource of 24.9Mt at 0.9% Cu and 0.62g/t Au. A preliminary feasibility study is due for completion by the end of \n2022. Jibal Qutman was enlarged this year with a +500,000oz production plan over ten years with an open \npit/carbon-in-leach process. A mining licence and financing is being sought for the project. The company received \nadditional exploration licences to bring its total to nine licences covering over 630km2. \n \nSignificant activities since year end: The Jibal Qutman licence has been renewed for a five-year term. The \ncompany intends to construct a pioneers camp and carry out environmental baseline studies and geotechnical \nand metallurgical diamond drilling going forward. The feasibility study remains on target for completion in early Q1 \n2023 with environmental permits targeted for Q1 2023 also.

Its main focus is developing pozzolan-perlite deposits while looking to enter \ninto a JV or sell its other tenements. \n \nSunrise continued with development of its pozzolan-perlite project with discussions with companies in the cement \nand concrete industries. As natural pozzolan has a key role in cement decarbonisation strategies towards net-\nzero CO2 emissions, it may benefit from California state legislation and Implementation Priorities under the Biden \nadministration’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill.  \n \nThe company also extended its pozzolan footprint to a new project site at Hazen with due diligence field visits \ncarried out by interested parties and sample testing underway. A permit was obtained during the year to extract \n500 tons of sample material for commercial trials.  \n \nA new Mining Lease application was submitted on the company’s Bakers Gold project in Western Australia to \ncover high-grade gold mineralisation intersected in a 2021 drill programme, with a highlight of 2m at 14.36g/t Au \nfrom 64m downhole. The project is available for sale or JV according to the company’s website.  \n \nSignificant activities since year end: Sunrise announced it has entered into a collaborative arrangement with an \nexisting pozzolan processor for mining and test grinding.

      "text": "Starvest plc \n2022 Annual Report and Financial Statements \n13 \n \n \n \nStrategic report \nPrincipal activities and business review \nSince the company’s inception in 2002, its principal trading activity has been to identify and, where appropriate, \nsupport small company new issues, pre-IPO and ongoing fundraising opportunities with a view to realising profit \nfrom disposals as the businesses mature in the medium term. The current directors have maintained this strategy \nof seeking out investment opportunities in small-cap and pre-IPO mining and metals companies.  \nThe Company’s investing policy is stated on page 3. \nThe Company’s key performance indicators and developments during the year are given in the Chairman’s \nstatement and in the trading portfolio review, all of which form part of the Directors’ & Strategic reports. \n \nFinance Review \nOver the 12 months to 30 September 2022 the Company recorded a loss before tax of £7,540,842, equating to a \nloss of 12.96 pence per share with net cash inflow for the year of £327,830. This compares to a loss before tax of \n£3,861,014 in the previous year that equated to a loss of 6.69 pence per share. The Company’s cash deposits \nstood at £406,106 at the period end. \n \nKey Performance Indicators \nThe Company’s key measure of performance is the market value of its investment holdings. As a secondary metric, \nthe Company seeks to manage the administrative and other expenses associated with achieving its investment \nresults. The Company does not have any operating activities and thus the directors take the opinion that analysis \nusing operating key performance indicators is not necessary for an understanding of the performance, \ndevelopment or position of the business at the present time. \n \nKey risks and uncertainties \nThis business carries a high level of risk and uncertainty with commensurately high potential returns. The risk \narises from the very nature of early-stage mineral exploration where there can be no certainty of outcome. In \naddition, often there is a lack of liquidity in the Company’s trading portfolio, even for securities quoted on AIM or \nAQSE, such that the Company may have difficulty in realising the full value in an immediate or forced sale. \nAccordingly, a commitment is only made after thorough research into both the management and the business of \nthe target, both of which are closely monitored thereafter. Furthermore, the Company limits the total size of any \nsingle commitment, both as to the absolute amount and percentage ownership of the target company.  \nSection 172 Statement \nSection 172 (1) of the Companies Act obliges the Directors to promote the success of the Company for the benefit \nof the Company’s members as a whole. This section specifies that the Directors must act in good faith when \npromoting the success of the Company and in doing so have regard (amongst other things) to: \na) The likely consequences of any decision in the long term;  \nb) The interests of the Company’s employees; \nc) The need to foster the Company’s business relationship with suppliers, customers and others; \nd) The impact of the Company’s operations on the community and environment; \ne) The desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct; and  \nf) \nThe need to act fairly as between members of the Company. \nThe Board of Directors is collectively responsible for formulating the Company’s strategy, which is to invest in \nbusinesses where prospects appear to be exceptional at an attractive price and deliver good risk-adjusted \ninvestment returns to its shareholders. Since 1 October 2021, the Board took the decision to reduce its \nconcentration of risk in one project by divesting some of its position. The Board places equal importance on all \nshareholders and strives for transparent and effective external communications, within the regulatory confined of \na listed company.

      "text": "Starvest plc \n2022 Annual Report and Financial Statements \n19 \n \n \n \nCorporate governance statement \n \nThe Board of Starvest plc are committed to the principles of good corporate governance and believe in the \nimportance and value of robust corporate governance and in our accountability to our shareholders and \nstakeholders. \nThe AIM Rules for companies, updated in early 2018, required AIM companies to apply a recognised corporate \ngovernance code from 28 September 2018. Starvest has chosen to adhere to the Quoted Company Alliance’s \nCorporate Governance Code for Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies (the “QCA Code”) and listed below are \nthe 10 broad principles of the QCA Code and the Company’s disclosure with respect to each point. \nThe Board recognises the importance of good governance, agrees to the principals set out in the QCA Code, and \nis compliant with the vast majority of the QCA Code. However, the Company does not achieve full compliance \nwith the QCA Code; specifically, Principles 5 and 7. The areas of non-compliance will be readily addressed as the \nCompany grows and additional members are added to the Board. \nThe Board recognises that it is non-compliant with Principle 5 where the QCA Code recommends that at least two \ndirectors are independent. The QCA Code requires that the boards of AIM companies have an appropriate balance \nbetween executive and non-executive directors. The Board believes, at this time in the Company’s development \nand with respect to the Company’s size and goals of achieving good shareholder value through preserving cash \nfor investment opportunities, that the positions within the Board are sufficient to carry out good corporate \ngovernance with a balanced approach to decisions. As the Company grows this matter will be reviewed and \naddressed with the goal of appointing additional board members and filling a non-executive, independent role.  \nThe Board recognises that it does not fully comply with Principle 7 in that Starvest currently does not have formal \nevaluation procedures for individual board members but the Board recognises that a formal evaluation process \nmay become necessary in the near future. \n \nQCA CODE: \n1: Establish a strategy and business model promoting long-term value for shareholders:  \nThe Company is established as a source of early stage finance to fledgling businesses, to maximise the \ncapital value of the Company and to generate benefits for Shareholders in the form of capital growth and \nmodest dividends. \nInvesting strategy \nNatural resources: Whilst the Company’s investment mandate is not exclusively limited to natural resources, the \nBoard sees this sector as having considerable growth potential in the medium term. Historically, investments were \ngenerally made immediately prior to an initial public offering on AIM or AQSE as well as in the aftermarket.  As the \nnature of the market has changed since 2008, it is more likely that the future investment portfolio will include \ncompanies that have completed an IPO but remain in the early stages of identifying or, with the appropriate \nfinancial backing, developing a commercial resource. \nDirect Project: The Company’s strategy is to invest predominantly through ownership of equity stakes in target \ncompanies. However, the Company believes there may be opportunities to take direct interests in mining projects \nand subsequently to acquire equity positions in target companies on favourable terms in exchange for these direct \nproject interests; those companies would therefore become Starvest investee companies. The projects will be \noperated by the investee company; Starvest will not manage any project. Prior to selling any projects to corporate \nentities, Starvest may therefore have an interest in a number of projects. The addition of the Direct Project strategy \nto the Company’s Investing Policy was approved by shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting held \n1 December 2017. \n \nInvestment size: Initial investments are usually not greater than £100,000. Target companies are invariably not \ngenerating cash, but rather they have a constant need for additional funding in order to continue exploration and \ndevelopment. Therefore, after appropriate due diligence, the Company may provide further funding support and \nmake later market purchases, so that the total investment may be greater than £100,000."

However, the Company affords investors the \nopportunity to participate in diverse early-stage ventures, which the Board believes will offer the potential for \nsignificant returns for the foreseeable future.  \nLack of liquidity: The investee companies, being small, almost invariably lack share market liquidity, even if they \nare quoted on AIM, AQSE, ASX, or TSX-V. Therefore, in the early years it is rarely possible to sell an investment \nat the quoted market price with the result that extreme patience is required whilst the investee company develops \nand ultimately attracts market interest. If and when an explorer finds a large exploitable resource, it may become \nthe object of a third party bid, or otherwise become a much larger entity; either way an opportunity to realise cash \nis expected to follow. \nSuccess rate: Of the 15 to 20 investments held at any one time, it is expected that no more than five will prove \nto be ‘winners’; from half of the remainder we may expect to see modest share price improvements. Overall, the \nexpectation is that in time Shareholder returns will be acceptable if not substantial. Accordingly, the Board is \nunable to give any estimate of the quantum or timing of returns. \nProfit distribution: When profits have been realised and adequate cash is available, it is the intention of the \nBoard to recommend the distribution of up to half the profits realised. \nOther matters: The Company currently has investments in the following companies, which themselves are \ninvestment companies: Equity Investors plc and Equity Resources Limited.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law \nand United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in \nthe UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).  \nIn our opinion, the financial statements:  \n \ngive a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 30 September 2022 and of its loss for \nthe year then ended;  \n \nhave been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting \nPractice; and \n \nhave been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.  \nBasis for opinion  \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable \nlaw. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit \nof the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical \nrequirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical \nStandard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with \nthese requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide \na basis for our opinion.  \nConclusions relating to going concern  \nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Director's use of the going concern basis of \naccounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors’ \nassessment of the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included a review \nof the cash flow forecasts prepared by management, challenging the assumptions made therein and evaluating \nthe ability of the company to realise its Level 1 investments, if required, to meet its liabilities as they fall due. \nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or \nconditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a \ngoing concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. \nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the \nrelevant sections of this report. \nOur application of materiality  \nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. The quantitative and qualitative thresholds \nfor materiality determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures. \nMateriality for the company financial statements was set at £184,000 (2021: £422,000). This was calculated based \non 3% of net assets, of which equity investments comprise the majority of the balance. The basis for calculating \nmateriality is unchanged from the previous year, with the reduction reflecting the fall in fair value of equity \ninvestments at year-end. The benchmark used is the one which we determined, in our professional judgment, to \nbe the key benchmark within the financial statements relevant to shareholders of an investment management \ncompany in assessing financial performance. The key driver of the company and assessment of its performance \nis linked to the valuation of its equity investments held. Performance materiality has been set at £128,800 (2021: \n£295,400) being 70% of headline materiality, based upon our assessment of risk and the absence of any audit \nadjustments in previous periods.  \nWe agreed to report to those charged with governance all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified \nthrough our audit with a value in excess of £9,000 (2021: £21,100). We also agreed to report any other audit \nmisstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds."

In particular, we looked at areas where the Directors made significant judgements, comprising the fair \nvalue of investments at level 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We also assessed the risk of management override \nof internal controls. \nKey audit matters  \nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of \nthe financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material \nmisstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the \noverall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. \nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming \nour opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.   \nKey Audit Matter \nHow our scope addressed this matter \nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss \n(Note 10) \n \n \nThe Company holds equity investments with a car-\nrying value of £6m (2021: £14m) as at 30 September \n2022. The portfolio consists largely of listed invest-\nments, and thus are valued under Level 1 of the fair \nvalue hierarchy.   \nUnlisted investments are subject to management \nvaluation, and thus are exposed to significant levels \nof management judgement and estimation. These \ninvestments have been written down to £Nil in pre-\nvious periods. \nBased upon the significance of the value of the in-\nvestments held at the year end, this was determined \nto be a Key Audit Matter. \n \n  \nOur work in this area included: \n \nreviewing the valuation methodology for each \ntype of investment held and ensuring the carrying \nvalues are supported by sufficient and appropri-\nate audit evidence;  \n \nensuring that investments are categorised and \ndisclosed correctly in accordance with UK GAAP; \n \nagreeing year-end fair values to independent \nsources of price data; \n \nensuring that the company has legal title to the \ninvestments held.; and \n \nperforming tests of detail on investment disposals \nin the year \n \n \n \nOther information  \nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements \nand our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the \nannual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the \nextent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our \nresponsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially \ninconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise \nappears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material \nmisstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial \nstatements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material \nmisstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact."

Misstatements can arise from fraud or \nerror and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.  \nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures \nin line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, \nincluding fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is \ndetailed below: \n \nWe obtained an understanding of the company and the sector in which it operates to identify laws and \nregulations that could reasonably be expected to have a direct effect on the financial statements. We \nobtained our understanding in this regard through discussions with management and application of cu-\nmulative audit knowledge."

These procedures included, but \nwere not limited to: \n- \nEnquiries of management \n- \nReview of board minutes and other correspondence  \n- \nReview of the company’s related party transactions and disclosures  \n \nWe also identified the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud. We consid-\nered, in addition to the non-rebuttable presumption of a risk of fraud arising from management override of \ncontrols, that the existence and good title to investments represented the greatest risk of fraud. \n \nWe addressed the risk of fraud arising from management override of controls by performing audit proce-\ndures which included, but were not limited to: the testing of journals and evaluating the business rationale \nof any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business. \nBecause of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including \nthose leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation.  This risk \nincreases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected \nin the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is \nalso greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional \nconcealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation. \nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial \nReporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

      "text": "Starvest plc \n2022 annual report and financial statements \n \n38 \n \n \nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2022 \n \n1. \nCompany Information \n \nStarvest plc is a Public Limited Company incorporated in England & Wales. The registered office is Salisbury \nHouse, London Wall, London, EC2M 5PS. The Company's shares are listed on the AIM market of the London \nStock Exchange. These Financial Statements (the \"Financial Statements\") have been prepared and approved by \nthe Directors on 07 February 2023 and signed on their behalf by Mark Badros and Gemma Cryan. \n \n2. \nBasis of Preparation \n \nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting \nstandards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 – ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the \nUnited Kingdom and Republic of Ireland’ (‘FRS102’), and with the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements \nhave been prepared on the historical cost basis. There are no fair value adjustments other than to the carrying \nvalue of the Company’s trade investments. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is \nalso the functional currency of the company. \n \nGoing concern \nThe Company's day to day financing is from its available cash resources and, on occasion, by the part disposal of \ninvestments and use of short-term loans.  \nThe Directors are confident that adequate funding can be raised as required to meet the Company's current and \nfuture liabilities, which has been confirmed within the cash flow forecast prepared by the Board for the 12 months \nending 29 February 2024. In the unlikely event that such finance could not be raised, the Directors could raise \nsufficient funds by disposal of certain of its current asset trade investments. \nAs at the date of this report, the Company has no borrowings. \nFor the reasons outlined above, the Directors are satisfied that the Company will be able to meet its current and \nfuture liabilities, and continue trading, for the foreseeable future and, in any event, for a period of not less than \ntwelve months from the date of approving the financial statements. The preparation of the financial statements on \na going concern basis is therefore considered to remain appropriate. \n \n3. \nPrincipal Accounting Policies  \n \nAdministrative expenses \nAll administrative expenses are stated inclusive of VAT, where applicable, as the company is not eligible to reclaim \nVAT incurred on its costs. \nTaxation \nCorporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rates enacted or substantially enacted at the \nbalance sheet date.  \nUnder FRS102, investments are valued on a mark-to-market basis using publicly quoted trading prices at year \nend irrespective of whether they are classified as fixed or current assets.  However, pursuant to Part 3, Chapter 3, \nCorporation Tax Act 2009, any increase in the value of a current asset is recognised as a trading profit and \nimmediately subject to Corporation Tax when a company is classified as a trading company under HMRC rules \nand regulations, whereas an increase in the value of a fixed asset is not subject to taxation until the asset is \ndisposed of when a company is classified as an investment company. Reported profit under UK GAAP is \nunaffected."

Following a comprehensive review of various factors related to the Company’s \ninvestment portfolio and strategy, including, among others, the frequency, timing, liquidity, trading activities, \ndevelopment stage and investment horizon of such investments individually and the portfolio as a whole, the \nCompany’s current board have determined the Company is appropriately classified as an investment \ncompany, and the investment portfolio is properly accounted for among the Company’s fixed assets. The Board \ndo not consider this to be a change in accounting policy; rather, it is a correction in presentation to reflect more \naccurately the factual position.   \n \nDeferred tax \nDeferred tax is provided on an undiscounted full provision basis on all timing differences which have arisen but \nnot reversed at the balance sheet date using rates of tax enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet \ndate. \nDeferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the \nreversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits and are recognised within debtors. The deferred \ntax assets and liabilities all relate to the same legal entity and being due to or from the same tax authority are \noffset on the balance sheet. \nFRS 102 requires that investments are valued each year on the mark-to-market basis and the revaluation \ndifferences are reflected in the profit and loss account. However, the tax on any unrealised profit is calculated and \nshown in the accounts as if the profit had been realised, but there is then an adjustment in the deferred tax to \nmove the tax that relates to the unrealised profit to the balance sheet. \n \nForeign Currencies \nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. \nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the \nexchange rate ruling at the reporting date, unless specifically covered by foreign exchange contracts whereupon \nthe contract rate is used.  \n \n \nInvestments \nCurrent investments are stated at mid-market publicly quoted prices. \nInvestments in unlisted company shares are remeasured to available market values, or Directors’ valuations at \neach balance sheet date.  Gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the statement of comprehensive \nincome for the period. As at 30 September 2022 unlisted shares were valued at £nil (2021: £nil). \nInvestments in listed company shares are remeasured to market value at each balance sheet date under level 1 \nof the fair value hierachy. Gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the statement of comprehensive \nincome for the period. \n \nDividend income is recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established from \ninvestee companies.  \n \nFinancial instruments: \nTrade and other receivables \nTrade and other receivables are not interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently \nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment. \n \nCash and cash equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and deposits held at call with banks."
