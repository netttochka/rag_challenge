BUSINESS\nOverview\nCelldex Therapeutics, Inc., which we refer to as “Celldex,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company,” is a biopharmaceutical company\ndedicated to developing therapeutic monoclonal and bispecific antibodies that address diseases for which available treatments are\ninadequate. Our drug candidates include antibody- based therapeutics which have the ability to engage the human immune system and/or\ndirectly affect critical pathways to improve the lives of patients with inflammatory diseases and many forms of cancer.\nWe are focusing our efforts and resources on the continued research and development of\n●\nBarzolvolimab (also referred to as CDX-0159), a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the KIT receptor and potently\ninhibits its activity, which is currently being studied across multiple mast cell driven diseases including\n-\nChronic Urticarias: In June and July 2022 respectively, we announced that enrollment had opened and the first patients\nhad been dosed in Phase 2 studies in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU).\nPositive interim data from the ongoing Phase 1b study in CSU were reported in February 2023. Positive interim data\nfrom the Phase 1b study in CIndU were reported in July and September 2021 and in December 2022 in patients with\ncold urticaria and symptomatic dermographism;\n-\nPrurigo Nodularis (PN): In December 2021 we announced that the first patient had been dosed in a Phase 1b study in\nPN; enrollment was closed in February 2023 and we plan to present data from the study in the second half of 2023;\n-\nEosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE): We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in EoE in the first half of 2023.\n●\nOur next generation bispecific antibody platform to support pipeline expansion with additional candidates for inflammatory\ndiseases and oncology. Targets are being selected based on new science as well as their compatibility to be used in bispecific\nantibody formats with Celldex’s existing antibody programs. Development is focused on emerging, important pathways\ncontrolling inflammatory diseases or immunity to tumors.\nOur goal is to build a fully integrated, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops important therapies for patients\nwith unmet medical needs. We believe our program assets provide us with the strategic options to either retain full economic rights to our\ninnovative therapies or seek favorable economic terms through advantageous commercial partnerships. This approach allows us to\nmaximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolio while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual\nproduct.\nOur future success depends upon many factors, including our ability, and that of any licensees and collaborators that we may have,\nto successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our drug candidates. We have had no commercial revenues\nfrom sales of our drug candidates, and we have had a history of operating losses. It is possible that we may not be able to successfully\ndevelop, obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, our drug candidates, and we are subject to a number of risks that you should\nbe aware of before investing in us. These risks are described more fully in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nClinical Development Programs\nBarzolvolimab (also referred to as CDX-0159)\nBarzolvolimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT and potently inhibits its\nactivity. KIT is expressed in a variety of cells, including mast cells, and its activation by its ligand SCF regulates mast cell growth,\ndifferentiation, survival, chemotaxis and degranulation. Barzolvolimab is designed to block KIT activation by disrupting both SCF\nbinding and KIT dimerization. We believe that by targeting KIT, barzolvolimab may be able to inhibit mast cell activity and decrease\nmast cell numbers to provide potential clinical benefit in mast cell related diseases."

In June 2020,\nwe completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose escalation Phase 1a study of barzolvolimab in\nhealthy subjects (n = 32; 8 subjects per cohort, 6 barzolvolimab; 2 placebo). Subjects received a single intravenous infusion of\nbarzolvolimab at 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 9.0 mg/kg or placebo. The objectives of the study included safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics\n(PK) and pharmacodynamics (tryptase and stem cell factor) and immunogenicity. Tryptase is an enzyme synthesized and secreted almost\nexclusively by mast cells and decreases in plasma tryptase levels are believed to reflect a systemic reduction in mast cell burden in both\nhealthy volunteers and in disease. Data from the study were featured in a late breaking presentation at the European Academy of Allergy\nand Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Annual Congress 2020 in June. Barzolvolimab demonstrated a favorable safety profile as well as\nprofound and durable reductions of plasma tryptase, consistent with systemic mast cell suppression.\nThese data supported expansion of the barzolvolimab program into mast cell driven diseases, including initially in CSU and CIndU,\ndiseases where mast cell degranulation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease. Phase 1 studies in CSU and CIndU\nare completing and Phase 2 studies are ongoing. We continue to assess potential opportunities for barzolvolimab in other diseases where\nmast cells play an important role, such as dermatologic, respiratory, allergic, gastrointestinal and ophthalmic conditions and to this end,\nare conducting an ongoing Phase 1 study in prurigo nodularis and plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in eosinophilic esophagitis in the first\nhalf of 2023. Phase 1 studies of barzolvolimab have been conducted with an intravenous formulation; a subcutaneous formulation has\nbeen successfully developed and is being used in Phase 2 studies.\nChronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)\nCSU presents as itchy hives, angioedema or both for at least six weeks without a specific trigger; multiple episodes can play out over\nyears or even decades. CSU is one of the most frequent dermatologic diseases with a prevalence of 0.5-1.0% of the total population or up\nto approximately 1 to 3 million patients in the United States (Weller et al. 2010. Hautarzt. 61(8), Bartlett et al. 2018. DermNet.Org).\nApproximately 50% of patients with CSU achieve symptomatic control with antihistamines. Omalizumab, an IgE inhibitor, provides\nrelief for roughly half of the remaining antihistamine refractory patients. Consequently, there is a need for additional therapies.\nIn October 2020, we announced that enrollment had opened and the first patient had been dosed in a Phase 1b multi-center study of\nbarzolvolimab in CSU. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to assess the safety of\nmultiple ascending doses of barzolvolimab in up to 40 patients with CSU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with\nantihistamines. Secondary and exploratory objectives include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments, including\nmeasurement of tryptase and stem cell factor levels and clinical activity outcomes (impact on urticaria symptoms, disease control,\nclinical response) as well as quality of life assessments. Barzolvolimab is administered intravenously (0.5, 1.5, 3 and 4.5 mg/kg at\nvarying dosing schedules) as add on treatment to H1-antihistamines, either alone or in combination with H2-antihistamines and/or\nleukotriene receptor agonists.\nIn February 2023, we reported positive interim data from the CSU study. As of the data cut-off date on November 29, 2022,\nenrollment was complete with 45 patients with moderate to severe CSU refractory to antihistamines enrolled and treated [35\nbarzolvolimab (n=9 in 0.5 mg/kg; n=8 in 1.5 mg/kg; n=9 in 3.0 mg/kg; n=9 in 4.5 mg/kg) and 10 placebo]. The 0.5 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg\nand 3.0 mg/kg cohorts had completed study participation through 24 weeks; 6 of 9 patients in the 4.5 mg/kg cohort had completed\nthrough the week 20 visit. Complete data were included for all patients in dose levels through 3.0 mg/kg through 24 weeks. All available\ndata for the 4.5 mg/kg and placebo dose levels were presented for adverse events. Activity data for the 4.5 mg/kg dose level were\nreported through week 20. Activity data for the 0.5 mg/kg and placebo group were only included through week 12 because, as expected,\nmost patients from these groups had significant symptoms ahead of week 24 and discontinued follow up. Two patients did not receive all\ndoses of study treatment [4.5 mg/kg (1), placebo (1)].\n●\nBarzolvolimab resulted in rapid, marked and durable responses in patients with moderate to severe CSU refractory to\nantihistamines, including patients with prior omalizumab treatment.\n●\nThe 1.5 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg and 4.5 mg/kg dose groups showed similar markedly improved urticaria symptoms and disease\ncontrol with sustained durability up to 24 weeks."

Two additional patients\ntreated with these doses who were not a complete response at week 12 had a complete response at week 24. 6 of 6 (100%)\npatients treated with barzolvolimab 4.5 mg/kg maintained their complete response through their last assessment with additional\nfollow up ongoing.\n●\nPatients with prior omalizumab therapy had similar symptom improvement as all patients.\n●\nRapid onset of responses after initial dosing and sustained durability were observed; onset as early as 1 week after the first dose\nand prolonged symptom control in some patients for up to 24 weeks.\n●\nTryptase suppression, indicative of mast cell depletion, paralleled symptom improvement, demonstrating the impact of mast\ncell depletion on CSU disease activity.\n●\nBarzolvolimab was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile; effects of multiple dose administration were consistent with\nobservations in single dose studies. Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity and resolved while on study. The most\ncommon treatment emergent adverse events were hair color changes, COVID-19, headache, neutropenia and urinary tract\ninfections (UTIs). UTIs and COVID-19 were reported as unrelated to treatment. There was one serious adverse event of\nsalmonella gastroenteritis which was also not related to study therapy. Changes in hematologic parameters were consistent with\nobservations in single dose studies, with no pattern of further decreases with multiple doses; hematologic values generally\nremained within the normal range and returned to baseline levels during the follow up period. Five patients had decreases in\nneutrophil counts reported as AEs; four of which were previously reported in the EAACI 2022 data presentation. The pattern\nobserved in the neutrophil changes for these patients was similar to the pattern seen in patients across the barzolvolimab\nprogram to date—generally transient, asymptomatic, and mild and typically occurring in patients with screening and baseline\nneutrophil counts at the lower end of the normal range on study initiation.\nIn June 2022, we announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 2 study in patients with CSU who remain symptomatic\ndespite antihistamine therapy. The study is being conducted at approximately 75 sites across 9 countries. The study is a randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of multiple dose regimens of\nbarzolvolimab to determine the optimal dosing strategy. Approximately 168 patients will be randomly assigned on a 1:1:1:1 ratio to\nreceive subcutaneous injections of barzolvolimab at 75 mg every 4 weeks, 150 mg every 4 weeks, 300 mg every 8 weeks or placebo\nduring a 16-week placebo-controlled treatment phase. Patients will then enter a 36-week active treatment phase, in which patients not\nalready randomized to barzolvolimab at 150 mg every 4 weeks or 300 mg every 8 weeks will be randomized 1:1 to receive one of these\ntwo dose regimens; patients already randomized to these treatment arms will remain on the same regimen as during the placebo-\ncontrolled treatment phase. Following the treatment period, patients will enter a 24-week follow up phase. The primary endpoint of the\nstudy is mean change in baseline to week 12 in UAS7 (Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days). Secondary endpoints include safety and\nother assessments of clinical activity including ISS7 (Itch Severity Score over 7 days), HSS7 (Hive Severity Score over 7 days) and\nAAS7 (Angioedema Activity Score over 7 days). Based on current enrollment projections, we anticipate that enrollment to this study will\nbe completed by the end of the third quarter of 2023 and we plan to report topline data either late this year or in the first quarter of 2024.\nChronic Inducible Urticaria (CIndU)\nCIndUs are forms of urticaria that have an attributable cause or trigger associated with them, typically resulting in hives or wheals.\nThe prevalence of CIndU is estimated at 0.5% of the total population and is reported to overlap in up to 36% of CSU patients"

There are currently no approved therapies for chronic inducible\nurticarias other than antihistamines and patients attempt to manage symptoms associated with their disease through avoidance of triggers.\nWe are exploring cold-induced, dermographism (scratch-induced) and cholinergic (exercise-induced) urticarias.\nIn December 2020, we announced that enrollment had opened and the first patient had been dosed in a Phase 1b study in CIndU\nbeing conducted in Germany in patients who are refractory to antihistamines. This study is an open label clinical trial designed to\nevaluate the safety of a single dose (3 mg/kg) of barzolvolimab in patients with cold urticaria (ColdU) or symptomatic dermographism\n(SD). In March and June 2021, respectively, we added a third cohort (single dose, 3 mg/kg) in patients with cholinergic urticaria and a\nfourth cohort at a lower dose (single dose, 1.5 mg/kg) in ColdU. Patient’s symptoms are induced via provocation testing that resembles\nreal life triggering situations. Secondary and exploratory objectives include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments,\nincluding changes from baseline provocation thresholds, measurement of tryptase and stem cell factor levels, clinical activity outcomes\n(impact on urticaria symptoms, disease control, clinical response), quality of life assessments and measurement of tissue mast cells\nthrough skin biopsies. Barzolvolimab is administered intravenously on Day 1 as add on treatment to H1-antihistamines.\nIn November 2022, data from the ColdU and SD cohorts treated with a single intravenous infusion of barzolvolimab at 3 mg/kg\nwere published in Allergy (Terhorst-Molawi et al Allergy. 2022 Nov 16. doi: 10.1111/all.15585). Safety results were reported for 21\npatients; activity results were reported for the 20 patients who received a full dose of barzolvolimab. Patients had high disease activity.\nAt baseline, patients’ mean scores (range) for Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) [10.8 (2–21)] and Urticaria Control Test (UCT)\n[6.0 (0–13)] indicated marked impairment of quality of life (QoL) and poorly controlled disease, respectively. Three patients (1 with\nColdU and 2 with SD) were previously treated with omalizumab and chose to discontinue that treatment because they remained\nsymptomatic. At baseline, provocation thresholds, on average (range), were 18.9°C or 66°F (5–27°C or 41–80.6°F) for patients with\nColdU and 3.5 (2–4) pins for patients with SD.\n●\nRapid (as early as 1 week) and durable responses were observed in all patients as assessed by provocation testing. A complete\nresponse was achieved in 95% (n = 19/20) of patients (n = 10/10 ColdU; n = 9/10 SD). The median duration (range) of\ncomplete response through the 12-week observation period was 77+ days (29–86; n = 10) for patients with ColdU and 57+ days\n(16–70; n = 9) for patients with SD. All three patients who experienced insufficient response to omalizumab treatment had a\ncomplete response after treatment with barzolvolimab.\n●\nFollowing a single dose of barzolvolimab rapid improvements in urticaria control was observed. A UCT score of ≥12 (well\ncontrolled) was achieved by 80% (n = 16/20) of the patients within week 4 post-treatment. By week 8, all patients (100%; n =\n20/20) achieved well-controlled urticaria, which was sustained to week 12 post-dose by 80% (n = 16/20) of patients. Complete\nurticaria control (UCT = 16) was achieved by 35% (n = 7/20), 65% (n = 13/20), and 40% (n = 8/20) at weeks 4, 8, and 12,\nrespectively.\n●\nAt baseline, patients in both treatment groups reported disease impact on their QoL. Disease impact significantly decreased\nafter dosing; a score of 0–1 (minimal/none) was achieved by 80% (n = 16/20) for all patients who completed the DLQI during\nthe study. Additionally, clinically meaningful improvements in QoL were attained and sustained to week 12.\n●\nA single dose of barzolvolimab led to marked decreases in tryptase and in skin mast cells. The kinetics correlated with\nimprovements in provocation testing and clinical activity, consistent with a central role for mast cells in the pathogenesis of\nColdU and SD. This confirmed that serum tryptase level is a robust pharmacodynamic biomarker for assessing mast cell burden\nand clinical activity in inducible urticaria and potentially in other diseases with mast cell driven involvement.\n●\nBarzolvolimab was well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild, and the most common (≥3 patients) were hair color changes\n(76%; n = 16/21), infusion reactions (43%; n = 9/21), taste changes (38%; n = 8/21), nasopharyngitis (24%; n = 5/21), malaise\n(24%; n = 5/21), and headache (19%; n = 4/21). Hair color changes (generally small areas of hair color lightening) and taste\ndisorders (generally partial changes of ability to taste salt or umami) are consistent with inhibiting KIT signaling in other cell\ntypes and completely resolved over time during follow-up. Infusion reactions, which manifested as localized hives and itching\nas well as erythema and feeling hot, resolved spontaneously. One patient with a history of fainting experienced loss of\nconsciousness during infusion. The patient rapidly recovered. Importantly, no evidence of mast cell activation as measured by\nserum tryptase monitoring was observed in this patient. Overall, mean hematology parameters remained within the normal\nranges—an important finding for a KIT inhibitor. Mild, transient, and asymptomatic decreases in hemoglobin and white blood\ncell parameters occurred for some patients."

Data were collected at one or more timepoints beyond week 12 through week 36.\n●\nMost patients had return of symptoms and/or loss of urticaria control between 12 and 36 weeks. Remarkably, two patients\nremained provocation negative at 36 weeks, and four had well controlled disease (UCT ≥12) 36 weeks post dosing.\n●\nSerum tryptase exhibits a similar rate of recovery as clinical symptoms, while skin mast cells return at a slower rate. Tissue KIT\nsignaling, as approximated by SCF levels, was rapidly inhibited after dose administration and fully reactivated approximately\n18 weeks after dosing.\n●\nTryptase levels return to pretreatment levels during follow up, while mast cells continue to recover. Drug related adverse events\nnoted during the study all resolved.\nIn December 2022, we also presented 12 week treatment results for the 1.5 mg/kg cohort in cold urticaria at the GA²LEN Global\nUrticaria Forum (GUF) 2022. 10 patients received a single intravenous infusion of barzolvolimab at 1.5 mg/kg. Patients had high disease\nactivity as assessed by provocation threshold testing with a mean baseline critical temperature threshold of 18.4°C or 65°F with a range\nfrom 6 to 27°C or 43 to 81°F. All patients had disease refractory to antihistamines and five patients had disease refractory to\nomalizumab. Safety results were reported for all 10 patients; activity results were reported for the 9 patients who received a full dose of\nbarzolvolimab, including four patients with omalizumab refractory disease.\n●\nAll 9 of 9 (100%) patients evaluable for activity treated at 1.5 mg/kg experienced a complete response as assessed by\nprovocation threshold testing, including 4 patients with disease refractory to omalizumab. Rapid onset of responses after dosing\nand sustained durability were observed in the 1.5 mg/kg cohort. 6 of 9 patients treated achieved a complete response within a\nweek of dosing. The median duration of response was 51+ days (7+ weeks).\n●\nImprovements in disease activity as reported by Urticaria Control Test (UCT) were consistent with the complete responses as\nmeasured by provocation testing. All patients entered the study with poorly controlled disease (mean UCT score at baseline of\n5.9 and a range of 1-11). Following barzolvolimab administration, all patients achieved well controlled disease (UCT>12) with\n7 of 9 achieving complete control (UCT = 16).\n●\nA single 1.5 mg/kg dose of barzolvolimab resulted in rapid, marked and durable suppression of serum tryptase; the kinetics of\ntryptase depletion mirrored changes in provocation threshold and UCT. Barzolvolimab was generally well tolerated and the\nsafety profile at 1.5mg/kg was similar to the profile observed with 3.0 mg/kg.\n●\nNo new treatment emergent AEs of concern were noted. While mild, transient and asymptomatic decreases in hemoglobin and\nwhite blood cell (WBC) parameters were noted, consistent with prior studies, the hematology parameters generally remained\nwithin the normal range.\nTo date, 19 of 19 (100%) patients with cold urticaria treated with either a single dose of barzolvolimab at 1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg in this\nPhase 1b study have experienced a complete response by provocation testing, including 5 patients with omalizumab refractory disease.\nIn July 2022 we announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 2 study in patients with CIndU who remain symptomatic\ndespite antihistamine therapy. The study will be conducted at approximately 85 sites across approximately 12 countries. The randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase 2 study is evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of multiple dose regimens of\nbarzolvolimab in patients with CIndU to determine the optimal dosing strategy. Approximately 180 patients in 2 cohorts (differentiated\nby CIndU subtype) including 90 patients with cold urticaria and 90 patients with symptomatic dermographism will be randomly assigned\non a 1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of barzolvolimab at 150 mg every 4 weeks, 300 mg every 8 weeks or placebo during a\n20-week treatment phase. Patients will then enter a follow-up phase for an additional 24 weeks. In addition, the study includes the option\nfor patients who have symptoms following the treatment phase, including patients who were on placebo, to enroll in an open label\nextension where all patients receive 300 mg every 9 weeks of barzolvolimab. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of\npatients with a negative provocation test at week 12 (using TempTest(R) and FricTest(R)). Secondary endpoints include safety and other\nassessments of clinical activity including CTT (Critical Temperature Threshold), CFT (Critical Friction Threshold) and WI-NRS (Worst\nitch numeric rating scale)."

PN is a chronic skin disease characterized by\nthe development of hard, intensely itchy (pruritic) nodules on the skin. Mast cells through their interactions with sensory neurons and\nother immune cells are believed to play an important role in amplifying chronic itch and neuroinflammation, both of which are a\nhallmark of PN. There is currently only one FDA approved therapy for PN, representing an area of significant unmet need. Industry\nsources estimate there are approximately 154,000 patients in the United States with PN who have undergone treatment within the last 12\nmonths and, of these, approximately 75,000 would be biologic-eligible. In December 2021, the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1b\nmulti-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intravenous study designed to assess the safety and treatment effects across\nmultiple dosing cohorts of barzolvolimab in up to 30 patients with PN. Enrolling an intravenous, early stage study in the dermatology\nsetting has been a challenge and the study has taken longer than expected to complete. In February 2023, we closed enrollment at 24\npatients, which we believe will provide sufficient data for analysis to inform future development decisions in PN. Following the\ncompletion of the 24 week follow up period post dosing for patients on study, we plan to present data from the study in the second half of\n2023. Potential future development in PN will utilize the subcutaneous formulation of barzolvolimab.\nEosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)\nIn February 2022, we announced that we will be expanding clinical development of barzolvolimab into eosinophilic esophagitis\n(EoE), the most common type of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease. EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus\ncharacterized by the infiltration of eosinophils. This chronic inflammation can result in trouble swallowing, chest pain, vomiting and\nimpaction of food in the esophagus, a medical emergency. Several studies have suggested that mast cells may be an important driver in\nthe disease, demonstrating that the number and activation state of mast cells are greatly increased in EoE biopsies and that mast cell\nsignatures correlate with markers of inflammation, fibrosis, pain and disease severity. Currently, there is only one FDA approved therapy\nfor EoE, representing an area of significant unmet need. Industry sources estimate there are approximately 160,000 patients in the United\nStates with EoE who have undergone treatment within the last 12 months and, of these, approximately 48,000 would be biologic-eligible.\nGiven the lack of effective therapies for EoE and barzolvolimab’s potential as a mast cell depleting agent, we believe EoE is an important\nindication for future study and plan to initiate a Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled subcutaneous study\ndesigned to assess the treatment effects and safety of barzolvolimab in patients with EoE in the first half of 2023.\nAdditional Barzolvolimab Development Activities\nManufacturing activities to support the introduction of the barzolvolimab subcutaneous formulation into the clinical program have\nbeen completed and, in September 2021, we initiated dosing in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 study designed\nto evaluate the safety of single ascending doses of the subcutaneous formulation of barzolvolimab in healthy volunteers. In February\n2022, we reported that subcutaneous administration of barzolvolimab was well tolerated and that multiple dose levels have been\nidentified that possess promising pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Importantly, subcutaneous delivery of\nbarzolvolimab resulted in dose-dependent, rapid and sustained decreases in serum tryptase compared with placebo and achieved\nsufficient exposure to produce tryptase suppression levels comparable with the levels that generated impressive clinical activity observed\nin the Phase 1 CIndU intravenous study. The Phase 2 multi-dose studies in urticaria are designed to evaluate 75 mg and 150 mg\nadministered every 4 weeks and 300 mg administered every 8 weeks. These doses support a 0.5 to 2 ml injection volume, allowing for a\nsingle injection as barzolvolimab advances towards potential commercialization. In 2022, we initiated transfer of our current\nbarzolvolimab manufacturing process to a contract manufacturing organization to support late-stage trials and to prepare for potential\ncommercialization.\nIn February 2022, we reported interim data after completing the in-life dosing portion of our six-month chronic toxicology study in\nnon-human primates. The only clinically adverse finding at the completion of dosing was a profound impact on spermatogenesis, an\nexpected and well understood effect of KIT inhibition. As a standard part of toxicology studies, some animals from each group continued\nto be observed through a recovery period to understand the reversibility of any adverse findings. Due to the very high concentrations of\nbarzolvolimab at the end of dosing, the recovery period was approximately one year. As we expected, and consistent with previous\nfindings with KIT blocking antibodies, we were pleased to report in December 2022, that during this recovery period spermatogenesis\nfully recovered in all male animals as measured by both sperm count and motility. We expect the final histologic analysis and study\nreport in early 2023. We are encouraged with these findings and believe these data strongly support our Phase 2 studies in urticaria and in\nfuture indications."

Targets are being selected based on new science as well as their compatibility to be used in\nbispecific antibody formats with our existing antibody programs. Development is focused on emerging, important pathways controlling\ninflammatory diseases or immunity to tumors.\nCDX-585\nCDX-585 combines our proprietary highly active PD-1 blockade and anti-ILT4 blockade to prevent immunosuppressive signals in T\ncells and myeloid cells, respectively. ILT4 is emerging as an important immune checkpoint on myeloid cells and is thought to contribute\nto resistance to PD-1 blockade. Interactions of PD-1 and ILT4 with their ligands are known to deliver immune suppressive signals that\ncan attenuate anti-tumor immune responses. The concept behind CDX-585 is to simultaneously inhibit both T cell and myeloid\nsuppressive signals to potentiate the anti-tumor activity of both cell types, and potentially overcome PD-1 resistance. In preclinical\nstudies, CDX-585 was demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of PD-1 signaling in comparison to the approved PD-1 antibody, nivolumab.\nIn addition, CDX-585 activated and promoted a strong inflammatory phenotype in human macrophage and dendritic cell cultures.\nTogether these activities of CDX-585 enhanced the response in a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay above that observed for either\nparental mAb or the combination of the PD-1 and ILT4 mAbs. The in vivo efficacy of CDX-585 was also demonstrated in a melanoma\nhumanized mouse model. CDX-585 has successfully completed GMP manufacturing and IND-enabling studies to support clinical\ndevelopment. CDX-585 will initially be developed for the treatment of solid tumors either as monotherapy or in combination with other\noncologic treatments and is expected to enter the clinic in 2023 in patients with advanced malignancies.\nCDX-527\nCDX-527 used our proprietary highly active anti-PD-L1 and CD27 human antibodies to couple CD27 co-stimulation with blockade\nof the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway to help prime and activate anti-tumor T cell responses through CD27 co-stimulation, while preventing PD-1\ninhibitory signals that subvert the immune response. In the summer of 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with\nadvanced or metastatic solid tumors that had progressed during or after standard of care therapy to be followed by tumor-specific\nexpansion cohorts. Enrollment to the dose escalation portion was successfully completed and an expansion cohort in patients with\ncheckpoint naïve ovarian cancer was initiated. In November 2022, we provided an update on the study. With multiple clinical trials\nactively recruiting in ovarian cancer, enrollment to the expansion cohort did not meet our internal timelines and a review of the results\ndid not meet internal hurdles for proceeding and we closed enrollment to the study and discontinued the program.\nOther programs:\nCDX-1140\nCDX-1140 is a fully human agonist monoclonal antibody targeted to CD40, a key activator of immune response, which is found on\ndendritic cells, macrophages and B cells and is also expressed on many cancer cells. A Phase 1 study was conducted in patients with\nrecurrent, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and B cell lymphomas. An MTD of 1.5 mg/kg was established and clinical activity\nwas observed both as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. Despite evidence of clinical benefit, questions remain to\nbe answered about CDX-1140, and the broader CD40 agonist class, regarding the best clinical settings, regimens, and possible\ncombinations before advancing into additional Celldex-sponsored studies. Given our pipeline priorities and resource requirements, in\nAugust of 2022, we announced that we are not progressing further Company-sponsored studies at this time and are exploring these\nquestions in third-party sponsored studies.\nPartnerships\nWe may enter into co-development and commercialization partnerships for any of our programs where appropriate. In the past, we\nhave entered into collaborative partnership agreements with pharmaceutical and other companies and organizations that provided\nfinancial and other resources, including capabilities in research, development, manufacturing, and sales and marketing, to support our\nresearch and development programs and may enter into more of them in the future."

If we fail to meet our\nobligations under these agreements, they could terminate, and we might need to enter into relationships with other collaborators and to\nspend additional time, money and other valuable resources in the process. We cannot predict whether our collaborators will continue\ntheir development efforts or, if they do, whether their efforts will achieve success. Many of our collaborators face the same kinds of risks\nand uncertainties in their businesses that we face. A delay or setback to a partner will, at a minimum, delay the commercialization of any\naffected drug candidates, and may ultimately prevent it. Moreover, any partner could breach its agreement with us or otherwise not use\nbest efforts to promote our products. A partner may choose to pursue alternative technologies or products that compete with our\ntechnologies or drug candidates. In either case, if a partner failed to successfully develop one of our drug candidates, we would need to\nfind another partner. Our ability to do so would depend upon our legal right to do so at the time and whether the product remained\ncommercially viable.\nResearch Collaboration and License Agreements\nWe have entered into license agreements whereby we have received licenses or options to license technology, specified patents\nand/or patent applications. These license and collaboration agreements generally provide for royalty payments equal to specified\npercentages of product sales, annual license maintenance fees, continuing patent prosecution costs and potential future milestone\npayments to third parties upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Summarized below are\nour significant research collaboration and license agreements for our current clinical drug candidates.\nYale University (Yale)\nUnder a license agreement with Yale, we may be required to make a one-time payment to Yale of $3.0 million with respect to\nbarzolvolimab upon achievement of a specified commercial milestone. In addition, we may be required to pay a low single-digit royalty\non annual worldwide net sales of barzolvolimab. Unless earlier terminated by us or Yale, the Yale license agreement is due to expire no\nlater than May 2038 but may expire earlier on a country-by-country basis under specified circumstances.\nCompetition\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.\nMany of the products that we are attempting to develop and commercialize will be competing with existing therapies. Other companies\nare pursuing the development of new therapies that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting and may compete\ndirectly with our drug candidates. We face competition from companies, major universities and research institutions in the United States\nand abroad, including a number of large pharmaceutical companies, as well as firms specialized in the development and production of\ntargeted therapies and immune modulators. Some of our competitors possess substantially greater financial, technical and human\nresources than we do.\nThe competitors of which we are aware that have initiated a Phase 3 study or have obtained marketing approval for a potentially\ncompetitive drug to barzolvolimab for treatment of CSU, CIndU, PN and EoE include: Allakos (lirentelimab for EoE), AstraZeneca\n(Fasenra for CSU), Galderma/Chugai (nemolizumab for PN), Genentech (fenebrutinib for CSU), Leo Pharma (Adbry for AD), Novartis\n(ligelizumab for CSU, CIndU and food allergy; remibrutinib for CSU), Regeneron/Sanofi (Dupixent for CSU, CIndU, PN and EoE), and\nTrevi Therapeutics (nalbuphine for PN).\nOur competitors may utilize discovery technologies and techniques or partner with collaborators in order to develop products more\nrapidly or successfully than us or our collaborators are able to. In addition, some competitors have significantly greater experience than\nwe have in conducting preclinical and nonclinical testing and human clinical trials of drug candidates, scaling up manufacturing\noperations and obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and manufacturing facilities. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in\nobtaining regulatory approval for drugs more rapidly than we do. If we obtain regulatory approval and commence commercial sales of\nour drug candidates, we also will compete with respect to manufacturing efficiency and sales and marketing capabilities, areas in which\nwe currently have limited experience.\nIn addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek\npatent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies and may establish exclusive collaborative or licensing\nrelationships with our competitors. Moreover, technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be\nacquired or licensed by our competitors, thereby preventing us from obtaining technology on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We\nwill also compete for the services of third parties that may have already developed or acquired internal"

We will require substantial capital resources to complete development of some or all of our drug\ncandidates, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market our drug candidates. In order to secure\ncapital resources, we anticipate having to sell additional capital stock, which would dilute existing stockholders. We may also attempt to\nobtain funds through research grants and agreements with commercial collaborators. However, these types of funding are uncertain\nbecause they are at the discretion of the organizations and companies that control the funds. As a result, we may not receive any funds\nfrom grants or collaborations. Alternatively, we may borrow funds from commercial lenders, likely at high interest rates, which would\nincrease the risk of any investment in us.\nManufacturing\nWe are a research and development company and have limited experience in commercial manufacturing. Our ability to conduct late-\nstage clinical trials, as well as manufacture and commercialize our drug candidates, depends on the ability of Contract Manufacturing\nOrganizations (CMOs) to manufacture our drug candidates on a large scale at a competitive cost and in accordance with current Good\nManufacturing Practices (cGMP) and U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements, as applicable. We also rely on CMOs for labeling and\nstorage for studies inside and outside the US. In order for us to establish our own commercial manufacturing facility, we would require\nsubstantial additional funds and would need to make facility modifications, hire and retain significant additional personnel and comply\nwith cGMP regulations applicable to such a facility. The commercial manufacturing facility would also need to be licensed for the\nproduction of our drug candidates by the FDA and meet other regulatory standards. We therefore work with CMOs under established\nmanufacturing arrangements that comply with the FDA’s requirements and other regulatory standards, although there is no assurance that\nthe manufacturing will be successful.\nWe operate our own cGMP manufacturing facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, to produce drug substance for our current and\nplanned early-stage clinical trials. Our Fall River manufacturing facility has 250L and 1000L bioreactor capacity and is able to\nmanufacture in compliance with FDA and EU regulations, allowing us to distribute drug candidates to clinical sites in the U.S., EU and\nROW for early-stage clinical trials. We have manufactured barzolvolimab and CDX-585 drug substance in our Fall River facility for our\ncurrent and planned Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. All products are then filled at CMOs. Any manufacturing failures or compliance\nissues at contract manufacturers could cause delays in our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies for these drug candidates.\nOur barzolvolimab drug product is currently administered both intravenously and subcutaneously. In 2022, we manufactured\nbarzolvolimab drug substance at our Fall River facility in subcutaneous form then filled at a CMO to support ongoing and planned\nclinical trials. The subcutaneous formulation will allow for a potential self-administration at home setting versus the need for intravenous\ndosing in a hospital or clinic setting. The subcutaneous form could improve the patient experience if the product becomes available\ncommercially. In 2022, we initiated a transfer of our current barzolvolimab manufacturing process to a CMO to allow us to produce\nlarger batches in support of late-stage trials and to prepare for potential commercialization. We believe that barzolvolimab can be scaled\nup to permit manufacturing in commercial quantities. However, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in\nscaling up the manufacturing processes.\nWhile we believe that there is currently sufficient capacity worldwide for the production of our potential products through CMOs,\nestablishing long-term relationships with contract manufacturers and securing multiple sources for the necessary quantities of clinical\nand commercial materials required can be a challenge due to increasing industry demand for CMO services. Qualifying the initial source\nof clinical and ultimately commercial material is a time consuming and expensive process due to the highly regulated nature of the\npharmaceutical/biotech industry. These costs may be mitigated by the economies of scale realized in commercial manufacture and\nproduct sales. The key difficulty in qualifying more than one source for each product is the duplicated time and expense in doing so\nwithout the potential to mitigate these costs if the secondary source is never utilized."

As a result, we may not be\nable to detect a variety of problems that may arise and may face additional costs in the process of interfacing with and monitoring the\nprogress of our contract manufacturers. If third-party manufacturers fail to meet our manufacturing needs in an acceptable manner or fail\nto comply with regulatory requirements, we would face delays and additional costs while we develop internal manufacturing capabilities\nor find alternate third-party manufacturers. It may not be possible to have multiple third-party manufacturers ready to supply us with\nneeded material at all or without incurring significant costs.\nCommercial Organization\nWe have limited commercial experience in marketing, sales, distribution and product reimbursement. We have the capability to\nprovide current and future market insights to our research and development organization regarding our potential drug candidates. In the\nfuture, we may choose to expand our commercial team and build a full-scale commercial organization which we believe could provide us\nthe opportunity to retain marketing rights to our drug candidates and commercialize such products ourselves where we deem appropriate\nor pursue strategic partnerships to develop, sell, market and distribute our drug candidates where we deem appropriate.\nPatents, Licenses and Proprietary Rights\nIn general, our intellectual property strategy is to protect our technology by filing patent applications and obtaining patent rights\ncovering our own technology, both in the United States and in foreign countries that we consider important to our business. In addition,\nwe have acquired and will seek to acquire as needed or desired, exclusive rights of others through assignment or license to complement\nour portfolio of patent rights. We also rely on trade secrets, unpatented know-how and technological expertise and innovation to develop\nand maintain our competitive position.\nPatents\nThe successful development and marketing of products by us will depend in part on our ability to create and maintain intellectual\nproperty, including patent rights. We are the owner or exclusive licensee to proprietary patent positions in the areas of immunotherapy\ntechnologies and antibody technologies. Although we continue to pursue patent protection for our products, no assurance can be given\nthat any pending application will issue as a patent, that any issued patent will have a scope that will be of commercial benefit or that we\nwill be able to successfully enforce our patent position against infringers. We routinely review our patent portfolio and adjust our\nstrategies for prosecution and maintenance of individual cases according to a number of factors, including program priorities, stage of\ndevelopment and patent term.\nThe key patents and patent applications owned by us or licensed to us that we consider important to our current clinical programs\ninclude the following (except where stated otherwise, the indicated and estimated patent expiry dates are the estimated normal\nexpirations if all maintenance fees and annuities are paid when due, and do not include any possible additional terms for Patent Term\nAdjustments (PTAs), Patent Term Extensions (PTEs), other term extensions or Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs), if these\nmay be secured in due course):\n●\nWe own a portfolio of patents and patent applications directed to barzolvolimab and other anti-KIT receptor antibodies. These\npatents and patent applications include claims directed to particular anti-KIT antibody compositions of matter, including\nbarzolvolimab compositions of matter, and methods of using such antibodies. A composition of matter patent has been issued in\nthe U.S. which would have an estimated patent expiry date in 2034 (this includes additional term due to PTA, but does not\ninclude any PTE if this may be secured in due course) and further U.S. patent applications are pending. Patents have also been\nissued in Europe, Japan, Canada, China, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, India,the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation,\nSingapore and certain other countries. Where issued the foregoing would have estimated normal patent expiry dates ranging\nfrom 2032 to 2033.

If any of these actions is successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license\nin order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such action\nor that any license required under any such third-party patent would be made available on acceptable terms or at all. We believe that there\nmay be significant litigation in the biotechnology industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. If we become involved\nin that litigation, we could consume substantial resources.\nLicenses\nWe have entered into significant license agreements relating to technologies that are being developed by us. Typically, institutions\nhave granted us an exclusive worldwide license (with right to sublicense) to make, use and sell products embodying the licensed\ntechnology, subject to the reservation by the licensor of a non-exclusive right to use the technologies for non-commercial research\npurposes. Generally, the term of each license is through the expiration of the last of the patents issued with respect to the technologies\ncovered by the license and/or a specified period from first commercial sale on a territory-by- territory basis. We have generally agreed to\nuse reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products and to achieve specified milestones and pay license fees,\nmilestone payments and royalties based on the net sales of the licensed products or to pay a percentage of sublicense income. If we\nbreach our obligations, the licensor has the right to terminate the license, and, in some cases, convert the license to a non-exclusive\nlicense. Generally, we control and are responsible for the cost of defending the patent rights of the technologies that we license."

We require each of our\nemployees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting\nrelationship with us. The agreements generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of employment or in\nproviding services to us and all confidential information developed by, or made known to, the individual during the term of the\nrelationship shall be the exclusive property of us and shall be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in limited\nspecified circumstances. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our\ninformation in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such confidential information.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur activities and products are significantly regulated by a number of governmental entities, including the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration, or FDA, in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. These entities regulate, among other\nthings, the manufacture, testing, safety, effectiveness, labeling, documentation, advertising and sale of our products. We must obtain\nregulatory approval from the FDA and comparable authorities in other countries, as applicable, for our drug candidates before we can\ncommercialize such drugs in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Product development within this regulatory framework takes a number of\nyears and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Many drug candidates that initially appear promising ultimately do not reach\nthe market because they are found to be unsafe or ineffective when tested. Our inability to commercialize a product would impair our\nability to earn future revenues.\nFDA Approval Process\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA,\nthe Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the\nsubsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial\ntime and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product\ndevelopment process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions,\nsuch as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of untitled\nor warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of\ngovernment contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the\nfollowing:\n●\ncompletion of preclinical studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP,\nregulations;\n●\nsubmission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical\ntrials may begin;\n●\napproval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;\n●\nperformance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to\nestablish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for each indication;\n●\nsubmission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or a biologics license application, or BLA, as applicable;\n●\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;"

Moreover, during the regulatory process, new or changed drug approval policies may cause unanticipated delays or rejection of\nour product. We may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals within a reasonable period of time, if at all, or avoid delays or other\nproblems in testing our products. Moreover, even if we received regulatory approval for a product, the approval may require limitations\non use, which could restrict the size of the potential market for the product.\nClinical Trials\nThe FDA provides that human clinical trials may begin 30 days after receipt and review of an IND application, unless the FDA\nrequests additional information or changes to the study protocol within that period. An IND must be sponsored and filed for each of our\nproposed drug candidates. Authorization to conduct clinical trials in no way assures that the FDA will ultimately approve the product.\nClinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases. In a Phase 1 trial, the product is given to a small number of patients to\ntest for safety (adverse effects), determine a recommended Phase 2 dose(s) and evaluate any signals of efficacy. Phase 2 trials are\nconducted on a limited group of the target patient population; safety, optimal dosage and efficacy are studied. A Phase 3 trial is\nperformed in a large patient population, generally over a wide geographic area to provide evidence for the safety and efficacy of the\nproduct. The FDA maintains and exercises oversight authority throughout the clinical trial process.\nA product’s safety and effectiveness in one clinical trial is not necessarily indicative of its safety and effectiveness in another clinical\ntrial. Moreover, we may not discover all potential problems with a product even after completing clinical trials on it. Some of our\nproducts and technologies have undergone only preclinical testing. As a result, we do not know whether they are safe or effective for\nhumans. Also, regulatory authorities may decide, contrary to our findings, that a product is unsafe or not as effective in actual use as its\nclinical trial results indicated. This could prevent the product’s widespread use, require its withdrawal from the market or expose us to\nliability. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the\npatients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its\ninstitution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with\nunexpected serious harm to patients. Any such action could materially harm us. Clinical trials are critical to the success of our products\nbut are subject to unforeseen and uncontrollable delay, including delay in enrollment of patients. Any delay in clinical trials could delay\nour commercialization of a product.\nMarketing Approval\nAssuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with\ndetailed information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things,\nare submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. FDA\napproval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. Under federal law, the\nsubmission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee and the sponsor of an approved NDA or\nBLA is also subject to annual prescription drug program fees.\nThe FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs and BLAs within the first 60 days after receipt before accepting them for filing\nbased on the agency’s threshold determination that they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request\nadditional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional\ninformation. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted\nfor filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs\nand BLAs. Most such applications for non-priority products are reviewed within ten to twelve months after filing, and most applications\nfor priority review products, that is, drugs and biologics that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing\ntherapy, are reviewed in six to eight months after filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to\nconsider certain late-submitted information or clarification regarding information already provided in"

The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or biological products or products that present difficult questions of\nsafety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a\nrecommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory\ncommittee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.\nBefore approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The\nFDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP\nrequirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an\nNDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data\nsubmitted.\nThe testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to\ncomplete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could\ndelay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or\nunanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our drug candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or\npreclude us from marketing our products.\nAfter the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA or BLA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter\nor a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biological product with specific\nprescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may\nrequire substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies\nhave been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will resume review and may subsequently\nissue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of\ninformation included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not\nsatisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.\nEven if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications,\nwarnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post- approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be\nconducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after\ncommercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, which can\nmaterially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based\non the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as\nchanges in indications, manufacturing changes and labeling, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.\nSpecial Regulatory Procedures\nFast track designation — The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs and biologics that are\nintended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet\nmedical needs. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug or biologic candidate may request the FDA to designate the\nproduct for a specific indication as a fast track product, concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. A drug that\nreceives fast track designation is eligible for some or all of the following: (i) more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the drug’s\ndevelopment plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval; (ii) more frequent written communication\nfrom the FDA about such things as the design of the proposed clinical trials and use of biomarkers; (iii) eligibility for accelerated\napproval and priority review, if relevant criteria are met; and (iv) “Rolling Review,” which means that a drug company can submit\ncompleted sections of its BLA or NDA for review by the FDA, rather than waiting until every section of the NDA or BLA is completed\nbefore the entire application can be reviewed. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule\nfor the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for\nreviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. In addition, the fast track\ndesignation may be withdrawn by the FDA if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial\nprocess.\nPriority review — Under FDA policies, a drug candidate may be eligible for priority review. The priority review program provides\nfor expedited review or an NDA or BLA, typically within a six to eight month time frame from the time a complete application is\naccepted for filing. Products regulated by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, are eligible"

Products regulated by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, are eligible for priority review if\nthey provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious or life-\nthreatening disease. A fast track designated drug candidate could be eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of\nthe BLA or NDA submission.\nAccelerated approval — Under the law and the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug or biologic for\na serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based on a surrogate\nendpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than\nclinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the\ncompletion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-\napproval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market\non an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review\nby the FDA.\nBreakthrough therapy designation — The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for\napproval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates\nthat the drug candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.\nUnder the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for\na specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate.\nOrphan drug designation — Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended\nto treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the\nUnited States. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval\nprocess. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with\nFDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that\nindication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or\nbiologic for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax\ncredits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.\nPediatric Information\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA, BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data that are\nadequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric\nsubpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.\nThe FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until\nafter approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Under the Food and Drug\nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, the FDA has additional authority to take action against manufacturers not\nadhering to pediatric study requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to\nproducts with orphan drug designation.\nPost Approval\nAny drug or biological products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and\ncontinuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product\nsampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most\nchanges to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.\nThe FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the\nFDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s\nsafety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials\nbe followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug or biologic."

The FDA was also granted new inspection\nauthorities under FDASIA. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before\nbeing implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and\ndocumentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must\ncontinue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.\nOnce an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not\nmaintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product,\nincluding adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory\nrequirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or\nclinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy\nprogram. Other potential consequences include, among other things:\n●\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product\nrecalls;\n●\nfines, untitled and warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;\n●\nrefusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of\nproduct license approvals;\n●\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or\n●\nconsent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal prosecution.\nThe FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and\nbiologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA, the\nOffice of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting\nthe promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant\nliability.\nBiosimilars Law\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to provide for an abbreviated approval\npathway for biological products that demonstrate biosimilarity to a previously-approved biological product. The BPCIA establishes\ncriteria for determining that a product is biosimilar to an already-licensed biologic, or reference product, and establishes a process by\nwhich an abbreviated BLA for a biosimilar product is submitted, reviewed and approved. The BPCIA provides periods of exclusivity that\nprotect a reference product from biosimilars competition. Under the BPCIA, the FDA may not accept a biosimilar application for review\nuntil four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the biosimilar may not be licensed until 12 years after the\nreference product’s approval. Additionally, the BPCIA establishes procedures by which the biosimilar applicant may provide information\nabout its application and product to the reference product sponsor, and by which information about potentially relevant patents is shared\nand litigation over patents may proceed in advance of approval. The BPCIA also provides a period of exclusivity for the first biosimilar\nto be determined by the FDA to be interchangeable with the reference product. The BPCIA applies to our drug candidates and could be\napplied to allow approval of biosimilars to our products.\n21st Century Cures Act\nOn December 13, 2016, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and\npersonalize health care, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased\nfederal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects, including for certain\noncology- directed research. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the National\nInstitutes of Health."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n17\nThe Cures Act also authorizes funding for the “Cancer Moonshot” initiative. The Cancer Moonshot initiative’s strategic goals\nencourage inter-agency cooperation and fund research and innovation to catalyze new scientific breakthroughs, bring new therapies to\npatients and strengthen prevention and diagnosis. This initiative aims to stimulate drug development through the creation of a public-\nprivate partnership with 20 to 30 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to expedite cancer researchers’ access to investigational\nagents and approved drugs. This partnership is designed to permit researchers to obtain drugs and other technologies from a preapproved\n“formulary” list without having to negotiate with each company for individual research projects. We will continue to monitor these\ndevelopments to assess their potential impacts on our business.\nCompanion Diagnostic Review and Approval\nOur drug candidates may rely on the use of a companion diagnostic. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA\nand comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate clearance or approval prior to their\ncommercialization. Based on recent FDA guidance documents and the FDA’s past treatment of companion diagnostics, we believe that\nthe FDA will likely require one or more of our in vitro companion diagnostics to obtain Premarket Approval Application, or PMA, in\nconjunction with approval of the related drug candidate. The receipt and timing of PMA approval may have a significant effect on the\nreceipt and timing of commercial approval for such drug candidates.Currently we rely on third-party collaborators to develop companion\ndiagnostics for our drug candidates.\nThe PMA process is similar to the NDA and BLA processes and is costly, lengthy and uncertain. PMA applications must be\nsupported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and\nmanufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA\napplication typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will\nconduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or\nQSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. If the FDA\nevaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an\napprovable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the\nFDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not\napprovable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is\nnecessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the\nPMA approval may be delayed while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA.\nFurthermore, even after PMA approval is obtained, numerous regulatory requirements apply to the manufacturer of the companion\ndiagnostic. The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. These requirements include: the QSR, labeling\nregulations, the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off label” uses, the medical device reporting\nregulation, and the reports of corrections and removals regulation. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of\nenforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall\nor seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for PMA of new\nproducts; and withdrawing PMAs already granted.\nFederal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products, several other types of federal and state laws\nhave been applied to restrict certain marketing business practices in the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries in recent years.\nThese laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes and false claims laws, data\nprivacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to health care providers.\nApplicable state law may be broader in scope than federal law and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services\nreimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws\ndescribed above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil\nand/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government health care\nprograms, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or\nrestructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To\nthe extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, which may include, for\ninstance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of\ncorporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to health care professionals."

It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or\nauthorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political\ncandidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity. In many countries, the\nhealth care professionals we may interact with may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official.\nForeign Regulation\nIn order to market any therapeutic or diagnostic product outside of the United States, we need to comply with numerous and varying\nregulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing\nauthorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we need to\nobtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or\nmarketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product\ntesting and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be\nlonger than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but\na failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.\nUnder the EU regulatory system, we will submit most of our marketing authorization applications under the centralized procedure.\nThe centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology, or are for the treatment of cancer, or officially\ndesignated as ‘orphan medicines.’ The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all\nEU member states. As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a drug candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a\nspecific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”)\ngrants orphan medicinal product designation to promote the development of products that may offer therapeutic benefits for life-\nthreatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy\neconomic and marketing benefits, including a 10-year market exclusivity period for the approved indication, but not for the same\nproduct, unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-\ndesignated product.\nOther Regulatory Processes\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions\ngoverning the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.\nIn addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may\nsignificantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or\nwhether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will change or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.\nThird-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory\napproval. Sales of any of our drug candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the drugs will be\ncovered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as commercial health\ninsurers, such as managed care organizations. The process for determining reimbursement rates is separate from the payor coverage\ndecision. Therefore, despite obtaining coverage, reimbursement rates may be lower than expected, which can result in larger out-of-\npocket payments for the patient.\nIn order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any drug that might be approved for sale, we need to conduct analyses and\npharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the incremental medical benefit over and above the generally-accepted standard of\ncare and cost-effectiveness of the drug. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary, provide insufficient incremental\nmedical benefit, or may not be deemed cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an\nadequate reimbursement rate will be approved.\nThe containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have\nbeen a focus in this effort. Given that the Inflation Reduction Act is now in place, potential implications for the biopharma industry are\nbeing assessed. In the meantime, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services"

If\nthese third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our\ndrugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement and/or restrictions in formulary placement\nmay be such that they would significantly limit projected sales volumes. In addition to third-party payors, we will also need to negotiate\nformulary placement with hospitals, health systems and certain independent delivery networks. Such negotiations may be more\nprotracted than anticipated and may be compromised because of similar considerations, relating to insufficient incremental medical\nbenefit and/or cost-effectiveness.\nPricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. For example, certain EU member states may approve a \nspecific price and volume for a drug product after which incremental revenues or profits need to be paid back by way of rebates. They \nmay also institutionalize utilization restrictions,  curb physicians’ drug budgets, provide conditional reimbursement schemes that require \nadditional evidence to be generated post-marketing authorization, etc. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, including \nprescription drugs, has been evident in EU markets for some time and is now a major focus of federal and state governments in the U.S. \nAs a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the pricing and reimbursement of new drugs, despite regulatory efforts to bring \ndrugs to market sooner. Cross- border trade has existed for some time in the EU, allowing pharmacies in one country to import, at a \nlower price, drug from another country, further exerting pricing pressures across the EU. A proposal to allow importation of less \nexpensive drugs from Canada to the U.S. has been under consideration in U.S. Congress. There can be no assurance that any country that \nhas price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any \nof our drugs.\nThe marketability of any drugs for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if third-party payors and/or\nhospital administrators fail to provide adequate coverage, reimbursement or formulary placement. Coverage policies, third-party\nreimbursement rates and drug pricing regulations may change in the future. In addition, the States may continue to consider legislation of\ntheir own which could further restrict the ability to freely price drugs and/or curb utilization in the U.S. Even if favorable coverage and\nreimbursement status is attained for one or more drugs for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and\nreimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nEmployees\nAs a mission driven organization, we believe the engagement and dedication of our employees is central to our success and employ\ntalented individuals who have the skills and expertise to help us achieve our goals.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 148 full-time employees, 26 of whom have Ph.D. and/or M.D. degrees. Of these employees, 123\nwere engaged in or directly support research and development activities.

We\nemploy a pay for performance philosophy. Annual salary increases, incentive bonuses and stock option grants are available to all\nemployees and are based on merit and include individual and corporate performance factors.\nMuch of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and\ncontinue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce.

We had an\naccumulated deficit of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022. Until, and unless, we complete clinical trials and other development\nactivity, and receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, for our drug candidates, we cannot sell our drugs and will\nnot have product revenue. We expect to spend substantial funds to continue the research, development and testing of our products that are\nin the preclinical and clinical testing stages of development and to prepare to commercialize products in anticipation of FDA approval.\nTherefore, for the foreseeable future, we will have to fund all of our operations and development expenditures from cash on hand, equity\nor debt financings, licensing fees and grants. Additional financing will be required to meet our liquidity needs. If we do not succeed in\nraising additional funds on acceptable terms, we might not be able to complete planned preclinical and clinical trials or obtain approval\nof any drug candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product\ndevelopment, reduce or forego sales and marketing efforts, forego attractive business opportunities or curtail operations. Any additional\nsources of financing could involve the issuance of our equity securities, which would have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. No\nassurance can be given that additional financing will be available to us when needed on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability in the future. Failure to achieve profitability could diminish our\nability to sustain operations, pay dividends on our common stock, obtain additional required funds and make required payments on our\npresent or future indebtedness.\nWe expect to incur future losses and we may never become profitable.\nWe have incurred operating losses of $115.2 million, $71.2 million and $63.4 million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and\nexpect to incur an operating loss in 2023 and beyond. We believe that operating losses will continue in 2023 and beyond because we are\nplanning to incur significant costs associated with the development of our drug candidates. During the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2021 and 2020, we incurred $23.8 million, $8.0 million and $4.9 million in clinical trial expense and $4.5 million, $1.7 million and $1.2\nmillion in contract manufacturing expense. Our net losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on, among other things,\nour stockholders’ equity, total assets and working capital. We expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year,\nand that such fluctuations may be substantial. We cannot predict when we will become profitable, if at all.\nWe will need additional capital to fund our operations, including the development, manufacture and potential commercialization of\nour drug candidates. If we do not have or cannot raise additional capital when needed, we may be unable to develop and ultimately\ncommercialize our drug candidates successfully.\nWe expect to incur significant costs as we develop our drug candidates. The continuing development and commercialization of our\ndrug candidates requires additional capital beyond our current resources. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities of $305.0 million. During the next twelve months and beyond, we will take further steps to raise additional capital\nto fund our long-term liquidity needs. Our capital raising activities may include, but may not be limited to, one or more of the following:\n●\nlicensing of drug candidates with existing or new collaborative partners;\n●\npossible business combinations;\n●\nissuance of debt; or\n●\nissuance of common stock or other securities via private placements or public offerings.\nWhile we may seek capital through a number of means, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on\nacceptable terms, if at all, and our negotiating position in capital-raising efforts may worsen as existing resources are used. There is also\nno assurance that we will be able to enter into further collaborative relationships. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to our\nstockholders; debt financing, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to\noperate as a business; and licensing or strategic collaborations may result in royalties or other terms which reduce our economic potential\nfrom drug candidates under development.

If we elect to pay future milestone consideration in cash, we would likely need to raise\nadditional capital.\nIn connection with the agreement pursuant to which we acquired Kolltan in 2016 (the “Merger Agreement”) as modified by the\ndefinitive settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) we entered on July 15, 2022 related to litigation arising from the Kolltan\nmerger, in the event that certain specified milestones related to the successful completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of CDX-0159 or\nregulatory approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency of certain drug candidates are\nachieved, we will be required to pay to the former stockholders of Kolltan milestone payments, which milestone payments may be made,\nat our sole election, in cash, in shares of our common stock or a combination of both, subject to provisions of the Merger Agreement.\nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, as of December 31, 2022 we may be obligated to make milestone payments of up to $65,000,000.\nIf we elect to issue shares of our common stock to make these milestone payments, you will experience further dilution.\nWe may require additional capital to fund any milestone payments in cash, depending on the facts and circumstances at the time\nsuch payments become due. The number of shares of our common stock issuable in connection with a milestone payment, if any, will be\ndetermined based on the average closing price per share of our common stock for the five trading day period ending three calendar days\nprior to the achievement of such milestone. If we elect to pay the Kolltan Milestones in shares of our common stock, our stockholders\nwould experience substantial dilution.\nU.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.\nOn March 27, 2020, in response to COVID-19, U.S. Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the\n“CARES Act”). The CARES Act modified the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) by, among other things, eliminating the limitation on the\ndeduction of net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income for tax years beginning before January 1, 2021, and increasing\nthe amount of interest expense that may be deducted from 30% to 50% of adjusted taxable income for tax years beginning in 2019 or\n2020. We continue to examine the impact of this tax reform legislation, as well as any additional regulatory guidance that may be issued,\nmay have on our business. For example, change of administration could result in additional tax legislative activity that could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company.\nRisks Related to Development and Regulatory Approval of Drug Candidates\nOur long-term success depends heavily on our ability to fund and complete the research and development activities and obtain\nregulatory approval for our program assets.\nOnly a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. Clinical failure\ncan occur at any stage of clinical development. Clinical and preclinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may\ndecide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical trials. In addition, data obtained from trials are\nsusceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit or prevent\nregulatory approval. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same\nresults or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a drug candidate. As part of development, we also\nmust show that we can formulate and manufacture our product candidates in compliance with regulatory requirements.\nWe will need substantial additional financing to complete the development of our drug candidates and comply with the regulatory\nrequirements governing this process. Further, even if we complete the development of our drug candidates and gain marketing approvals\nfrom the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in a timely manner, we cannot be sure that such drug candidates will be\ncommercially successful in the pharmaceutical market. If the results of clinical trials, the anticipated or actual timing of marketing\napprovals, or the market acceptance of any of our drug candidates, if approved, do not meet the expectations of investors or public\nmarket analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n25\nOur drug candidates are subject to extensive regulatory scrutiny.\nAll of our drug candidates are at various stages of development, and our activities and drug candidates are significantly regulated by\na number of governmental entities, including the FDA in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. These\nentities regulate, among other things, the manufacture, testing, safety, effectiveness, labeling, documentation, advertising and sale of\ndrugs and drug candidates. We or our partners must obtain regulatory approval for a drug candidate in all of these areas before we can\ncommercialize any of our drug candidates. Product development within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves\nthe expenditure of substantial resources. This process typically requires extensive preclinical and clinical testing, which may take longer\nor cost more than we anticipate, and may prove unsuccessful due to numerous factors. Many drug candidates that initially appear\npromising ultimately do not reach the market because they are found to be unsafe or ineffective when tested. Companies in the\npharmaceutical, biotechnology and immunotherapeutic drug industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even\nafter obtaining promising results in earlier trials. Our inability to commercialize a drug candidate would impair our ability to earn future\nrevenues.\nIf our drug candidates do not pass required tests for safety and effectiveness, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval and\nderive commercial revenue from them.\nIn order to succeed, we will need to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates. The FDA has not approved any of our drug\ncandidates for sale to date. Our drug candidates are in various stages of preclinical and clinical testing. Preclinical tests are performed at\nan early stage of a product’s development and provide information about a drug candidate’s safety and effectiveness before initiating\nhuman clinical trials. Preclinical tests can last years. If a product passes its preclinical tests satisfactorily and we determine that further\ndevelopment is warranted, we would file an IND application for the product with the FDA, and, if the FDA gives its approval, we would\nbegin Phase 1 clinical tests. Phase 1 testing generally lasts between 6 and 24 months. If Phase 1 test results are satisfactory and the FDA\ngives its approval, we can begin Phase 2 clinical tests. Phase 2 testing generally lasts between 6 and 36 months. If Phase 2 test results are\nsatisfactory and the FDA gives its approval, we can begin Phase 3 pivotal studies. Phase 3 studies generally last between 12 and 48\nmonths. Once clinical testing is completed and a BLA or NDA is filed with the FDA, it may take more than a year to receive FDA\napproval.\nIn all cases we must show that a drug candidate is both safe and effective before the FDA, or drug approval agencies of other\ncountries where we intend to sell the product, will approve it for sale. Our research and testing programs must comply with drug\napproval requirements both in the United States and in other countries, since we are developing our drug candidates with the intention to,\nor could later decide to, commercialize them both in the U.S. and abroad. A product may fail for safety or effectiveness at any stage of\nthe testing process. A major risk we face is the possibility that none of our products under development will come through the testing\nprocess to final approval for sale, with the result that we cannot derive any commercial revenue from them after investing significant\namounts of capital in multiple stages of preclinical and clinical testing.\nSuccess in early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot assure you that any of the\nclinical trials that we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain regulatory approval.\nThe results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later- stage clinical trials, and interim\nresults of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Preclinical and clinical data are susceptible to various interpretations and\nanalyses, and many companies that have believed their drug candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and early-stage\nclinical trials have nonetheless failed to replicate such results in later-stage clinical trials and subsequently failed to obtain marketing\napproval. Drug candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through\npreclinical and initial clinical trials, even if certain analyses of primary or secondary endpoints in those early trials showed trends\ntowards efficacy. Later-stage clinical trials with larger numbers of patients or longer durations of therapy may also reveal safety concerns\nthat were not identified in earlier smaller or shorter trials. Our failure to demonstrate efficacy and safety data sufficient to support\nmarketing approval for any of our other drug candidates would substantially harm our business, prospectus, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nProduct testing is critical to the success of our drug candidates but subject to delay or cancellation if we have difficulty enrolling\npatients.\nAs our portfolio of drug candidates moves from preclinical testing to clinical testing, and then through progressively larger and more\ncomplex clinical trials, we will need to enroll an increasing number of patients with the appropriate characteristics.

The factors that affect our ability to enroll patients are largely uncontrollable and include principally the following:\n●\nthe nature of the clinical test;\n●\nthe size of the patient population;\n●\npatients’ willingness to receive a placebo or less effective treatment on the control arm of a clinical study;\n●\nthe distance between patients and clinical test sites; and\n●\nthe eligibility criteria for the trial.\nIf we cannot enroll patients as needed, our costs may increase, or we may be forced to delay or terminate testing for a product.\nWe may have delays in commencing, enrolling and completing our clinical trials, and we may not complete them at all.\nWe have not completed the clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval to market any of our drug candidates in development.\nClinical trials for our products in development may be delayed or terminated as a result of many factors, including the following:\n●\ninability to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs) and trial sites, the\nterms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n●\ndifficulty in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n●\ninability to maintain necessary supplies of study drug and comparator to maintain predicted enrollment rates at clinical trial\nsites;\n●\npatients failing to complete clinical trials due to dissatisfaction with the treatment, side effects or other reasons;\n●\nfailure by regulators to authorize us to commence a clinical trial;\n●\nsuspension or termination by regulators of clinical research for many reasons, including concerns about patient safety, bias or\nfailure of our contract manufacturers to comply with cGMP requirements;\n●\ndelays or failure to obtain clinical supply for our products necessary to conduct clinical trials from contract manufacturers,\nincluding commercial grade-clinical supply for our Phase 3 clinical trials;\n●\ninability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial\nprograms, including some that may be for the same indication as our product candidates;\n●\ndrug candidates demonstrating a lack of efficacy during clinical trials;\n●\ninability to continue to fund clinical trials or to find a partner to fund the clinical trials;\n●\ncompetition with ongoing clinical trials and scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians; and\n●\ndelays in completing data collection and analysis for clinical trials.\nAny delay or failure to commence, enroll or complete clinical trials, fulfill regulatory requirements and obtain FDA approval for our\ndrug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our cost to develop and commercialize, and our ability to generate revenue from,\na particular drug candidate."

In pharmaceutical development, many drugs that initially show promise in early-stage testing are later found to cause\nside effects that prevent further development of the drug. Currently marketed therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory\ndiseases are generally limited to some extent by their toxicity. In addition, some of our drug candidates would be chronic therapies or be\nused in pediatric populations, for which safety concerns may be particularly important. Use of our drug candidates as monotherapies may\nalso result in adverse events consistent in nature with those associated with other marketed therapies. In addition, when used in\ncombination with other marketed therapies, our drug candidates may exacerbate adverse events associated with the marketed therapy.\nOur drug candidates, including barzolvolimab, are monoclonal antibodies, which are biologics.  Side effects from biologics may \ninclude hypersensitivity; severe reactions such as anaphylaxis or cytokine release syndrome; immune-mediated adverse reactions that \nmay occur in any organ system or tissue, such as pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, and dermatologic reactions; \nas well as infusion-related reactions, cellulitis, sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, fatigue, rash, and diarrhea.  \nMost biologics, including some of our drug candidates, are injected, either subcutaneously or intravenously. There are risks inherent\nin subcutaneous injections, such as injection-site reactions (including redness, itching, swelling, pain, and tenderness) and other side\neffects. In addition, there are risks inherent in intravenous administration such as infusion-related reactions (including nausea, pyrexia,\nrash, and dyspnea). These and other complications or side effects could harm further development and/or commercialization of our\nantibody-based products and product candidates utilizing this method of administration.\nIn addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidates, the administration of\nbiologics frequently causes an immune response, sometimes resulting in the creation of antibodies against the drug candidate which can\nimpact the safety and/or efficacy associated with the treatment.\nWe may expend our resources to pursue a particular drug candidate or indication and forgo the opportunity to capitalize on drug\ncandidates or indications that may ultimately be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we intend to focus on developing drug candidates for specific\nindications that we identify as most likely to succeed, in terms of both their potential for regulatory approval and commercialization. As a\nresult, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other drug candidates or for other indications that may prove to have greater\ncommercial potential.\nOur resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial drugs or profitable market opportunities.\nOur spending on current and future research and development programs and drug candidates for specific indications may not yield any\ncommercially viable drug candidates. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular drug\ncandidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that drug candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in\ncases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to the drug\ncandidate.\nWe may be unable to manage multiple late-stage clinical trials for a variety of drug candidates simultaneously.\nAs our current clinical trials progress, we may need to manage multiple late-stage clinical trials simultaneously in order to continue\ndeveloping all of our current products. The management of late-stage clinical trials is more complex and time consuming than early-stage\ntrials. Typically, early-stage trials involve several hundred patients in no more than 10 to 30 clinical sites. Late-stage (Phase 3) trials may\ninvolve up to several thousand patients in up to several hundred clinical sites and may require facilities in several countries. Therefore,\nthe project management required to supervise and control such an extensive program in a compliant manner is substantially larger than\nearly-stage programs. As the need for these resources is not known until some months before the trials begin, it is necessary to recruit\nlarge numbers of experienced and talented individuals very quickly.

To achieve\nthis, one or more of our drug development programs may be dependent on the development and commercialization of a companion\ndiagnostic by us or by third-party collaborators. Companion diagnostics are developed in conjunction with clinical programs for the\nassociated drug candidate. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation as medical devices and must themselves be approved for\nmarketing by the FDA or certain other foreign regulatory agencies before the related drug candidate may be commercialized. The\napproval of a companion diagnostic as part of the product label will limit the use of the drug candidate to only those patients who express\nthe specific biomarker it was developed to detect. We or our third-party collaborators may also experience delays in developing a\nsustainable, reproducible and scalable manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners or negotiating insurance\nreimbursement for such companion diagnostic, all of which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our\ndrugs on a timely or profitable basis, if at all.\nWe and our third-party collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval for these companion\ndiagnostics. Any delay or failure by us or third-party collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic\ncould delay or prevent approval of our related drug candidates or, if regulatory approval is obtained, delay or limit our ability to\ncommercialize our related drug candidates.\nAny delay in obtaining regulatory approval would have an adverse impact on our ability to earn future revenues.\nIt is possible that none of the drug candidates that we develop will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us to begin\ncommercializing them. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but in general takes years following the\ncommencement of clinical trials, depending upon the nature of the drug candidate. Any analysis we perform of data from clinical\nactivities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from the\nparticular drug candidate including, but not limited to, loss of patent term during the approval period. Furthermore, if we, or our partners,\ndo not reach the market with our products before our competitors offer products for the same or similar uses, or if we, or our partners, are\nnot effective in marketing our products, our revenues from product sales, if any, will be reduced.\nWe face intense competition in our development activities. We face competition from many companies in the United States and\nabroad, including a number of large pharmaceutical companies, firms specialized in the development and production of vaccines,\nadjuvants and vaccine and immunotherapeutic delivery systems and major universities and research institutions. Most of our competitors\nhave substantially greater resources, more extensive experience in conducting preclinical studies and clinical testing and obtaining\nregulatory approvals for their products, greater operating experience, greater research and development and marketing capabilities and\ngreater production capabilities than those of ours. These companies might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive\nproducts more rapidly than we can for our products, especially if we experience any delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals.\nWe may enter into collaboration agreements for the licensing, development and ultimate commercialization of some of our drug\ncandidates including, where appropriate, for our lead drug candidates. In such cases, we will depend greatly on our third-party\ncollaborators to license, develop and commercialize such drug candidates, and they may not meet our expectations.\nWe may enter into co-development and commercialization partnerships for our drug candidates where appropriate. The process of\nidentifying collaborators and negotiating collaboration agreements for the licensing, development and ultimate commercialization of\nsome of our drug candidates may cause delays and increased costs. We may not be able to enter into collaboration agreements on terms\nfavorable to us or at all. Furthermore, some of those agreements may give substantial responsibility over our drug candidates to the\ncollaborator. Some collaborators may be unable or unwilling to devote sufficient resources to develop our drug candidates as their\nagreements require. They often face business risks similar to ours, and this could interfere with their efforts. Also, collaborators may"

If a collaborator does not successfully develop any one of our\nproducts, we will need to find another collaborator to do so. The success of our search for a new collaborator will depend on our legal\nright to do so at the time and whether the product remains commercially viable.\nIf we enter into collaboration agreements for one or more of our lead drug candidates, the success of such drug candidates will\ndepend in great part upon our and our collaborators’ success in promoting them as superior to other treatment alternatives. We believe\nthat our drug candidates can be proven to offer disease treatment with notable advantages over drugs in terms of patient compliance and\neffectiveness. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prove these advantages or that the advantages will be sufficient\nto support the successful commercialization of our drug candidates.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Drug Candidates\nWe may face delays, difficulties or unanticipated costs in establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or seeking a\npartnership for the commercialization of our drug candidates, even if regulatory approval is obtained.\nWe may retain full economic rights to our drug candidates or seek favorable economic terms through advantageous commercial\npartnerships. As a result, we may have full responsibility for commercialization of one or more of our drug candidates if and when they\nare approved for sale. We currently lack sufficient marketing, sales and distribution capabilities to carry out this strategy. If any of our\ndrug candidates are approved by the FDA, we will need a drug sales force with technical expertise prior to the commercialization of any\nof our drug candidates. We may not succeed in developing such sales and distribution capabilities, the cost of establishing such sales and\ndistribution capabilities may exceed any product revenue, or our direct marketing and sales efforts may be unsuccessful. We may find it\nnecessary to enter into strategic partnerships, co-promotion or other licensing arrangements. To the extent we enter into such strategic\npartnerships, co- promotion or other licensing arrangements, our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and\nsold such drugs, and some or all of the revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful\nand may not be within our control. If we are unable to enter into such strategic partnerships, co-promotion or other licensing\narrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our existing and future drug candidates. If\nwe are not successful in commercializing any drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval, either on our own or through\ncollaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer, and we may never achieve profitability or become\nunable to continue the operation of our business.\nIf our drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval do not achieve broad acceptance from physicians, patients and third-\nparty payors, we may be unable to generate significant revenues, if any.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates, our approved drugs may not gain market acceptance among\nphysicians and patients. We believe that effectively marketing our drug candidates, if any of them are approved, will require substantial\nefforts, both prior to commercial launch and after approval. Physicians may elect not to prescribe our drugs, and patients may elect not to\nrequest or take them, for a variety of reasons, including:\n●\nlimitations or warnings contained in a drug’s FDA-approved labeling;\n●\nchanges in the standard of care or the availability of alternative drugs for the targeted indications for any of our drug candidates;\n●\nlimitations in the approved indications for our drug candidates;\n●\nthe approval, availability, market acceptance and reimbursement for the companion diagnostic, where applicable;\n●\ndemonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other drugs;\n●\nsignificant adverse side effects;\n●\neffectiveness of education, sales, marketing and distribution support;\n●\ntiming of market introduction and perceived effectiveness of competitive drugs;"

If the FDA grants approval, the scope of the approval\nmay limit our ability to commercialize such drug, and in turn, limit our ability to generate substantial product revenue. For example, the\nFDA may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-approval clinical trials or subject to warnings or contraindications\nor under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) drug safety program. Additionally, even after granting approval, the\nmanufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping\nfor such drug will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. In addition, manufacturers of our drug candidates are\nrequired to comply with cGMP regulations, which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance as well as the\ncorresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory authorities must inspect and approve these manufacturing\nfacilities before they can be used to manufacture our drug candidates, and these facilities are subject to continual review and periodic\ninspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. If we or a third party discover previously\nunknown problems with a drug, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the\ndrug is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturer or us, including requiring\nwithdrawal of the drug from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our drug candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our\ndrug candidates fail to comply with regulatory requirements of the FDA and/or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, we could be subject\nto administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including the following:\n●\nwarning letters;\n●\ncivil or criminal penalties and fines;\n●\ninjunctions;\n●\nconsent decrees;\n●\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n●\nsuspension of any ongoing clinical studies;\n●\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n●\nrefusal to accept or approve applications for marketing approval of new drugs;\n●\nrestrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n●\nseizure or detention of drugs or import bans.\nThe regulatory requirements and policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted with which we may\nalso be required to comply. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future\nlegislation or administrative action, either in the United States or in other countries. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance,\nwe may not be permitted to market our future products and our business may suffer."

If there is not sufficient reimbursement for our future drugs, it is less likely that such drugs will be widely used.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any of our drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval will depend on reimbursement\npolicies and may be affected by future health care reform measures in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Government\nauthorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will\ncover and establish payment levels. In addition, government authorities and these third-party payors are increasingly attempting to\ncontain health care costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they will cover\nand the amounts that they will pay for these drugs. In addition, we might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate\nthe cost-effectiveness of any future drugs to such payors’ satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of\nmanagement time and financial and other resources.\nReimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on \npayments allowed for lower-cost products that are already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or \nservices and may reflect budgetary constraints and/or imperfections in Medicare or Medicaid data used to calculate these rates. Net \nprices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government health care programs. Such programs,  or \nregulatory changes or relaxation of laws that restrict imports of drugs from other countries, could reduce the net price we receive for any \nfuture marketed drugs. In addition, our future drugs might not ultimately be considered cost-effective.\nWe cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for any drug candidates that we develop.Also, we cannot be certain that\nreimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, any future drugs.

In\norder to market our future products in the European Economic Area, or EEA, and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain\nseparate regulatory approvals. Specifically, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing\nAuthorization, or MA.\nBefore granting the MA, the European Medicines Agency or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an\nassessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.\nThe approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, and the time required to obtain approval\nmay differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Clinical studies conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory\nauthorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval\nby one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA.\nHowever, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in\nothers.

These activities include clinical\npatient recruitment and observation, clinical trial monitoring, clinical data management and analysis, safety monitoring and project\nmanagement. We conduct project management and medical and safety monitoring in-house for some of our programs and rely on third\nparties for the remainder of our clinical development activities. If any of these third parties is unable to perform in a quality and timely\nmanner, and at a feasible cost, our clinical studies will face delays. Further, if any of these third parties fails to perform as we expect or if\ntheir work fails to meet regulatory standards, our testing could be delayed, cancelled or rendered ineffective.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers over whom we have limited control. Should the cost, delivery and quality of clinical materials\nmanufactured by us in our Fall River facility or supplied by contract manufacturers vary to our disadvantage, our business\noperations could suffer significant harm.\nWe have limited experience in commercial manufacturing. We rely on CMOs to manufacture drug substance and drug product for\nany late-stage clinical studies of our drug candidates as well as for future commercial supplies. Our ability to conduct late-stage clinical\ntrials, manufacture and commercialize our drug candidates, if regulatory approval is obtained, depends on the ability of such third parties\nto manufacture our drug candidates on a large scale at a competitive cost and in accordance with cGMP and foreign regulatory\nrequirements, if applicable. We also rely on CMOs for labeling and storage for studies inside and outside the US. In order for us to\nestablish our own commercial manufacturing facility, we would require substantial additional funds and would need to make facility\nmodifications, hire and retain significant additional personnel and comply with extensive cGMP regulations applicable to such a facility.\nThe commercial manufacturing facility would also need to be licensed for the production of our drug candidates by the FDA and meet\nother regulatory standards.\nPrior to approval of any drug candidate, the FDA must review and approve validation studies for both drug substance and drug\nproduct. The manufacturing processes for our drug candidates and immunotherapeutic delivery systems utilize known technologies. We\nbelieve that the products we currently have under development can be scaled up to permit manufacture in commercial quantities.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in scaling up the manufacturing processes. Significant scale-up\nof manufacturing may result in unanticipated technical challenges and may require additional validation studies that the FDA must\nreview and approve. CMOs may encounter difficulties in scaling up production, including problems involving supply chain, raw material\nsuppliers, production yields, technical difficulties, scaled-up product characteristics, quality control and assurance, shortage of qualified\npersonnel, capacity constraints, changing priorities within the CMOs, compliance with FDA and foreign regulations, environmental\ncompliance, production costs and development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Any of these difficulties, if\nthey occur and are not overcome to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory agency, could lead to significant delays and possibly\nthe termination of the development program for such drug candidate. These risks become more acute as we scale up for commercial\nquantities, where reliable sources of drug substance and drug product become critical to commercial success. The commercial viability of\nany of our drug candidates, if approved, will depend on the ability of our contract manufacturers to produce drug substance and drug\nproduct on a large scale. Failure to achieve this level of supply can jeopardize and prevent the successful commercialization of the drug.\nWe operate our own cGMP manufacturing facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, to produce drug substance for our current and\nplanned early-stage clinical trials. Our Fall River manufacturing facility has 250L and 1000L bioreactor capacity and is able to\nmanufacture in compliance with FDA and EU regulations, allowing us to distribute potential products to clinical sites in the U.S., EU and\nROW for early-stage clinical trials. We have manufactured barzolvolimab and CDX-585 drug substance in our Fall River facility for our\ncurrent and planned Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. All products are then filled at CMOs. Any manufacturing failures, supply chain\ndelays or compliance issues at our Fall River facility or at our CMOs could cause delays in our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies for\nthese drug candidates.\nOur barzolvolimab drug product is currently administered both intravenously and subcutaneously. In 2022, we manufactured\nbarzolvolimab drug substance at our Fall River facility in subcutaneous form then filled at a CMO to support ongoing and planned\nclinical trials. The subcutaneous formulation will allow for a potential self-administration at home setting versus the need for intravenous\ndosing in a hospital or clinic setting. The subcutaneous form could improve the patient experience if the product becomes available\ncommercially. In 2022, we initiated a transfer of our current barzolvolimab manufacturing process to a CMO to allow us to"

We believe that barzolvolimab can\nbe scaled up to permit manufacturing in commercial quantities. However, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter\ndifficulties in scaling up the manufacturing processes.\nOur leading drug candidates require specialized manufacturing capabilities and processes. We may face difficulty in securing\ncommitments from U.S. and foreign contract manufacturers as these manufacturers could be unwilling or unable to accommodate our\nneeds. Relying on foreign manufacturers involves peculiar and increased risks, including the risk relating to the difficulty foreign\nmanufacturers may face in complying with cGMP requirements as a result of language barriers, lack of familiarity with cGMP or the\nFDA regulatory process, supply chain issues or other causes, economic or political instability in or affecting the home countries of our\nforeign manufacturers, shipping delays, potential changes in foreign regulatory laws governing the sales of our product supplies,\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the imposition or application of trade restrictions.\nThere can be no assurances that contract manufacturers will be able to meet our timetable and requirements. Further, contract\nmanufacturers must operate in compliance with cGMP and failure to do so could result in, among other things, the disruption of product\nsupplies. As noted above, non-U.S. contract manufacturers may face special challenges in complying with cGMP requirements, and\nalthough we are not currently dependent on non-U.S. collaborators or contract manufacturers, we may choose or be required to rely on\nnon-U.S. sources in the future as we seek to develop stable supplies of increasing quantities of materials for ongoing clinical trials of\nlarger scale. Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our products may adversely affect our profit margins and our\nability to develop, manufacture, sell and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe may need to rely on third-party collaborators to develop and commercialize companion diagnostic tests for our drug candidates.\nWe do not have experience or capabilities in developing, administering, obtaining regulatory approval for, or commercializing\ncompanion diagnostic tests and will need to rely in large part on third-party collaborators to perform these functions. Companion\ndiagnostic tests are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States as medical devices\nand require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. We may need to rely on such third-party collaborators to obtain\nregulatory approval and commercialize such companion diagnostic tests. Such third-party collaborators:\n●\nmay not perform its obligations as expected or as required under our collaboration agreement;\n●\nmay encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the companion diagnostic test;\n●\nmay have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostic test in the clinical community;\n●\nmay not pursue commercialization of the companion diagnostic test even if they receive any required regulatory approvals;\n●\nmay elect not to continue the development or commercialization of the companion diagnostic test based on changes in the third\nparties’ strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing\npriorities;\n●\nmay be susceptible to third party cyber-attacks on our and their information security systems;\n●\nmay not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of the companion diagnostic test; and\n●\nmay terminate their relationship with us.\nIf such third-party collaborators fail to develop, obtain regulatory approval or commercialize the companion diagnostic test, we may\nnot be able to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain supplies of an alternative diagnostic test for use in\nconnection with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could\nadversely affect and/or delay the development or commercialization of our drug candidates."

A competitor’s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster\nrecovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nAny unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, earthquake, extreme weather condition, medical epidemic, including the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or manmade accidents or incidents that result in us\nbeing unable to fully utilize our facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party CMOs, could severely disrupt our operations\nand have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For example, our operations\nare located primarily on the east coast of the United States, and any adverse weather event or natural disaster, such as a hurricane or\nheavy snowstorm, could have a material adverse effect on a substantial portion of our operations. If any event occurred that prevented us\nfrom using all or a significant portion of our manufacturing and lab facilities, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as third-party\nmanufacturing facilities, or that otherwise disrupted operations and travel, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to\ncontinue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove\ninadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event.

To date we have hired a core\ncommercial team to plan for potential commercial launches if any of our drug candidates are approved. Over the next several years, we\nmay experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug\ndevelopment, regulatory affairs and sales and marketing. To manage this potential future growth, we may continue to implement and\nimprove our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified\npersonnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such\nanticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified\npersonnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business\ndevelopment resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our existing technology or to modify our technologies to create new immunotherapeutic\ndrugs.\nIf we are able to integrate our acquired assets and licensed assets with our immunotherapy technologies, we believe these assets will\ngive our immunotherapeutic drugs a competitive advantage.

For example, the loss of clinical trial data from\nongoing or future clinical trials for any of our product candidates could result in delays in regulatory approval efforts and significantly\nincrease costs to recover or reproduce the data. Our information security systems are also subject to laws and regulations requiring that\nwe take measures to protect the privacy and security of certain information we gather and use in our business. For example, HIPAA and\nits implementing regulations impose, among other requirements, certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy\nand security of personal health information. In the European Union the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is even more\nrestrictive with respect to all personal information, including information masked by a coding system. In addition to HIPAA and GDPR,\nnumerous other federal and state laws, including, without limitation, state security breach notification laws, state health information\nprivacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure and storage of personal information.\nTo the extent that any disruption or security breach of our information technology systems were to result in a loss of or damage to data or\napplications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information or personal health information, we could incur\nsubstantial liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, our reputation would be damaged, and the further\ndevelopment of our product candidates could be delayed, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nOur business requires us to use hazardous materials, which increases our exposure to dangerous and costly accidents.\nOur research and development activities involve the use of biological materials and small amounts of hazardous chemicals. The\ncompany has internal policies and procedures for the safe handling and disposal of these materials, in full compliance with applicable\nlaws and regulations, including applicable OSHA, EPA, state and local regulations, and utilizing EPA licensed disposal companies and\nfacilities. Although we believe we have reduced our risk and impacts from these materials through our safety procedures, we cannot\ncompletely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. The ongoing cost of complying with\nenvironmental laws and regulations is significant and may increase in the future. All risks of environmental damage inherent to our\noperations cannot be mitigated and failure to comply with applicable government regulations could result in the imposition of fines,\nrestrictions, or increased operational costs, which could impact our ability to carry on with our operations.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims, which could exceed our insurance coverage, and product recalls, each of which could\ndeplete our cash resources.\nAs a participant in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and immunotherapeutic drug industries, we are exposed to the risk of product\nliability claims alleging that use of our drug candidates caused an injury or harm. These claims can arise at any point in the development,\ntesting, manufacture, marketing or sale of our drug candidates and may be made directly by patients involved in clinical trials of our\nproducts, by consumers or health care providers or by individuals, organizations or companies selling our products.Product liability\nclaims can be expensive to defend, even if the drug or drug candidate did not actually cause the alleged injury or harm.\nInsurance covering product liability claims becomes increasingly expensive as a drug candidate moves through the development\npipeline to commercialization. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage is or will continue to be adequate or\navailable to us at a cost acceptable to us or at all. We may choose or find it necessary under our collaborative agreements to increase our\ninsurance coverage in the future. We may not be able to secure greater or broader product liability insurance coverage on acceptable\nterms or at reasonable costs when needed. Any liability for damages resulting from a product liability claim could exceed the amount of\nour coverage, require us to pay a substantial monetary award from our own cash resources and have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, a product recall, if required, could generate substantial negative\npublicity about our products and business and inhibit or prevent development of our drug candidates and, if approval is obtained,\ncommercialization of our future drugs.\nDisruptions in the global economy and supply chains may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nThe disruptions to the global economy since 2020 have impeded global supply chains, resulting in longer lead times and also\nincreased critical component costs and freight expenses. We have taken steps to minimize the impact of these increased costs by working\nclosely with our suppliers.

In addition, if we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we\ncould lose license rights that are important to our business.\nCompanies that license technologies to us that we use in our research and development programs may require us to achieve\nmilestones or devote minimum amounts of resources to develop products using those technologies. They may also require us to make\nsignificant royalty and milestone payments, including a percentage of any sublicensing income, as well as payments to reimburse them\nfor patent costs. The number and variety of our research and development programs require us to establish priorities and to allocate\navailable resources among competing programs. From time to time, we may choose to slow down or cease our efforts on particular\nproducts. If in doing so we fail to fully perform our obligations under a license, the licensor can terminate the license or permit our\ncompetitors to use the technology. Termination of these licenses or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our\nhaving to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms. Moreover, we may lose our right to market and sell any products\nbased on the licensed technology. The occurrence of such events could materially harm our business.\nOur ability to successfully develop and, if regulatory approval is obtained, commercialize our drug candidates may be materially\nadversely affected if we are unable to obtain and maintain effective intellectual property rights for our drug candidates and\ntechnologies.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection and other intellectual property protection for our\ndrug candidates and proprietary technology. We have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United\nStates and abroad related to our drug candidates and technology that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-\nconsuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely\nmanner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to\nobtain patent protection. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using\nour technologies or from developing competing drugs and technologies. We may also be unable to obtain patent term adjustments or\nextensions (or similar rights, such as Supplementary Protection Certificates, in foreign countries) at the relevant times, or the duration of\nany such adjustments, extensions or the like may be less than requested.\nBiotechnology patents involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions and are highly uncertain and may also result in\ndifferent outcomes in different territories. To date, there is no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology\npatents, particularly in regard to patents for technologies for human uses like those we use in our business. We cannot predict whether the\npatents we or our licensors seek will issue. If such patents are issued, a competitor may challenge them and may potentially have them\nrevoked or limit their scope, for example based on existing or newly identified prior art or other issues of validity. Moreover, our patents\nmay not afford effective protection against competitors with similar technology. A successful challenge to any one of our patents could\nresult in a third party’s ability to use the technology covered by the patent. We also face the risk that others will infringe, avoid or\ncircumvent our patents. Technology that we license from others is subject to similar risks and this could harm our ability to use that\ntechnology. If we, or a company that licenses technology to us, were not the first creator of an invention that we use, and/or if\ninventorship were to be decided against us (or our licensor) in any relevant litigation, our use of the underlying product or technology\nwill face restrictions, including elimination, and our ability to defend and/or enforce any affected patent rights could also be materially\nharmed.\nIf we must defend against suits brought against us or prosecute suits against others involving intellectual property rights, we will\nincur substantial costs. In addition to any potential liability for significant monetary damages, a decision against us may require us to\nobtain licenses to patents or other intellectual property rights of others on potentially unfavorable terms. If those licenses from third\nparties are necessary but we cannot acquire them, we would attempt to design around the relevant technology, which would cause higher\ndevelopment costs and delays and may ultimately prove impracticable."

It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of a third party to commercialize our own technology\nor drug candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from such third party. A license to such intellectual property\nmay not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, thus harming our business and competitive position.\nWe rely upon trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information to develop and maintain\nour competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and our collaborators and\nconsultants. We also have agreements with our employees that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. However, it is possible that\ntechnology relevant to our business will be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement. Furthermore, if\nthe employees, consultants or collaborators that are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may\nnot have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations.\nFurther, our trade secrets could be disclosed, misappropriated or otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our\ncompetitors. In addition, intellectual property laws in foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the\nlaws of the United States. If our trade secrets are disclosed or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time- consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims,\nwhich can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is\ninvalid or unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not\ncover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being\ninvalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual\nproperty litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of\nlitigation.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which\nwould be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our\ndrug candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary rights or\nintellectual property of third parties. We may become party to, or be threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation\nregarding intellectual property rights with respect to our drug candidates and technology. Third parties may assert infringement claims\nagainst us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third-party’s intellectual\nproperty rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third-party to continue developing our drug candidates and\ntechnology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were\nable to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We\ncould be forced, including by court order, to cease developing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable\nfor monetary damages. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties can have a\nsimilar negative impact on our business.\nThird parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or\nmisappropriated trade secrets.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other diagnostic or biopharmaceutical companies, including\nour competitors or potential competitors.

If we fail\nin defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\nEven if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management\nand other employees.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug designation or exclusivity for our product candidates.\nWe may seek orphan drug designation for some of our product candidates in the United States.Regulatory authorities in some\njurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or\ncondition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.\nGenerally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for\nwhich it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or the EMA from\napproving another marketing application for the same indication for that drug during that time period. The applicable period is seven\nyears in the United States and ten years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets\nthe criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan\ndrug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the\nmanufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nWe cannot assure you that any future application for orphan drug designation with respect to any product candidate will be granted.\nIf we are unable to obtain orphan drug designation in the United States, we will not be eligible to obtain the period of market exclusivity\nthat could result from orphan drug designation or be afforded the financial incentives associated with orphan drug designation. Even if\nwe obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because\ndifferent drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the\nsame drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more\neffective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nAny fast track designation or grant of priority review status by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory\nreview or approval process, nor will it assure FDA approval of our product candidates. Additionally, our product candidates may treat\nindications that do not qualify for priority review vouchers.\nWe may seek fast track designation for some of our product candidates or priority review of applications for approval of our product\ncandidates. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life- threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to\naddress unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. If a product candidate offers\nmajor advances in treatment, the FDA may designate it eligible for priority review. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant\nthese designations, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for these designations, we cannot assure you that the\nFDA would decide to grant them. Even if we do receive fast track designation or priority review, we may not experience a faster\ndevelopment process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it\nbelieves that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nAny breakthrough therapy designation granted by the FDA for our product candidates may not lead to a faster development or\nregulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing\napproval.\nWe may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for some of our product candidates. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug\nthat is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and\npreliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more\nclinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs and biologics that\nhave been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to\nidentify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens.\nDrugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for accelerated approval if the relevant criteria are met."

Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product\ncandidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such\ndesignation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster\ndevelopment process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not\nassure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the\nFDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or\napproval will not be shortened.\nIf our processes and systems are not compliant with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to delays in submitting BLAs,\nNDAs or restrictions on marketing of drugs after they have been approved.\nWe currently are developing drug candidates for regulatory approval and are in the process of implementing regulated processes and\nsystems required to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our drug candidates. Certain of these processes and systems for\nconducting clinical trials and manufacturing material must be compliant with regulatory requirements before we can apply for regulatory\napproval for our drug candidates. These processes and systems will be subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the FDA\nand other regulatory bodies. If we are unable to achieve compliance in a timely fashion or if compliance issues are identified at any point\nin the development and approval process, we may experience delays in filing for regulatory approval for our drug candidates or delays in\nobtaining regulatory approval after filing. In addition, any later discovery of previously unknown problems or safety issues with\napproved drugs or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on such drugs or\nmanufacturing processes, withdrawal of drugs from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or a refusal by the FDA\nand/or other regulatory bodies to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved\napplications, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we are a party to agreements that transfer\nresponsibility for complying with specified regulatory requirements, such as filing and maintenance of marketing authorizations and\nsafety reporting or compliance with manufacturing requirements, to our collaborators and third-party manufacturers. If our collaborators\nor third-party manufacturers do not fulfill these regulatory obligations, any drugs for which we or they obtain approval may be subject to\nlater restrictions on manufacturing or sale or may even risk withdrawal, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have conducted and are conducting clinical trials outside the United States and anticipate conducting additional clinical trials\noutside the United States, and the FDA may not accept data from such trials.\nWe are currently conducting clinical trials for our product candidates in countries outside of the United States and we anticipate that\nwe will conduct additional clinical trials in countries outside the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials\nconducted outside the United States, acceptance of such study data by the FDA is subject to certain conditions. For example, the clinical\ntrial must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA must be able to validate the data from the clinical trial\nthrough an onsite inspection if it deems such inspection necessary. Where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the\nsole basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless\nthose data are considered applicable to the U.S. patient population and U.S. medical practice, the clinical trials were performed by\nclinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data is considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA\nor, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other\nappropriate means. In addition, such clinical trials would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the\nclinical trials are conducted. A description of any studies related to overdosage is also required, including information on dialysis,\nantidotes, or other treatments, if known. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data from clinical trials conducted outside of the\nUnited States. If the FDA does not accept any such data, it would likely result in the need for additional clinical trials, which would be\ncostly and time-consuming and delay aspects of our development plan.\nRisks inherent in conducting international clinical trials include, but are not limited to:\n●\nforeign regulatory requirements that could burden or limit our ability to conduct our clinical trials;\n●\nadministrative burdens of conducting clinical trials under multiple foreign regulatory schema;\n●\nforeign currency fluctuations which could negatively impact our financial condition since certain payments are paid in local\ncurrencies;"

During the course of a development program, sponsors may also change the contract\nmanufacturers used to produce the product candidates. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives.\nAny of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of clinical trials. Such changes may\nalso require additional testing, notification or approval by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities. This could delay completion of\nclinical trials; require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or studies, or the repetition of one or more clinical trials; increase clinical trial\ncosts; delay approval of our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for a drug candidate, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued\nregulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable\nregulatory requirements.\nOnce regulatory approval has been granted, the approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review by the FDA\nand/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities.

The confidentiality, collection, use and\ndisclosure of personal data, including clinical trial patient-specific information, are subject to governmental regulation generally in the\ncountry that the personal data were collected or used. In the United States, we are subject to various state and federal privacy and data\nsecurity regulations, including but not limited to HIPAA and as amended by the HITECH Act. HIPAA imposes specified requirements\nrelating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and mandates, among other things, the\nadoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common health care transactions, as well as standards\nrelating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical\nand technical safeguards to protect such information. We may also be subject to state security breach notification laws, state laws\nprotecting the privacy and security of health and personal information, and federal and state consumer protections laws which regulate\nthe collection, use, disclosure and transmission of personal information.

For example, in the United States, the ACA\nsubstantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the\npharmaceutical industry. Many provisions of ACA impact the biopharmaceutical industry, including that in order for a biopharmaceutical\nproduct to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government\nagencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the drug pricing program under the Public Health\nServices Act, or PHS. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges and amendments to certain aspects of\nACA. There is continued uncertainty about the implementation of ACA, including the potential for further amendments to the ACA and\nlegal challenges to or efforts to repeal the ACA.\nIn addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, enacted in August 2022, empowers the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to set the prices for a limited set of high-cost drugs covered by Medicare,\nand puts penalties in place for drug manufacturers who increase their Medicare prices by more than the rate of inflation.\nOther examples of proposed changes include, but are not limited to, expanding post-approval requirements, changing the Orphan\nDrug Act, and restricting sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products.\nWe cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether government regulations, guidance or\ninterpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes would be on the marketing approvals, sales, pricing, or\nreimbursement of our drug candidates or products, if any, may be."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n45\nRisks Related to Our Capital Stock\nOur history of losses and uncertainty of future profitability make our common stock a highly speculative investment.\nWe have had no commercial revenue to date from sales of our drug candidates. We had an accumulated deficit of $1.3 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022. We expect to spend substantial funds to continue the research and development testing of our drug candidates.\nIn anticipation of FDA approval of these products, we will need to make substantial investments to establish sales, marketing,\nquality control, regulatory compliance capabilities and commercial manufacturing alliances. These investments will increase if and when\nany of these drug candidates receive FDA approval. We cannot predict how quickly our lead drug candidates will progress through the\nregulatory approval process. As a result, we may continue to lose money for several years.\nWe cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability in the future. Failure to achieve profitability could diminish our\nability to sustain operations, pay dividends on our common stock, obtain additional required funds and make required payments on our\npresent or future indebtedness.\nOur share price has been and could remain volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. From\nJanuary 2021 through December 2022, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated from a high of $57.20 per share in the fourth\nquarter of 2021, to a low of $15.37 per share in the first quarter of 2021. Our progress in developing and commercializing our products,\nthe impact of government regulations on our products and industry, the potential sale of a large volume of our common stock by\nstockholders, our quarterly operating results, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other\ndevelopments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially with\nsignificant market losses. If our stockholders sell a substantial number of shares of common stock, especially if those sales are made\nduring a short period of time, those sales could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to\nraise capital. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has\naffected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may\nadversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, we could be subject to a securities class action litigation as a result of\nvolatility in the price of our stock, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources and\ncould harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards will be subject to limitation and, under certain circumstances, may be\neliminated.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $623.1 million for federal income\ntax purposes, and $879.9 million for state income tax purposes. Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future\nincome, which cannot be assured. In addition, utilization of our net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards\nmay be subject to substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in\nthe future provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or Section 382, as well as similar state provisions. In general,\nan ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders or public\ngroups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period.\nIn October 2007, June 2009, December 2009 and December 2013, we experienced a change in ownership as defined by Section 382.\nHistorically, we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions which, combined with shareholders’\nsubsequent disposition of those shares, has resulted in three changes of control, as defined by Section 382. As a result of these ownership\nchanges, utilization of at least some of our federal NOL carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation. We have not undertaken a study\nto assess whether an ownership change or multiple ownership changes have occurred for (i) acquired businesses with NOLs prior to\nbeing acquired by the Company, (ii) the Company on the state level, (iii) the Company since March 2015 or (iv) research and\ndevelopment credits. If, based on such a study, we were to determine that there has been an ownership change at any time, utilization of\nnet operating loss or tax credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 (or similar state provisions).\nAny unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years, and the amount of the limitation may, under certain circumstances,\nbe subject to adjustment if the fair value of our net assets is determined to be below or in excess of the tax basis of such"

Subsequent ownership changes, as defined in Section 382, could further limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and\nresearch and development credits that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. Additionally, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nlimited the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of taxable income while providing that net operating loss carryovers for years after\n2017 will not expire. The CARES Act provides relief to corporate taxpayers by permitting a five year carryback of 2018 – 2020 NOLs,\nremoving the 80% limitation on the carryback of those NOLs, and accelerates refunds for minimum tax credit carryforwards, along with\na few other provisions. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, no material adjustments were made to provision amounts\nrecorded as a result of the enactment of the CARES Act.\nRefer to Note 15, “Income Taxes,” in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for additional discussion on income taxes.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our\nfinancial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which\nwould harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with\nadequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required or improved controls, or\ndifficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. We have designed, implemented\nand tested the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation, which was and is time consuming, costly,\nand complicated. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that\nthe control system’s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be\ndetected. Any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or any subsequent testing by\nour independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are\ndeemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other\nareas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported\nfinancial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have many competitors in our field, and they may develop technologies that make ours obsolete.\nBiotechnology, pharmaceuticals and therapeutics are rapidly evolving fields in which scientific and technological developments are\nexpected to continue at a rapid pace. We have many competitors in the U.S. and abroad. The competitors of which we are aware that\nhave initiated a Phase 3 study or have obtained marketing approval for a potentially competitive drug to barzolvolimab for treatment of\nCSU, CIndU, PN and EoE include: Allakos (lirentelimab for EoE), AstraZeneca (Fasenra for CSU), Galderma/Chugai (nemolizumab for\nPN), Genentech (fenebrutinib for CSU), Leo Pharma (Adbry for AD), Novartis (ligelizumab for CSU, CIndU and food allergy;\nremibrutinib for CSU), Regeneron/Sanofi (Dupixent for CSU, CIndU, PN and EoE), and Trevi Therapeutics (nalbuphine for PN). Our\nsuccess depends upon our ability to develop and maintain a competitive position in the product categories and technologies on which we\nfocus. Many of our competitors have greater capabilities, experience and financial resources than we do. Competition is intense and is\nexpected to increase as new products enter the market and new technologies become available. Our competitors may:\n●\ndevelop technologies and products that are more effective than ours, making ours obsolete or otherwise noncompetitive;\n●\nobtain regulatory approval for products more rapidly or effectively than us; and\n●\nobtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would block our ability to develop competitive products.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and outbreaks, including COVID-19, which could significantly disrupt our preclinical\nstudies and clinical trials.\nThe future progression of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business and operations are uncertain. The duration and the\ngeographic impact of the business disruption and related financial impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be"

In an effort to halt or slow the outbreak of\nCOVID-19, many governments have, at times, placed significant restrictions on travel and many businesses have, at times, announced\nclosures for extended periods which could adversely impact our operations. Enrollment of patients in our clinical trials and our planned\nand ongoing preclinical and clinical trials may be delayed due to COVID-19. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operations\nof the FDA and other health authorities may delay potential approvals of our clinical trial protocols. In addition, we rely on independent\nclinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to assist us in managing, monitoring and\notherwise carrying out our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the pandemic may affect their ability to devote sufficient time and\nresources to our programs. We also rely on third party suppliers and contract manufacturers to produce the drug product we utilize in our\nclinical trials, and the pandemic may cause delays in the delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”) and drug product.\nTemporary closure of our facilities, or facilities at which our clinical or preclinical trials are conducted, or restrictions on the ability of\nour employees, clinicians or patients enrolled in our trials to travel could adversely affect our operations and our ability to conduct and\ncomplete our preclinical and clinical trials. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, including insufficient vaccination of the general\npopulation and the emergence of COVID-19 variants, could affect the health and availability of our workforce as well as those of the\nthird parties on whom we rely. If new, more infectious or severe variants emerge, it is possible that the impact of the pandemic on our\nbusiness may increase or lengthen in duration.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, the expected timeline for data readouts of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and certain\nregulatory filings may be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe depend greatly on the intellectual capabilities and experience of our key executives and scientists, and the loss of any of them\ncould affect our ability to develop our products.\nThe loss of any of our executive officers could harm us. We entered into employment agreements with each of our executive\nofficers, although an employment agreement as a practical matter does not guarantee retention of an employee. We also depend on our\nscientific and clinical collaborators and advisors, all of whom have outside commitments that may limit their availability to us. In\naddition, we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientific,\nmanagerial and marketing personnel, particularly as we expand our activities in clinical trials, the regulatory approval process and sales\nand manufacturing. We routinely enter into consulting agreements with our scientific and clinical collaborators and advisors, key opinion\nleaders and heads of academic departments in the ordinary course of our business. We also enter into contractual agreements with\nphysicians and institutions who recruit patients into our clinical trials on our behalf in the ordinary course of our business.\nNotwithstanding these arrangements, we face significant competition for this type of personnel from other companies, research and\nacademic institutions, government entities and other organizations. We cannot predict our success in hiring or retaining the personnel we\nrequire for continued growth.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and\nrequirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to\ncomply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with applicable privacy laws, comply with\nmanufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report\nfinancial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business\narrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing\nand other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and\npromotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve\nthe improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to\nour reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and launched a Health Care Compliance program, but it is not\nalways possible to identify and deter employee misconduct. The precautions we take and the investments we make to detect and prevent\nthis activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental\ninvestigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions\nare instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant\neffect on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions."

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing therapeutic monoclonal and bispecific antibodies that address diseases\nfor which available treatments are inadequate. Our drug candidates include antibody-based therapeutics which have the ability to engage\nthe human immune system and/or directly affect critical pathways to improve the lives of patients with inflammatory diseases and many\nforms of cancer.\nWe are focusing our efforts and resources on the continued research and development of\n●\nBarzolvolimab (also referred to as CDX-0159), a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the KIT receptor and potently\ninhibits its activity, which is currently being studied across multiple mast cell driven diseases including\n-\nChronic Urticarias: In June and July 2022 respectively, we announced that enrollment had opened and the first patients\nhad been dosed in Phase 2 studies in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU).\nPositive interim data from the ongoing Phase 1b study in CSU were reported in February 2023.

Targets are being selected based on new science as well as their compatibility to be used in bispecific\nantibody formats with Celldex’s existing antibody programs. Development is focused on emerging, important pathways\ncontrolling inflammatory diseases or immunity to tumors.\nOur goal is to build a fully integrated, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops important therapies for patients\nwith unmet medical needs. We believe our program assets provide us with the strategic options to either retain full economic rights to our\ninnovative therapies or seek favorable economic terms through advantageous commercial partnerships. This approach allows us to\nmaximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolio while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual\nproduct.\nThe expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties. Completion of clinical\ntrials may take several years or more, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and\nintended use of a drug candidate. It is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of drug candidates to each take five years or\nmore, and total development costs could exceed hundreds of millions of dollars for each drug candidate. We estimate that clinical trials\nof the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines:\nEstimated\nCompletion\nClinical Phase\n    \nPeriod\nPhase 1\n \n1 – 2 Years\nPhase 2\n \n1 – 5 Years\nPhase 3\n \n1 – 5 Years\nThe duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the\nclinical trial protocol, including, among others, the following:\n●\nthe number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial;"

We may then conduct\nmultiple clinical trials for each drug candidate. As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for\ncertain drug candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising drug candidates.\nAn element of our business strategy is to pursue the discovery, research and development of a broad portfolio of drug candidates.\nThis is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures. To the extent we are unable\nto maintain a broad range of drug candidates, our dependence on the success of one or a few drug candidates increases.\nRegulatory approval is required before we can market our drug candidates as therapeutic products. In order to proceed to subsequent\nclinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval, the regulatory agencies must conclude that our clinical data\ndemonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective. Historically, the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials\n(through Phase 2) have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. A number of new drugs and biologics have\nshown promising results in early clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary\nregulatory approvals.\nFurthermore, our business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the\ndevelopment and commercialization of our drug candidates. In the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one of\nour drug candidates, the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than us. We cannot forecast\nwith any degree of certainty which proprietary products, if any, will be subject to future collaborative arrangements, in whole or in part,\nand how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements. Our programs may also benefit from subsidies,\ngrants, contracts or government or agency-sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs.\nAs a result of the uncertainties discussed above, among others, it is difficult to accurately estimate the duration and completion costs\nof our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization\nand sale of a product. Our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into\ncollaborative agreements, when appropriate, could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our\nliquidity. These uncertainties could force us to seek additional, external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with\nour business strategy. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the\nfuture success of our business.\nDuring the past five years through December 31, 2022, we incurred an aggregate of $287.2 million in research and development\nexpenses. The following table indicates the amount incurred for each of our significant research programs and for other identified\nresearch and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

      "text": "Table of Contents\n52\nClinical Development Programs\nBarzolvolimab (also referred to as CDX-0159)\nBarzolvolimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT and potently inhibits its\nactivity. KIT is expressed in a variety of cells, including mast cells, and its activation by its ligand SCF regulates mast cell growth,\ndifferentiation, survival, chemotaxis and degranulation. Barzolvolimab is designed to block KIT activation by disrupting both SCF\nbinding and KIT dimerization. We believe that by targeting KIT, barzolvolimab may be able to inhibit mast cell activity and decrease\nmast cell numbers to provide potential clinical benefit in mast cell related diseases.\nIn certain inflammatory diseases, such as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), also known as chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), and\nchronic inducible urticaria (CIndU), mast cell degranulation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease. In June 2020,\nwe completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose escalation Phase 1a study of barzolvolimab in\nhealthy subjects (n = 32; 8 subjects per cohort, 6 barzolvolimab; 2 placebo). Subjects received a single intravenous infusion of\nbarzolvolimab at 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 9.0 mg/kg or placebo. The objectives of the study included safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics\n(PK) and pharmacodynamics (tryptase and stem cell factor) and immunogenicity. Tryptase is an enzyme synthesized and secreted almost\nexclusively by mast cells and decreases in plasma tryptase levels are believed to reflect a systemic reduction in mast cell burden in both\nhealthy volunteers and in disease. Data from the study were featured in a late breaking presentation at the European Academy of Allergy\nand Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Annual Congress 2020 in June. Barzolvolimab demonstrated a favorable safety profile as well as\nprofound and durable reductions of plasma tryptase, consistent with systemic mast cell suppression.\nThese data supported expansion of the barzolvolimab program into mast cell driven diseases, including initially in CSU and CIndU,\ndiseases where mast cell degranulation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease. Phase 1 studies in CSU and CIndU\nare completing and Phase 2 studies are ongoing. We continue to assess potential opportunities for barzolvolimab in other diseases where\nmast cells play an important role, such as dermatologic, respiratory, allergic, gastrointestinal and ophthalmic conditions and to this end,\nare conducting an ongoing Phase 1 study in prurigo nodularis and plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in eosinophilic esophagitis in the first\nhalf of 2023. Phase 1 studies of barzolvolimab have been conducted with an intravenous formulation; a subcutaneous formulation has\nbeen successfully developed and is being used in Phase 2 studies.\nChronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)\nCSU presents as itchy hives, angioedema or both for at least six weeks without a specific trigger; multiple episodes can play out over\nyears or even decades. CSU is one of the most frequent dermatologic diseases with a prevalence of 0.5-1.0% of the total population or up\nto approximately 1 to 3 million patients in the United States (Weller et al. 2010. Hautarzt. 61(8), Bartlett et al. 2018. DermNet.Org).\nApproximately 50% of patients with CSU achieve symptomatic control with antihistamines. Omalizumab, an IgE inhibitor, provides\nrelief for roughly half of the remaining antihistamine refractory patients. Consequently, there is a need for additional therapies.\nIn October 2020, we announced that enrollment had opened and the first patient had been dosed in a Phase 1b multi-center study of\nbarzolvolimab in CSU. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial designed to assess the safety of\nmultiple ascending doses of barzolvolimab in up to 40 patients with CSU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with\nantihistamines. Secondary and exploratory objectives include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments, including\nmeasurement of tryptase and stem cell factor levels and clinical activity outcomes (impact on urticaria symptoms, disease control,\nclinical response) as well as quality of life assessments. Barzolvolimab is administered intravenously (0.5, 1.5, 3 and 4.5 mg/kg at\nvarying dosing schedules) as add on treatment to H1- antihistamines, either alone or in combination with H2-antihistamines and/or\nleukotriene receptor agonists."

The 0.5 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg\nand 3.0 mg/kg cohorts had completed study participation through 24 weeks; 6 of 9 patients in the 4.5 mg/kg cohort had completed\nthrough the week 20 visit. Complete data were included for all patients in dose levels through 3.0 mg/kg through 24 weeks. All available\ndata for the 4.5 mg/kg and placebo dose levels were presented for adverse events. Activity data for the 4.5 mg/kg dose level were\nreported through week 20. Activity data for the 0.5 mg/kg and placebo group were only included through week 12 because, as expected,\nmost patients from these groups had significant symptoms ahead of week 24 and discontinued follow up.

UTIs and COVID-19 were reported as unrelated to treatment. There was one serious adverse event of\nsalmonella gastroenteritis which was also not related to study therapy. Changes in hematologic parameters were consistent with\nobservations in single dose studies, with no pattern of further decreases with multiple doses; hematologic values generally\nremained within the normal range and returned to baseline levels during the follow up period. Five patients had decreases in\nneutrophil counts reported as AEs; four of which were previously reported in the EAACI 2022 data presentation. The pattern\nobserved in the neutrophil changes for these patients was similar to the pattern seen in patients across the barzolvolimab\nprogram to date—generally transient, asymptomatic, and mild and typically occurring in patients with screening and baseline\nneutrophil counts at the lower end of the normal range on study initiation."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n54\nIn June 2022, we announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 2 study in patients with CSU who remain symptomatic\ndespite antihistamine therapy. The study is being conducted at approximately 75 sites across 9 countries. The study is a randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of multiple dose regimens of\nbarzolvolimab to determine the optimal dosing strategy. Approximately 168 patients will be randomly assigned on a 1:1:1:1 ratio to\nreceive subcutaneous injections of barzolvolimab at 75 mg every 4 weeks, 150 mg every 4 weeks, 300 mg every 8 weeks or placebo\nduring a 16-week placebo-controlled treatment phase. Patients will then enter a 36-week active treatment phase, in which patients not\nalready randomized to barzolvolimab at 150 mg every 4 weeks or 300 mg every 8 weeks will be randomized 1:1 to receive one of these\ntwo dose regimens; patients already randomized to these treatment arms will remain on the same regimen as during the placebo-\ncontrolled treatment phase. Following the treatment period, patients will enter a 24-week follow up phase. The primary endpoint of the\nstudy is mean change in baseline to week 12 in UAS7 (Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days). Secondary endpoints include safety and\nother assessments of clinical activity including ISS7 (Itch Severity Score over 7 days), HSS7 (Hive Severity Score over 7 days) and\nAAS7 (Angioedema Activity Score over 7 days). Based on current enrollment projections, we anticipate that enrollment to this study will\nbe completed by the end of the third quarter of 2023 and we plan to report topline data either late this year or in the first quarter of 2024.\nChronic Inducible Urticaria (CIndU)\nCIndUs are forms of urticaria that have an attributable cause or trigger associated with them, typically resulting in hives or wheals.\nThe prevalence of CIndU is estimated at 0.5% of the total population and is reported to overlap in up to 36% of CSU patients (Weller et\nal. 2010. Hautarzt. 61(8), Bartlett et al. 2018. DermNet.Org). There are currently no approved therapies for chronic inducible urticarias\nother than antihistamines and patients attempt to manage symptoms associated with their disease through avoidance of triggers. We are\nexploring cold-induced, dermographism (scratch-induced) and cholinergic (exercise-induced) urticarias.\nIn December 2020, we announced that enrollment had opened and the first patient had been dosed in a Phase 1b study in CIndU\nbeing conducted in Germany in patients who are refractory to antihistamines. This study is an open label clinical trial designed to\nevaluate the safety of a single dose (3 mg/kg) of barzolvolimab in patients with cold urticaria (ColdU) or symptomatic dermographism\n(SD). In March and June 2021, respectively, we added a third cohort (single dose, 3 mg/kg) in patients with cholinergic urticaria and a\nfourth cohort at a lower dose (single dose, 1.5 mg/kg) in ColdU. Patient’s symptoms are induced via provocation testing that resembles\nreal life triggering situations. Secondary and exploratory objectives include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments,\nincluding changes from baseline provocation thresholds, measurement of tryptase and stem cell factor levels, clinical activity outcomes\n(impact on urticaria symptoms, disease control, clinical response), quality of life assessments and measurement of tissue mast cells\nthrough skin biopsies. Barzolvolimab is administered intravenously on Day 1 as add on treatment to H1-antihistamines.\nIn November 2022, data from the ColdU and SD cohorts treated with a single intravenous infusion of barzolvolimab at 3 mg/kg\nwere published in Allergy (Terhorst-Molawi et al Allergy. 2022 Nov 16. doi: 10.1111/all.15585). Safety results were reported for 21\npatients; activity results were reported for the 20 patients who received a full dose of barzolvolimab. Patients had high disease activity.\nAt baseline, patients’ mean scores (range) for Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) [10.8 (2–21)] and Urticaria Control Test (UCT)\n[6.0 (0–13)] indicated marked impairment of quality of life (QoL) and poorly controlled disease, respectively. Three patients (1 with\nColdU and 2 with SD) were previously treated with omalizumab and chose to discontinue that treatment because they remained\nsymptomatic. At baseline, provocation thresholds, on average (range), were 18.9°C or 66°F (5–27°C or 41–80.6°F) for patients with\nColdU and 3.5 (2–4) pins for patients with SD.\n●\nRapid (as early as 1 week) and durable responses were observed in all patients as assessed by provocation testing. A complete\nresponse was achieved in 95% (n = 19/20) of patients (n = 10/10 ColdU; n = 9/10 SD). The median duration (range) of\ncomplete response through the 12-week observation period was 77+ days (29–86; n = 10) for patients with ColdU and 57+ days\n(16–70; n = 9) for patients with SD. All three patients who experienced insufficient response to omalizumab treatment had a\ncomplete response after treatment with barzolvolimab.\n●\nFollowing a single dose of barzolvolimab rapid improvements in urticaria control was observed. A UCT score of ≥12 (well\ncontrolled) was achieved by 80% (n = 16/20) of the patients within week 4 post-treatment. By week 8, all patients (100%; n =\n20/20) achieved well-controlled urticaria, which was sustained to week 12 post-dose by 80% (n = 16/20) of patients. Complete\nurticaria control (UCT = 16) was achieved by 35% (n = 7/20), 65% (n = 13/20), and 40% (n = 8/20) at weeks 4, 8, and 12,\nrespectively."

Disease impact significantly decreased\nafter dosing; a score of 0–1 (minimal/none) was achieved by 80% (n = 16/20) for all patients who completed the DLQI during\nthe study. Additionally, clinically meaningful improvements in QoL were attained and sustained to week 12.\n●\nA single dose of barzolvolimab led to marked decreases in tryptase and in skin mast cells. The kinetics correlated with\nimprovements in provocation testing and clinical activity, consistent with a central role for mast cells in the pathogenesis of\nColdU and SD. This confirmed that serum tryptase level is a robust pharmacodynamic biomarker for assessing mast cell burden\nand clinical activity in inducible urticaria and potentially in other diseases with mast cell driven involvement.\n●\nBarzolvolimab was well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild, and the most common (≥3 patients) were hair color changes\n(76%; n = 16/21), infusion reactions (43%; n = 9/21), taste changes (38%; n = 8/21), nasopharyngitis (24%; n = 5/21), malaise\n(24%; n = 5/21), and headache (19%; n = 4/21). Hair color changes (generally small areas of hair color lightening) and taste\ndisorders (generally partial changes of ability to taste salt or umami) are consistent with inhibiting KIT signaling in other cell\ntypes and completely resolved over time during follow-up. Infusion reactions, which manifested as localized hives and itching\nas well as erythema and feeling hot, resolved spontaneously. One patient with a history of fainting experienced loss of\nconsciousness during infusion. The patient rapidly recovered. Importantly, no evidence of mast cell activation as measured by\nserum tryptase monitoring was observed in this patient. Overall, mean hematology parameters remained within the normal\nranges—an important finding for a KIT inhibitor. Mild, transient, and asymptomatic decreases in hemoglobin and white blood\ncell parameters occurred for some patients.\nIn December 2022, we presented long term follow up data from the 3.0 mg/kg cohorts in cold urticaria and symptomatic\ndermographism at the GA²LEN Global Urticaria Forum (GUF) 2022. 14 patients consented to the optional long term follow up\nevaluation (6 cold, 8 symptomatic dermographism); 10 of the 14 still had complete control of their disease as assessed by provocation\ntesting at week 12. Data were collected at one or more timepoints beyond week 12 through week 36.\n●\nMost patients had return of symptoms and/or loss of urticaria control between 12 and 36 weeks. Remarkably, two patients\nremained provocation negative at 36 weeks, and four had well controlled disease (UCT ≥12) 36 weeks post dosing.\n●\nSerum tryptase exhibits a similar rate of recovery as clinical symptoms, while skin mast cells return at a slower rate. Tissue KIT\nsignaling, as approximated by SCF levels, was rapidly inhibited after dose administration and fully reactivated approximately\n18 weeks after dosing.\n●\nTryptase levels return to pretreatment levels during follow up, while mast cells continue to recover. Drug related adverse events\nnoted during the study all resolved.\nIn December 2022, we also presented 12 week treatment results for the 1.5 mg/kg cohort in cold urticaria at the GA²LEN Global\nUrticaria Forum (GUF) 2022. 10 patients received a single intravenous infusion of barzolvolimab at 1.5 mg/kg. Patients had high disease\nactivity as assessed by provocation threshold testing with a mean baseline critical temperature threshold of 18.4°C or 65°F with a range\nfrom 6 to 27°C or 43 to 81°F. All patients had disease refractory to antihistamines and five patients had disease refractory to\nomalizumab. Safety results were reported for all 10 patients; activity results were reported for the 9 patients who received a full dose of\nbarzolvolimab, including four patients with omalizumab refractory disease.\n●\nAll 9 of 9 (100%) patients evaluable for activity treated at 1.5 mg/kg experienced a complete response as assessed by\nprovocation threshold testing, including 4 patients with disease refractory to omalizumab. Rapid onset of responses after dosing\nand sustained durability were observed in the 1.5 mg/kg cohort. 6 of 9 patients treated achieved a complete response within a\nweek of dosing. The median duration of response was 51+ days (7+ weeks).\n●\nImprovements in disease activity as reported by Urticaria Control Test (UCT) were consistent with the complete responses as\nmeasured by provocation testing. All patients entered the study with poorly controlled disease (mean UCT score at baseline of\n5.9 and a range of 1-11). Following barzolvolimab administration, all patients achieved well controlled disease (UCT>12) with\n7 of 9 achieving complete control (UCT=16)."

Barzolvolimab was generally well tolerated and the\nsafety profile at 1.5mg/kg was similar to the profile observed with 3.0 mg/kg.\n●\nNo new treatment emergent AEs of concern were noted. While mild, transient and asymptomatic decreases in hemoglobin and\nwhite blood cell (WBC) parameters were noted, consistent with prior studies, the hematology parameters generally remained\nwithin the normal range.\nTo date, 19 of 19 (100%) patients with cold urticaria treated with either a single dose of barzolvolimab at 1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg in this\nPhase 1b study have experienced a complete response by provocation testing, including 5 patients with omalizumab refractory disease.\nIn July 2022 we announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 2 study in patients with CIndU who remain symptomatic\ndespite antihistamine therapy. The study will be conducted at approximately 85 sites across approximately 12 countries. The randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase 2 study is evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of multiple dose regimens of\nbarzolvolimab in patients with CIndU to determine the optimal dosing strategy. Approximately 180 patients in 2 cohorts (differentiated\nby CIndU subtype) including 90 patients with cold urticaria and 90 patients with symptomatic dermographism will be randomly assigned\non a 1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of barzolvolimab at 150 mg every 4 weeks, 300 mg every 8 weeks or placebo during a\n20-week treatment phase. Patients will then enter a follow-up phase for an additional 24 weeks. In addition, the study includes the option\nfor patients who have symptoms following the treatment phase, including patients who were on placebo, to enroll in an open label\nextension where all patients receive 300 mg every 9 weeks of barzolvolimab. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of\npatients with a negative provocation test at week 12 (using TempTest(R) and FricTest(R)). Secondary endpoints include safety and other\nassessments of clinical activity including CTT (Critical Temperature Threshold), CFT (Critical Friction Threshold) and WI-NRS (Worst\nitch numeric rating scale).\nPrurigo Nodularis (PN)\nWe have expanded clinical development of barzolvolimab into prurigo nodularis (PN). PN is a chronic skin disease characterized by\nthe development of hard, intensely itchy (pruritic) nodules on the skin. Mast cells through their interactions with sensory neurons and\nother immune cells are believed to play an important role in amplifying chronic itch and neuroinflammation, both of which are a\nhallmark of PN. There is currently only one FDA approved therapy for PN, representing an area of significant unmet need. Industry\nsources estimate there are approximately 154,000 patients in the United States with PN who have undergone treatment within the last 12\nmonths and, of these, approximately 75,000 would be biologic-eligible. In December 2021, the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1b\nmulti-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intravenous study designed to assess the safety and treatment effects across\nmultiple dosing cohorts of barzolvolimab in up to 30 patients with PN. Enrolling an intravenous, early stage study in the dermatology\nsetting has been a challenge and the study has taken longer than expected to complete. In February 2023, we closed enrollment at 24\npatients, which we believe will provide sufficient data for analysis to inform future development decisions in PN. Following the\ncompletion of the 24 week follow up period post dosing for patients on study, we plan to present data from the study in the second half of\n2023. Potential future development in PN will utilize the subcutaneous formulation of barzolvolimab.\nEosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)\nIn February 2022, we announced that we will be expanding clinical development of barzolvolimab into eosinophilic esophagitis\n(EoE), the most common type of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease. EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus\ncharacterized by the infiltration of eosinophils. This chronic inflammation can result in trouble swallowing, chest pain, vomiting and\nimpaction of food in the esophagus, a medical emergency. Several studies have suggested that mast cells may be an important driver in\nthe disease, demonstrating that the number and activation state of mast cells are greatly increased in EoE biopsies and that mast cell\nsignatures correlate with markers of inflammation, fibrosis, pain and disease severity. Currently, there is only one FDA approved therapy\nfor EoE, representing an area of significant unmet need. Industry sources estimate there are approximately 160,000 patients in the United\nStates with EoE who have undergone treatment within the last 12 months and, of these, approximately 48,000 would be biologic-eligible.\nGiven the lack of effective therapies for EoE and barzolvolimab’s potential as a mast cell depleting agent, we believe EoE is an important\nindication for future study and plan to initiate a Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled subcutaneous study\ndesigned to assess the treatment effects and safety of barzolvolimab in patients with EoE in the first half of 2023."

In February\n2022, we reported that subcutaneous administration of barzolvolimab was well tolerated and that multiple dose levels have been\nidentified that possess promising pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Importantly, subcutaneous delivery of\nbarzolvolimab resulted in dose-dependent, rapid and sustained decreases in serum tryptase compared with placebo and achieved\nsufficient exposure to produce tryptase suppression levels comparable with the levels that generated impressive clinical activity observed\nin the Phase 1 CIndU intravenous study. The Phase 2 multi-dose studies in urticaria are designed to evaluate 75 mg and 150 mg\nadministered every 4 weeks and 300 mg administered every 8 weeks. These doses support a 0.5 to 2 ml injection volume, allowing for a\nsingle injection as barzolvolimab advances towards potential commercialization. In 2022, we initiated transfer of our current\nbarzolvolimab manufacturing process to a contract manufacturing organization to support late-stage trials and to prepare for potential\ncommercialization.\nIn February 2022, we reported interim data after completing the in-life dosing portion of our six-month chronic toxicology study in\nnon-human primates. The only clinically adverse finding at the completion of dosing was a profound impact on spermatogenesis, an\nexpected and well understood effect of KIT inhibition. As a standard part of toxicology studies, some animals from each group continued\nto be observed through a recovery period to understand the reversibility of any adverse findings. Due to the very high concentrations of\nbarzolvolimab at the end of dosing, the recovery period was approximately one year. As we expected, and consistent with previous\nfindings with KIT blocking antibodies, we were pleased to report in December 2022, that during this recovery period spermatogenesis\nfully recovered in all male animals as measured by both sperm count and motility. We expect the final histologic analysis and study\nreport in early 2023. We are encouraged with these findings and believe these data strongly support our Phase 2 studies in urticaria and in\nfuture indications.\nBispecific Platform\nOur next generation bispecific antibody platform is supporting the expansion of our pipeline with additional candidates for\ninflammatory diseases and oncology. Targets are being selected based on new science as well as their compatibility to be used in\nbispecific antibody formats with our existing antibody programs. Development is focused on emerging, important pathways controlling\ninflammatory diseases or immunity to tumors.\nCDX-585\nCDX-585 combines our proprietary highly active PD-1 blockade and anti-ILT4 blockade to prevent immunosuppressive signals in T\ncells and myeloid cells, respectively. ILT4 is emerging as an important immune checkpoint on myeloid cells and is thought to contribute\nto resistance to PD-1 blockade. Interactions of PD-1 and ILT4 with their ligands are known to deliver immune suppressive signals that\ncan attenuate anti-tumor immune responses. The concept behind CDX-585 is to simultaneously inhibit both T cell and myeloid\nsuppressive signals to potentiate the anti-tumor activity of both cell types, and potentially overcome PD-1 resistance. In preclinical\nstudies, CDX-585 was demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of PD-1 signaling in comparison to the approved PD-1 antibody, nivolumab.\nIn addition, CDX-585 activated and promoted a strong inflammatory phenotype in human macrophage and dendritic cell cultures.\nTogether these activities of CDX-585 enhanced the response in a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay above that observed for either\nparental mAb or the combination of the PD-1 and ILT4 mAbs. The in vivo efficacy of CDX-585 was also demonstrated in a melanoma\nhumanized mouse model. CDX-585 has successfully completed GMP manufacturing and IND-enabling studies to support clinical\ndevelopment. CDX-585 will initially be developed for the treatment of solid tumors either as monotherapy or in combination with other\noncologic treatments and is expected to enter the clinic in 2023 in patients with advanced malignancies.\nCDX-527\nCDX-527 used our proprietary highly active anti-PD-L1 and CD27 human antibodies to couple CD27 co-stimulation with blockade\nof the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway to help prime and activate anti-tumor T cell responses through CD27 co-stimulation, while preventing PD-1\ninhibitory signals that subvert the immune response. In the summer of 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with\nadvanced or metastatic solid tumors that had progressed during or after standard of care therapy to be followed by tumor-specific\nexpansion cohorts. Enrollment to the dose escalation portion was successfully completed and an expansion cohort in patients with\ncheckpoint naïve ovarian cancer was initiated. In November 2022, we provided an update on the study. With multiple"

A Phase 1 study was conducted in patients with\nrecurrent, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and B cell lymphomas. An MTD of 1.5 mg/kg was established and clinical activity\nwas observed both as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. Despite evidence of clinical benefit, questions remain to\nbe answered about CDX-1140, and the broader CD40 agonist class, regarding the best clinical settings, regimens, and possible\ncombinations before advancing into additional Celldex-sponsored studies. Given our pipeline priorities and resource requirements, in\nAugust of 2022, we announced that we are not progressing further Company-sponsored studies at this time and are exploring these\nquestions in third-party sponsored studies.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We\nbelieve our most critical accounting policies include accounting for contingent consideration, revenue recognition, intangible and long-\nlived assets, research and development expenses and stock-based compensation expense.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the\nresults we report in our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our experience and assumptions\nform the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual\nresults may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could materially change our reported\nresults. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial\nstatements and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our financial statements:\nContingent Consideration\nWe record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We determine the\nfair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors:\n●\ntiming and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals;\n●\ntiming and probability of success of meeting clinical and commercial milestones; and\n●\ndiscount rates.\nOur contingent consideration arose in connection with our acquisition of Kolltan. On a quarterly basis, we revalue these obligations\nand record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of\nour contingent consideration was $0.0 million. Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount\nrates, accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time, changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving\ndevelopment or commercial milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability\nassociated with regulatory approval.\nThe assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any\nchanges in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration adjustment recorded in any\ngiven period."

The terms of the agreements may include nonrefundable signing and licensing fees, funding\nfor research, development and manufacturing, milestone payments and royalties on any product sales derived from collaborations. The\nCompany assesses the multiple obligations typically within product development contracts to determine the distinct performance\nobligations and how to allocate the arrangement consideration to each distinct performance obligation. Under product development\nagreements, revenue is generally recognized using a cost-to-cost measure of progress. Revenue is recognized based on the costs incurred\nto date as a percentage of the total estimated costs to fulfill the contract. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds\nwith, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Due to the nature of the work performed in these arrangements, the\nestimation of cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables, such as expected clinical trial costs, and requires significant\njudgements. Circumstances can arise that change original estimates of costs or progress toward completion. Any revisions to estimates\nare reflected in revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the change in circumstances became known.\nRevenue for the Company is also derived from manufacturing and research and development arrangements. The Company owns and\noperates a cGMP manufacturing facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, to produce drug substance for its current and planned early-stage\nclinical trials. In order to utilize excess capacity, the Company has, from time to time, entered into contract manufacturing and research\nand development arrangements in which services are provided on a time-and-material basis or at a negotiated fixed- price. Revenue from\ntime-and-material contracts is generally recognized on an output basis as labor hours and/or direct expenses are incurred. Under fixed-\nprice contracts, revenue is generally recognized on an output basis as progress is made toward completion of the performance obligations\nusing surveys of performance completed to date.\nIntangible and Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment when circumstances indicate that an event\nof impairment may have occurred. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting\nfrom the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the\ncarrying amount of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values.\nIPR&D assets acquired in a business combination initially are recorded at fair value and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible\nassets. These assets are capitalized on our balance sheets until either the project underlying them is completed or the assets become\nimpaired. If a project is completed, the carrying value of the related intangible asset is amortized over the remaining estimated life of the\nasset beginning in the period in which the project is completed. If a project becomes impaired or is abandoned, the carrying value of the\nrelated intangible asset is written down to its fair value and an impairment charge is taken in the period in which the impairment occurs.\nDiscounted cash flow models are typically used in these tests, and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions\nincluding but not limited to:\n●\ntiming and costs to complete the in-process projects;"

The Company has the\noption to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the IPR&D asset is impaired and whether it is necessary\nto perform a quantitative impairment test.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs, including internal and contract research costs, are expensed as incurred. Research and development\nexpenses consist mainly of clinical trial costs, manufacturing of clinical material, toxicology and other preclinical studies, personnel\ncosts, depreciation, license fees and funding of outside contracted research.\nClinical trial expenses include expenses associated with clinical research organization, or CRO, services. Contract manufacturing\nexpenses include expenses associated with contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, services. The invoicing from CROs and CMOs\nfor services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO and CMO activities based\non our estimate of costs incurred. We maintain regular communication with our CROs and CMOs to assess the reasonableness of our\nestimates. Differences between actual expenses and estimated expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the\nperiod in which they become known.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe record stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees, consultants and non-employee\ndirectors based on the estimated fair values of the stock-based awards expected to vest at the grant date and adjust, if necessary, to reflect\nactual forfeitures. Our estimates of employee, consultant, and non-employ director stock option values rely on estimates of future\nuncertain events. Significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to estimate the expected stock price volatility. We also\nestimate expected term based on historical exercise patterns. For consultant and non-employee director grants, we may elect to use the\ncontractual term as the expected term in the option-pricing model. Actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different\nfrom our estimates. Compensation expense for all stock-based awards is recognized using the straight-line method over the term of\nvesting or performance."

We maintain cash balances\nwith financial institutions in excess of insured limits. We do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances. We invest our\nexcess cash balances in marketable securities, including municipal bond securities, U.S. government agency securities and high- grade\ncorporate bonds that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our investment policy seeks to manage\nthese assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity.\nThe use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees; facility and facility-related\ncosts for our offices, laboratories and manufacturing facility; fees paid in connection with preclinical studies, clinical studies, contract\nmanufacturing, laboratory supplies and services; and consulting, legal and other professional fees. We anticipate that our cash flows from\noperations will continue to be focused in these areas as we progress our current drug candidates through the clinical trial process and\ndevelop additional drug candidates. To date, the primary sources of cash flows from operations have been payments received from our\ncollaborative partners and from government entities and payments received for contract manufacturing and research and development\nservices provided by us. The timing of any new contract manufacturing and research and development agreements, collaboration\nagreements, government contracts or grants and any payments under these agreements, contracts or grants cannot be easily predicted and\nmay vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nAt December 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $305.0\nmillion. We have had recurring losses and incurred a loss of $112.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net cash used in\noperations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $103.7 million. We believe that the cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities at December 31, 2022 are sufficient to meet estimated working capital requirements and fund planned operations through 2025,\nwhich include our ongoing Phase 1b studies in urticaria and prurigo nodularis and our ongoing and planned Phase 2 studies in CSU,\nCIndU and EoE. This could be impacted if we elect to pay the future milestones under the Settlement Agreement with SRS, if any, in\ncash.\nDuring the next twelve months, we may take further steps to raise additional capital to meet our long-term liquidity needs including,\nbut not limited to, one or more of the following: the licensing of drug candidates with existing or new collaborative partners, possible\nbusiness combinations, issuance of debt, or the issuance of common stock or other securities via private placements or public offerings.\nAlthough we have been successful in raising capital in the past, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on\nacceptable terms, if at all, and our negotiating position in capital raising efforts may worsen as existing resources are used. There is also\nno assurance that we will be able to enter into further collaborative relationships. Additional equity financings may be dilutive to our\nstockholders; debt financing, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to\noperate as a business; and licensing or strategic collaborations may result in royalties or other terms which reduce our economic potential\nfrom products under development. Our ability to continue funding our planned operations into and beyond twelve months from the\nissuance date is also dependent on the timing and manner of payment of the future milestones under the Settlement Agreement with SRS,\nin the event that we achieve the milestones related to those payments. We may decide to pay those milestone payments in cash, shares of\nour common stock or a combination thereof. If we are unable to raise the funds necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs, we may\nhave to delay or discontinue the development of one or more programs, discontinue or delay ongoing or anticipated clinical trials,\ndiscontinue or delay our commercial manufacturing efforts, discontinue or delay our efforts to expand into additional indications for our\ndrug product candidates, license out programs earlier than expected, raise funds at a significant discount or on other unfavorable terms, if\nat all, or sell all or a part of our business."

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk as part of our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio is used to\npreserve our capital until it is used to fund operations, including our research and development activities. None of these market-risk\nsensitive instruments are held for trading purposes. We invest our cash primarily in money market mutual funds.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. and its subsidiary (the “Company”) as\nof December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of stockholders’ equity\nand of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to\nas the “consolidated financial statements”).

Also in\nour opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control\nover financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s\nAnnual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are\na public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due\nto error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures\nthat are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nKolltan Settlement - Accounting for Future Milestone Payments\nAs described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, on November 29, 2016, the Company acquired all of the share and \ndebt interests of Kolltan, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, in exchange for 1,217,200 shares of the Company’s common stock \nplus contingent consideration of up to $172.5 million payable in cash, in shares of Celldex’s common stock or a combination of both, in \nthe sole discretion of the Company and subject to provisions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 1, 2016 (the \n“Merger Agreement”) with such contingent consideration based on the achievement of development, regulatory approval or sales-based \nmilestones (“Kolltan Milestones”). In October 2019, the Company received a letter from Shareholder Representative Services LLC \n(“SRS”), the hired representative of the former stockholders of Kolltan, notifying the Company that it objected to the Company’s \ncharacterization of the development, regulatory approval and sales-based Kolltan Milestones relating to CDX-0158 as having been \nabandoned and contending instead that the related milestone payments are due from the Company to the Kolltan stockholders. On \nAugust 18, 2020, the Company filed a Verified Complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against SRS (the \n“litigation”). On June 20, 2022, the Company entered into a binding settlement term sheet with SRS, related to the litigation, which, upon \nexecution of a definitive settlement agreement and the initial payment of $15 million would result in the joint dismissal, with prejudice, \nof all claims and counterclaims in the litigation. The definitive settlement agreement between the Company and SRS was executed on \nJuly 15, 2022 (the “Settlement Agreement”).  The payment obligations under the Settlement Agreement replace, in their entirety, the \ncontingent consideration in the Merger Agreement. As described by management, future milestone payments related to the CDX-0159 \nprogram, which was subject to the litigation, will be recorded when and if payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable in \naccordance with the loss contingency model whereas milestones related to the remaining surviving company products are measured at \nfair value in accordance with the contingent consideration model.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Kolltan settlement - accounting for\nfuture milestone payments is a critical audit matter is the high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures relating to management’s\ndetermination that the future milestone payments required in connection with the Kolltan settlement will be assessed under the loss\ncontingency model as it relates to the CDX-0159 program, and under the contingent consideration model as it relates to the surviving\ncompany products under the Merger Agreement."

(the “Company” or “Celldex”) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing therapeutic\nmonoclonal and bispecific antibodies that address diseases for which available treatments are inadequate. The Company is primarily\nfocusing its efforts and resources on the continued research and development of barzolvolimab (also referred to as CDX-0159) and CDX-\n585.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $305.0 million. The Company has had\nrecurring losses and incurred a loss of $112.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net cash used in operations for the year\nended December 31, 2022 was $103.7 million. The Company believes that the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the\nfiling date of this Form 10-K will be sufficient to meet estimated working capital requirements and fund planned operations for at least\nthe next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements.\nDuring the next twelve months and beyond, the Company may take further steps to raise additional capital to meet its long-term\nliquidity needs including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: the licensing of drug candidates with existing or new\ncollaborative partners, possible business combinations, issuance of debt, or the issuance of common stock or other securities via private\nplacements or public offerings. Although the Company has been successful in raising capital in the past, there can be no assurance that\nadditional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and the Company’s negotiating position in capital-raising efforts may\nworsen as existing resources are used. There is also no assurance that the Company will be able to enter into further collaborative\nrelationships. Additional equity financings may be dilutive to the Company’s stockholders; debt financing, if available, may involve\nsignificant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to operate as a business; and licensing or strategic\ncollaborations may result in royalties or other terms which reduce the Company’s economic potential from products under development.\nThe Company’s ability to continue funding its planned operations beyond twelve months from the issuance date is also dependent on the\ntiming and manner of payment of amounts due under the Settlement Agreement with Shareholder Representative Services LLC (“SRS”)\n(refer to Note 17), in the event that the Company achieves the milestones related to those payments. The Company, at its option, may\ndecide to pay those milestone payments in cash, shares of its common stock or a combination thereof. If the Company is unable to raise\nthe funds necessary to meet its long-term liquidity needs, it may have to delay or discontinue the development of one or more programs,\ndiscontinue or delay ongoing or anticipated clinical trials, discontinue or delay our commercial manufacturing efforts, discontinue or\ndelay our efforts to expand into additional indications for our drug product candidates, license out programs earlier than expected, raise\nfunds at a significant discount or on other unfavorable terms, if at all, or sell all or a part of the Company.\n(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe balance sheets and statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, are consolidated for\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. These consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the Company and\nits wholly-owned subsidiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company operates\nin one segment, which is the business of development, manufacturing and commercialization of novel therapeutics for human health\ncare.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates."

Cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds and debt securities.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company invests its excess cash balances in marketable securities, including municipal bond securities, U.S. government\nagency securities, and highly rated corporate bonds. The Company classifies all of its marketable securities as current assets on the\nbalance sheets because they are available-for-sale and available to fund current operations. Marketable securities are stated at fair value\nwith unrealized gains and losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a separate\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity, until such gains and losses are realized. If a decline in the fair value is considered other-than-\ntemporary, based on available evidence, the unrealized loss is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the\nstatements of operations. Realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method and are included in investment\nand other income, net.\nConcentration of Credit Risk and of Significant Customers and Suppliers\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash, cash\nequivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company invests its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in\ndebt instruments and interest-bearing accounts at major financial institutions in excess of insured limits. The Company mitigates credit\nrisk by limiting the investment type and maturity to securities that preserve capital, maintain liquidity and have a high credit quality. The\nCompany has not historically experienced credit losses from its accounts receivable and therefore has not established an allowance for\ndoubtful accounts.\nRevenue from Rockefeller University represented 75% of total Company revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue\nfrom Rockefeller University and Gilead Sciences represented 88% and 85% of total Company revenue for the years ended December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company relies on contract manufacturing organizations (CMO) to manufacture drug substance and drug product as well as for\nfuture commercial supplies. The Company also relies on CMOs for supply of raw materials as well as filling, packaging, storing and\nshipping our drug products.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company has certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in the financial statements. The Company seeks to\nmaximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from sources independent from the Company) and to minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs (the Company’s assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities) when measuring the\nfair value of its assets and liabilities. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of the following fair value\nhierarchy as defined by U.S. GAAP:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or\nliability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing\ninformation on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and\nquoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing\nthe asset or liability.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line\nmethod. Laboratory equipment and office furniture and equipment are depreciated over five years, and computer equipment is\ndepreciated over three years. Manufacturing equipment is depreciated over seven to ten years. Leasehold improvements"

Property and equipment under construction is classified as construction in progress and is depreciated or\namortized only after the asset is placed in service. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense whereas the costs of\nsignificant improvements which extend the life of the underlying asset are capitalized. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets\ndisposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the Company’s\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe treatment of costs to construct property and equipment depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction. Costs\nincurred in the project planning, design, construction and installation phases are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset. The Company\nstops capitalizing these costs when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. For manufacturing property and\nequipment, the Company also capitalizes the cost of validating these assets for the underlying manufacturing process. The Company\ncompletes the capitalization of validation costs when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Costs capitalized\ninclude incremental labor and fringe benefits, and direct consultancy services.\nLeases\nThe Company has operating leases of office, manufacturing and laboratory space, which have remaining lease terms of one to three\nyears and may include one or more options to renew or terminate early.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are\nrecognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Certain\nadjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as prepaid or accrued lease payments, initial direct costs paid or\nincentives received. The Company’s leases do not contain an implicit rate, and therefore the Company uses an estimated incremental\nborrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nOptions to extend or terminate the lease are reflected in the calculation when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\nThe Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component, however non-lease components\nthat are variable, such as common area maintenance and utilities, are generally paid separately from rent based on actual costs incurred\nand therefore are not included in the right-of-use asset and operating lease liability and are reflected as an expense in the period incurred.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.\nContingent Consideration\nThe Company records contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. The\nCompany determines the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the (i) timing and probability of success of clinical\nevents or regulatory approvals; (ii) timing and probability of success of meeting clinical and commercial milestones; and (iii) discount\nrates. The Company’s contingent consideration liabilities arose in connection with its acquisition of Kolltan. On a quarterly basis, the\nCompany revalues these obligations and records increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings.\nChanges to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates, accretion of the discount rates due to the\npassage of time, changes in the Company’s estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones,\nchanges in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. The\nassumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in\nthe underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration adjustment recorded in any given\nperiod.\nIntangible Assets\nIPR&D assets acquired in a business combination initially are recorded at fair value and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible\nassets. The valuation model used to measure the fair value of the Company’s IPR&D assets was primarily a discounted cash flow\napproach. The assumptions used in determining the fair value of the Company’s IPR&D assets include (i) probability of success; (ii)\nprobability of partnership; (iii) partnership milestones; and (iv) discount rate. These assets are capitalized on the Company’s balance\nsheets until either the project underlying them is completed or the assets become impaired. If a project is completed, the carrying value of\nthe related intangible asset is amortized over the remaining estimated life of the asset beginning in the period in which the project is\ncompleted. If a project becomes impaired or is abandoned, the carrying value of the related intangible asset is written down to its fair\nvalue and an impairment charge is taken in the period in which the impairment occurs."

The Company has the\noption to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the IPR&D asset is impaired and whether it is necessary\nto perform a quantitative impairment test.\nImpairment of Intangible and Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and\nintangible assets when circumstances indicate that an event of impairment may have occurred. Determination of recoverability is based\non an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such\ncash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their estimated\nfair values.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when performance obligations under agreements or contracts are satisfied, in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n●\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n●\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n●\nDetermination of the transaction price;\n●\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n●\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nRevenue for the Company is derived from product development agreements with collaborative partners for the research and\ndevelopment of therapeutic drug candidates. The terms of the agreements may include nonrefundable signing and licensing fees, funding\nfor research, development and manufacturing, milestone payments and royalties on any product sales derived from collaborations. The\nCompany assesses the multiple obligations typically within product development contracts to determine the distinct performance\nobligations and how to allocate the arrangement consideration to each distinct performance obligation. Under product development\nagreements, revenue is generally recognized using a cost-to-cost measure of progress. Revenue is recognized based on the costs incurred\nto date as a percentage of the total estimated costs to fulfill the contract. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds\nwith, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Due to the nature of the work performed in these arrangements, the\nestimation of cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables, such as expected clinical trial costs, and requires significant\njudgements. Circumstances can arise that change original estimates of costs or progress toward completion. Any revisions to estimates\nare reflected in revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the change in circumstances became known.\nRevenue for the Company is also derived from manufacturing and research and development arrangements. The Company owns and\noperates a cGMP manufacturing facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, to produce drug substance for its current and planned early-stage\nclinical trials. In order to utilize excess capacity, the Company has, from time to time, entered into contract manufacturing and research\nand development arrangements in which services are provided on a time-and-material basis or at a negotiated fixed price. Revenue from\ntime-and-material contracts is generally recognized on an output basis as labor hours and/or direct expenses are incurred. Under fixed-\nprice contracts, revenue is generally recognized on an output basis as progress is made toward completion of the performance obligations\nusing surveys of performance completed to date."

A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional as compared to a contract asset which is a right to\nconsideration that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time.\nThe Company’s contract liabilities result from arrangements where the Company has received payment in advance of performance\nunder the contract. These amounts are included as deferred revenue within current portion of long-term liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs, including internal and contract research costs, are expensed as incurred. Research and development\nexpenses consist mainly of clinical trial costs, manufacturing of clinical material, toxicology and other preclinical studies, personnel\ncosts, depreciation, license fees and funding of outside contracted research.\nClinical trial expenses include expenses associated with clinical research organization, or CRO, services. Contract manufacturing\nexpenses include expenses associated with contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, services. The invoicing from CROs and CMOs\nfor services rendered can lag several months. The Company accrues the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO and CMO\nactivities based on our estimate of costs incurred. The Company maintains regular communication with our CROs and CMOs to assess\nthe reasonableness of its estimates. Differences between actual expenses and estimated expenses recorded have not been material and are\nadjusted for in the period in which they become known.\nPatent Costs\nPatent costs are expensed to general and administrative expense as incurred. Certain patent costs are reimbursed by the Company’s\nproduct development and licensing partners. Any reimbursed patent costs are recorded as product development and licensing agreement\nrevenues in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees, consultants and non-\nemployee directors based on the estimated fair values of the stock-based awards expected to vest at the grant date and adjusts, if\nnecessary, to reflect actual forfeitures. Compensation expense for all stock-based awards is recognized using the straight-line method\nover the term of vesting or performance.\nForeign Currency Translation\nNet unrealized gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, accumulated other comprehensive income includes a net unrealized gain related to foreign\ncurrency translation of $2.6 million.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes, including the recognition of deferred tax assets and\ndeferred tax liabilities for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement amounts and\ntheir respective tax basis. Quarterly, the Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recovery. A valuation allowance is established when\nthe Company believes that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from\nperiod to period are included in the Company’s tax provision in the period of change.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the uncertain tax\nposition will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The Company records interest and penalties related to uncertain\ntax positions in income tax expense."

The\nCompany includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities in other\ncomprehensive loss. The statements of operations and comprehensive loss reflect total comprehensive loss for the years ended December\n31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nNet Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per common share is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period,\nexcluding restricted stock that has been issued but is not yet vested. Diluted net loss per common share is based upon the weighted-\naverage number of common shares outstanding during the period plus additional weighted-average potentially dilutive common shares\noutstanding during the period when the effect is dilutive. In periods in which the Company reports a net loss, there is no difference\nbetween basic and diluted net loss per share because dilutive shares of common stock are not assumed to have been issued as their effect\nis anti-dilutive. The potentially dilutive common shares that have not been included in the net loss per common share calculations\nbecause the effect would have been anti-dilutive are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, \n    \n2022\n    \n2021\n    \n2020\nStock options\n5,085,662\n4,077,667\n3,042,229\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other\nstandard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company\nbelieves that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance on the Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The guidance requires that\ncredit losses be reported using an expected losses model rather than the incurred losses model that is currently used, and establishes\nadditional disclosures related to credit risks. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the standard now requires\nallowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. This standard will be effective for the Company on\nJanuary 1, 2023. The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements and related disclosures.\n(3) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reported as a component of stockholders’ equity, for the year\nended December 31, 2022 are summarized below:\n    \nUnrealized \n    \n    \nGain (Loss) on\nMarketable\nForeign\nSecurities\nCurrency Items\nTotal\n(In thousands)\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n$\n(702)\n$\n2,596\n$\n1,894\nOther comprehensive loss\n(634)\n—\n(634)\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n(1,336)\n$\n2,596\n$\n1,260\nNo amounts were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020."

The significant unobservable inputs used in\nthe fair value measurement of the contingent consideration are estimates, including probability of success, discount rates and amount of\ntime until the conditions of the milestone payments are met.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $6.9 million gain on fair value remeasurement of contingent\nconsideration primarily due to the Company’s decision to deprioritize the CDX-1140 program. The assumptions related to determining\nthe value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a\nmaterial impact on the amount of contingent consideration adjustment recorded in any given period.\nThe Company did not have any transfers of assets or liabilities between the fair value measurement classifications during the years\nended December 31, 2022 and 2021."

Barzolvolimab is in Phase 2 development. As of December 31, 2022, the IPR&D asset\nrelated to the anti-KIT program had not reached technological feasibility nor did the asset have alternative future uses.\nThe Company performs an impairment test on IPR&D assets at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that IPR&D assets may be impaired. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company decided that although it had\ndeveloped promising data for the AxL target within the TAM program, it would focus its efforts on out-licensing opportunities for its\nTAM program, a broad antibody discovery effort to generate antibodies that modulate the TAM family of RTKs, comprised of Tyro3,\nAxL and MerTK. As a result, the Company evaluated the TAM program IPR&D asset for potential impairment due to the change in\nprojected development and regulatory timelines related to the program. The Company used a discounted cash flow fair value model and\nrecorded a non-cash partial impairment charge of $14.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. During the third quarter of 2021, the\nCompany evaluated its out-licensing progress since December 31, 2020 and the status and expectation for the TAM program. Despite the\nCompany’s efforts to out-license, there was a lack of interest in the program from third parties. Therefore, the Company evaluated the\nTAM program IPR&D asset for potential impairment using a discounted cash flow fair value model and concluded that the TAM IPR&D\nasset was fully impaired. A non-cash impairment charge of $3.5 million was recorded for the third quarter of 2021. The Company\nevaluated the CDX-3379 IPR&D asset for potential impairment as a result of the discontinuation of the CDX-3379 program in the\nsecond quarter of 2020. The Company concluded that the CDX-3379 IPR&D asset was fully impaired, and a non-cash impairment\ncharge of $3.5 million was recorded during the second quarter of 2020. The Company performed its annual impairment test of the\nIPR&D asset related to the development of the anti-KIT program (including barzolvolimab) during the fourth quarter of 2022 and\nconcluded that the IPR&D asset was not impaired. Due to the nature of IPR&D projects, the Company may experience future delays or\nfailures to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials, failures of such clinical trials or other failures to achieve a commercially\nviable product, and as a result, may recognize further impairment losses in the future."

Among other provisions, the CARES Act included (i) the ability to use net operating losses to offset income without the 80%\ntaxable income limitation enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) for net operating losses incurred in the 2018, 2019 or\n2020 tax years; and (ii) the ability to claim a current deduction for interest expense up to 50% of adjusted taxable income for the 2019\nand 2020 tax years (rather than 30% of adjusted taxable income pursuant to the TCJA). We do not expect that any of the provisions of the\nCARES Act will result in a material impact to the financial statements.\nThe net deferred tax liability of $1.6 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, relates to the temporary differences associated with the\nIPR&D intangible assets acquired in previous business combinations and are not deductible for tax purposes. The Company recorded an\nincome tax benefit of $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to a decrease in deferred tax liabilities resulting from\nthe impairment of the TAM program IPR&D asset in the third quarter of 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $623.1 million and $879.9 million,\nrespectively, which may be available to offset certain future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2023 and 2029, respectively. Of\nthe federal net operating loss carryforwards of $623.1 million, approximately $374.8 million are from 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022\nand have no expiration date. As of December 31, 2022, the Company also had federal and state research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards of $41.4 million and $11.7 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to\nexpire in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nUtilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual\nlimitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or Section 382, due to ownership changes that occurred previously or\nthat could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset\nfuture taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of\ncertain shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. The Company has\nestimated the amounts of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards which will expire unutilized as a\nresult of its estimated annual limitations under Section 382 and has excluded those amounts from the carryforward amounts disclosed\nabove and in the deferred tax assets and liabilities table included in this footnote. The Company has concluded Section 382 studies\nthrough 2015 for Celldex generated NOLs.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits."

The definitive settlement agreement between the\nCompany and SRS was executed on July 15, 2022 (the “Settlement Agreement”) and the Company and SRS jointly filed a Stipulation of\nDismissal with prejudice relating to the Litigation on July 19, 2022.\nPursuant to the terms of the Term Sheet and the Settlement Agreement, all milestone payments provided for by the Merger\nAgreement are replaced in their entirety with the following payments, each of which is payable only once:\n(i)\nThe Company paid $15.0 million upon execution of the Settlement Agreement (the “Initial Payment”).\n(ii) The Company shall pay $15.0 million upon the Successful Completion (as defined in the Term Sheet) of a Phase 2 Clinical\nTrial (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of barzolvolimab, subject to the $2.5 million contractual credit as set forth in the\nMerger Agreement."

The terms of our common stock may also be affected by\nDelaware law.\nGeneral\nWe are authorized to issue up to 297,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share. We are also authorized to\nissue up to 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which have been designated as Class C Preferred Stock, including\n350,000 shares which have been designated as Series C-1 Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, the terms of\nwhich are to be determined by our Board of Directors.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CLDX”.\nDescription of Common Stock\nDividends\nThe Board of Directors may, out of funds legally available, at any regular or special meeting, declare dividends to the\nholders of shares of our common stock as and when they deem expedient, subject to the rights of holders of the preferred\nstock, if any.\nVoting\nEach share of common stock entitles the holders to one vote per share on all matters requiring a vote of the stockholders,\nincluding the election of directors.

      "text": "Anti-Takeover Provisions\nCertain provisions in our third restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, our second amended and restated by-laws\n(the “by-laws”) and applicable Delaware corporate law, may have the effect of discouraging a change of control of Celldex,\neven if such a transaction is favored by some of our stockholders and could result in stockholders receiving a substantial\npremium over the current market price of our shares. The primary purpose of these provisions, which are summarized below\nis to encourage negotiations with our management by persons interested in acquiring control of our corporation.\n·\nSpecial Meetings.  Our by-laws provide that, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of our\nstockholders can only be called by the chair of the board, our president, secretary or our board of directors.\n·\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals.    Our by-laws establish an advance notice procedure for\nstockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders, including proposed nominations of\npersons for election to our board of directors. Stockholders at an annual meeting are only able to consider proposals\nor nominations specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our board of\ndirectors or by a stockholder of record on the record date for the meeting who is entitled to vote at the meeting and\nwho has delivered timely written notice in proper form to our secretary of the stockholder’s intention to bring such\nbusiness before the meeting. These provisions could have the effect of delaying until the next stockholder meeting\nstockholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities.\n·\nDelaware Business Combination Statute.    We are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the\nState of Delaware. Subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 prevents a publicly held Delaware corporation from\nengaging in a “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for three years following the date that the\nperson became an interested stockholder, unless the interested stockholder attained such status with the approval of\nour board of directors or unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A “business\ncombination” includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving us and the “interested stockholder”\nand the sale of more than 10% of our assets. In general, an “interested stockholder” is any entity or person\nbeneficially owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or\ncontrolling or controlled by such entity or person.\n·\nExclusive Forum Selection.    Our by-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an \nalternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have, or \ndeclines to accept, jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court located within the State of Delaware) will be the \nsole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting any internal corporate claims. Such claims include claims in \nthe right of the Company that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, employee \nor stockholder in such capacity, or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) confers \njurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery.  Our by-laws also provide that unless otherwise selected or consented to by \nthe Company, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the sole and exclusive forum for any \ncomplaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nComputershare Trust Company, N.A. is presently the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock."
