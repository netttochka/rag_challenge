We had a good \nteam, loyal clients and opportunities to grow. \nOur reputation with banks and regulators was \nsound. However, we were not executing well \n– a lot of activity, but an unclear operating \nframework resulting in us not meeting the \ncommitments we held ourselves accountable to. \nOur vital signs – customer growth, revenue and \nearnings – were all in decline. \nCompetition had intensified significantly. \nCompetitors were well funded and measured \nsuccess by revenue growth and growth in \ncustomer numbers while generating ever \nincreasing losses. The options available for \nclients and prospects had changed dramatically, \nand we had been slow to adapt and evolve.\nExecuting and building a valuable Company\nWe set out to reconnect with our core values – \ngrowing client value, generating a sustainable \nreturn, and innovating within the new \nenvironment we saw. We significantly upgraded \nour global executive team; and intensified our \nfocus on Corporate and on growing the North \nAmerican region. We increased our investment \nin technology and improving our customer \nexperience and our risk management and \ncompliance – all while preserving our core \nvalues. There were many times where it felt like \nwe were swimming against the tide but the \nBoard and the Management Team remained \nresilient and focused on the strategy we had \ncommitted to. I am delighted to see the \nprogress we have made in building a more \nvaluable Company.\nSkander will share the fiscal year 2022 results, \nbut it must be said they are the result of years of \nhard work, investment and good execution, from \nBoard through management and the broader \nOFX employee community, everywhere.\nSome key highlights:\n•\tIt took us around 14 years to generate a \nmonthly turnover of $1b in December 2013.\n•\tIt took us another six years to get to a monthly \nturnover of $2b in December 2019.\n•\tIt only took us two more years to get to $3b of \nmonthly turnover in 2021.\n•\tIn our last fiscal year we generated $33.2b in \nturnover, at a healthy EBITDA margin, which \nis up from $19.4b in fiscal year 2017.\n•\tWe completed our first investment, in \nTreasurUp in June 2021, and our second, \nin acquiring Firma, in May 2022.\nI am pleased to share that execution and progress against our strategic \npriorities in fiscal year 2022 has been outstanding, and that the Board \nand I are very pleased with the progress we are making.\nFrom the Chairperson\n2  \nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited"

We see the \nincreasing regulatory focus which we believe \nwe have is a competitive strength of ours. \nWe believe that increasing interest rates and \nthe challenge competition are facing with \ntheir path to profitability as being new and \npositive tailwinds for us, because our team, \nour execution, have never been better. \nOur customers are experiencing that and our \ninvestors are seeing that. There are still several \nrisks we must navigate – most notably the \nincrease in cyber risk, increasing societal \nexpectations of good governance, and in the \nwar for talent. However, we feel as well placed \nas ever to manage those on your behalf, as we \ncontinue to build a strong, sustainable Company. \nI want to thank my fellow Directors for their \ndedication and commitment when the \nCompany needed it. Their dedication is \nextraordinary, especially in the context of \nmore scrutiny, more time that is required for \nmergers and acquisitions, and higher \nexpectations from investors. \nFinally, on behalf of our clients and our \npartners, I want to thank Skander and the OFX \nteam for their extraordinary hard work, skill \nand perseverance in these uncertain times. \nSteven Sargent\nChairperson\n17 May 2022\nFrom the Chairperson"

The repositioning \nand hard work put in over the last five years \nmeant we were able to maximise the benefits of \nthis, and have contributed to records in most key \nmetrics. Shareholders have seen the value of the \nCompany as measured by its market \ncapitalisation grow from $275m to $602m in the \n12 months to 31 March 2022, and we are very \nwell positioned for the next economic \nenvironment. \nThe Board and I have consistently aimed for \nsustainable growth, and last year our investment \nin those foundations – people, risk and scalable \ntechnology – hit all-time highs, with headcount \ngrowing to 459, total compensation to $66.5m, \nrisk investments across our infrastructure, \nsoftware, people and regulatory compliance \ngrowing to $14.1m, and our capex overall, 89% of \nwhich is in building new scalable systems, grew \nto $11.5m, in addition to technology operating \nexpenses growing as we transition more of our \ntechnology to software-as a-service programs. \nTo complement this, our growth drivers have \nalso got record investments, with promotional \nexpenses at $16.5m, our highest ever excluding \nwhen we rebranded; our partnerships programs \nacross our four segments driving record \noutcomes; and our regional investments in North \nAmerica and UK/Europe also at record highs.\nWith all this investment, it’s great to see the \noutcomes covered in our trading highlights \nbelow. And those investments are the engine \nfor our future growth. \nTo complement all our organic efforts and \ninvestments, it was very encouraging to \nannounce our first two inorganic investments \n– a $6.1m investment in TreasurUp and the \nacquisition of Firma for CAD90m (AUD98m). \nMore on those later, but it’s a huge credit to the \nBoard, the leadership and the entire OFX Group \nto be able to invest to that extent, in such a \ndisciplined way, whilst delivering record \nperformance.\nTrading highlights\nNet Operating Income of $147.0m, up 24.7% on \nFY21 and 17.5% on FY20.\nLosses of $0.1m, down 94.1% on FY21, and 96.5% \non FY20.\nUnderlying EBITDA of $44.5m, up 53.1% on FY21 \nand 16.4% on FY20.\nA record year\nUnderpinning the trading highlights were very \nstrong performances across the regions and the \nsegments. Our largest region, APAC, delivered \n$83.7m of revenue which was up 12.8% on FY21. \nThat was driven by a very strong performance in \nA&NZ, across all segments. In addition to terrific \ngrowth in Corporate, we are also activating our \nlargest Enterprise opportunities in A&NZ. \nHowever, it was good to see the hard work in \nAsia starting to bear fruit, with Asia Corporate \nrevenue up 108.5% in the full year and 24.5% in \nthe 2H. Singapore was our fastest growing \ncountry, with revenue up 73.6%. \nNorth America had an exceptional year, with \nrevenue up 27.8%. Losses were down 92%; a \nThis was a terrific year for OFX.

Corporate was the standout, growing \nrevenue by 14.5% v FY21, growing new revenue \nby 13.7% v FY21 (and 29.9% ex offshore share \npurchases), and growing more profitably through \nthe implementation of better risk tools, better \nbanking infrastructure, and stronger commercial \ndiscipline. Our Online Seller segment for the \nyear was close to flat, a good performance \nwhen eCommerce activity retreated from very \nsignificant COVID-driven highs in FY21, and \nwe continued to pivot away from low margin \nvolume in Asia. Our Enterprise segment had \na strong year, growing revenue 31.3%, and the \npipeline continues to grow across all regions. \nFinally, Consumer had a wonderful year – our \nvalue proposition of ‘digital+human’, targeting \nhigher value use cases like property and wealth \nmanagement, were very popular – and the \nsupport of a strong banking infrastructure has \nnever been more valuable.

      "text": "Inorganic investments\nThis year was historic for OFX’s first inorganic \ninvestments. It represents years of hard work, \na lot of lessons learned and an unerring focus \non doing the right transactions, not just any \ntransactions. \nOur investment in TreasurUp, a software \ncompany that specialises in risk management \nprograms that banks and fintechs can offer to \ntheir mid-sized Corporate clients, was a great \nstart. The valuation, relative to other similar \nvaluations, was fair; but pleasingly, the cultural \nfit with the team there is strong – they are \ncreative, hard-working, have a deep service \nculture and are hungry to grow. Their expertise \nin banking mid-sized Corporates, across foreign \nexchange, cash management and treasury \nmanagement, has taught us a lot, and in turn \nwe are playing our part in helping them focus \non which commercial opportunities are the \nstrongest, and how to scale globally. They have \nmet their objectives for last year and look set for \na strong year next year.\nThe announcement in December that OFX would \nacquire 100% of Firma was a terrific moment for \nus. The fit to our strategy was very clear, the \nteam are exceptional, the opportunity to help \ntake their business digital is great, and it was a \ngood size that made it very appropriate to be \ndebt-funded. By the time this is published the \nacquisition will be largely complete, a great \nachievement for our Legal, Finance, Risk and \nbroader teams, as well as the great support from \nour advisors. I could not be more grateful for the \nBoard’s wisdom and support – they helped us \nmove quickly, clearly and strategically to success. \nOur first year of integration is about retaining \nthe Firma people, about delivering Firma \nunderlying EPS accretion of 20% on an \nannualised in year basis, and ensuring the \nintegration execution is well set for Year 2. \nBuilding a more valuable Company\nEvery year, we reflect on and invest in initiatives \nor improvements that help us grow the value of \nOFX over time, not just in that year. Last year \nwas no different; in fact, perhaps the year that \nthe value of earlier investments in things like \nscalable systems, geographic expansion and \nrisk management really bore fruit. This year we \ninvested more deeply in systems to enhance our \nEnterprise client experience, in a better set of \npayment capabilities, in a better cyber security \nposture, in a substantial database upgrade, and \nmany more. These investments will be felt by \nshareholders, clients and regulators for years \nto come.\nOur People\nNo CEO can reflect on last year without giving \nthanks to their people. When we laid our \nfoundational pillars back in 2018, we talked about \none of the three being people. Hardly creative \nbut this last year, never more important or \nvaluable. The challenges were immense and were \ngenerally uncharted territory – remote work, \nfatigue, volatility of markets, an unprecedented \ndegree of wage inflation leaving some managers \nwith employees getting 40%, 50% and 60% \ncompeting pay offers, an increasing regulatory \nfocus and more. This is just what people had to \nnavigate in their professional lives.\nOur leadership, at all levels and in all regions, \ndid a magnificent job in supporting and growing \nour people. OFX has always fostered a culture \nof respect, of learning, and of making a \ndifference, and these values were how we \nnavigated the toughest leadership year of my \nprofessional career. \nSo how did we navigate this, and how did we \nfinish the year?\nFrom the CEO \n6  \nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited"

      "text": "Firstly, as leaders, we established respect for \npeople’s personal challenges as well as their \nprofessional ones. We set up flexible working \narrangements, and we respected them. We gave \npeople the space they needed, and they gave us \nproductivity and their legendary service culture \nin return. In response to the statement in our \nannual engagement survey, “I believe our \norganisation is supporting us to have a more \nflexible workplace”, 93% of employee \nrespondents agreed. \nSecondly, as a smaller company, our people told \nus that one of their motivators was learning. \nSo we committed to that in a number of ways. \nNot just through traditional learning and \ndevelopment through better programs, albeit \nremote ones, but through new assignments, \nworking groups, more feedback. For example, \nthe Firma acquisition included many employees \nwho had never done M&A but were hungry to \nlearn from those who had, so we included them \non our deal team, and they responded superbly.\nFinally, we encouraged and celebrated, as best \nwe could, people making a difference. We gave \npeople new assignments. Although we had held \nback pay rises (as we had awarded them in FY20 \nwhen the outlook was very uncertain), we did \nover 89 salary adjustments for people who had \ntaken on increased responsibilities, or a \npromotion. We complemented that with stock \ngrants for people who had gone ‘above and \nbeyond’, and, through our ESS grant, to everyone \nfor ‘staying the course’ in tough times. \nAs a Company that has thrived for 20+ years, \nthrough global disruptions such as the dotcom \nboom and bust in 2002, the financial crisis in \n2008, Brexit in 2016, and now COVID in 2020- \n2022, we have shown our resilience as people, \nand as a model. I am immensely grateful to our \nBoard for their support, and to every one of our \nExecutives – Selena Verth, Mark Shaw, Lis Ellis, \nKate Svoboda, Adam Thomas, Elaine Herlihy, \nYung Ngo, Alfred Nader and Sarah Webb for their \nextraordinary leadership during the toughest \nof times. \nWe finished the year with good engagement, \nrecord in some areas. Of course we also finished \nwith areas where we can do better – attrition is \nhigher than we like, there are roles where we are \nnot able to attract the talent we like, and pockets \nwhere our people tell us we can be faster, more \ncompetitive with our products, and simpler. \nOverall, a very good place to finish. \nConclusion\nOverall, in addition to a great performance, we \nare, no question, a stronger and more valuable \nCompany. Thank you to our investors, for \ninvesting in us this year, and you deserve the \nrewards that have accrued. It has been a very \nunusual year for markets, but the OFX model \nand the OFX team have operated well. Thank you \nalso to our loyal clients. We never take your \ncustom for granted.\nThank you also to our Board who have \nchallenged us, shared their experiences in \nservice of growing us sustainably, and worked \nincredibly hard, as Steve mentioned. \nFinally, a big thanks to all the dedicated OFXers \nwho make this such a great Company for all \nyour hard work, for your enthusiasm and \nfor your support for each other in building \nthis great Company. \nSkander Malcolm\nChief Executive Officer and Managing Director\n17 May 2022\nFrom the CEO \nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited  7"

The supplier mentioned that \nthey had an internal issue with their \nbank so instead of paying \nthe balance of 68,760 EUR to their \nregular account, they requested \nBruce to send the payment, which \namounted to $83,300 USD, to the \nsupplier’s sister company based \nin Turkey.\nBruce said, “I even emailed the \nsupplier back to confirm if they \nwanted to send the funds to their \nsister company and they responded \nright back: ‘Yes, please do that.

      "text": "About us\nBefore any machinery can get \nshipped out of Slovakia, Bruce \nwould normally have to complete \nthe payment on his balance. \nSo considering this new request \nfrom the supplier, he asked OFX if \nhe could make payments to Turkey. \nHe also wanted to get an expert \nopinion on the implications of \nmaking business transfers to a \nsister company. \n“This has never happened before, so \nI decided to contact Josh and just \nask him about it. I said, ‘What do you \nthink’?”\nBruce Romesburg orders machinery \nfrom his supplier, a manufacturer of \nequipment for sandwich panel \nproduction and various other \nequipment based in Slovakia.\nOFX confirmed that it was possible \nto make the payment to Turkey, \nbut his account manager \nrecommended that Bruce take \nspecific actions to verify the \nrequest. \nAt OFX the safety of customers’ \nmoney is our everyday focus, so \nOFXers are up to date with fraud \nprevention tips and the latest scam \npractices used against individuals \nand business owners. \nJosh explained that requesting \npayment from a different bank \naccount is one common tactic in \nemail fraud. He advised Bruce to call \nhis supplier from a phone number \nhe had used before to get verbal \nconfirmation about the new bank \ndetails.\nIt turned out to be a scam. Bruce \ncalled his supplier and found out \nthere was no sister company nor \nwere there any issues with their \nregular bank account. \nOFX takes scams and fraud \nseriously. It is the responsibility of \nevery OFXer to ensure that we are \ndoing the right thing by our clients \nand the community in general. OFX \naccount managers and customer \nservice teams play a vital role as \nthe first line of defense when it \ncomes to protecting clients’ money.\nJason Nader, Head of Fraud and \nIdentity Risk at OFX\n“Somehow [the fraudsters] \nwere able to capture the original \npurchase order, generate an invoice, \nchange the bank details on it and \nsend it directly to me as though it \ncame from the supplier’s regular \nemail,” Bruce said.\nOFX processes thousands of \ntransactions and uses various \ntechnology suites to take a layered \napproach to fraud prevention and \ndetection. But we don’t only rely \non technology to help protect \nOFX clients.\n“Unfortunately, scams are one of \nthe most difficult types of financial \ncrime to detect as payments \nresemble genuine payments. \nWhich is why we provide training \nto all OFXers on how to detect \npotential scams and frauds. OFX \nclients place their trust in OFX to \nensure we are protecting them. \nWe never want to let them down,” \naccording to Jason Nader, Head of \nFraud and Identity Risk at OFX. \nOFX saved me $83,000. I was ready \nto make that payment until I \nchecked with [my account manager] \nand got his suggestion. \nBruce Romesburg, Vice President \n– Product Development, SIP \nMachinery and Materials Group\nIt was a good thing that Bruce took \nhis OFXpert’s advice, because \nrecovering funds from a scam once \nthe payment has gone through is \nalmost impossible. Fraudsters tend \nto withdraw the funds as soon as \nthey hit the account.\n“The client did the right thing by \ntaking the advice of his OFXpert and \nreaching out to their supplier. Small \nbusiness owners are so busy that \nthey don’t have time to scrutinise \ninvoices in such detail and all too \noften end up making payments they \nshouldn’t when situations like this \narise,” Nader said. \nIn December 2018, Bruce switched \nto OFX for a more affordable option \nthan his bank. \nHe says he still uses his local bank \nfor other domestic business \npayments but leaves the high-value \npayments to any overseas suppliers \nwith OFX.\n“I never checked back with my \nlocal bank in four or five years. \nMaybe they’ve changed their rates \nand it’s the same price now. But the \nbottom line is I’ve always used OFX \nand I wouldn’t change for the sake \nof changing.”\nHe says it’s always been the \npersonal service that’s kept him \na happy customer, but after \nthat close call with fraudsters, \nhe appreciates the human support \neven more. \n“I’ve always booked my payments \nthrough email. I still do it through \nemail, but now I always follow up \nwith a phone call to speak to \nsomeone at OFX and to someone at \nthe supplier based on the incident \nthat happened.”\nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited  11"

This list does not \ncover every risk that may be associated with the \nGroup, and the occurrence or consequences \nof some of the risks described are partially or \ncompletely outside the control of the Group, its \nDirectors and senior management. There is also \nno guarantee or assurance that the risks will not \nchange or that other risks will not emerge. \nRegulatory compliance – The international \npayments market is highly regulated. There is \na risk that any new or changed regulations, \nfor example, banking and financial services \nlicensing regulations, could require the Group to \nincrease its spending on regulatory compliance \nand/or change its business practices, which could \nadversely affect the Group’s profitability. There is \na risk that such regulations could also make it \nuneconomical for the Group to continue to \noperate in places where it currently does business. \n•\tThere is a risk that the Group may not comply \nwith all applicable laws or have adequate \ncompliance procedures in place to manage or \nprevent breaches of applicable laws. There is \nalso a risk that the Group is required to pay \nsignificant penalties if it fails to maintain or \nfollow adequate procedures in relation to \non-boarding of clients or to detect and prevent \nmoney laundering, financing of terrorism, \nbreaches anti-bribery laws or contravenes \nsanctions, as have been imposed on other \ncompanies by governmental authorities. \nIn addition, there is a risk that evidence of \na serious failure by the Group to comply \nwith laws may cause one or more of the \ncounterparty banks, partnerships or affiliates \nto cease business with the Group. The Group \nhas a range of system and process controls in \nplace to mitigate this risk and invests significant \nresources in compliance. All employees \nundertake compulsory compliance training \non a regular basis.\n•\tInformation technology (IT) – The Group \ndepends on the performance, reliability and \navailability of its technology platform and \ncommunications systems. There is a risk that \nthese systems may be adversely affected by \nevents including damage, equipment faults, \npower failure, computer viruses, misuse by \nemployees or contractors or external malicious \ninterventions such as hacking, fire, natural \ndisasters or weather interventions. Events of \nthat nature may cause part of the Group’s \ntechnology platform, apps or websites to \nbecome unavailable. The Group’s operational \nprocesses or disaster recovery plans may not \nadequately address every potential event and \nits insurance policies may not cover loss or \ndamage that the Group suffers as a result of \na system failure. This in turn could reduce the \nGroup’s ability to generate income, impact \nclient service and confidence levels, increase \ncost burden, impact the Group’s ability to \ncompete and cause damage to the Group’s \nreputation and, potentially, have a material \n44  \nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited\nDirectors’ report"

Further, there is a risk that \npotential faults in the Group’s technology \nplatform could cause transaction errors that \ncould result in legal exposure from clients, \ndamage to the Group’s reputation or cause \na breach of certain regulatory requirements \n(including those affecting any required licence) \nand, potentially, have a material adverse \neffect on the Group’s financial position and \nperformance. The Group maintains disaster \nrecovery plans and controls to mitigate this risk.\n•\tData security and privacy – The Group’s \nbusiness relies on the effective processing \nand storage of information using its core \ntechnologies and IT systems and operations. \nIf the Group’s data security controls are \nineffective, the Group’s IT systems could be \nexposed to successful cyber-attacks which may \nresult in the unauthorised access to or loss of \ncritical or sensitive data, loss of information \nintegrity, breaches of obligations or client \nagreements and websites, system outages \nand regulatory actions. Any interruptions to \nthese operations would impact the Group’s \nability to operate and could result in business \ninterruption, the loss of customers and \nrevenue, damaged reputation and weakening \nof competitive position and could therefore \nadversely affect the Group’s operating and \nfinancial performance. The Group is subject to \nprivacy laws in Australia and other jurisdictions \nin which it conducts its business. The Group \noperations in the United Kingdom and the \nEuropean Union are required to comply with \nthe respective implementations of the UK and \nthe European Economic Area versions of the \nGeneral Data Protection Regulations. Similarly, \nthe Group operations in North America are \nsubject to relevant US and Canadian laws, \nincluding the California Consumer Privacy Act. \nIn each of the relevant jurisdictions, these laws \ngenerally regulate the collection, use and \nprocessing of personal information. Such laws \naffect the way the Group can collect, use, \nanalyse, transfer and share personal \ninformation that is central to many of the \nservices the Group provides. Any actual or \nperceived failure by the Group to comply with \nrelevant privacy laws and regulations may \nresult in the imposition of fines, investigations, \nenforceable undertakings or other penalties, \nclient losses, a reduction in existing services, \nand limitations on the development of \ntechnology and services making use of such \ndata. Any of these events could adversely \naffect the Group’s business, financial condition \nand financial performance as well as cause \nreputational damage. The Group has a range \nof system and process controls in place to \nmitigate this risk pursuant to a Board approved \nCyber Strategy. Employees undertake \ncompulsory privacy and cyber security \nawareness training.\n•\tRelationships with banking counterparties \n– The Group relies on banks to conduct its \nbusiness, particularly to provide its network \nof local and global bank accounts and act as \ncounterparties in the management of foreign \nexchange and interest rate risk. There is a risk \nthat one or more of these banks may cease to \ndeal with the Group. The loss of a significant \nbanking relationship, or the loss of a number \nof banking relationships at the same time, \nparticularly as the Group grows, could prevent \nor restrict the Group’s ability to offer foreign \nexchange and payment services in certain \njurisdictions, increase operating costs for the \nGroup, increase time taken to execute and \nsettle transactions and reduce the Group’s \nability to internally net out transactions, all \nof which could materially impact profitability. \nIn addition, there is a risk that a loss or \nreduction in the services provided by the \nGroup’s banks could restrict its ability to \nactively manage its foreign exchange and \ninterest rate risk in certain jurisdictions. \nAs a result, the Group may have to increase \nthe level of foreign exchange and interest rate \nexposure within existing operations, reduce or \nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited  45\nDirectors’ report"

The Group maintains a panel of \nbanking counterparties and actively manages \nits relationships with these counterparties.\n•\tMistaken Payment – There is a risk that, due \nto system or human errors in the processing \nof transactions, the Group may transfer an \nincorrect amount of funds or transfer funds \nto an incorrect recipient. In these instances, \nthe Group may be required to take steps to \nrecover the funds involved and, in certain \ncircumstances, be liable for amounts paid \nthat were in not in accordance with customer \ninstructions. The Group has a range of system \nand process controls in place to mitigate \nthis risk.\n•\tFraud – There is a risk that, if the Group’s \nservices are used to transfer money in \nconnection with a fraud or theft (including \nidentity theft), the Group may be required to \ntake steps to recover the funds involved and \nmay in certain circumstances be liable to \nrepay amounts that it accepted for transfer, \neven after it has made the corresponding \ninternational payment. In some cases the \nGroup’s insurance does not indemnify for this \nloss. The Group has a range of fraud prevention \ncontrols in place to mitigate this risk.\n•\tForeign exchange rate fluctuations – Changes \nin value in currencies can affect the average \ntransaction size entered into by the Group’s \nclients and, potentially, the number of \ntransactions. The Group offers services in \nover 50 currencies and movements in any \nof them may adversely impact the Group’s \nperformance. In addition, as the Group reports \nin Australian Dollars, a strengthening of the \nAustralian Dollar against other currencies will \nalso have a negative impact on the reported \nearnings of the Group that relate to its income \nearned in geographies outside Australia \n(which may increase over time, potentially \nsubstantially). Similarly, a weakening of the \nAustralian Dollar as against USD, CAD, £, NZD, \nHKD and SGD will have a negative impact on \nthe costs of the Group that relate to the costs \nincurred in geographies outside Australia. \nTo mitigate against this risk, the Group’s \ntreasury risk management process monitors \nand reports performance against defined \nlimits. Overall exposure of the Group is \nmanaged within limits set by the Board.\n•\tCredit – The Group enters into forward \nexchange contracts with some of its clients and \nits banking counterparties. There is a risk that a \nclient or counterparty fails to make payment \nupon settlement of these contracts. The Group \nmitigates against this risk by retaining the \ndiscretion to require that an advance payment \nis made; however, the Group remains exposed \nto the mark-to-market value of the \ntransactions. \n•\tCompetition – The market for the provision \nof foreign exchange and payment services \nis highly competitive. The major existing \ncompetitors of the Group include banks, money \ntransfer organisations and other specialist \nproviders. New competitors, services and \nbusiness models which compete with the Group \nare likely to arise in the future. A substantial \nincrease in competition for any of these \nreasons could result in the Group’s services \nbecoming less attractive to consumer or \nbusiness clients or partnerships, require the \nGroup to increase its marketing or capital \nexpenditure or require the Group to lower its \nspreads or alter other aspects of its business \nmodel to remain competitive, any of which \ncould materially adversely affect the Group’s \nprofitability and financial condition. A key \naspect of the Group’s business model and \ncompetitive advantage is its ability to offer \nmany clients more attractive exchange rates \nand transaction fees than they regularly receive \nfrom competitors such as many major banks. \n46  \nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited\nDirectors’ report"

Any of \nthese outcomes could materially impact the \nGroup’s income and earnings. The Group \nregularly reviews its market position and \ncompetitiveness as part of its strategic \nand business planning process.\n•\tIntellectual property risk – The Group relies \non certain intellectual property (IP) such as \ntrademarks, licences, software and proprietary \ntechnology to conduct its business. There is a \nrisk that the actions taken by the Group to \nregister and protect its IP may not be adequate, \ncomplete or enforceable, and may not prevent \nthe misappropriation of the Group’s IP and \nproprietary information. If the Group’s IP has \nbeen compromised, the Group may need to \nprotect its rights by initiating litigation such \nas infringement or administrative proceeding, \nwhich may be time consuming, unpredictable \nand costly. Any failure by the Group to protect \nits IP rights may adversely impact the Group’s \nbusiness, operations and future financial \nperformance. There is a risk that the Group \nmay infringe the IP rights of third parties. \nThird parties may enforce their IP rights and \nprevent the Group from using the IP, which may \nadversely impact the business and operations \nof the Group, and damage the reputation of the \nGroup. To mitigate against this risk the Group \nactively manages its trademarks and obtains \nlicences in respect of third party IP rights used \nby the business.\n•\tReputational damage – Maintaining the \nstrength of the Group’s reputation is important \nto retaining and increasing the client base and \npreserving healthy relationships with its \nregulators, banks, partners and other \nstakeholders, There is a risk that unforeseen \nissues or events may adversely affect the \nGroup’s reputation. This may impact on the \nfuture growth and profitability of the Group. \nThe Group actively maintains its relationships \nwith regulators, banks, partners and other \nstakeholders to mitigate against this risk.\n11. \u0007State of affairs and significant \nchanges in the state of affairs\nIn the Directors’ opinion there have been no \nsignificant changes in the state of affairs of \nthe Group during the year.

The purpose \nof this report is to outline OFX’s approach to \nremuneration for Executives and Non-Executive \nDirectors and, in particular, the links between \nOFX’s remuneration framework, business \nperformance and strategy.\nFY22 in review\nOFX has had a very strong year in which financial \nand operating targets have been either met or \nexceeded. The Global Executive Team has done \nan outstanding job adapting our strategy to \noptimise market opportunities, including \nacquisitions, and effectively managing the \ncontinuing impacts of COVID-19 on our business \noperations and our people. The benefits of \nthis have flowed to shareholders through: \na significant improvement in the share price \n(121%); strong financial returns; and a sound \nplatform for future earnings in the form of an \nindustry leading management team, a proven \nstrategy, and investments in safe, reliable and \nscalable platforms and acquisitions. Compliance, \nrisk and fraud controls have also been \nexceedingly well managed in an environment \nwhere these risks have only continued to \nincrease.\nRemuneration outcomes for FY22 reflect the \nperformance of Executives and our people to \nboth maximise business performance and grow \nthe company, accelerating our vision to be one \nof the world’s leading cross-border payment \nspecialists. A summary of FY22 remuneration \noutcomes is as follows:\n•\tShort-term incentive funding was determined \nto be 100% of target representing the \nsignificant improvement in business \nperformance and therefore an increase \nfrom the FY21 outcome of 47.8% of target;\n•\tBased on market analysis, a 3% budget as well \nas a $1.4m market adjustment pool for roles \nthat are below market has been allocated for \nsalary increases in FY23 following no pool for \nsalary adjustments in FY22; and\n•\tThere have been no increases to Non-Executive \nDirector fees.\nRemuneration changes in FY23\nConsistent with our remuneration principles, the \nBoard has:\n•\tApproved the issuance of one-off, discretionary \nawards to employees whose contribution \nmakes a material difference to the earnings \nprofile/competitive differentiation of the \nbusiness in the near to medium term. These \nawards of performance-based share rights \nrecognise the performance and/or unique \ncontribution of employees who create \nsignificant business benefits for OFX and \nincentivises them to realise those business \nbenefits over a given period.

These loans are provided for the sole purpose of Executive KMP \nacquiring shares in the Company. The amount of the loan is equal to the issue price multiplied by the \ntotal number of shares issued. The loan is ‘interest free’ in that there is no annual interest charge to \nthe participant on the loan. However, the notional value of this interest is taken into account in the \noverall structure of the program. The participant is obliged to pay a portion of the post-tax value of any \ndividends received during the loan term toward repayment of the loan amount. To access the shares, \nparticipants must repay their loan in full. Following the end of the vesting period, assuming the \nearnings ‘gateway’ is achieved, the participant can either repay the loan directly or sell some of their \nshares and apply the proceeds to repay the loan. Shares remain restricted and can only be sold for the \npurposes of repaying the loan until the loan is repaid, and it is important that the loan obligation is \nalways taken into account alongside the face value of shares under the ESP awards.\nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited  67\nRemuneration report  \nfor the financial year ended 31 March 2022"

In particular, \nwith the intent of ensuring that OFX has competitive remuneration in place for the Executive team and \nthat remuneration is aligned to market practice. The Board approved changes to Executive \nremuneration as follows:\nFY23 STI Plan metrics\nUnderlying EBT will replace Underlying EBITDA as one of two financial metrics in FY23 (Underlying NOI \nwill be retained). The decision to revert back to Underlying EBT as a financial metric for the STI Plan is \non the basis that it reflects financial performance in the context of:\n•\tIncreasing capital expenditure and as such amortisation expenses; and\n•\tThe Company taking on interest expense as a result of the Firma acquisition funding via debt.\n68  \nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited\nRemuneration report  \nfor the financial year ended 31 March 2022"

      "text": "Variable reward opportunity for Executives\nA review of market practice indicated that a 50:50 weighting of STI and LTI at target would provide a \nmore appropriate remuneration mix for Executives. As such, for direct reports of the CEO, the intent \nis to achieve a remuneration mix of 40%:30%:30% for Total Fixed Remuneration:STI:LTI from FY24 \nonwards. This will be achieved by a stepped adjustment of STI and LTI opportunity as follows:\n•\tIncreasing the STI opportunity from 60% to 65% in FY23 and to 75% in FY24; and\n•\tIncreasing the LTI opportunity from 40% to 60% in FY23 and to 75% in FY24.\nTo achieve the same 50:50 weighting between STI and LTI at target for the CEO, an increase of the LTI \ntarget from 92% to 115% was approved, resulting in a remuneration mix of 30%:35%:35% for Total Fixed \nRemuneration:STI:LTI from FY23 onwards.\nFY23 STI and FY23 LTI\nThe current range of opportunity between Target and Stretch measures in the STI and LTI plans \nis not sufficiently broad to encourage outperformance or when compared to market practice. \nThe performance measures for Stretch should be reflective of true outperformance resulting from \nexceptional discretionary effort that results in shareholder value creation. \nFrom FY23, the Stretch targets will be increased as follows, with the performance metrics being set \nat commensurate levels:\n•\tSTI Stretch target will increase from 110% to 125%; and\n•\tLTI Stretch target will increase from 110% to 150%.\nSTI deferral\nCurrently, the vesting schedule of deferred STI for Australian participants is such that 100% vests \nafter 12 months and there is a 12-month holding lock post vesting. From FY23, this will be changed \nso that 50% of the deferred STI award vests after 12 months and 50% of the deferred STI award vests \nafter 24 months. This increases the deferral period as well as ensures global consistency across all \nparticipants subject to deferral of STI. \nMinimum shareholding requirement\nWith the increase to the variable reward components as well as the STI and LTI opportunity for \nExecutives, the Board approved the introduction of a minimum shareholding requirement for \nExecutives from FY23 in order to further align the interests of the Executives with those of \nshareholders. The parameters of the requirement are that:\n•\tThe CEO must establish and maintain a level of share ownership equal to one times his annual base salary;\n•\tThe other Executives must establish and maintain a level of share ownership equal to 0.5 times their \nannual base salary; and \n•\tUntil these requirements are met, the Executive must retain 25% of any shares that vest via the LTI Plan.\nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited  69\nRemuneration report  \nfor the financial year ended 31 March 2022"

The People, Culture and \nRemuneration Committee follows protocols around the engagement and use of external remuneration \nconsultants to ensure compliance with relevant legislation as it relates to Executive remuneration.\nDuring the 2022 financial year, Godfrey Remuneration Group was engaged to provide advice on \nExecutive remuneration relating to STI and LTI and to recommend any changes to the framework \nthat would be valued by Executives and supported by shareholders.\nThe Board is satisfied that the recommendations received from the remuneration consultants were \nfree from undue influence from the KMP to whom the recommendations relate and in accordance \nwith section 9B of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\nFurther, the following arrangements were made to meet this requirement:\n•\tThe remuneration consultants were engaged by and reported to the Chair of the People, Culture and \nRemuneration Committee on behalf of the Board;\n•\tThe advice containing the remuneration recommendations was provided by the remuneration \nconsultants directly to the Chair of the People, Culture and Remuneration Committee; and\n•\tThe remuneration recommendations made by external advisors to the People, Culture and \nRemuneration Committee and the Board were used as an input to decision making only.\nThe total fees paid to external advisors for remuneration recommendations included $16,500 \n(including GST) paid to Godfrey Remuneration Group. \n9.2 Board discretion\nThe Company has a structured and objective approach to remuneration.

In certain \nappropriate circumstances, allowed for under Executive Service Agreements, the Board may deem \nan Executive KMP to be a ‘good leaver’ and exercise discretion to allow eligibility for a pro-rata cash \npayment in respect of the current performance year and may determine that deferred STI previously \nawarded is retained.\nIn general, all ESP shares are forfeited and surrendered in full settlement of the loan if a participant \nceases employment prior to the end of the performance period. All unvested performance rights are \nnot forfeited if a participant ceases employment prior to vesting date; however, the Board has absolute \ndiscretion in appropriate circumstances to deem whether some or all of an Executive KMP’s \nperformance rights are retained.\nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited  71\nRemuneration report  \nfor the financial year ended 31 March 2022"

Each Non-Executive Director \nmust establish and maintain a level of share ownership equal to one times’ the Non-Executive \nDirector’s annual base fee.

Its shares are publicly \ntraded on the Australian Securities Exchange. \nThis financial report presents the consolidated \nperformance, position and cash flows of the \nGroup for the year ended 31 March 2022 and was \napproved and authorised for issue by the Board \nof Directors on 17 May 2022. The Group is for-\nprofit for the purpose of preparing the financial \nstatements. The accounting policies explained \nin this report are consistent for all the periods \npresented unless otherwise stated. The Directors \nhave the power to amend and reissue the \nfinancial report.\nThe financial report is a general-purpose financial \nreport which:\n•\tIs prepared in accordance with Australian \nAccounting Standards and Interpretations \nissued by the Australian Accounting Standards \nBoard and the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). \nConsequently, this financial report has also \nbeen prepared in accordance with and \ncomplies with IFRS as issued by the IASB;\n•\tHas been prepared under the historical cost \nconvention except for derivatives and share-\nbased payments which are measured at fair \nvalue; and\n•\tIs presented in Australian dollars with all \nvalues rounded to the nearest thousand dollars \nin accordance with ASIC Legislative Instrument \n2016/191 unless otherwise indicated.\nCritical estimates and judgements\nPreparing the financial report requires judgement \nin applying the accounting policies and calculating \ncertain critical accounting estimates. The Group’s \ncritical accounting estimates and significant \njudgements are:\n•\tFair value of certain financial instruments \n(Note 10 and Note 11)\n•\tEstimated credit losses on receivables \n(Note 12(c))\n•\tShare-based payments (Note 23)\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created economic \nuncertainty resulting in changes to cross-border \npayment flow activity, impacting all regions. \nFollowing the global outbreak of COVID-19, the \nGroup enacted its Business Continuity plans and \ntransitioned almost all of its global workforce \nto work from home arrangements. Many of the \nGroup’s key suppliers, including its major banking \ncounterparties, enacted similar arrangements. \nAs a result, no major disruption to the Group’s \nservices have occurred to date. The Group has \nclosely monitored, and will continue to closely \nmonitor the situation. There has been no \nsignificant impact on estimates and key \njudgements as a result. \nb) Basis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial report comprises \nthe assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of the \nGroup as at 31 March 2022 and the results of \nall subsidiaries for the year then ended. A list \nof controlled entities at year end is contained \nin Note 22.\nSubsidiaries are all those entities over which \nthe Group has the power to direct the relevant \nactivities, exposure to significant variable \nreturns and the ability to utilise power to affect \nthe Group’s own returns. The determination \nof control is based on current facts and \ncircumstances and is continuously assessed.\n82  \nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited"

Unrealised losses are \nalso eliminated unless the transaction provides \nevidence of the impairment of the asset \ntransferred.\nAccounting policies of subsidiaries have been \nchanged where necessary to ensure consistency \nwith the policies adopted by the Group.\nInvestments in subsidiaries are accounted for \nat cost in the separate financial statements of \nOzForex Limited (the intermediate holding \ncompany) in accordance with AASB 127 Separate \nFinancial Statements.\nFunctional and presentation currency \nForeign operations are measured in the Group’s \nfinancial statements using the currency of the \nprimary economic environment in which the \nforeign operation operates (the functional \ncurrency). The functional currencies of overseas \nsubsidiaries are listed in Note 22.\nThe Group’s financial statements are presented \nin Australian dollars, which is the Group’s \npresentation currency.\nGST\nRevenues, expenses and fixed assets are \nrecognised net of the associated GST, unless the \nGST is not recoverable from the relevant taxation \nauthority. Receivables and creditors are \npresented including the GST. The net GST \nrecoverable from, or payable to, each taxation \nauthority is presented in other receivables or \nother payables.\nCash flows are presented including GST. \nThe GST components of the cash flows arising \nfrom investing or financing activities which are \nrecoverable from, or payable to, the taxation \nauthority, are presented as operating cash flow.\nc) \u0007New and Amended Accounting \nStandards Adopted by the Group\nIFRIC Agenda Decision – Configuration of \ncustomisation costs in a cloud computing \narrangement (April 2021)\nThe International Financial Reporting Standards \nInterpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued its \nagenda decision titled Configuration or \ncustomisation costs in a cloud computing \narrangement in April 2021. This decision \ndiscusses whether configuration or \ncustomisation expenditure relating to Software-\nas-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements can be \nrecognised as an intangible asset and if not, over \nwhat time period the expenditure is expensed. \nThe Group’s accounting policy has historically \nbeen to capitalise all costs associated with \nSaaS arrangements as intangible assets in the \nConsolidated Statement of Financial Position. \nThe adoption of the above agenda decision has \nresulted in a reclassification of these intangible \nassets to either a prepaid asset in the \nConsolidated Statement of Financial Position \nand/or recognition as an expense in the \nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive \nIncome, impacting both the current period and \nprior periods presented.\nSoftware-as-a-Service (SaaS) Arrangements\nSaaS arrangements are service contracts \nproviding the Group with the right to access the \ncloud provider’s application software over a \ncontract period. As such, IFRIC has concluded \nthat SaaS arrangements do not provide an entity \nwith an intangible asset at the commencement \nof a contract. As a result of the IFRIC decision, \ncosts previously capitalised as an intangible \nasset are now expensed in the period in which \nthe costs are incurred. Costs incurred for the \ndevelopment of software code that enhances \nor modifies or creates additional capability to \nexisting systems and meets the definition of and \nrecognition criteria for an intangible asset are \nrecognised as intangible assets, as set out in \nNote 14. Historical financial information has \nbeen restated to account for the impact of the \nchange in accounting policy in relation to SaaS \narrangements.\nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited  83"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements\nfor the year ended 31 March 2022\nNote 5. Income Taxes1 \nIncome tax expense is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income adjusted for changes in \ndeferred income tax. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are due to temporary timing \ndifferences and unused tax losses.\nCurrent income tax is based on tax laws enacted or substantively enacted in each jurisdiction of the \nGroup’s operations at the end of the reporting period. If required, provisions are established for the \namounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\nDeferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method at the tax rates expected to apply \nwhen the assets are recovered or the liabilities are settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise on \ntemporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. In \naddition, deferred tax assets may be recognised due to unused tax losses. Amounts are only \nrecognised to the extent it is probable future taxable amounts will be available to use those temporary \ndifferences or tax losses.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when: \n•\tThere is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities; and \n•\tThe deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset when: \n•\tThere is a legally enforceable right to offset; and\n•\tThere is an intention to settle on a net basis.\nCurrent and deferred taxes attributable to amounts recognised directly in equity are also recognised \ndirectly in equity.\nWhere there is uncertainty over income tax treatments the recognition and measurement of current or \ndeferred tax assets or liabilities is determined applying Interpretation 23 – Uncertainty Over Income Tax \nTreatments. The Group believes its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based \non its assessment, including interpretations of income tax treatments and prior experience.\nTax Consolidation\nThe tax consolidation legislation was adopted by the Group as of 15 October 2013. As a consequence, \nOzForex Limited and its wholly owned Australian controlled entities are taxed as a single entity. \nThe Group’s tax year end has been aligned to financial year end as of 31 March 2021, changed from \n30 September.\n1\t Comparative information has been restated to reflect the change in accounting policy and the prior period restatements detailed in Note 1(c).\n90  \nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited"

Settlement typically \noccurs between 12 to 24 hours after the deal \nis entered into or up to 24 months later for \nforward contracts with clients.\nThe Group is also exposed to the interest rate \nrisk embedded in forward contracts offered \nto its clients to lock in exchange rates up to \n24 months in advance.\nTo manage the movement in foreign exchange rates, \nthe Group aggregates transactions and nets out buy \ntransactions against sell transactions.\nThe Group then enters into forward foreign \nexchange hedging contracts with counterparty \nbanks once exposure to a single currency reaches \nor exceeds a defined threshold. \nInterest rate risk – Exposure to non-traded \ninterest rate risk results from cash and term \ndeposits held in different currencies.\nSettlement of client liabilities between 12 and \n24 hours of receipt of client cash results in low \nexposure to non-traded interest rate risk.\nCredit risk – The risk that creditors (clients \nand financial institutions) will not make \npayments on their receivables and derivatives \nrespectively, when they fall due.\nThe Group typically does not pay out client deals \nuntil associated funds have been received.\nIn exceptional circumstances, senior management \nhave the discretion to authorise same-day \npayments, which can result in funds being paid prior \nto clearance of customer funds. These transactions \nwould only be approved for clients with a low risk of \ndefault and are pro-actively monitored to ensure \ntimely settlement.\nFor forward deals part payments are required to be \nmade by clients. Active monitoring of client balances \nensures that adequate collateral is held.\nThe Group sets credit limits and obtains collateral \nwith well-rated banking counterparties as security \n(where appropriate).\nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited  97"

The Group is primarily focused on fair value information to assess the assets’ \nperformance and make decisions, resulting in derivative financial instruments being measured at fair \nvalue through profit or loss unless designated in hedging relationships.\n(iii) Hedging activity\nFinancial instruments designated by the Group for the purpose of hedging the variability in cash flows \nassociated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in exchange rates, and for \nthe management of foreign currency risk associated with its net investment in foreign operations \nqualify for hedge accounting. Instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative \ncontract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each \nreporting period. The full fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as an asset or liability.\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between \nhedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging \ninstruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents \nits risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions. \nHedges of net investments in foreign operations and cash flow hedges are accounted for by \nrecognising any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge \nin other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in equity. The gain or loss relating to \nthe ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss within unrealised gains/(losses).\nThe Group designates only the change in fair value of the spot element of forward exchange contracts \nas the hedging instrument in cash flow hedging relationships. The change in fair value of the forward \nelement of forward exchange contracts (forward points) is separately accounted for as a cost of \nhedging and recognised in a costs of hedging reserve within equity. \nWhen the hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, \nthe amount accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of hedging reserve is included directly in \nthe initial cost of the non-financial item when it is recognised. \nGains and losses accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss when the foreign operation is \npartially disposed of or sold.\nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited  103"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements\nfor the year ended 31 March 2022\nNote 17. Leases \nUnder AASB 16, leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date \nat which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between \nthe liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as \nto produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. \nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on \na straight-line basis.\nThe Group leases various offices. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of three to 10 \nyears but may have extension options. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain \na wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, \nbut leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease \nliabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n•\tFixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable and\n•\tVariable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate.\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot \nbe determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would \nhave to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic \nenvironment with similar terms and conditions. To determine the incremental borrowing rate and in \nthe absence of third-party borrowings, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free \ninterest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by the Group, and makes adjustments specific to \nthe lease, e.g. term, country, currency and security. \nExtension options are included in a number of the Group’s property leases. The extensions are \nexercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor. In determining the lease term, \nwhich forms part of the initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability, management \nconsiders all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option. \nExtension options are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: \n•\tThe amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n•\tAny lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n•\tAny initial direct costs; and\n•\tRestoration costs. \nSubsequent to initial measurement, the lease liability is reduced for payments made and increased for \ninterest incurred. The liability is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification, or if there \nare changes to in-substance fixed payments. When the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding \nadjustment is made to the value of the right-of-use asset. Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated \nover the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a \nstraight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term \nof 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.\n108  \nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited"

TreasurUp is a treasury management software company, \nwhose principal place of business is The Netherlands, which will allow the Group to provide automated \nhedging and risk management solutions for small and medium size corporates to manage their foreign \nexchange risk. TreasurUp is not publicly listed. TreasurUp is structured as a separate vehicle and the \nGroup has a residual interest in the net assets of TreasurUp. Accordingly, the Group has classified its \ninterest in TreasurUp as a joint venture.\nIn accordance with the agreement under which the Group’s investment in TreasurUp was established, \nThe Group provided a loan to the Company in an amount of €750,000, with an annual interest rate of \n8%.

A joint venture is an \narrangement in which the Group has joint control over the key financial and operating policies and \nhas rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for \nits liabilities. Interests in the joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. \nUnder the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, which includes transaction \ncosts. The investment is subsequently adjusted to recognise the Group’s share of the joint venture’s \nprofit or loss and other comprehensive income until the date on which joint control ceases. \nThe Group’s share of the joint venture’s profit or loss and other comprehensive income is included \nin the Group’s profit and loss. \nUnrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investments are eliminated against \nthe investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investment. Unrealised losses are eliminated \nin the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\nAt each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that an investment \nin joint venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, an impairment loss, measured by comparing \nthe recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying value, is recognised in the profit or loss. \nNo impairment expense has been recognised in this regard in the current period.\n112  \nAnnual Report 2022  |  OFX Group Limited"

The expense \nrecognised is reduced to take account of the expense attributable to participating employees who do \nnot remain in the employment of the Group throughout the vesting period.\nShares issued under the LTI – ESP are accounted for as Options and as such the amounts receivable \nfrom employees in relation to these loans are not recognised in the financial statements. Settlement \nof share loans upon vesting is recognised as contributed equity.\nThe LTI – Performance Rights, the LTI – ESP options and LTI GEP Options are measured at fair value at \nthe date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair values include assumptions in the \nfollowing areas: risk free rate, volatility, estimated service periods and expected achievement of \nhurdles. The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative \nof exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical \nvolatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily reflect the actual outcome.\nLong-Term Incentives (LTI) \nExecutive Share Plan (ESP) and Options\nThe ESP was established to incentivise Executives to deliver on the business strategy and contribute to \nsustainable long-term returns. Detailed remuneration disclosures are provided in the Remuneration \nReport section of the Directors’ Report.\nUnder the ESP, eligible Executives are provided with an interest free, non-recourse loan from the \nGroup for the sole purpose of acquiring shares in the Company. Executives may not deal with the \nshares while the loan remains outstanding and any dividends paid on the shares are applied (on an \nafter-tax basis) towards repaying the loan. Executives are entitled to exercise the voting rights attached \nto the shares from the date of allocation.
