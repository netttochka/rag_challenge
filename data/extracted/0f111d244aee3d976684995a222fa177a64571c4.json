      "text": "PART I\nItem 1. Business.\nOverview\nWe are the market leader in delivering next generation positioning, navigation and timing (“PNT”) solutions that overcome the limitations of existing\nspace-based global positioning system (“GPS”). The impact of GPS on the U.S. economy is approaching $1 trillion annually, according to a NextNav\nextrapolation of our data from a National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) sponsored study conducted by RTI International (“RTI”), and the\nEuropean Commission has estimated a similar impact on the economy of the European Union in its 2018 budget process. Based on the increasing reliance on\nPNT across many facets of the global economy, the world increasingly requires more accurate and resilient PNT capabilities. PNT resiliency has recently\nemerged as a priority of the U.S. Federal Government, including as a key cyber security vulnerability.  Higher performance will continue to expand the reach\nand value of PNT solutions, while resilience is essential to protect the vast economic activity that is reliant on GPS. We are targeting a global addressable\nmarket that is greater than $100 billion.\nWe currently deliver differentiated PNT solutions through our network-based Pinnacle and TerraPoiNT solutions. Our Pinnacle system provides “floor-\nlevel” altitude service to any device with a barometric pressure sensor, including most off-the-shelf Android and iOS smartphones. This service enables full 3D\nlocation at national scale for the first time. Public safety, autonomous vehicles, electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (“eVTOLs”), unmanned aerial\nvehicles (“UAVs”), and the app economy all require precise 3D location solutions. Paramedics need to know which apartment a 911 call originated from, ride\nhailing and delivery apps need to know precisely where a customer is standing and game developers need precise 3D location data to deliver next generation\naugmented reality experiences.\nIn early 2021, we launched the first element of our next generation GPS service through initial commercial launch of our nationwide Pinnacle network\nthat was deployed in partnership with AT&T Services, Inc. (“AT&T”). The Pinnacle network provides “floor-level” altitude data to over 90% of commercial\nstructures over three stories in the U.S. Pinnacle is being utilized by FirstNet® for public safety. We are currently providing service to Verizon\nCommunications, Inc. (\"Verizon\") as a customer for enhanced 911 (“E911”) services, using our Pinnacle 911 solution.  Pinnacle has also been adopted by a\ngrowing number of public safety apps, commercial apps and app development platforms, including Unity Engine, CRG, GeoComm, Rapid Deploy, Central\nSquare, NGA 911, Qualcomm, and the Unreal Engine. We believe that ramp up of customers using our existing Pinnacle network will support revenue growth\nover the coming year.\nOur TerraPoiNT system is a terrestrial-based, encrypted network designed to overcome the limitations inherent in the space-based nature of GPS.  GPS is\na faint, unencrypted signal, which is often unavailable indoors, distorted in urban areas and vulnerable to both jamming and spoofing. TerraPoiNT overcomes\nthese limitations through a network of specialized wide area location transmitters that broadcast an encrypted PNT signal on our licensed 900 MHz LMS\nspectrum with a signal that is 100,000 times stronger than GPS. Unlike GPS, the TerraPoiNT signal can be reliably received indoors and in urban areas and is\ndifficult to jam or spoof. Further, the TerraPoiNT signal embeds Pinnacle information to provide a full 3D solution. In addition, TerraPoiNT provides\nredundancy for GPS by offering positioning, navigation and NIST-traceable timing services independently. We believe that this backup capability is essential\ndue to the economy’s reliance on GPS for location and precision timing. GPS redundancy is increasingly a U.S. national security priority, and is rising in\npriority in the European Union, non-EU countries in Eastern Europe and in other parts of the world due to both the demonstrated vulnerability and lack of local\ncontrol of space-based signals and systems, highlighted by recent events in the Ukraine. Critical infrastructure, including communications networks and power\ngrids, require a reliable GPS signal for accurate timing. A failure of GPS could be catastrophic, and there is no comprehensive, terrestrial backup that is widely\ndeployed today. TerraPoiNT received the highest scores in testing by the U.S. Department of Transportation reported in 2021 regarding potential PNT backup\nsolutions, in each category tested, and was the only solution evaluated capable of providing the full set of services provided by GPS.\nAs of March 2023, TerraPoiNT is deployed and available, with metro-wide service in the San Francisco Bay Area and select services available in 85 total\nmarkets nationally. It is also in use by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”) at its Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA for drone\noperations research and at its Ames facility in Mountain View, CA, leveraging our deployed network in the Bay Area.\n1"

      "text": "On October 31, 2022, we acquired Nestwave, SAS, a French société par actions simplifiée (“Nestwave”), a privately held global leader in low-power\ngeolocation. Based in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, Nestwave provides advanced geolocation solutions to Internet of Things (“IoT”) modem and digital signal\nprocessor vendors and end IoT users. We believe that the combination of our technology with Nestwave’s LTE/5G capabilities will allow us to intelligently\ncombine signals from existing terrestrial LTE/5G networks with our own highly synchronized TerraPoiNT system to deliver resilient 3D PNT capabilities with\nexpanded geographic scale at significantly lower deployment costs than a standalone TerraPoiNT system.  We also expect the integration of the Nestwave\ntechnology to significantly improve the spectral efficiency of our transmissions and may allow downlink data capacity similar to other LTE/5G systems\noperating over similar spectrum bandwidth.  Nestwave is adopting NextNav’s name and has been substantially integrated into existing TerraPoiNT engineering\nand technology efforts.\nWe acquired Nestwave for an enterprise value of $18.0 million and gross consideration value of $19.3 million, consisting of $4.3 million in cash and\n$15.0 million in our common stock. The transaction resulted in the issuance of 4.0 million shares of our common stock upon close, and up to 1.1 million shares\nof common stock upon exercise of certain Nestwave employee options. All such shares are subject to a lock-up expiring on the first anniversary of transaction\nclose.\nSince the inception of NextNav, LLC in 2007, we have secured valuable Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) licenses for a contiguous 8 MHz\nband of 900 MHz LMS spectrum covering approximately 93% of the U.S. population, been granted more than 150 patents related to our systems and services,\nand standardized our TerraPoiNT technology in 3GPP, the global telecommunications standards-setting body.\nWe believe our unique approach to PNT, relying on terrestrial infrastructure deployed at existing wireless tower or antenna locations, provides an\nunrivaled quality-of-service and would be difficult to replicate.\nOur Strategy\nDomestically, we operate primarily as a facilities-based service provider. Our target customers include businesses, including applications developers, and\nadjacent businesses selling PNT products and systems to end users, and Federal, state and local governmental entities. We deploy sensor and broadcast network\ncapabilities, and licenses access to our customers for the data generated by our networks. Internationally, we provide equipment, software and services to our\ncustomers to enable them to partner in the operation of our systems in their home markets. The key elements of our strategy include:\n●\nEstablish TerraPoiNT as the leader in resilient PNT. We anticipate that the expanded availability of our TerraPoiNT system will provide enhanced value\nto existing customers and open new verticals. We have entered into agreements related to the commercialization of TerraPoiNT in the burgeoning urban\nair mobility space, and are working with the U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Congress to assess\nthe suitability of TerraPoiNT as a national backup capability to GPS. Redundancy to space-based PNT systems is rising in priority in the European\nUnion, non-EU countries in Eastern Europe and in other parts of the world due to both the demonstrated vulnerability and lack of local control of space-\nbased signals and systems, highlighted by recent events in the Ukraine. We also anticipate enterprise, IOT and critical infrastructure customers for\nTerraPoiNT, especially those that require either timing or dynamic navigation capabilities, or reliable urban and indoor reception of its signal. This\nincludes industries such as transportation and telecommunications, which rely on position, navigation and timing to provide service and sectors such as\nthe electrical grid which require timing — nearly every segment of the U.S. economy, most of which rely on GPS or GPS-derived services in one form\nor another.\n●\nOptimize the Full Value of our Spectrum, including maximizing Spectral Efficiency and Throughput of Our Spectrum.We anticipate adopting 4G LTE\nand 5G technologies as a core element of our TerraPoiNT PNT offering, including through the integration of technologies acquired from Nestwave.  We\nbelieve that this will improve the data carrying capacity of our spectrum without impacting our core PNT services, which will allow us to expand our\nservice offering and the potential uses for our spectrum. \n2"

      "text": "●\nExpand our Global Reach. In pursuit of our vision for our services to form the standard for global PNT, we have commenced distribution of our\nservices outside of the United States. We are focused on working with partners that can bring local scale as well as access to local authorities\nresponsible for spectrum allocation and national critical infrastructure. Our joint venture in Japan, MetCom, backed by Sony and Kyocera, is\nemblematic of this approach. MetCom has access to significant local facilities to host our Pinnacle and TerraPoiNT infrastructure and has secured initial\naccess to the required spectrum resources from the Japanese government for TerraPoiNT operations. Pinnacle was launched in November 2022 in Japan\nand we anticipate expanded geographic coverage in 2023. Following the launch of service in Japan, and our successful operations in the U.S., we\nanticipate interest from other international markets in the future.\n●\nEnsure 3D Location is Market Standard. Our PNT services offer improved accuracy, resiliency and service availability compared to GPS-based\nservices. We have developed our services to be easily integrated into applications, and sold to end users either as part of a standalone application or for\nintermediate services used as part of a system or application (e.g., software development kits (“SDK”) based products for mass-market apps or the\nNASA drone system used as part of their aircraft systems). Our pricing plans are designed to encourage usage and adoption, and are tailored to the use\ncase and business operations of our customers. Given the increasing importance of geolocation services to society and economy, we believe that our\nofferings should become the new standard in geolocation.\n●\nEnable a Suite of Complementary Products. As the first to market with a scalable 3D location service, we provide or partner with companies to deliver\nproducts and services that are adjacent to our basic location service. Our first product supporting 3D location is our altimeter software bundled with our\nSDK that enables a quick reference to a user’s relative height. We anticipate building additional tools and capabilities to improve access and usability to\napplication developers to both accelerate adoption and the use of full 3D location.\n●\nEnhance Adoption, Distribution and Scale with Strategic Partners. We launched our services after securing our strategic agreement with AT&T to\ndeploy the Pinnacle altitude network and to begin offering services to public safety customers. This relationship provided us with a platform to offer a\nnationwide service capability and to deliver a crucial situational awareness capability to public safety customers as part of AT&T’s FirstNet®\noperations. Our public safety presence is supported by our own marketing, awareness built through AT&T’s marketing campaigns and its presence on\nthe FirstNet® API Catalog.\n●\nExpand the use of our service for E911 in the U.S. In October 2021, we entered into an agreement with Qualcomm to make our Pinnacle software and\nservices available with the Qualcomm Location Suite, which will make it easier for device vendors to integrate vertical location capabilities into\nexisting carrier E911 infrastructure. We are currently providing service to Verizon as a customer for E911 services, using our Pinnacle 911 solution for\nits customers, and the first device (in partnership with Sonim Technologies Inc.) leveraging this technology became available in December 2022. We\nbelieve that our service may be attractive to other wireless carriers based on our high performance, system availability and FCC requirements for\nwireless carriers to provide accurate vertical location to first responders during E911 calls.\n3"

      "text": "Industry Background\nPNT services are used in nearly every facet of our economy. Cellular and electrical distribution systems depend on GPS-based timing, the mobile app\neconomy relies on location to create innovative services and to drive data and advertising revenue, and public safety and E911 saves lives every day with the\nuse of location services. \nGPS has powered the global economy for nearly 40 years. Without high-precision timing from GPS, cellular systems would quickly fail and the\ndistribution of electricity would be impacted, while GPS-based location powers everything from aviation and wireless 911 location to the mobile app economy.\nBased on research performed for NIST by RTI in 2019, for example, GPS alone is calculated to have provided nearly $1.4 trillion to the U.S. economy between\n1984 and 2017, with nearly a quarter of that value, exceeding $300 billion, delivered in the last year of their analysis. Applying the average 2015-2017 growth\nrate from the NIST RTI analysis implies that the 2021 domestic value provided by GPS was approximately $700 billion and the 2023 value is expected to be\napproximately $1.1 trillion. This is consistent with analysis performed by the European Commission, which estimated the contribution of global navigation\nsatellite services (“GNSS”) in the European Union was approximately EUR 1.2 trillion in 2018. \nGPS and GNSS services have inherent limitations due to their faint signal and the geometry of the orbital satellites especially near the Earth’s surface.\nThis results in poor performance, especially in urban environments, indoors, and other locations where precise altitude determination is essential. The\nincreasing demand for location services has resulted in the development of a number of supplements and alternatives to traditional GPS.\nNextNav Market Opportunity\nWe believe that the market opportunity for our services is significant, with a total addressable market of over $50 billion in the United States and over\n$100 billion globally. Nearly every segment of the global economy relies on geolocation or high-precision timing, directly or indirectly, and in general those\nservices are either: (a) expensive; (b) of limited performance; or (c) are derived only from GPS or global navigation satellite system (“GNSS”), and suffer from\nthe limitations and vulnerabilities of those services.\nWe have divided the broad application of our services into five major verticals:\n1)\nmission critical public safety and E911;\n2)\nmass market, mobile apps, and data analytics;\n3)\neVTOLs, UAVs and autonomous vehicles;\n4)\nIOT critical infrastructure and resilient PNT; and\n5)\nglobal expansion.\nMission Critical Public Safety and E911\nOur solutions provide valuable services in the public safety market. Our Pinnacle service is currently being used by first responders enabling them to\nmore accurately locate a user with our 3D location services. The launch of our service for E911 callers with Verizon provides more accurate information to first\nresponders about callers’ locations during a wireless 911 call. When TerraPoiNT becomes broadly available, it is expected to provide significant additional\nvalue to first responders.\nBased on information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the National Fire Protection Agency, we believe there are approximately 10 million primary\nfirst responders, extended primary first responders and non-military federal employees addressable by FirstNet®. We believe that these potential customers\nrepresent a total addressable market of approximately $1.2 billion.\nAccording to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), E911, which is a FCC required service provided by telecommunications carriers to\ntheir subscribers, is dialed approximately 240 million times each year as citizens seek to summon aid for emergencies, including medical emergencies, fires and\nother incidents. Because FCC rules require E911 services to convey the caller’s telephone number and detailed location information to emergency responders,\ngeolocation is an essential element of emergency response. Currently wireless customers pay through their wireless carrier approximately $0.70 per month,\ndepending on the jurisdiction in which they reside, into state and local E911 pools. A vast majority of those fees collected are directed towards E911 call center\nequipment. Based on a state-by-state review of E911 and other regulatory fees collected by wireless carriers we estimate a total addressable market for E911\nlocation services in the United States of approximately $2.3 billion.\nThe FCC’s rules require wireless carriers to provide altitude information along with horizontal location information with E911 calls in urban markets,\nwith this requirement expanding to a nationwide basis in 2025. We have the opportunity to sell our services to wireless carriers to satisfy their regulatory\nobligations, improve the safety of their customers, and offer certain related services to Public Safety Answering Points to enhance the usability of E911 location\nservices directly and in partnership with other service providers.\nMass Market, Mobile Apps, and Data Analytics\nThe mobile app economy relies on the availability of location data for direct services to consumers, emerging augmented reality applications and for\nadvertising, marketing and analytics-driven monetization. Mobile advertising in the United States alone is projected by eMarketer to reach nearly $257 billion\nby 2026, from approximately $170 billion in 2022, and according to customer discussions approximately 40% of ad inventory is location-enabled.\n4"

      "text": "Mobile Ad Spending\nSource: eMarketer, “Mobile Ad Spending, US 2022-2026,” October 2022\nBeyond mobile advertising, mobile applications use location services to enable a wide range of capabilities. According to Google, one-third, or\napproximately 1 million out of 3 million, apps on the Google Play Store use location. In 2019, nearly $1 billion was spent in app stores on approximately\n10,000 applications hosting at least one direct location services software development kit (“SDK”) (e.g., a mapping SDK and SDKs to enhance user experiences\nin venues), a small subset of the total apps using location, according to Apptopia data.\nMobile gaming also increasingly relies on location. One example is Niantic’s Pokemon Go™, the location-based game that captured national attention in\n2016 and continues to be the leading mobile game by revenue. Pokemon Go™ generated over $3 billion in revenue between 2016 and 2019 according to\nSensorTower research. According to Statista research, this augmented reality trend is expected to accelerate, from approximately 10% of mobile gaming\nrevenue in 2020 to 75% in 2025, or approximately $7.5 billion in annual spend on augmented reality titles.\nAggregated data gathered from mass-market applications is also utilized for analytics, including foot-traffic and related analysis. Based on customer\ninteractions and internal analysis, we believe that the total addressable market value of location-enabled analytics data and reports exceeds $6 billion.\nFinally, mCommerce in the U.S. is expected to reach nearly $700 billion in 2025 according to eMarketer, growing at a compound annual growth rate\n(“CAGR”) of approximately 16% and is expected to result in significant online-to-offline and related opportunities.\nCollectively, we believe that the total addressable market for the mass-market segment in the United States is approximately $24 billion, and is\ncharacterized by multiple high-growth sectors.\neVTOLs, UAVs and Autonomous Vehicles\neVTOLs, UAVs and autonomous vehicles require reliable, accurate location data for navigation and timing services for control system synchronization.\nBased on discussions with potential customers, including leading urban air mobility (“UAM”) providers, we believe that our Pinnacle service will provide\na superior altitude or pressure reference both to airframe, autopilot and autonomous systems providers, and to air traffic control and air data providers. We\nbelieve that, when deployed broadly, our TerraPoiNT service will provide a resilient, supplementary signal for urban navigation, landing and takeoff. We\nanticipate selling our services through a mix of per vehicle, monthly recurring and per-usage access fees.\n5"

With this volume, which requires approximately 80,000 eVTOLs to be in operation, We believe that the value of enhanced\nnavigation and air traffic control could result in an addressable market of nearly $4 billion per year.\nFor autonomous vehicles, sensor-based approaches that do not incorporate reliable, independent location references are challenged in poor weather,\nambiguous conditions, and GPS is vulnerable especially in urban environments.\nWe have estimated the total addressable market in the United States for autonomous vehicle systems to be over $6 billion by 2030, based on research\npublished by the Gartner Group and McKinsey, with over 5 million fully autonomous vehicles on the road. We believe that each of these vehicles is a potential\nuser of our services.\nEnterprise, IOT and Critical Infrastructure\nEnterprise and IOT services enable connectivity and coordination within a business or governmental agency. These systems enable intelligent machines,\ndevices and fixed or mobile assets to communicate information from the machine, device, or fixed or mobile asset to and from back-office information systems\nof businesses and government agencies, as applicable, that track, monitor, control and communicate with them. Location and timing services are a critical\nelement of these systems, and apply to a wide range of use cases including asset tracking, inventory management, patient monitoring in healthcare, people and\npet tracking, smart grid applications, smart parking applications, and health and well-being-oriented wearables, among others.\nAccording to ABI Research’s “IOT Market Tracker,” as of the first quarter of 2018 there are expected to be nearly 1.3 billion connected devices in this\nsector by 2024, resulting in over $10 billion in service value in the United States – excluding equipment and data connectivity, and other enterprise and IOT\napplications. The number of devices in these areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 70% between 2020 and 2026, while addressable service revenue is\nexpected to grow at a CAGR of 53% over the same period.\nWe also believe that there is a significant market for our services on a private network basis, at ex-urban college campuses and industrial facilities. We\nbelieve the total addressable market in enterprise and IOT in the United States is over $10 billion per year and growing rapidly.\nGPS plays an outsized role in the U.S. economy and our critical infrastructure, including communications networks and power grids, require a reliable\nGPS signal for accurate timing. Given its importance, the U.S. Federal Government is actively exploring backup solutions to ensure that interruptions to GPS\nservice do not impair the operation of critical infrastructure across various sectors identified by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as well as other\ncritical consumer sectors.\nIn a recent report published by the U.S. Department of Transportation, we offered the highest performance among technologies tested for “alternate PNT.”\nWe are actively marketing our TerraPoiNT service to the U.S. Federal Government and other firms as a solution to ensure continuity of service across various\nindustries including power generation and transmission, telecommunications, and aviation amongst others.\nGlobal Expansion\nWe have initiated marketing of our Pinnacle and TerraPoiNT services to potential partners and customers in Canada, East Asia, Europe and the Middle\nEast, with a focus on countries with a high reliance on GPS and location services across highly urbanized populations. We are seeing a similar emphasis\nglobally on PNT services in: (i) mission critical public safety and E911; (ii) mass market, mobile apps, and data analytics; (iii) autonomous vehicles, eVTOLs\nand UAVs; and (iv) enterprise, IOT and critical infrastructure.\nOur services have been piloted in multiple countries already, and in Japan, our joint venture partner MetCom has begun the process of securing a license\nto operate on the spectrum required for a TerraPoiNT system. We have commenced a pilot program for Pinnacle through our MetCom joint venture as well, and\nanticipate moving forward with a deployment of Pinnacle services in Japan. MetCom’s access to facilities through its primary backers, Sony and Kyocera,\ncreate a strong opportunity for a nationwide deployment in Japan.\nBased on our analysis, we believe that the international market for its services, excluding China, Russia and Africa, is similar in size to that of the United\nStates, and exceeds $50 billion.\n6"

      "text": "Our Solutions\nOur location systems have been engineered and deployed to provide comprehensive solutions to the limitations and vulnerabilities inherent in GPS-based\nservices. Key GPS limitations include:\n●\nLow signal strength resulting in poor building/indoor penetration, limitations in urban areas;\n●\nVulnerability to jamming;\n●\nPoor vertical accuracy in most devices, which impacts any service where altitude is relevant (e.g., multi-level structures, vertical separation in\nlow-altitude aviation);\n●\nThe primary consumer GPS signal is unencrypted, resulting in poor location security and spoofing;\n●\nInherent physical vulnerability due to few, isolated transmitters; and\n●\nSingle point of failure for a wide range of PNT services.\nIsolated solutions to various aspects of the limitations to GPS-based positioning have been deployed, but none carry the primary benefit of GPS, which is\nhigh performance across a wide area.\nOur current service platforms include Pinnacle, our altitude (z-axis) solution, and TerraPoiNT, which is similar to a terrestrial GPS constellation. Both\nsystems offer metro-wide service, are inherently secure and can provide universal service access to all types of appropriately-equipped devices that use location\nservices.\nPinnacle\nPinnacle is our z-axis service, a dedicated vertical positioning network to cover entire metropolitan areas. Pinnacle provides devices equipped with a\nbarometric pressure sensor with the highest quality wide-area altitude service available in the U.S. market today based on a CTIA/FCC “911 Location Test Bed,\nLLC Report on Stage Z” from 2018. Our service is now available in the top 105 major U.S. markets, which include over 4,400 cities and over 90% of\ncommercial buildings that exceed three stories. In November 2022, Pinnacle service was launched by MetCom in Japan, and we anticipate MetCom will expand\ntheir service area in 2023.\nThe Pinnacle service is based three primary components:\n1)\nAn altitude station network, a managed network that consists of equipment designed, manufactured, deployed and operated by us, which\nmeasures key environmental variables associated with altitude to enable “floor level” altitude determination;\n2)\nDevice software, which supports delivery of our z-axis service to mobile apps and other devices, calibration of the pressure sensors on individual\ndevices and receipt of z-axis data from our cloud services platform; and\n3)\nA secure cloud services platform, which actively manages our altitude station network, synthesizes data from our network and devices to enable\nservice delivery, and performs access management functions.\nThe diagram below illustrates the basic process flow of the z-axis service. \n7"

      "text": "Pinnacle works by leveraging the physical principal that barometric pressure declines as altitude increases. By measuring the barometric pressure at a\ndevice, and comparing that measurement to the measurements from our network, we can accurately compute the altitude of the sensor. A Pinnacle altitude\nstation is depicted below, and measures approximately 16” x 6” x 4”.\n \n \n \nBecause our Pinnacle technology relies on barometric pressure measurement, it works with the hardware currently used in most mobile phones and\ntablets. Our Pinnacle service can be delivered to customers in this segment over an applications programming interface (“API”) or via an SDK integrated into\nthe relevant applications.\nIn order to expand access to and use of our Pinnacle services, we work closely with sensor vendors to provide input on key sensor performance factors\nnecessary to produce optimal Pinnacle services. We also recently launched the NextNav Certified™ program. The NextNav Certified™ program allows\npressure sensor vendors to perform a set of tests monitored by us. If a vendor meets the criteria for performance while adhering to the test procedures, the\nvendor can display the NextNav badge on its website and use the endorsement in its marketing to device vendors. Bosch Sensortec, InvenSense Goertek and ST\nMicroelectronics currently offer NextNav Certified™ sensors.\nTerraPoiNT\nTerraPoiNT is our full 3D PNT system, standardized in the global telecommunications standards group, 3GPP Release 13 as Metropolitan Beacon System\n(“MBS”). The current technical specification for the standard MBS signal, or Interface Control Document, can be downloaded from ATIS, the North American\naffiliate to 3GPP. We are in the process of evolving our transmission and this technical specification, subject to the successful integration of technologies\nacquired from Nestwave.  We license elements of our receiver technology to third-party chipset providers and device vendors, typically with no per device\nroyalty, to enable the reception of our signal on their devices.\nPositioning, navigation and timing are the core services provided by GPS, and TerraPoiNT can be thought of as a land-based GPS satellite constellation,\nbut with the broadcast transmitters, which we call “beacons.” In the United States, this service operates on 8 MHz of contiguous LMS spectrum licensed to us\nin the 900 MHz band, and covering approximately 93% of the U.S. population (see “Radio Spectrum” for more information about these licenses). We have\ndeployed a wide area, commercial grade TerraPoiNT network in 2 markets in the San Francisco Bay Area and in smaller networks in 83 additional markets\nthroughout the U.S. We are also conducting a pilot program with our joint venture partner MetCom in Japan to support a possible spectrum allocation.\n8"

The beacon network is also synchronized to Coordinated Universal Time, the global time standard broadcast by GPS and other NIST-\ntraceable sources.\nThis architecture is naturally resilient to service disruption and significantly more resistant to jamming than GPS. If GPS is disrupted, or completely\neliminated, a TerraPoiNT transmitter continues to operate and provide similar service within the TerraPoiNT service area. If one TerraPoiNT beacon is\ndisrupted, service continues from other nearby beacons. Thus, there is both local and national resilience embedded in the basic system design. By operating\nterrestrially in the 900 MHz LMS band, the TerraPoiNT signal is approximately 100,000 times stronger than GPS, and thus is significantly more difficult to\ndisrupt.\n9"

      "text": "TerraPoiNT was initially designed for maximum compatibility with GPS and other GNSS receivers, previously demonstrated by Broadcom on a version\nof their 4775 platform and GCT’s GDM7243i.  We expect TerraPoiNT's signal waveform to evolve to be compatible with standard LTE/5G receivers.  This\nevolution will enable the TerraPoiNT signal to be processed by the hardware used to process LTE and 5G signals. Separately, hybrid operation of our system\nwill allow us to rely in part on third party cellular signals that have been calibrated by our network. We anticipate that such a signal evolution would increase\nour spectral efficiency significantly, allowing us to offer a data capacity equivalent to other LTE/5G signals for the same bandwidth. This increased data\ntransmission capacity could be used, subject to FCC approval, to provide other types of LTE/5G-based two-way voice and data transmission services while\nmaintaining our PNT capabilities.\nThe expansion of the TerraPoiNT network build-out will require significant investment, however, compared to prior estimates, we believe that the hybrid\noperation of our network will require significantly less capital than that required by our historical network architecture. Once it is fully built-out, we expect to\nincur minimal ongoing maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the network. As a result, our business model provides significant operating leverage as the\nbusiness scales due to low variable costs to adding incremental network traffic. \nPrivacy and Data Security\nWe understand that protection of data and privacy is critically important to the end-users of our services. Our core privacy principles are:\n1.\nTransparency: We are transparent about our data practices, and we comply with our privacy policies and agreements so customers and business\npartners can make informed decisions.\n2.\nControl: We have implemented appropriate means for our customers and business partners to control relevant personal and business information.\n3.\nSecurity: We endeavor to protect the data entrusted to us by using strong security protocols.\n4.\nCompliance: We respect and comply with local privacy laws, ensuring that privacy-by-design is a core consideration as we develop our products\nand services.\n5.\nConsent: We require appropriate opt-in consent for the provision of all of our services, consistent with the requirements of local law.\nBased on industry best-practices, we have implemented multilayered administrative, physical, and technical security measures to protect data. Data access\nis implemented with the rule of “least privilege,” and we isolate data by service, business function and customer agreement. Our data is encrypted both at rest\n(locally on the device and on the server) and in transit.\nManufacturing and Network Operations\nManufacturing\nOur services are provided in part through equipment we design, generally manufactured under contract by domestic vendors in the United States. The\nPinnacle altitude stations were designed to provide a very high performance reference for altitude determination at a low cost. The TerraPoiNT beacons are\nsophisticated broadcast transmitters that incorporate a very accurate timing system to provide a signal that is similar to that provided by GPS in a terrestrial\ntransmitter. These units are designed to be integrated with our cloud services platform, and managed by software that we designed and created for these\nsystems.\nNetwork Operations\nWe operate two separate and distinct networks. The Pinnacle network is primarily operated in partnership with AT&T. The Pinnacle altitude stations are\nco-located at AT&T wireless sites and take advantage of the power systems, including battery backup and generators, at the AT&T sites. We monitor the\nPinnacle network health through our network operations center (“NOC”) and work with AT&T to resolve any issues that may arise. Connectivity among the\nPinnacle altitude stations, our cloud service platform, and our NOC are enabled through wireless connections, currently provided by AT&T.\nWe are not required to use AT&T wireless sites for network expansion, and may establish new service areas through independently-acquired site leases or\nwith other partners.\nOur TerraPoiNT network is deployed, operated, and maintained by us. The equipment is installed at traditional wireless sites with a mix of towers and\nrooftops. We monitor the network health through the same NOC as the Pinnacle network and directly dispatch our maintenance contractors if needed.\nAT&T Relationship\nWe have entered into a series of agreements with AT&T to provide our Pinnacle services to FirstNet®, built with AT&T, and to enable the co-location of\nelements of our network at AT&T’s wireless sites. By co-locating the Pinnacle equipment at AT&T wireless sites, we were able to accelerate the nationwide\ndeployment of our services and significantly reduce the ongoing operating costs associated with the Pinnacle system.\n10"

The parties also entered into escrow\narrangements on customary terms for intellectual property storage and verification of the deposited escrow materials in various different escrow “lockers,”\nwhich could be accessed by AT&T based on different conditions on which the draw down could be made.\nIn 2019, we entered into an equipment hosting agreement with AT&T that has a seven-year term (subject to earlier termination after three years in certain\ncircumstances), expiring in October 2026. Under the terms of the equipment hosting agreement, AT&T is providing all site related services during AT&T’s\ncontinued use of the service.  However, if AT&T ceases to use our services after the first three years (i.e. October 2022), then we may terminate the equipment\nhosting agreement or if we are not in breach of the agreement we may continue the agreement for the remainder of the term and we will have to pay for power\nand, LTE connectivity and incremental lease costs incurred by AT&T to host the equipment, if any. Our services agreement with AT&T for distribution of our\nservices to FirstNet® customers, which was scheduled to expire in October 2022, has been extended to January 7, 2024.\nCompetition and Competitive Advantages\nThe geolocation industry is highly competitive and we compete with incumbent geolocation services like GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular signals, augmented by\nother sensor inputs, as well as other companies who are new entrants into the market seeking to provide a solution to the same needs as we are.\nThe increasing demand for location services has resulted in the development of a number of supplements and alternatives to traditional GPS. The primary\ncandidates for GPS backup technologies are based on approaches that are significantly different than the technical approach adopted by us. These competitive\ntechnologies include:\n●\neLORAN. eLORAN is an advanced version of the World War II-era hyperbolic radio navigation system that was developed in response to the\nperceived vulnerability of the GNSS systems. eLORAN, like its predecessor uses very low frequencies (in the 100 kHz range), but has an advanced\nreceiver design and transmission characteristics, which increase the accuracy and usefulness of traditional LORAN. These enhancements make it a\nsuitable substitute for GPS. Because eLORAN requires larger antennas and form factor for its receivers, it does not have the same reach as our\nsolutions. It is more suitable for more rural and maritime types of environment.\n●\nLEO Satellite Systems. Low Earth orbit (“LEO”) satellite systems offer primarily timing service based on signals transmitted from low earth orbit\nsatellite constellations, transmitted in the L-Band. Because it is in a lower orbit, the LEO signal is much stronger than GPS, allowing for improved\nreception in urban areas and limited indoor reception. The primary limitation of LEO-based systems is that they remain a satellite-based signal, so\nthe signal is not as strong as a terrestrial-based system. In addition, as an add-on technology, its design is not as flexible as a dedicated system.\n●\nCommercial Location Systems. Commercial location systems generally include cellular systems, crowd-sourced systems and locally managed\nsystems. Cellular systems may use localized millimeter wave transmitters in 5G which provides location performance in the immediate vicinity of\nsuch 5G transmitters, but the service area of this capability, if deployed, is expected to be limited. Cellular systems are typically used as a fallback\nwhen the GPS signal is not available (e.g., indoors), but do not provide the same accuracy that our solutions provide and are ultimately dependent\non GPS. Crowd-sourced systems, such as those provided by Google and Apple through APIs in their mobile operation system platforms, rely on the\napplication of machine learning techniques to location information gathered from mobile devices. These systems are “best-efforts systems” that\ncompare GPS measurements to Wi-Fi access point signal strength, cellular signals and other signals gathered from millions of devices to estimate\nthe location of the access points. Crowd-sourced systems vary considerably in accuracy, offer less accurate vertical positioning information and are\nsubject to degradation if there is an issue with local power and local access points. Locally Managed Systems are systems that rely on the\nmanagement of lower-power signals, managed WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, dedicated beacons with large bandwidth requirements and\nUltrawideband to provide location services. These systems are centrally managed by the enterprise or a vendor, and typically offer high accuracy\nand reliability, but are expensive to deploy and manage, offer only limited coverage, are dependent upon local power sources and are usually only\navailable to the entity that deployed them. Most commercial locations systems do not provide an independent timing source, so are limited in their\nability to be a viable backup to GPS.\nWe believe our 3D solutions offer a superior alternative to each of these services. A summary of a report published in 2021 by the U.S. Department of\nTransportation characterizes and ranks the different available systems.\n11"

Our employees typically have\nsignificant experience working with location systems. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 106 full-time employees, the majority in our headquarters in\nMcLean, Virginia and in our facility in Sunnyvale, California. Of our employee base, 45 employees are located outside the U.S. – two in Canada, 25 in India,\nand 18 in France. Over 73 of our employees are engaged in research and development and related functions, and more than half of these employees hold\nadvanced engineering and scientific degrees, including many from the world’s top universities. \nTo date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are either\nrepresented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.\nFacilities\nWe maintain a distributed workforce with facilities in McLean, Virginia, Sunnyvale, California, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France,  Noida, India and Bangalore,\nIndia. Our principle executive office is in McLean, Virginia. Our corporate offices in Virginia include finance, regulatory and network deployment functions,\nwhile our California facility hosts our technology development functions, among other functions. Our French and Indian locations house a mix of employees\nand contractors focused on software development and research and development functions. We may add additional facilities in other locations in the future.\nRegulatory\nThere are government regulations pertaining to our operation, use, and export of our vertical location and PNT solutions, some of which are currently\napplicable to us and others that will become applicable to us as we expand our operations. As we expand service to additional countries and regions, we will\nbecome subject to additional governmental approvals and regulations.\nRadio Spectrum\nCertain of our services rely on the use of radio communications spectrum, which is regulated in the United States and in most other countries. In the\nUnited States, spectrum access is licensed and regulated by the FCC. We hold radio licenses issued by the FCC that authorize the use of 8 MHz of contiguous\nspectrum in the 900 MHz band covering approximately 93% of the population in the United States. These licenses and the FCC rules impose obligations on us\nregarding the use of this spectrum, including power and operational limits, spectrum sharing and interference restrictions, build out and usage requirements, and\na license renewal obligation. We must comply with these requirements in order to retain access and use of its spectrum resources.\nPrivacy\nIn developing highly accurate location information, we collect, process, transmit and store personal information, such as certain individual geolocation\ninformation, and other personal information relating to its business contacts, personnel, end users, and website visitors. A variety of federal and state laws and\nregulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of this information. The U.S. privacy and data protection legal landscape continues to\nevolve, with California and Virginia having enacted broad-based data privacy and protection legislation and with states and the federal government continuing\nto consider additional data privacy and protection legislation. As we expand overseas, our joint venture partners will be subject to foreign data privacy and\nprotection legislation, and we may be as well.\n14"

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other\ninformation included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before you decide whether to invest in our securities. We may face additional risks and uncertainties\nthat are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business. The following discussion should be read in\nconnection with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should consult\nyour own financial and legal advisors as to the risks entailed by an investment in our securities and the suitability of investing in our securities in light of your\nparticular circumstances. Some statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including such statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-\nlooking statements. See the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nRisks Related to the Business and the Industry \nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We expect to incur losses in the future, may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, and may\nneed to raise additional capital to maintain our operations in the future.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception and until the second quarter of 2021 had not widely commercially sold our solutions. For the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred net losses of $40.1 million, $144.7 million and $137.3 million, respectively. Furthermore, any\nexpansion of our TerraPoiNT services will result in increased operating costs. As a result, our losses are expected to continue and we may not achieve\nprofitability when expected, or at all. Even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability.\nSince becoming a public company, our operating expenses have increased, and we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase over the next\nseveral years as we scale our operations, increase research and development efforts relating to new offerings and technologies, hire more employees, and\noperate as a public company. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in meaningful revenue or growth in our business. Any failure\nto initiate and increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining\nprofitability or positive cash flow. If our future growth and operating performance fail to meet investor or analyst expectations, or if we have future negative\ncash flow or losses resulting from expanding our operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 30, 2023 will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital\nexpenditure needs, including all contractual commitments, for the next 12 months. We expect to meet longer term expected future cash requirements and\nobligations through a combination of cash flows from operations and issuance of equity securities or debt offerings. However, this determination is based upon\ninternal projections of operating cash flows and is subject to changes in market and business conditions. Our ability to obtain debt financing and/or issue equity\nsecurities on acceptable terms, or at all, will depend on, among other things, our financial performance and credit ratings, general economic factors, including\ninflation and then-current interest rates, the condition of the credit and capital markets and other events, some of which may be beyond our control.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\nWe have been focused on developing the next generation of geolocation services utilizing vertical (z-axis) location services and in order for us to be\nprofitable, our services require substantial adoption across disparate industries. We have only recently begun to commercially market our services, so it is\ndifficult, in consideration of our limited operating history, to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Risks and challenges\nwe have faced or expect to face include our ability to:\n16"

If our access to capital is restricted or associated borrowing costs increase as a result of\ndevelopments in financial markets, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere\nin this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical\nfinancial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we\nhad a longer operating history or operated in a more developed market. Forecasting the revenue potential of our services is made more difficult by the fact that\nlegacy location technologies, such as GPS, were developed by the federal government and made available to commercial users without charge. As a result, one\nof the adoption hurdles that must be overcome is convincing enterprise customers that the additional accuracy and security made available by our services\njustifies paying for them. We have encountered in the past, and we will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing\ncompanies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and\noperate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our\nexpectations and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPinnacle z-axis is a new capability, and adoption may be delayed by our potential customers’ unfamiliarity with 3D position, a lack of ecosystem support\n(e.g., specific device sensors, 3D routing) and/or other factors.\nWe do not sell our Pinnacle z-axis solutions directly to end users. Instead, we provide location technology that integrates with devices and applications\nthat are created or distributed by third parties. Accordingly, our future growth significantly depends on third parties choosing to incorporate our technology into\nsmartphone devices, applications and other new device types and markets, such as the Internet of Things, eVTOLs, UAVs and other markets that utilize\nlocation. We also depend on our customers, resellers and licensees to develop products and services with value-added features to drive sales and demand.\nBecause GPS has been viewed in the marketplace as a reliable geolocation service provided for free to end users, our customers may not see a business need to\nintegrate our solutions into our devices and applications. Despite efforts to educate customers about the need for z-axis geolocation services, there can be no\nassurance that such efforts will be successful and as a result, a market for our solutions may not be created.\nThe majority of our business plan depends on selling services that must be licensed and integrated into our customers’ platforms for sales to end users, and\nwe typically only generate revenue from the arrangements when end users access those third-party platforms and utilize our services.\nOur business plans are dependent in part on the sale of location services to our customers, which are third-party developers who use our services to create\napplications for use in mobile devices, on vehicles and in other platforms. For these types of contracts, we recognize revenue when end users access and use our\ncustomers’ applications. Contracts of this type do not contain purchase commitments and our limited operating history makes estimating the future variable\nvolume and revenue associated with these contracts difficult. If our customers take longer than expected to integrate our services into their applications or are\nunable to sell their applications in the volumes or timeframes we expect, then the use of our services by end users and the related recognition of revenue could\nbe delayed or may never occur.\n17"

      "text": "We may not be successful in the evolution of our TerraPoiNT technology to utilize LTE/5G signals, which will increase our costs and may increase the\nchallenge of adopting our services.\nWe are currently evolving our core technology from one reliant on a transmission that was designed to be technically compatible with GPS and GNSS\nreceivers to one that is designed to be technically compatible with LTE/5G receivers. This carries risks related to the technical performance of this\ntransmission.  If the technical performance of the LTE/5G transmission is not similar to the technical performance of our legacy technologies, then the market\nfor our services may be diminished.  Finally, while we intend our signal to be compatible with LTE/5G receivers, we may not be successful at integrating our\nservice into commercial LTE/5G receivers, which would significantly reduce the market for our services.\nOur hybrid architecture, which depends on the use of our transmitters and our ability to calibrate signals transmitted by third parties, is unproven, may not\nperform well and may cost significantly more than our initial estimates.\nWe are currently planning to provide our resilient PNT service through a “hybrid” architecture that relies in part on our signal (whether compatible with\nGPS/GNSS or LTE/5G), and in part on signals radiated by cellular operators and other third parties that are calibrated by us.  If we are not able to calibrate the\nsignals radiated by cellular operators and other third parties, then the performance of our hybrid system may not be sufficient to meet customer requirements,\nand the market for our services may be diminished.  Our hybrid architecture may also not result in the cost savings estimated by us, which would substantially\nincrease our future capital and operating expenditures.\nWe face intense competition in our market, especially from competitors that offer their location services for free, which could make it difficult for us to\nacquire and retain customers and end users. \nThe market for development, distribution and sale of location services is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have strong name recognition,\nsizable customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, public relations, sales, distribution and other resources than we do. These\ncompetitors often offer competing services for free and have the financial capabilities to continue to improve upon their location services offering without\ncharging a fee. Certain of our competitors are already vying for market share in the 3D location space through their participation in a federal regulatory\nproceeding involving the FCC in which wireless carriers are being required to enter into relationships with 3D location vendors in order to enable accurate 3D\nlocation information to be conveyed to E911 emergency dispatchers with each wireless call made to E911 emergency services. In June of 2022, the CTIA, a\ntrade association representing the wireless communications industry in the United States, filed a statement with the FCC that solutions provided by these\ncompetitors meet these FCC requirements. If the FCC accepts this statement, then the market for our services for E911 may be reduced. Also, although our\nservices currently offer an improved functionality over the services offered for free, there is no certainty that we will be able to achieve broad market appeal for\nour 3D location services. In addition, there is no guarantee that our services will be as reliable and with the same geographic coverage as the currently available\ngeolocation services, which may impact our ability to attract customers to utilize our products over the free services offered by our competitors. The\nperformance of our services may vary based on ambient conditions, both physical and environmental which may impact the timing and location accuracy of the\nsystem. If our services are not meaningfully superior to those available at lower or no cost, we may have difficulty selling our services, achieving widespread\nadoption of our services and our business, financial position and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe face competition from multiple sources.\nOur services compete against: (i) other satellite and terrestrial based location technology offerings, such as GPS, Observed Time Difference of Arrival and\nterrestrial beacons; (ii) other providers of WiFi and cell-based positioning, such as Google, Apple, Polaris and Skyhook; (iii) venue-based solutions such as\nBluetooth Low Energy; and (iv) other in-house developed location solutions. In the smartphone location provider market, because Apple and Google control a\nlarge percentage of the market share for smartphone operating systems, already provide their services on a nationwide basis, and both offer location provider\nservices free as part of the iOS and Android markets, we are constrained in the distribution and monetization of our services in that market. As noted above,\nthose vendors that secure access to wireless handsets for their 3D location services may be able to leverage a significant competitive advantage over other\nlocation service vendors. There are also a number of new location technologies in development that may further increase competition to support location\ncapabilities in various wireless devices (such as Internet of Things) and which may require us to meet more stringent accuracy standards.\nCertain of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources. Thus, many of these large\nenterprises are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in spending by customers in its markets, and often have broader product lines and\nmarket focus, have greater brand recognition and may not be as susceptible to downturns in a single market. These competitors may also be able to bundle their\nproducts together (such as with mapping software) to meet the needs of a particular customer, may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging\ntechnologies or changes in customer requirements and may be capable of delivering more complete solutions than we are able to provide. If large enterprises\nthat currently do not compete directly with us choose to enter our markets by acquisition or otherwise, competition for both revenue and data would likely\nintensify. In addition, the growth of new location technologies currently in development may further increase competition to provide these new technologies. If\nwe are not able to compete successfully for customers, our financial position may be materially adversely affected.\n18"

This AT&T agreement provides for such important capabilities as the hosting of our Pinnacle\nnetwork at AT&T’s wireless sites, the provision of power to the Pinnacle network equipment and AT&T data service to enable the Pinnacle network equipment\nto communicate with us. We have no contractual right to require AT&T to continue its relationship with us beyond the existing term of the equipment hosting\nagreement and AT&T may elect not to renew our contracts or we and AT&T may not be able to come to an agreement on renewal or extension terms at or\nbefore the end of agreement term. If we cannot secure a renewal or extension of the equipment hosting agreement, we may have to construct a new Pinnacle\nnetwork prior to expiration of the equipment hosting agreement. Constructing a new network would require significant time and resources that we may not be\nable to secure. In addition, if there is a delay in our ability to build a new network, our Pinnacle services may experience lengthy disruptions and outages. If we\nare unable to maintain our relationship with AT&T, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed. Our ability to transmit data is\ndependent on AT&T’s wireless data network and on the associated power supply available within that network. We have experienced temporary and\ngeographically limited service outages due to issues with the AT&T wireless data network.\nWe rely, in part, on AT&T for distribution of our services to FirstNet® customers.\nWe entered into a services agreement with AT&T that was to expire in October 2022, with no renewal terms.  We amended the agreement by extending it\nuntil January 7, 2024. This AT&T agreement, as amended, continues our relationship in which AT&T purchases, markets and sells our services to\nits FirstNet® subscribers. We have no contractual right to require AT&T to continue its relationship with us, and AT&T may decide not to renew our services\ncontract prior to the end of the extended term. If we are not able to secure a further renewal or extension of our services agreement with AT&T, our ability to\nsell or market products to FirstNet® and other public safety customers may be impacted, and our business, financial and results of operations may be harmed.  \nOur services may not be adopted by additional wireless carriers for E911.\nWe have expended significant resources developing, testing and licensing software and solutions targeted towards E911 services, the primary customers\nfor which are wireless carriers. Certain of these wireless carriers were the subject of an enforcement action by the FCC regarding their lack of compliance with\nrules requiring the provision of vertical location services in the top 25 cellular market areas (“CMAs”) by April 3, 2021. On June 3, 2021, the FCC adopted\nconsent decrees with each of the named wireless carriers that effectively provided an extension of one year to the April 3, 2021 compliance date in the top 25\nCMAs, but also required the carriers to begin delivering any z-axis information that was available to them and to provide interim reports on their ongoing\ntesting and deployment efforts. While we are currently providing service to Verizon as a customer for E911 services, our ability to sell our Pinnacle service to\nadditional wireless carriers for E911, a service we believe to exceed the current FCC accuracy requirement, is dependent upon the willingness of these carriers\nto use our service to comply with the FCC mandate.  This willingness was impacted by the FCC’s one year extension and may continue to be impacted by the\ndevelopment and testing of competing solutions to our technology. In June of 2022, the CTIA filed a statement with the FCC that solutions provided by certain\ncompetitors meet these FCC requirements. If the FCC accepts this statement, then the market for our services for E911 may be reduced.\nOur ability to offer our service for E911 is also influenced by the willingness of wireless device manufacturers to incorporate our software or services into\ntheir device platforms. Apple and Google exert significant market power over services on their respective platforms, and there is no assurance that they will\napprove or adopt our software or services in connection with their respective platforms. If Apple and/or Google do not provide such approval, there could be a\nmaterial adverse impact to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Pinnacle service in smartphones relies on the availability of barometric pressure measurements and 2D location being made available to us or our\ncustomers.\nIn order for our customers to be able to utilize our Pinnacle service in smartphones, we and our customers must have access to barometric pressure\nmeasurements and 2D location information, both of which are made available by Application Programming Interfaces provided by Google and Apple. If either\nGoogle or Apple meaningfully change their terms of service related to the use of this measurement and location data, choose not to provide this data to us or our\ncustomers, or choose not to incorporate location sensors in their devices, our ability to offer our Pinnacle service to our customers on these platforms will likely\nbe impacted.\nMass-market adoption of our TerraPoiNT service will require integration into devices, which may require both hardware and software upgrades.\nOur TerraPoiNT service is currently available with specialized devices. Mass-market adoption of our TerraPoiNT service will require integration into\ndevices, which requires upgrades of both hardware and software. The U.S. market for smartphones, smartphone components, and software is highly\nconcentrated. Our ability to integrate our service into these devices is highly dependent upon: (i) the availability of mass-market TerraPoiNT processors; (ii) the\nintegration of such processors, and associated radio components or designs, into smartphones; and (iii) the integration of our access control and service delivery\nsoftware. Key manufacturers of devices and chipsets may be unwilling to integrate TerraPoiNT processors and required components into their devices.

To\nthe extent our customers are unable to maintain a productive relationship with either or both of them, our relationships with these customers may be impacted\nand our ability to achieve broad market reach will be impacted and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate our cloud platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services or the need\nfor additional cloud support would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe outsource our cloud infrastructure to Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). Customers of our products need to be able to access our platform at any time,\nwithout interruption or degradation of performance. AWS runs its own platform that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to service interruptions at\nAWS. We have experienced and we expect that in the future we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time\ndue to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. Capacity constraints\ncould be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks. In addition, if our security, or that of AWS,\nis compromised, our products or platform are unavailable or our users are unable to use our products within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these\nperformance problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, either through\nAWS or alternative providers of cloud infrastructure, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, any\nchanges in service levels from AWS may adversely affect our ability to meet our customers’ requirements. Further, our customers may require it to support\nadditional cloud platforms beyond AWS, which would result in additional costs to our business.\nAny of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, possibly move customers to stop using our products, impair our ability to increase\nrevenue from existing customers, impair our ability to grow our customer base, subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level\nagreements and otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of key vendors for timely supply of components or services for our service offerings. If these vendors experience problems, we\ncould fail to obtain the equipment and services we require to operate our business successfully.\nThe components required for our Pinnacle altitude stations and our TerraPoiNT beacons are not available in high volume and are produced by a small\nnumber of vendors. We also depend on certain third-party services, in addition to those described elsewhere, for the provision of our services. If we are unable\nto procure these components or services or design or obtain effective alternatives, we may be unable to produce additional Pinnacle altitude stations or\nTerraPoiNT beacons, or provide services to our customers, each of which will have a significant impact on our ability to achieve mass-market adoption of our\nservices. As a result, we are reliant upon a limited number of suppliers of these components and services. In the event it becomes necessary to seek alternative\nvendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement vendors on economically attractive terms on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs\nand may negatively impact our ability to expand our service offering or cause disruption in service.\nIf vendors of our equipment or providers of services on which we rely experience financial difficulties, service or billing interruptions, patent litigation or\nother problems, our growth and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nOur services are available within defined network footprints, and if we are not able to deploy new infrastructure, we will not be able to expand our service\narea.\nOur services are available within defined network footprints. Unlike certain of our competitors that do not require the deployment of network\ninfrastructure to provide location services, we are not able to sell our services outside of these footprints where our customers may require services. In order to\nexpand our footprint, we would need to invest significant time and financial resources to build-out additional infrastructure and there is no certainty that even if\nwe were to be able to secure the financial resources to do so, that we would be able to expand our footprint successfully. In addition, as discussed in a\nsubsequent section, certain of our services, such as our TerraPoiNT service, depend on access to radio spectrum. Although we hold FCC spectrum licenses\ncovering the vast majority of the U.S. population, we do not currently have access to licensed radio spectrum in every location in the United States, and we have\nnot yet secured access to radio spectrum in locations outside the United States. If we are not able to deploy new infrastructure, we will not be able to expand our\nservice area, customers that require service outside of our footprints may choose other service providers, or may combine our service with other offerings,\nwhich may impact the value of our business.\n20"

As a geolocation services provider, there is an increased\nrisk that our technological infrastructure may be targeted in connection with terrorism or cyberattacks, either as a primary target, or as a means of facilitating\nadditional attacks on other targets.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business, so earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires,\ncyber security attacks, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures and similar events could materially disrupt our business operations or our\nprovision of service in one or more markets. Costs we incur to restore, repair or replace our network or technical infrastructure, as well as costs associated with\ndetecting, monitoring or reducing the incidence of unauthorized use, may be substantial and increase our cost of providing service. In addition, any of the\naforementioned risks may be augmented if our business continuity and disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate. If any of the above events were to occur,\nwe could experience an adverse impact to our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, our insurance may not be adequate to cover\nthe costs associated with a natural disaster or terrorist attack.

As a result, our information technology\nsystems, including the functions of third parties that are involved or have access to those systems, is large and complex. While all information technology\noperations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security breaches, incidents, attacks and exposures, the size, complexity, accessibility and\ndistributed nature of our information technology systems, and personal or confidential information stored on those systems, make such systems potentially\nvulnerable to unintentional or malicious internal and external threats on our technology environment.\n21"

For example, despite our efforts to secure our information technology systems and the data contained in those\nsystems, including any efforts to educate or train our employees, we remain vulnerable to phishing attacks.\nIn addition to the threat of unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive or personal information, other threats could include the deployment of harmful\nmalware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity\nand availability of information. Some of these external threats may be amplified by the nature of third-party web hosting or cloud computing services or by the\nintegration of our product into a third party’s offerings. Our systems may experience directed attacks intended to interrupt our operations; extract money from it;\nand/or obtain our data (including without limitation end user or employee personal information or proprietary information).\nAlthough we have implemented certain systems, processes, and safeguards intended to protect our information technology systems and data from such\nthreats and mitigate risks to our systems and data, we cannot be certain that threat actors will not have a material impact on our systems or services in the future.\nOur safeguards intended to prevent or mitigate certain threats may not be sufficient to protect our information technology systems and data due to the\ndeveloping sophistication and means of attack in the threat landscape. Recent developments in the threat landscape include an increased number of cyber\nextortion and ransomware attacks, with increases in the amount of ransom demands and the sophistication and variety of ransomware techniques and\nmethodology. Additionally, our third-party vendors or business partners’ information technology systems may be vulnerable to similar threats and our business\ncould be affected by those or similar third-party relationships.

Compliance with these obligations could delay or impede the development or distribution of new products and may cause\nreputational harm.\nThere is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not been discovered. While we have no\nreason to believe that we have experienced a data security incident that we have not discovered, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they\nconceal their unauthorized access to systems, and many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that leads to\nunauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable federal\nand/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time-consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation\nand oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations\nand contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in\nsignificant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.\nIn addition, any actual or perceived failure by us or our vendors or business partners to comply with our privacy, confidentiality or data security-related\nlegal or other obligations to third parties, or any security incidents or other unauthorized access events that result in the unauthorized access, release or transfer\nof sensitive information, may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by\nadvocacy groups or others, and could cause third parties, including current and potential partners, to lose trust in us including existing or potential customers’\nperceiving our platform, system or networks as less desirable.

      "text": "Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nOur business depends on access to radio spectrum to provide certain of our location services and access to such spectrum on a nationwide basis is not a\ncertainty.\nCertain of our location services depend on our ability to use portions of the radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. Through our wholly owned affiliate,\nProgeny LMS, LLC, we hold licenses issued by the FCC to use radio spectrum for location services within the 902-928 MHz band, identified by the FCC as\nLMS licenses. Our LMS licenses provide coverage of most areas of the U.S. and the vast majority of populated areas within the U.S. Our licenses, however, do\nnot provide nationwide coverage, which we are likely to need to provide certain of our location services on a nationwide basis. Most of the geographic areas\nwhere we lack spectrum are generally rural in character, although we do not hold licensed spectrum assets in two well populated locations, Minneapolis and\nSacramento. Therefore, we may need to secure additional spectrum licenses from the FCC or other LMS license holders for additional frequencies within the\n902-928 MHz band or in other frequencies in order to achieve nationwide coverage or to serve every major city. Radio spectrum is a scarce public resource and\nno certainty exists that we will be able to obtain additional licenses to provide nationwide coverage or obtain them at a reasonable cost. Very few private entities\nhold LMS licenses that we could acquire in a private transaction. Although the FCC regularly issues new spectrum licenses, the FCC has not issued new LMS\nlicenses for spectrum within the 902-928 MHz band since 2001 and it could decide to refrain from issuing any additional LMS licenses because the 902-928\nMHz frequencies are also used by other services on a shared basis, including by certain unlicensed devices used in homes and for such enterprise services as\nutility meter reading. If the FCC does issue additional LMS licenses, the FCC is likely to distribute those licenses through an auction process, requiring us to\nparticipate and compete with other bidders in such an auction, with no certainty of winning. If we are unable to secure additional LMS licenses or suitable\nalternative spectrum in a different frequency band, our ability to expand certain of our services nationwide may be negatively impacted, which may have a\nnegative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently do not hold any rights to use licensed spectrum resources outside the U.S. The rules for securing access to spectrum rights vary in each\ncountry. Further, different portions of the radio frequency band, including the 902-928 MHz band, are used for different purposes in different countries and\nregions. Therefore, no certainty exists that suitable spectrum resources can be identified or secured in international locations where we would seek to expand\nour business. In those countries where suitable spectrum resources may be available, spectrum licenses are often distributed through an auction or tender\nprocess, meaning we would have to compete with other applicants for access to spectrum rights, the success of which cannot be assured.\nEven if we are able to convert our signal transmissions to an LTE/5G wave form, the FCC may not permit us to realize all of the benefits of our hybrid\nLTE/5G architecture, including the transmission of high-throughput non-PNT-related voice and data.\nOne of the significant benefits of converting our spectrum transmissions to an LTE/5G waveform would be a substantial increase in the data transmission\ncapacity of our network, thus facilitating the carriage of non-PNT-related two-way voice and data services.  The FCC’s rules already permit us to use our 8 MHz\nof LMS spectrum for the carriage of two-way voice and data services, but these communications must be related to our PNT services and must be transmitted\nprimarily to and from vehicles and the occupants of those vehicles. Further, the voice and data communications are not permitted to be interconnected in real\ntime with the public switched network unless a store and forward technology is used. Therefore, to maximize the benefit of a conversion to an LTE/5G\nwaveform, assuming the conversion is successful, we will need to request flexibility from the FCC permitting us to use our spectrum for additional non-PNT-\nrelated services in addition to our PNT offerings. This approval could include the removal of the restrictions on the types of two-way voice and data\ntransmissions provided using the network, the types of end user devices that primarily send and receive the two-way voice and data communications, and the\nability to interconnect in real time with the public switched network.  Any such proposal could face substantial opposition from our competitors and other users\nof the 902-928 MHz band, and there is no certainty that the FCC will provide us this flexibility or the extent of the flexibility that is provided.\nOur FCC licenses authorize the use of radio frequencies that are shared with other radio services, which could result in harmful interference and\nimpairment to our use of our licensed spectrum.\nOur LMS licenses authorize us to use the upper portion of the 902-928 MHz band. This spectrum is a shared frequency band that is used for a number of\npurposes both by individuals, businesses and the federal government. Other services that are authorized to use these frequencies include federal radiolocation\nsystems; industrial, scientific and medical devices; licensed amateur radio operations; and certain unlicensed devices. Our use of the spectrum is subject to FCC\nrequirements that our operations must accept harmful interference from other uses of the spectrum that have more senior rights to the spectrum. We have been\nsuccessful thus far in using our LMS spectrum to operate location services without experiencing material impairment of our location services caused by more\nsenior spectrum uses, but no certainty exists that we will be able to continue to do so. Moreover, for certain specialized uses, including non-PNT-related two-\nway voice and data uses, the use of our spectrum would be subject to additional regulatory review, approvals and/or limitations. More senior uses of the 902-\n928 MHz band could become more numerous or could alter the characteristics of their transmissions in ways that could increase the interference to our location\nservices, resulting in diminished coverage, consistency and accuracy of our location services.\nIn addition, we are required to refrain from causing unacceptable levels of harmful interference to unlicensed wireless devices. The FCC issued a decision\nin 2013 that concluded that, based on field tests, we had successfully demonstrated that our location services did not cause unacceptable levels of harmful\ninterference to such unlicensed wireless devices. Third-party challenges to the FCC decision, are still pending. Further, changes in our operations could alter the\ntransmission characteristics of its location services, potentially requiring us to provide further demonstrations that our location services do not cause\nunacceptable levels of harmful interference to those unlicensed devices. No certainty exists that the FCC would conclude in the future that we remained\nsuccessful in making such a demonstration a second time. If we are unable to make this demonstration to the satisfaction of the FCC, we may not be able to\nmake changes to our operating characteristics, potentially preventing the future implementation of desirable innovations.\n26"

The\nFCC’s rules do not identify a specific threshold that must be demonstrated in order for us to secure renewal of our LMS licenses, which means the applicable\nthreshold is the FCC’s statutory obligation to grant a renewal of our licenses if it serves the public interest. Our LMS licenses were initially required to be\nrenewed on July 19, 2010. We timely filed an application for renewal, which the FCC granted on January 17, 2017. The FCC’s renewal grant was expressly\nconditioned on our compliance with build-out requirements, discussed further below. On July 7, 2020, we filed a second request for renewal of our LMS\nlicenses, which is still pending before the FCC. If we secure the renewal of our LMS licenses, our license renewal applications thereafter will be subject to new\nFCC rules placing additional conditions on license renewal applications. Specifically, in order to secure a third renewal of our LMS licenses in 2030, we will be\nrequired to demonstrate compliance with additional requirements, including that we have satisfied its build-out construction requirements, that we use our\nnetwork to provide service to the public, and that the service provided is at least at the same level of service that was demonstrated at the time of our build-out\nshowing. No certainty exists that we will receive the currently applied for renewal or continue to meet the requirements of such renewal for future applications.\nIf we fail to secure renewals for our LMS licenses, we will not be able to pursue our TerraPoiNT services as previously planned and our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur LMS licenses are subject to end-of-term build-out requirements maintained by the FCC and no certainty exists that we will be able to comply with the\nbuild out requirements and retain our licenses.\nOur LMS licenses are subject to FCC rules that require licensees to make productive use of their licensed radio spectrum by a specific deadline and\ncontinue such use throughout the term of the licenses. If a licensee fails to satisfy one of its build-out deadlines, the FCC will declare its licenses to be null and\nvoid. Over the years, the FCC has revoked many of the LMS licenses that the FCC issued to other parties for failing to satisfy their build-out requirements. In\nnearly all instances in which our licenses have reached a deadline to demonstrate the build-out and use of the licensed spectrum, we have either secured a\nfavorable ruling from the FCC regarding the sufficiency of our build-out showing, or a waiver or extension of our build-out requirements. No certainty exists,\nhowever, that we will be able to meet the FCC’s requirements in the future or secure waivers or extensions.\nWe are currently required by the FCC’s build-out rules to satisfy build-out demonstrations on October 3, 2020 for our 42 LMS licenses covering the\nlargest 21 Economic Areas (“EAs”) in the United States, April 3, 2021 for 40 of our LMS licenses covering the next largest 20 EAs and April 3, 2023 for our\nremaining LMS licenses. The October 3, 2020 deadline identified above had been set for April 3, 2020, but we filed a request for a six month extension of the\ndeadline as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which the FCC granted on July 19, 2020, extending our deadline to October 3, 2020. Based on the ongoing\nnature of the pandemic, on September 17, 2020, we filed a request for a second six month extension of the build-out deadline, which was granted by the FCC on\nMarch 29, 2023, extending our build-out deadline until April 3, 2021. The FCC also further extended our build-out deadline until June 17, 2021 to cover an\namended build-out notification that the FCC staff asked us to submit by that date.\nTo comply with our build-out requirements on each of the deadlines, we must demonstrate for each of our LMS licenses either that the geographic area of\nour licensed network provides coverage of at least two-thirds of the population in each of the licensed areas or that we are providing substantial service to end\nusers in each of our licensed areas. On February 2, 2021, we filed a waiver request with the FCC seeking approval to use a third option, demonstrating that the\ngeographic area of our licensed network provides coverage of at least two-thirds of relatively tall buildings (those in excess of three stories) rather than two-\nthirds of the population. We employed our proposed tall building coverage approach with respect to the end-of-term build-out showings that we filed with the\nFCC for our 82 LMS licenses that were subject to an April 3, 2021 end-of-term building out deadline. On March 29, 2023, the FCC issued an order concluding\nthat the use of a network construction approach involving coverage of relative tall buildings, rather than population, is warranted in this situation.  The order\ndirected the FCC staff to apply this finding to its review of the construction notifications that we filed for each of our LMS licenses.  No certainty exists,\nhowever, that, in applying this standard to our build-out showings, the FCC staff will conclude that our network construction efforts were sufficient to satisfy\nthe FCC’s requirements. Finally, we remain subject to an April 3, 2023 deadline to demonstrate the build-out for our 144 LMS licenses covering less-populous\nmarkets. We are currently completing the construction of LMS networks covering the EAs authorized by many of these 144 LMS licenses and we intend to\nsubmit showings to the FCC indicating that we have satisfied our build-out requirements for these LMS licenses by the April 3, 2023 deadline.  With respect to\nthose LMS licenses for which network construction has not been completed by the April 3, 2023 deadline, we will file requests for waivers of the build-out\ndeadline seeking extensions of time to complete the construction and satisfy the build-out deadlines for these licenses.  We are still working to determine which\nLMS networks will be completed by the April 3, 2023 deadline. No certainty exists that the FCC will conclude that we have satisfied our build-out requirements\nin those EAs where we have completed construction of our networks or will grant waivers or extensions of our build-out deadlines for those EAs where\nnetwork construction has not been completed by the applicable deadline.  If the FCC fails to deem our build-out showings as acceptable and/or we are unable to\nsecure extensions to our build-out deadlines or necessary waivers, the FCC could declare the applicable LMS licenses to be null and void, which would have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our ability to expand our TerraPoiNT services as previously planned, and our business, financial condition and results of operations\ncould be harmed.\n27"

      "text": "Our retention and use of our LMS licenses has been the subject of ongoing objections by third parties that could result in the revocation or non-renewal of\nour LMS licenses.\nThe FCC’s oversight of radio spectrum is conducted using a largely public process that is generally governed by the Administrative Procedure Act and the\nFCC’s rules on public participation in spectrum allocation and licensing proceedings. As a result, our retention and use of our LMS licenses has been the subject\nof comments and objections from third parties, including other users of the 902-928 MHz frequencies and other current and former licensees of LMS spectrum.\nIn the past, the FCC has regularly rejected and dismissed these objections to our retention and use of our LMS licenses, but no certainty exists that the FCC will\ncontinue to do so in the future. Certain of the previous objections remain pending before the FCC, meaning that the FCC could still act on them in a manner that\nis adverse to us. The pending objections include pleadings that were filed on July 8, 2013 by a number of businesses that use unlicensed radio spectrum in their\noperations and were asking the FCC to suspend our authority to use our LMS spectrum for commercial purposes. In addition, several affiliated companies\ncontrolled by a former licensee of LMS spectrum have filed numerous objections and adverse pleadings against our LMS licenses. A number of these adverse\npleadings remain pending, including a petition, dated February 3, 2021, requesting the FCC to reallocate the 902-928 MHz band for other purposes. Although\nthe FCC has consistently rejected the adverse pleadings that were filed by this individual in the past, no certainty exists that the FCC will continue to do so. If\nthe FCC acts on any current or future objections by third parties, our LMS licenses could be revoked or not renewed, which will have a material adverse impact\non our ability to expand TerraPoiNT as previously planned and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nA portion of our business plan targets government customers, which subjects us to risks, including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and\npenalties.\nOne of our business strategies is to develop business relationships with U.S. government agencies for the provision of our products and services. We\ncurrently contract directly with U.S. government agencies, including NASA, and perform as a subcontractor to other contractors under U.S. government\nprograms. As a U.S. government contractor, our business is subject to statutes and regulations applicable to companies doing business with the U.S.\ngovernment, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, and NASA FAR Supplement, or NFS.\nThe funding of U.S. government programs is subject to annual U.S. Congressional appropriations. Long-term government contracts and related orders are\nsubject to cancellation if appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made. In addition, the U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its\ncontracts and subcontracts without prior notice at its convenience and in that event, the counterparty to the contract may generally recover only its incurred or\ncommitted costs and settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, the\ndefaulting party may be liable for any extra costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source. The termination of funding\nfor a U.S. government program that we support, or any modification or curtailment of our U.S. government prime contracts or subcontracts, would result in a\nloss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or U.S. government\ncustomer demand for our products and services.\nIn addition, U.S. government contracts normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and\nexpose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These compliance costs might further increase in the future, reducing our margins,\nwhich could have a negative effect on our financial condition. These requirements include, for example:\n●\nspecialized disclosure and accounting requirements unique to U.S. government contracts;\n●\nfinancial and compliance audits;\n●\npublic disclosures of certain contract and company information; and\n●\nmandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor requirements, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and\nenvironmental compliance requirements.\nFailure to comply with these U.S. government contracting regulations and requirements may result in potential price adjustments, recoupment of U.S.\ngovernment funds after such funds have been spent, civil and criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions such as suspension or debarment from U.S.\ngovernment contracting or subcontracting for a period of time and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and ability to secure future U.S.\ngovernment contracts.\nOur government contract activities are subject to audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies, including agency Inspectors General, regarding\nour compliance with U.S. government contract requirements. If any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to\ncivil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from\ndoing business with the U.S. government.\n28"

      "text": "In addition, if we fail to comply with U.S. government contracting laws, regulations and contract requirements, our contracts may be subject to\ntermination, and we may be subject to financial and/or other liability under our contracts, the Federal Civil False Claims Act (including treble damages and\nother penalties), or criminal law. In particular, the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” provisions also allow private individuals, including present and former\nemployees, to sue on behalf of the U.S. government. Any penalties, damages, fines, suspension, or damages could adversely affect our ability to operate our\nbusiness and our financial results.\nWe and our service providers collect, process, transmit, and store personal information, which creates legal obligations and may give rise to additional costs\nand liability. Failure to comply with federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection could adversely affect our\nbusiness and its financial condition.\nWe collect, process, transmit and store personal information, such as certain individual geolocation information, and other personal information relating to\nits business contacts, personnel, end users, and website visitors, and we may rely in part on third parties that are not directly under its control to manage certain\nof these operations on its behalf. A variety of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as international laws and regulations (including as applicable\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation) govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of this information.\nThe U.S. privacy and data protection legal landscape continues to evolve, with California and Virginia having enacted broad-based data privacy and\nprotection legislation and with states and the federal government continuing to consider additional data privacy and protection legislation. The potential effects\nof this legislation are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an\neffort to comply. The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) went into effect in January 2020 and gives California residents certain rights with respect to\ntheir personal information such as rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of the sale of their personal information, and\nreceive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of\naction for certain data breaches. The CCPA was amended, and the California Office of the Attorney General published final regulations to implement portions of\nthe CCPA. Additionally, in November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative, which introduces significant\namendments to the CCPA and confers enforcement power on a new state regulatory body to supplement the enforcement powers of the California Attorney\nGeneral. The CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023 and new CPRA regulations are expected to be introduced. In addition, the Virginia legislature passed\nthe Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), which includes new consumer rights, an appeals process for certain aggrieved consumers, and data protection\nassessments for certain data processing activities. We will need to implement mechanisms and internal processes to fulfill the new obligations under the\nVCDPA. Although we do not have direct interaction with end users, we may still be subject to these laws with respect to other personal information we process,\nor by way of acting as a service provider to our customers, which may bear additional obligations under these laws.\nWe or our customers may also be subject to FCC rules regarding Customer Proprietary Network Information or other restrictions on our ability to use\ncertain data that we collect in connection with 911 or other calls. Further, the FCC’s wireless location rules subject us to additional privacy restrictions with\nrespect to our use of any location information resulting from the provision of location services to support 911 emergency services.\nOur obligations under applicable data privacy laws, regulations, contracts, industry standards, self-certifications, and other documentation may include\nmaintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal information or other data in our possession or control, maintaining reasonable and\nappropriate security safeguards as part of an information security program, and limits on the use and/or cross-border transfer of such personal information or\nother data. These obligations create potential liability to regulators, our business partners and customers, end users, and other relevant stakeholders and also\nmay impact the attractiveness of our services to existing and potential customers. Data protection laws around the world often require “reasonable”,\n“appropriate” or “adequate” technical and organizational security measures, and the interpretation and application of those laws are often uncertain and\nevolving, and there can be no assurance that our security measures will be deemed adequate, appropriate or reasonable by a regulator or court. \nGiven the evolving nature of security threats and evolving safeguards, we cannot be sure that our chosen safeguards will protect against security threats to\nour business, including the personal data that we process. However, even security measures that are appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance with\napplicable legal requirements may not be able to fully protect our information technology systems and the data contained in those systems, or our data that is\ncontained in third parties’ systems. Moreover, certain data protection laws impose on us responsibility for our employees and third parties that assist with\naspects of our data processing. Our employees’ or third parties’ intentional, unintentional, or inadvertent actions may increase our vulnerability or expose us to\nsecurity threats, such as phishing attacks, and we may remain responsible for successful access, acquisition or other disclosure of our data despite the quality\nand legal sufficiency of our security measures.\nIn addition to the risk of data breaches and noncompliance with applicable law, we may be exposed to additional liability for our failure to adhere to the\ntechnical or operational security requirements of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”) if and as applicable, imposed by the Payment\nCard Industry Security Standards Council to protect cardholder data. Penalties arising from PCI DSS enforcement are inherently uncertain as penalties may be\nimposed by various entities within the payment card processing chain without regard to any statutory or universally mandated framework. Such enforcement\ncould threaten our relationship with our banks, card brands we do business with, and our third-party payment processors.\n29"

Although\nwe endeavor to comply with our published policies and other published documentation, we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do\nso. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees or vendors fail to comply with our published policies or\nother documentation. Such failures can subject us to potential law enforcement or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of\nour actual practices.\nWe expect that new industry standards, laws and regulations will continue to be proposed regarding privacy, data protection and information security in\nmany jurisdictions. We cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. We expect that the evolving\nregulatory interpretation and enforcement of data protection laws, such as the CCPA, CPRA, and VCDPA, as well as other domestic and foreign data protection\nlaws, will lead to increased operational and compliance costs and may require us to make changes to our operations, policies, and procedures.\nOur business is subject to a wide variety of additional extensive and evolving government laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and\nregulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations relating to various aspects of our business, including with respect to our wireless location\nservices, employment and labor, health care, tax, privacy and data security, health and safety, customs and government contracting. Laws and regulations at the\nforeign, federal, state and local levels frequently change, especially in relation to new and emerging industries, and we cannot always reasonably predict the\nimpact from, or the ultimate cost of compliance with, current or future regulatory or administrative changes. We monitor these developments and devote a\nsignificant amount of management’s time and external resources towards compliance with these laws, regulations and guidelines, and such compliance places a\nsignificant burden on management’s time and other resources, and it may limit our ability to develop new business channels. Moreover, changes in law, the\nimposition of new or additional regulations or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts our business could require us to change the\nway we operate and could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with these laws or regulations or failure to satisfy any criteria or other requirement under such laws or regulations, such as with respect\nto obtaining and maintaining licenses, certificates, authorizations and permits critical for the operation of our business, may result in civil penalties or private\nlawsuits, or result in a delay or the denial, suspension or revocation of licenses, certificates, authorizations or permits, which would prevent us from operating\nour business. \nAdditionally, regulation of our industry is still evolving, and new or different laws or regulations could affect our operations and increase direct\ncompliance costs. Application of these laws to our business may negatively impact our performance in various ways, limiting the collaborations we may pursue\nand increasing our costs and the time necessary to obtain required authorization. The adoption of a multi-layered regulatory approach to any one of the laws or\nregulations to which we are or may become subject, particularly where the layers are in conflict, could require alteration of our services or operational\nparameters, which may adversely impact our business. We may not be in complete compliance with all such requirements at all times and, even when we\nbelieve we are in complete compliance, a regulatory agency may determine that we are not.\nWe are subject to stringent U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations. Unfavorable changes in these laws and regulations or U.S.\ngovernment licensing policies, our failure to secure timely U.S. government authorizations under these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with\nthese laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business plans are based in part on the distribution of our equipment, software and services world-wide. We are required to comply with U.S. export\ncontrol laws and regulations, including the EAR administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security and the foreign asset\ncontrol regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Pursuant to these foreign trade control laws and\nregulations, we are required, among other things, to (i) determine the proper licensing jurisdiction and export classification of products, software, and\ntechnology, (ii) obtain licenses or other forms of U.S. government authorization, or qualify for exceptions, to export our products, software, and technology\noutside the United States, and (iii) avoid engaging in unauthorized transactions with certain sanctioned countries, territories, entities, and individuals. Violations\nof applicable export control and sanctions laws and related regulations, which are enforced on a strict liability basis, could result in criminal and administrative\npenalties, including fines and possible denial of export privileges. U.S. export licenses or license exceptions are required to transfer or make accessible certain\nof our software source code and technology to our non-U.S. employees (deemed exports).\nIn addition, U.S. export control laws and related licensing policies continue to change, further regulating the export and re-export of our products,\nservices, and technology from the U.S. and abroad, and increasing our costs and the time necessary to obtain required authorization. For example, should\nexceptions or exemptions under the EAR be changed, our activities otherwise authorized via these mechanisms may become unavailable and could result in the\nneed for additional export authorizations.\n30"

Increasing trade tensions with China and Russia, in particular, may affect our supply chain, increase direct and indirect\ncompliance costs, or significantly impact relations with business partners. The extensive and changing nature of these export control laws and related licensing\npolicies may diminish our ability to market our solutions in the certain markets.  \nWe are exposed to risks related to geopolitical and economic factors, laws and regulations and our international business subjects us to numerous political\nand economic factors, legal requirements, cross-cultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally.\nAlthough our international business is still in its early stages, its development is subject to both U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without\nlimitation, laws and regulations relating to export/import controls (described above), sanctions, technology transfer restrictions, government contracts and\nprocurement, data privacy and protection, anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act, security\nrestrictions and intellectual property. Failure by us, our employees, affiliates, partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and\nregulations could result in administrative, civil, commercial or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension\nof our export/import privileges. New regulations and requirements, or changes to existing ones in the various countries in which we operate can significantly\nincrease our costs and risks of doing business internationally.\nChanges in laws, regulations, political leadership and environment, and/or security risks may dramatically affect our ability to conduct or continue to\nconduct business in international markets, including sales to customers and purchases from suppliers outside the U.S. We may also be impacted by U.S. and\nforeign national policies and priorities, political decisions and geopolitical relationships, any of which may be influenced by changes in the threat environment,\npolitical leadership, geopolitical uncertainties, world events, bilateral and multi-lateral relationships and economic and political factors, and any of which could\nimpact our operations and/or export authorizations, or delay purchasing decisions or payments and the provision of supplies, goods and services. Global\neconomic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could further impact our business. For example, the tightening of credit in financial\nmarkets outside of the U.S. could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing and could result in a decrease in or cancellation\nof orders for our products and services or impact the ability of our customers to make payments.\nWe also are increasingly dependent on in-country suppliers and we face risks related to their failure to perform in accordance with the contracts and\napplicable laws, particularly where we rely on a sole source supplier. The services we provide internationally are sometimes in countries with unstable\ngovernments, economic or fiscal challenges, military or political conflicts and/or developing legal systems. This may increase the risk to our employees,\nsubcontractors or other third parties, and/or increase the risk of a wide range of liabilities, as well as loss of property or damage to our products.\nThe occurrence and impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position,\nresults of operations and/or cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nIf we issue and sell additional shares of our Common Stock in the future, our existing stockholders will be diluted and our stock price could fall.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, of which, as of June 30,\n2022, 101,386,800 shares were outstanding, 9,673,217 shares were reserved for issuance under our stock incentive plans or other outstanding options and\n18,749,990 shares were issuable upon the exercise of warrants. As a result, we have a large number of shares of Common Stock that are authorized for issuance\nand are not outstanding or otherwise reserved and could be issued at the discretion of our board of directors (our “Board”). We expect to seek additional\nfinancing in the future in order to fund our operations, and if we issue additional shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock, our\nexisting stockholders will be diluted. Our Board may also choose to issue shares of our Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our\nCommon Stock to acquire assets or companies, for compensation to employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors, to fund capital expenditures and to\nenter into strategic partnerships. Additionally, shares of Common Stock could be issued for anti-takeover purposes or to delay or prevent changes in control or\nmanagement of the Company. Our Board may determine to issue shares of our Common Stock on terms that our stockholders do not believe enhance\nstockholder value, or that may ultimately have an adverse effect on our business or the trading price of our Common Stock. Further, the issuance of any such\nshares may cause further dilution to the ownership interest of our current stockholders, reduce the book value per share of our Common Stock and may\ncontribute to a reduction in the market price for our Common Stock.\n31"

As of December 31, 2022, our\nexecutive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 71% of our outstanding\nshares of Common Stock. Accordingly, our directors, executive officers and certain stockholders have significant influence over our affairs due to their\nsubstantial stock ownership coupled with their positions on our management team. For example, these stockholders may be able to control or influence\nelections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This\nconcentration of ownership may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our Common Stock that some of our stockholders may\nbelieve is in their best interest.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of federal securities laws, compliance with which involves significant time, expense and expertise.\nWe are a public reporting company and are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws,\nincluding the obligations imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The ongoing costs associated with preparing and filing annual, quarterly and current\nreports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC in the ordinary course, as well as preparing and filing audited financial statements, are significant\nand may cause unexpected increases in operational expenses. Our present management team is relatively small and may be unable to manage the ongoing costs\nand compliance effectively. It may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to hire additional financial reporting, accounting and other finance staff in\norder to build and retain a management team with adequate expertise and experience in operating a public company. Although our Common Stock trades on The\nNasdaq Capital Market, a regular trading market for our Common Stock may not be sustained in the future.\nIn addition, as a public reporting company we will be required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting by the time our second\nannual report is filed with the SEC and thereafter, which will require us to document and make significant changes to our internal control over financial\nreporting. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting at such time as we cease to be an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (the\n“JOBS Act”), if we are an “accelerated filer” or “large accelerated filer” at such time.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. We have paid no cash dividends on any of our capital stock to\ndate and we currently intend to retain our available cash to fund the development and growth of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future\nwill be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by\napplicable law and other factors our Board deems relevant. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nAny return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock, which may never occur. \nCertain of our Warrants are exercisable, which could increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to\nour stockholders.\nOutstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 18,750,000 shares of Common Stock became exercisable on November 27, 2021 (the 30th day\nfollowing the closing of the Business Combination) in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement governing those securities. These warrants consisted\nof 10,000,000 public warrants originally included in Spartacus’ initial public offering and 8,750,000 private placement warrants. The 8,750,000 private\nplacement warrants have been registered pursuant to the Registration Statement and are included on this Post-Effective Amendment. Each warrant entitles its\nholder to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share and will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York time, on October 28, 2026 (five\nyears after the completion of the Business Combination), or earlier upon redemption of our Common Stock or our liquidation. To the extent warrants are\nexercised, additional shares of Common Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to our then existing stockholders and increase the number of shares\neligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading\nvolume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our\nbusiness. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price\nwould likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could\ndecrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. \n32"

      "text": "Overview\nWe are the market leader in delivering next generation PNT solutions that overcome the limitations of existing space-based GPS. The world increasingly\nrequires more accurate and resilient PNT capabilities. Public safety, autonomous vehicles, eVTOLs, UAVs, and the app economy all require precise 3D location\nsolutions. Paramedics need to know which apartment a 911 call originated from, ride hailing and delivery apps need to know precisely where you are standing\nand game developers need precise 3D location data to deliver a next generation augmented reality experience.\nIn early 2021, we launched the first element of our next generation GPS service through initial commercial launch of our nationwide Pinnacle network\nthat was deployed in partnership with AT&T Services, Inc. (“AT&T”). The Pinnacle network provides “floor-level” altitude data to over 90% of commercial\nstructures over three stories in the U.S. Pinnacle is being utilized by FirstNet® for public safety. We are currently providing service to Verizon as a customer for\nE911 services, using our Pinnacle 911 solution.  Pinnacle has also been adopted by a growing number of public safety apps, commercial apps and app\ndevelopment platforms, including Unity Engine, CRG, GeoComm, Rapid Deploy, Central Square, NGA 911, Qualcomm, and the Unreal Engine. We believe\nthat ramp up of customers using our existing Pinnacle network will support revenue growth over the coming year.\nWe will be extending our capabilities by expanding the deployment our TerraPoiNT system, which is a nationwide network that is designed to overcome\nthe inherent limitations of traditional GPS. TerraPoiNT utilizes a network of specialized wide area location transmitters that broadcast an encrypted PNT signal\non our licensed 900 MHz LMS spectrum with a signal that is 100,000 times stronger than GPS. TerraPoiNT is well suited for urban and indoor environments\nwhere existing GPS signals are either distorted or blocked all together. In addition, TerraPoiNT provides redundancy for GPS, which is vulnerable to spoofing\nand jamming. GPS redundancy is increasingly a U.S. national security priority and is a rising priority in the other parts of the world. Critical infrastructure,\nincluding communications networks and power grids, require a reliable GPS signal for accurate timing. A failure of GPS would be catastrophic, and there is no\nback-up today.\nSince the inception of NextNav, LLC in 2007, we have secured valuable FCC licenses covering approximately 93% of the U.S. population for a\ncontinuous 8 MHz band of 900 MHz spectrum, filed more than 150 patents related to our systems and services, deployed the nationwide Pinnacle network and\nlaunched commercial service. In addition, we have deployed our TerraPoiNT solution in 85 markets, and TerraPoiNT received the highest scores in testing by\nthe Department of Transportation of potential PNT back-up solutions.\nIn October 2022, we acquired Nestwave SAS (“Nestwave”). We expect the integration of the Nestwave technology to significantly reduce the capital and\noperating expenditures associated with a national deployment of a TerraPoiNT network.  In addition, Nestwave’s technology could result in a significant\nimprovement in the spectral efficiency of our radio transmissions, which may allow us to offer an expanded suite of PNT and data services.\nThe Business Combination\nOn October 28, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), we consummated a Business Combination pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. As a result of the\nBusiness Combination, we changed our name to NextNav Inc., and certain blocker entities formed by Holdings equity holders, Holdings and the various\noperating subsidiaries of Holdings became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, with the equity holders of each of such blocker entities and Holdings and\nSpartacus’ stockholders becoming our stockholders. The Nasdaq ticker symbols for our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and warrants are “NN” and\n“NNAVW,” respectively. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 included elsewhere in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K for additional information.\n36"

      "text": "Macroeconomic Factors\nWe are aware that network deployment projects are experiencing delays in schedules and potential cost increases due to a tight labor supply in the field\nservices market. While the impact of this supply constraint is not material to the Company's network projects at this time, we continue to carefully manage labor\nand materials supply matters.  Additionally, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nManagement continues to actively monitor our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce. We expect these macroeconomic\nand COVID-19 factors and their effects on our operations to continue through the remainder of 2023.\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe have generated limited revenue since our inception. We derive our revenue from “floor-level” altitude location data, and related products and services,\nand PNT products and services. Our revenue includes revenue generated through services contracts with wireless carriers, services with applications developers,\ntechnology demonstration, assessment and support contracts with government customers, sales of equipment, and licensing of proprietary technology. We\nrecognize revenue when an arrangement exists, services, equipment or access to licensed technology are delivered, the transaction price is determined, the\narrangement has commercial substance, and collection of consideration is probable.\nOperating Expense\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold (“COGS”) consist of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, and allocated facility\ncosts for our operations and manufacturing teams. COGS also includes expenses for site leases, cost of equipment, and professional services related to the\nmaintenance of the equipment at each leased site. We expect our operations costs to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in the expansion\nof our Pinnacle and TerraPoiNT networks in domestic U.S. and international markets.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, and allocated\nfacility costs for our research and development functions. Research and development costs also include outside professional services for software and hardware\ndevelopment, cloud hosting costs, and software licensing costs. We expect our research and development costs to increase for the foreseeable future as we\ncontinue to invest in research and development for our current products and future products.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, and\nallocated facility costs for our business development, marketing, corporate, executive, finance legal, human resources, IT and other administrative functions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses also include expenses for outside professional services, including legal, auditing and accounting services,\nrecruitment expenses, travel expenses and certain non-income taxes, insurance and other administrative expenses.\nWe expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we scale headcount with the growth of our business,\nand as a result of operating as a public company, including compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, legal, audit, additional insurance expenses,\ninvestor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services. As a result, we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses will\nincrease in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue over time.\n37"

      "text": "Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception and to date have generated only limited revenue. We have primarily relied upon debt and equity\nfinancings to fund our cash requirements. \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred net losses of $40.1 million and $144.7 million, respectively. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, our net cash used in operating activities and investing activities was $37.1 million and $15.7 million, respectively. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, our net cash used in operating activities and investing activities was $47.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022,\nwe had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $55.4 million and an accumulated deficit of $688.5 million. We expect to incur additional losses\nand higher operating expenses for the foreseeable future. Our primary uses of cash are to fund our operations as we continue to grow our business. We will\nrequire a significant amount of cash for expenditures as we invest in ongoing research and development and the expansion of the TerraPoiNT network.\nManagement has the intent and ability to manage liquidity through the timing and extent of research and development spend, as well as other discretionary\noperating expenses.\nManaging liquidity and our cash position is a priority of the Company. We continually work to optimize our expenses in light of the growth of our\nbusiness, and adapt to changes in the economic environment. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 30, 2023 will\nbe sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, including all contractual commitments, for the next 12 months. We expect to meet\nlonger term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash flows from operations and issuance of equity securities or debt\nofferings. However, this determination is based upon internal projections of operating cash flows and is subject to changes in market and business conditions.\nOur ability to obtain debt financing and/or issue equity securities on acceptable terms, or at all, will depend on, among other things, our financial performance\nand credit ratings, general economic factors, including inflation and then-current interest rates, the condition of the credit and capital markets and other events,\nsome of which may be beyond our control. \nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the period indicated:\n                                                       \n \nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n \n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n \n \n \n(in thousands)\n \nNet cash (used in) operating activities\n  $\n(37,095)   $\n(47,932)\nNet cash (used in) investing activities\n   \n(15,736)    \n(1,282)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n   \n43     \n135,641 \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur cash flows used in operating activities are significantly affected by the growth of our business primarily related to research and development, sales\nand marketing, and selling, general and administrative activities.

The equity and debt proceeds were partially offset by $96.9 million of debt repayments in connection with the\nconsummation of the Business Combination.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In doing such preparation, we have to make estimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those\nestimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates\non past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. \nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant\naccounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from indoor and dense-urban positioning technology, products and services including revenue generated through technology\ndemonstration and assessment contracts with customers, support services provided to customers, sales of equipment, and licensing of proprietary technology.\nWe recognize revenue when an arrangement exists, services, equipment or access to licensed technology are delivered, the transaction price is determined,\nthe arrangement has commercial substance, payment terms are determined and collection of consideration is probable.\nWe sell software licenses and services through arrangements that may bundle software, equipment, and other services. When we determine that we have\nseparate distinct performance obligations, we allocate the bundled contract price among the various performance obligations based on each deliverable’s stand-\nalone selling price. If the stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the amount to be allocated for each performance obligation based on\nobservable market transactions. When we determine the performance obligations are not distinct, we recognize revenue on a combined basis as the obligation is\nsatisfied. To the extent our contracts include variable consideration, the transaction price includes both fixed and variable consideration. The variable\nconsideration contained within our contracts with customers may include discounts, credits and other similar items. When a contract includes variable\nconsideration, we evaluate the estimate of the variable consideration to determine whether the estimate needs to be constrained; therefore, we include the\nvariable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of cumulative revenue recognized\nwill not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\n42"

      "text": "We recognize equipment sales and the related costs when control of the equipment passes to the customer, typically upon shipment. Customers do not\nhave rights of return without our prior consent. Revenue pursuant to licensing agreements for our technology represents performance obligations that are\nsatisfied over time. We recognize support services ratably over the periods in which the services are provided; the related costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenue on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. We bill amounts under our agreed-upon contractual terms at periodic intervals for services, upon shipment for equipment, or upon\nachievement of contractual milestones or as work progresses. Billing may occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in accounts receivable. We may\nalso receive payments from customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in deferred revenue.\nIndefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nWe hold wireless Multilateration LMS licenses. Certain general regulatory requirements apply to all licensed wireless spectrum, including, for example,\ncertain build-out or “substantial service” requirements, which generally must be satisfied as a condition to the retention of the license. We are actively engaged\nin either meeting such requirements currently or seeking an extension of such requirements from the FCC for each of our LMS licenses. Although licenses are\nissued for only a fixed time, ten years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the FCC, based on the achievement of certain milestones and a finding that such\nrenewal would serve the public interest. Renewal of our licenses has occurred previously and at nominal cost. As a result, we treat our wireless LMS spectrum\nlicenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We reevaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and\ncircumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Costs incurred to maintain the FCC licenses are recorded in operating expenses.\nWe assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment annually as of October 1, or during the year if an event or other circumstance\nindicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. In evaluating indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we first assess\nqualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is not\nmore likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. However, if we conclude that it is more\nlikely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, then we perform a two-step impairment test to identify potential impairment and\nmeasures the amount of impairment we will recognize, if any.\nLong-lived Assets \nOur property and equipment, network under construction, intangible assets and equity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for\npossible impairment, impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long-lived assets to management’s probability weighted estimate of\nthe future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets or asset group. In the event an impairment exists, a loss is recognized based on\nthe amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset group.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be\nimpaired. The Company operates as one reporting unit. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first perform an optional qualitative\nassessment. If the Company determines it is not more likely than not the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, then no further analysis is\nnecessary. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative\nimpairment test will be performed. Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the Company’s reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the\nCompany will recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess but limited to the total amount of goodwill.\nWarrants\nPrivate Placement Warrants are classified as non-current liabilities and reported at fair value at each reporting period. The fair value of the Private\nPlacement Warrants is accounted for using the Monte-Carlo simulation analysis. The Monte-Carlo simulation analysis requires us to make certain assumptions,\nincluding the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and the dividend yield. The expected dividend rate of zero is based on the fact that we have not\nhistorically paid and do not expect to pay a dividend on our common stock. The risk free rate was based on U.S. Treasury yields for securities with similar\nterms. Volatility was calculated based on the trading prices for a group of comparable public companies.\n43"

      "text": "Stock-Based Compensation\nWe estimate the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. We amortize the fair value of awards\nexpected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the period from the grant date to the end of the\nvesting period. The determination of the fair value of our stock option awards is based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, our common stock\nprice, risk-free rate, expected stock price volatility over the expected life of awards, dividend yield and, award’s expected term. The assumptions used to\ndetermine the fair value of the stock options represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of\nmanagement’s judgment. Additionally, we account for forfeitures for stock-based awards as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, “Income Taxes,” deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax\nconsequences attributable to net operating losses, tax credits, and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and\nliabilities and their respective tax bases, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Our income tax expense/benefit, deferred tax assets and\ntax receivable liability reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes. Significant judgments and estimates are required in\ndetermining the consolidated income tax expense/benefits, deferred tax assets and tax receivable agreement liability. In evaluating our ability to recover our\ndeferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income and results of recent operations.\nEstimating future taxable income is inherently uncertain, requires judgment and is consistent with estimates we are using to manage our business. If we\ndetermine in the future that we will not be able to fully utilize all or part of the deferred tax assets, we would record a valuation allowance through earnings in\nthe period the determination was made.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards\nFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any,\nrefer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nSection 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting\nstandards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can\nchoose not to take advantage of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, and any such\nelection to not take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. Spartacus previously elected to avail itself of the extended transition period, and\nfollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, we became an emerging growth company (for the period described in the immediately succeeding\nparagraph) and will continue to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period emerging growth company status permits. During the extended\ntransition period, it may be difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that complies with\npublic company effective dates for accounting standard updates because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2025, (b) the last date of our fiscal year in which\nwe have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, (c) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the rules of the SEC or\n(d) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the previous three years.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities of $55.4 million as of December 31, 2022, which are held for working capital\npurposes. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and investments in marketable securities, which consisted of\nmoney market funds and U.S. Government Agency Bonds. The fair values of our investments in U.S. Government Agency Bonds will generally fluctuate with\nmovements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Due to the short-term\nnature of these instruments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value due to changes in interest rates. The effect of a\nhypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n44"

Management believes the financial\ninstitutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to cash and cash\nequivalents. In addition, we seek to minimize our exposure to banking risk by limiting the amount of uninsured deposits and investing our excess cash in U.S.\ngovernment and government agency bonds, and money market funds.\nEffects of Inflation and Supply Chain\nWhile inflation and supply chain challenges may impact our revenue and cost of services, we believe the effects of inflation and supply chain challenges\non our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant to date. However, there can be no assurance that our results of operations and\nfinancial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation or supply chain challenges in the future.\nItem 8.

Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange\nAct) were effective as of December 31, 2022.\nManagement Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting; Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)\nof the Exchange Act. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of our  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of\nDecember 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of internal controls from the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm due to a transition period established by the rules of the SEC as a result of the Company’s status as an emerging growth company.\n45"

(the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive loss, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period\nended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nAdoption of ASU No. 2016-02\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2022 due to the adoption of\nAccounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the related amendments.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and\nare required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor\nwere we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nAccordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2012.\nTysons, Virginia\nMarch 30, 2023\nF-2"

      "text": "NEXTNAV INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Organization\nNextNav Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, (collectively “NextNav” or the “Company”) delivers next generation positioning, navigation and timing\n(“PNT”) solutions through network-based solutions, including the Pinnacle system. The Pinnacle system provides “floor-level” altitude service to any device\nwith a barometric pressure sensor, including most off-the-shelf Android and iOS smartphones. The TerraPoiNT system is a terrestrial-based, encrypted network\ndesigned to overcome the limitations inherent in the space-based nature of GPS through a network of specialized wide area location transmitters that broadcasts\nan encrypted PNT signal on a licensed 900 MHz spectrum.\n \nSince its inception, NextNav has incurred recurring losses and generated negative cash flows from operations and has primarily relied upon debt and\nequity financings to fund its cash requirements. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred net losses of $40.1 million and\n$144.7 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $37.1 million and $47.9 million,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was $55.4 million and no third-party debt was outstanding. The\nCompany’s primary use of cash is to fund operations as NextNav continues to grow. The Company expects to incur additional losses and higher operating\nexpenses for the foreseeable future, specifically as NextNav invests in ongoing research and development and the expansion of the TerraPoiNT network. \nManagement has the intent and ability to manage liquidity through the timing and extent of research and development spend, as well as other discretionary\noperating expenses. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 30, 2023, will be sufficient to meet its\nworking capital and capital expenditure needs, including all contractual commitments, for the next 12 months. The Company expects to meet longer term\nexpected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash flows from operations and issuance of equity securities or debt offerings.\nHowever, this determination is based upon internal projections of operating cash flows and is subject to changes in market and business conditions. The\nCompany’s ability to obtain debt financing and/or issue equity securities on acceptable terms, or at all, will depend on, among other things, its financial\nperformance and credit ratings, general economic factors, including inflation and then-current interest rates, the condition of the credit and capital markets and\nother events, some of which may be beyond the Company’s control. \nOn October 28, 2021, the Company consummated a business combination pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 9,\n2021, by and among the Company, Spartacus Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Spartacus”), NextNav Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited\nliability company (“Holdings”) and the other parties thereto (the “Business Combination”). As a result of the Business Combination, the Company changed its\nname from Spartacus Acquisition Shelf Corp. to NextNav Inc., and certain blocker entities formed by Holdings' equity holders, Holdings and the various\noperating subsidiaries of Holdings became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, with the equity holders of each of such blocker entities and Holdings and\nSpartacus’ stockholders becoming stockholders in NextNav.\nWhile the legal acquirer in the Business Combination is Spartacus, for financial accounting and reporting purposes under accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), Holdings is deemed to be the accounting acquirer, with the Business Combination being accounted for as a\n“reverse recapitalization.” A reverse recapitalization does not result in a new basis of accounting. Accordingly, the reverse recapitalization was treated as the\nequivalent of Holdings issuing stock for the net assets of Spartacus, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Spartacus are stated at historical costs,\nwith no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.\n \n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\n \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All intercompany transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\n \nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period and\naccompanying notes. These estimates include those related to the useful lives and recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets (including goodwill),\nvaluation of common stock warrants, income taxes and equity-based compensation, among others. NextNav bases estimates on historical experience,\nanticipated results and various other assumptions, including assumptions of future events, it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of\nwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses, that are not readily apparent from other\nsources. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.\nF-7"

      "text": "NEXTNAV INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash in banks and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased. The\ncombined account balances held on deposit at each institution typically exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance coverage and, as a\nresult, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. The Company seeks to reduce this risk by\nmaintaining such deposits with high quality financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy. Further, the Company seeks to minimize its\nexposure to banking risk by limiting the amount of uninsured deposits and investing its excess cash in U.S. government and government agency bonds, and\nmoney market funds.\nThe Company invests excess cash primarily in U.S. government and government agency bonds, and money market funds. The Company classifies all\nmarketable securities that have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents, and those that have stated maturities of\nover three months as short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company determines the appropriate classification of investments in\nmarketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. The Company’s marketable securities are classified as\ntrading and are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, including unrealized, recognized in interest income (expense). \nEquity Method Investment \nThe Company reports its investments in unconsolidated entities, over whose operating and financial policies the Company has the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence, but not control, under the equity method of accounting. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment\nincludes considering key factors such as ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material\nintercompany transactions.\n \nThe initial carrying value of equity method investment is based on the amount paid to purchase the interest in the investee entity. Subsequently, the\ninvestment is increased or decreased by the Company’s proportionate share in the investee’s earnings or losses and decreased by cash distributions from the\ninvestee. The Company eliminates from its financial results all significant intercompany transactions to the extent of its ownership interest, including the\nintercompany portion of transactions with equity method investee. The Company’s share of the investee’s income or loss is recorded on a one quarter lag.  \n \nThe Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the\ninvestment may not be recoverable. If the Company determines a decline in the fair value of an equity method investment below its carrying value is other-than-\ntemporary, an impairment is recorded. Determining fair value involves significant judgment. The Company’s estimates consider alternative evidence including,\nbut not limited to, general economic conditions and other relevant factors. The Company did not recognize any impairment losses for its equity method\ninvestments for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nLeases\nNextNav leases office space under a non-cancellable lease as well as site leases for towers and shelters under operating leases related to its network under\nconstruction. Site leases are entered into throughout the United States under which NextNav receives the rights to install equipment used to transmit its services\nover its licensed spectrum. The Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease based on assessment of the terms\nand conditions of the contract. The Company classifies leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. The Company\nhas elected not to recognize lease assets and liabilities for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of twelve months or less.\nThe Company’s leases may include options to extend or terminate the lease. The option to renew may be automatic, at the option of NextNav or mutually\nagreed to between the landlord and NextNav. Lease terms include the non-cancellable term and periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is\nreasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\nF-8"

Payments under the lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease\ncomponents primarily include payments for utilities and maintenance. The Company combines fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments\nand accounts for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of the Company’s lease assets and liabilities. Certain lease agreements\ncontain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These amounts include payments for common\narea maintenance. \n \nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to\ndetermine the present value of the future lease payments is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in the Company’s\nleases is not readily determinable. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar\nterms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Lease assets are reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs\nfrom executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from “Other current assets” upon lease commencement.\n \nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning January 1, 2022. Operating lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Monthly rent expense includes any site related utility payments or other fees such as administrative or\nup-front fees contained in the lease agreements that are determinable upon execution of the lease agreement."

NextNav has not capitalized development costs for software to be sold, leased or marketed to date, as the software\ndevelopment process is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility. As such, these costs are expensed as incurred and\nrecognized in research and development costs in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss.\nSoftware developed for internal use, with no substantive plans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized and included in\nintangible assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation and post implementation stages of the\nproject are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized. In 2022 and 2021, the Company\ncapitalized $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of development costs related to internal use software.\nInternal use software is amortized over a 3 year useful life. Amortization of internal use software was $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets primarily includes proprietary technology and software. See Note 3 — Acquisition. \nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\nasset may be impaired. The Company operates as one reporting unit. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first perform an optional\nqualitative assessment. If the Company determines it is not more likely than not the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, then no further\nanalysis is necessary. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the\nquantitative impairment test will be performed. Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the Company’s reporting unit exceeds its fair\nvalue, the Company will recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess but limited to the total amount of goodwill. Nogoodwill impairment\nwas recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022.

If circumstances require a long-lived\nasset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long-lived assets to management’s\nprobability weighted estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group. In the event an impairment\nexists, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset group. For the years ended December 31, 2022,\nand 2021, the Company determined that no events or changes in circumstances existed that would indicate any impairment of its long-lived assets.\nF-10"

      "text": "NEXTNAV INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible assets\nNextNav holds wireless Multilateration Location and Monitoring Service (“LMS”) licenses. Certain general regulatory requirements apply to all licensed\nwireless spectrum, including, for example, certain build-out or “substantial service” requirements, which generally must be satisfied as a condition to the\nlicense. NextNav is actively engaged in either meeting such requirements currently or seeking an extension of such requirements from the Federal\nCommunications Commission (“FCC”) for each of its LMS licenses. Although licenses are issued by the FCC for only a fixed time, ten years, such licenses are\nsubject to renewal by the FCC, based on the achievement of certain milestones and a finding that such renewal would serve the public interest. Upon renewal,\nthe licenses are granted for additional ten-year periods. All of NextNav’s licenses are up for renewal at the same time. Renewal of NextNav’s licenses has\noccurred previously and at nominal cost. As a result, NextNav treats its wireless LMS spectrum licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. NextNav\nreevaluates the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful\nlife. Costs incurred to maintain the FCC licenses are recorded in operating expenses.\nNextNav assesses indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment annually as of October 1 or during the year if an event or other circumstance\nindicates that NextNav may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. In evaluating indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, NextNav\nfirst assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If NextNav\nconcludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. However, if NextNav\nconcludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, then NextNav performs a two-step impairment test to\nidentify potential impairment and measures the amount of impairment it will recognize, if any.\nBased on its qualitative assessment performed for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, NextNav concluded that it was not more likely than not\nthat the fair value of its indefinite-lived asset is less than its carrying amount, and as such, no impairment exists.\nAcquisitions\nF-11\n \nThe Company accounts for its acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price is attributed to the fair value of the assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired or\nassumed are measured separately at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price of acquisition over the fair value of the\nidentifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. The results of businesses acquired are included in the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements from the date of acquisition. \n \nWhen the Company issues stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company’s shareholders, the Company evaluates whether the awards are\nconsideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the\ncontinued employment of the acquired company’s stockholders beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are\ntreated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period. \n \nDetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the\nselection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The estimates and\nassumptions used to determine the fair values and useful lives of identified intangible assets could change due to numerous factors, including market conditions,\ntechnological developments, economic conditions, and competition. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the\nCompany may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to\ngoodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded as of the acquisition date.\nThe Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company’s\npreliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final\ndetermination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the Company’s\nconsolidated statement of operations. In connection with the determination of fair values, the Company may engage a third-party valuation specialist to assist\nwith the valuation of intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain assumed obligations."

      "text": "NEXTNAV INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenue\nNextNav derives its revenue from indoor and dense-urban positioning technology, products and services including revenue generated through technology\ndemonstration and assessment contracts with customers, support services provided to customers, sales of equipment, and licensing of proprietary technology.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when an arrangement exists, services, equipment or access to licensed technology are delivered, the transaction price is\ndetermined, the arrangement has commercial substance, payment terms are determined and collection of consideration is probable.\nThe Company sells software licenses and services through arrangements that may bundle software, equipment, and other services. When the Company\ndetermines that it has separate distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates the bundled contract price among the various performance obligations\nbased on each deliverable’s stand-alone selling price. If the stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the amount to be\nallocated for each performance obligation based on observable market transactions. When the Company determines the performance obligations are not distinct,\nthe Company recognizes revenue on a combined basis as the obligation is satisfied. To the extent the Company’s contracts include variable consideration, the\ntransaction price includes both fixed and variable consideration. The variable consideration contained within the Company’s contracts with customers may\ninclude discounts, credits and other similar items. When a contract includes variable consideration, the Company evaluates the estimate of the variable\nconsideration to determine whether the estimate needs to be constrained; therefore, the Company includes the variable consideration in the transaction price\nonly to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated\nwith the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. \nNextNav recognizes equipment sales and the related costs when control of the equipment passes to the customer, typically upon shipment. The Company\nhas made an accounting policy election to account for shipping activities, consisting of direct costs to ship products performed after the control of a product has\nbeen transferred to the customer, in cost of goods sold. Customers do not have rights of return without NextNav’s prior consent. Revenue pursuant to licensing\nagreements for NextNav’s technology represents performance obligations that are satisfied over time. NextNav recognizes revenue from initial integration\nservices and ongoing services ratably over the periods in which the services are provided; the related costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenue on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The Company bills amounts under its agreed-upon contractual terms at periodic intervals for services, upon shipment for\nequipment, or upon achievement of contractual milestones or as work progresses. Billing may occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in accounts\nreceivable. The Company may also receive payments from customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in deferred revenue. Additionally, the Company\nhad performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial\nstatements. \nThe following table presents the Company’s revenue disaggregated by category and source:\n \nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n \n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n \n \n \n(in thousands)\n \nCommercial\n  $\n3,499    $\n400 \nGovernment contracts\n   \n32     \n303 \nEquipment sales\n   \n395     \n37 \nOther\n   \n—     \n23 \nTotal revenue\n  $\n3,926    $\n763 \nF-12\nNon-controlling Interests \n \nThe non-controlling interest in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for year ended December 31, 2022 represents the warrants for Nestwave, \nSAS (“Nestwave”) shares that were owned by the selling shareholders.

      "text": "NEXTNAV INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in recognizing certain\nincome, expense and credit items for financial reporting purposes and tax reporting purposes. Such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the difference\nbetween the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted\nstatutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. Excess tax benefits and tax\ndeficiencies are recognized in the income tax provision in the period in which they occur.\nThe Company records a valuation allowance when it determines, based on available positive and negative evidence, that it is more-likely-than-not that\nsome portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company determines the realizability of its deferred tax assets primarily based on the\nreversal of existing taxable temporary differences and projections of future taxable income (exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards). In\nevaluating such projections, the Company considers its history of profitability, the competitive environment, and general economic conditions. In addition, the\nCompany considers the time frame over which it would take to utilize the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration.\nFor certain tax positions, the Company uses a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken. Tax positions that\nmeet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefits determined on a cumulative probability basis, which are\nmore-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to\nincome tax matters in income tax expense.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of NextNav’s foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the\nexchange rate in effect at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. Operating accounts are translated at an average rate of exchange for the respective accounting\nperiods. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are reported as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss. Transaction gains and losses reflected in the functional currencies are charged to income or expense at the time of the\ntransaction.\nNet transaction gains (losses) from foreign currency contracts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss were immaterial for the\nfiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The only component of other comprehensive loss is currency translation adjustments for all periods presented.\nNo income tax expense was allocated to the currency translation adjustments.\nSegments\nNextNav operates as one operating segment. NextNav’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information\npresented on an entity-wide basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. Substantially all long-\nlived tangible assets are located in the United States, except for the acquired intangible assets. See Note 3— Acquisition.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers accounted for 83% and 10% of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, three\ncustomers accounted for 40%, 31%, and 19% of total revenue.\nF-15"

      "text": "NEXTNAV INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAdopted Accounting Pronouncements \nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU\n2016-02”), which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for those leases classified as operating leases\nunder current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset\nrepresenting its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The new guidance also requires qualitative and\nquantitative disclosures related to the nature, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In July 2018, the FASB amended the new lease standard\nwhich, among other changes, allows a company to elect to adopt ASU 2016-02 using a transition option whereby a cumulative effect adjustment is recorded to\nthe opening balance of its retained earnings on the adoption date. The Company has elected to use this modified retrospective transition option and recorded a\ncumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.5 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 2022. The Company also elected certain practical expedients\npermitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to\ndetermine if they contain leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities of $13.4 million\nand $10.5 million, respectively. The standard did not have a significant effect on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss and Cash\nFlows. See Note 5 for additional lease disclosures.\n \nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-02, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) (“ASU 2019-12”), which is intended to\nimprove consistency and simplify several areas of existing guidance. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles related to the approach\nfor intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis\ndifferences. ASU 2019-12 is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2022. The Company adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2022. The\nadoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. \nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU  2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from\nContracts with Customers (“ASU 2021-08”). The ASU requires an acquiring entity to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in\na business combination in accordance with Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, rather than at fair value. The Company early adopted this ASU\nin the fourth quarter of 2022 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. \nRecent Accounting Developments Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires that an entity\nmeasure and recognize expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost and replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S.\nGAAP with a methodology that requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate credit losses. The guidance also modifies the impairment\nmodel for available-for-sale debt securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023. The Company is continuing to\nassess the potential impacts of ASU 2016-13 on its financial statements and expects the impact to be immaterial.\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect\non the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nF-16"

The pro forma\nfinancial information, assuming the acquisition had taken place on January 1, 2021, as well as the revenue and earnings generated during the period after the\nacquisition date, were not material for separate disclosure and, accordingly, have not been presented. \n \nThe fair value measurements of the identified intangible assets on acquisition date were based primarily on significant unobservable inputs and thus\nrepresent a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements. The fair values of technology and software were determined using the\nreplacement cost method under the cost approach. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired\nwas recognized as goodwill and is attributable to a number of business factors, including but not limited to, the acquired workforce and expanded market\nopportunities when integrating Nestwave’s software and technology with the Company’s other offerings. Goodwill generated from the acquisition is not\ndeductible for tax purposes.\n \n          As of the acquisition date, the purchase price assigned to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is summarized as follows. The purchase price\nallocation is preliminary and subject to revision as additional information about deferred taxes becomes available. Although final determination may result in\ndifferent asset and liability fair values, it is not expected that such differences will be material to understanding the impact of the transaction on the financial\nresults of the Company.\n(in thousands)\nCash acquired \n $\n433  \nOther current assets \n   \n436  \nProperty and equipment \n   \n69  \nOther noncurrent assets \n   \n50  \nIntangible assets:\n   \n    \nTechnology \n   \n541  \nSoftware  \n \n5,128  \nGoodwill \n   \n16,317  \nTotal assets acquired \n $\n22,974  \nCurrent liabilities\n760\nNoncurrent liabilities\n501\nNet assets acquired \n$\n21,713\nThe estimated useful lives of the identified finite-lived intangible assets from the acquisition is 12 years for technology and software.\nF-17"

Fair Value\nNextNav uses observable and unobservable inputs to determine the value of its assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. Observable inputs reflect\nmarket data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used to\nmeasure fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, where applicable, is as follows:\n- Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\n- Level 3 — No observable pricing inputs in the market\nAssets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. NextNav’s\nassessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities\nbeing measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. NextNav effectuates transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, as of the\ndate of the actual circumstance that caused the transfer.\nThe following table presents the Company’s fair value hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n \n \nLevel 1\n   \nLevel 2\n   \nLevel 3\n   \nTotal\n \n \n \n(in thousands)\n \nDecember 31, 2022\n \n    \n    \n    \n  \nCash and Cash Equivalents - Money Market Funds\n$\n95\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n95\nCash and Cash Equivalents - U.S. Government Agency Bonds\n—\n36,509\n—\n36,509\nShort term investments - U.S. Government Agency Bonds\n—\n8,216\n—\n8,216\nWarrants\n   \n—     \n—   \n4,200   \n4,200 \n    \n      \n      \n      \n  \nDecember 31, 2021\n   \n      \n      \n      \n  \nWarrants\n  $ \n—    $ \n—    $\n28,875    $\n28,875 \nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued expenses, amounts included in other current assets, and current liabilities that\nmeet the definition of a financial instrument, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.\nAssets, liabilities, and equity instruments that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include fixed assets and intangible assets. The Company\nrecognizes these items at fair value when they are considered to be impaired or upon initial recognition. The fair value of these assets and liabilities are\ndetermined with valuation techniques using the best information available and may include quoted market prices, market comparables and discounted cash flow\nmodels.\nLevel 3 Liabilities\nThe Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist with the fair value analysis of the warrants. The analysis used commonly accepted valuation\nmethodologies and best practices to determine the fair value of the equity, in accordance with fair value standards and U.S. GAAP. For the Private Placement\nWarrants that were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, NextNav used a Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table shows the assumptions\nused in each respective model:\nF-23"

As of December 31, 2021, there were Exchanged Options to purchase 1,968,861 shares of common stock of\nNextNav. All stock unit activity was retroactively restated to reflect the Exchanged Options.\nUpon consummation of the Business Combination and adoption of the Omnibus Plan (as defined below), the Profit Interests and B-4s converted and were\nretroactively restated in the same manner as the Exchanged Options except that the Profit Interests and B-4s were exchanged for NextNav restricted stock units.\nAll terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) under the Incentive Plan remained the same following the Business Combination.\nNextNav 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nIn October 2021, the Company adopted the NextNav 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Plan”). The Omnibus Plan became effective upon\nconsummation of the Business Combination and succeeds the Incentive Plan. Upon adoption of the Omnibus Plan, a total of 12,818,902 shares were approved\nto be issued as stock options and restricted stock awards under the Omnibus Plan. In addition, the Omnibus Plan provides for annual increases in the number of\nshares available for issuance thereunder on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the 2022 fiscal year, equal to the lesser of: (i) 5,636,259 shares; or (ii)\na lesser number of shares as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. The vesting period of awards granted under the Omnibus Plan is determined by\nthe Board of Directors, although, for service-based awards vesting has historically been generally ratably over a four-year period.

The expected term of option awards is calculated as the midpoint between the\nvesting date and the end of the contractual term. Historical data is not sufficient to reasonably estimate the expected term of new grants.

Rather, its members are subject to income taxations\nbased on the member’s portion of Holdings’ income or loss. Accordingly, in addition to the Company’s operating activities, the Company will also incur income\ntaxes on its allocable share of any net taxable income of Holdings.\nHoldings’ non-operating subsidiary, CommLabs, Inc., is taxed as a U.S. corporation. Holdings, through its subsidiaries, also owns an Indian subsidiary,\nCommlabs Technology Centre Pvt. Ltd. (“Commlabs India”), which is taxed as a corporation in India and, as such, is subject to Indian entity-level income tax.\nAdditionally in October of 2022, the Company acquired Nestwave, which is taxed as a corporation in France and as such is subject to French entity-level\nincome tax. \nU.S. and international components of (loss) income before income taxes were comprised of the following for the periods indicated: \n \nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n \n \n(in thousands)\n \nUnited States\n  $\n(40,012)   $\n(144,811)\nForeign\n   \n(132)    \n197 \nTotal\n  $\n(40,144)   $\n(144,614)\nThe (benefit from) provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the periods indicated:\n \nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n \n \n(in thousands)\n \nBenefit (Provision) for income taxes:\n \n    \n  \nCurrent:\n \n    \n  \nFederal\n  $\n—    $\n— \nState\n   \n(1)    \n— \nForeign\n   \n(90)    \n(52)\nTotal current\n  $\n(91)   $\n(52)\nDeferred:\n   \n      \n  \nFederal\n   \n—     \n— \nState\n   \n—     \n— \nForeign\n   \n119    \n— \nTotal deferred\n  $\n119   $\n— \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes:\n  $\n28   $\n(52)\nF-29"

The\nCompany has an accumulated deficit with respect to Nestwave. Because all of these earnings generated by Commlabs have previously been subject to the one-\ntime transition tax on foreign earnings required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, any additional taxes due with respect to such earnings or the excess of the\namount for financial reporting over the tax basis of the Company’s foreign investments would generally be limited to foreign and state taxes. The Company\nintends, however, to indefinitely reinvest these earnings and expects future U.S. cash generation to be sufficient to meet future U.S. cash needs. \nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting\npurposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

      "text": "NEXTNAV INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of\nthe existing deferred tax assets (“DTA”). A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year\nperiod ended December 31, 2021. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company’s projections for future\ngrowth.\nOn the basis of this evaluation, as of December 31, 2022, a valuation allowance of $88.9 million has been recorded because management has concluded\nthat it is more likely than not that such DTA will ultimately not be realized. The amount of the DTA considered realizable, however, could be adjusted in future\nyears if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative\nlosses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company did not have any unrecognized income tax benefits. \nThe Company has U.S. income tax net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $76.0 million and $36.4 million as of December 31, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively. $5.0 million of the NOL’s are expected to expire beginning in 2027 while the remaining $71.0 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The\nCompany’s NOLs in the U.S. may be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). NOLs are limited when there is a significant ownership\nchange as defined by the IRC Section 382. At this time, the Company expects that none of its federal NOLs will expire unutilized as a result of a limitation\nunder Section 382.\nThe Company had foreign NOLs as of December 31, 2022 of $5.8 million attributable to Nestwave and an immaterial amount of state NOLs.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States, various states within the United States, India, and France. Each jurisdiction has its own statute of\nlimitations for making assessment of additional tax liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, due to its net operating losses, all the Company’s tax years remained\nopen for U.S. Federal and state income tax purposes. India has a 4-year statute of limitations, so years prior to 2017 are closed.  France has a statute of\nlimitation tax expires 3 years following the year that triggered the liability.  \n \n14. Retirement Plan\nNextNav sponsors a defined contribution benefit plan to provide retirement benefits for its employees. Participants may make voluntary contributions not\nto exceed maximum allowable contribution amounts. NextNav made discretionary contributions and matching contributions, totaling $0.3 million for each of\nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n15. Subsequent Events\nThe Company has completed an evaluation of all subsequent events through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to ensure that these financial\nstatements include appropriate disclosure of events both recognized in the financial statements and events which occurred but were not recognized in the\nfinancial statements. The Company has concluded that no subsequent event has occurred that require disclosure."
