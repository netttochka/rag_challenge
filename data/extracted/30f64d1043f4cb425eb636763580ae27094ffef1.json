      "text": "1-800-FLOWERS.COM, INC. \nLETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS \n \nDear Fellow Shareholders, \nAs the world began to transition to a post-COVID environment through fiscal 2022, we along with many \nother businesses faced new and unprecedented challenges in this ever-changing landscape, including a \nseismic shift in consumer behavior as they responded to significant inflation that impacted both their \ndiscretionary and non-discretionary purchases.  Nonetheless, as a result of the strategic investments \nthat we have made over the last several years, our company grew revenues by 4 percent in fiscal 2022, \nwhich was on top of the more than 40 percent growth that we experienced in the prior year.   \nOur revenue growth demonstrates the scalability of our e-commerce platform and our ability to retain \nand build on the gains we achieved over the past two years. Most notably, our revenue is now more \nthan 75 percent higher than it was during the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 and we have essentially \ndoubled the size of our company over the past several years. This reflects the healthy growth that we \nhave seen in our customer file, our expanded product offerings and our ever-increasing focus on \ncustomer engagement through a combination of highly relevant content and unique experiences. \nWhile we were able to grow our customer base and revenue in fiscal 2022 incremental to the significant \ngrowth we experienced in the prior year, our profits were pressured by the significant macro inflationary \nheadwinds on our cost structure.  We generated $99 million of adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year as our \nrevenue growth was offset by the significant increase in product and operating costs. In the years ahead, \nwe are confident that our bottom-line performance will reflect the significant top line growth we have \nexperienced.  Our initiatives to improve operational efficiencies through automation and logistics \noptimization, as well as a reversion to the mean of some of our cost structure, such as lower shipping \ncontainer and fuel costs, are already beginning to be realized.   \nAs we look ahead, it’s just as important to take a moment and reflect on some of the significant changes \nthat have occurred with our business and the economy over the last several years and determine which \nwe expect to be more transitory vs permanent in nature.  \nOur business and the broader economy have gone through several significant stages over the past few \nyears. Prior to the pandemic, we made the decision to increase our investments in marketing, \nparticularly in our flagship 1-800-Flowers and Harry & David brands, to accelerate revenue growth. This \neffort enabled us to accelerate our revenue growth rate from the low single-digit range in fiscal 2018 to \ndouble-digits during the latter half of fiscal 2020.  Additionally, we accelerated the growth of our most \nvaluable asset, our customer file and our Celebrations Passport loyalty program during this period.  \nWith the advent of the COVID pandemic in the Spring of 2020 and the introduction of lockdowns, social \ndistancing and the shift to remote work, we experienced an unprecedented surge in demand as \ncustomers looked to stay connected with the important people in their lives.  The resourcefulness and \nunwavering commitment of our team, coupled with the investments that we made in our business \nplatform positioned us well to respond to this extraordinary environment.  This surge not only benefited \nour top and bottom-line results, but most importantly, grew our customer file to record levels."

      "text": "As the pandemic began to wane, we once again saw dramatic and sudden shifts in the macro economy \nand consumer behavior.  On one hand, we witnessed increased travel, dining out, group celebrations, \nalong with other pent-up activities.  And on the other, we saw rapidly increasing inflation that affected \ncustomer demand, unprecedented disruptions in the global supply chain, geopolitical turmoil, and an \nextremely tight labor market – all of which increased prices on everything from labor to shipping to \ncommodities.  Though inflationary pressures remain, we are beginning to see early improvements in \ncertain areas, including fuel prices that are off their peak, a decline in ocean freight costs, and a \nstabilization of labor rates. \nWhile we are encouraged by these positive trends, our company has taken proactive steps to address \nand further mitigate these issues.  We have utilized our balance sheet to invest in our operating \nplatform and continue to build for the future, which includes: \n• \nautomating our warehouse and distribution facilities to reduce our exposure to escalating labor \ncosts,  \n• \nbuying and building inventories early to get ahead of the continuing global supply chain issues, \nand \n• \nimplementing logistics optimization programs to enhance our outbound shipping operations and \nmanage rising rates. \nThese initiatives, coupled with our strategic pricing programs across our family of brands, are expected \nto help us mitigate rising costs and gradually improve our gross margins and bottom-line results \nbeginning in the latter half of fiscal 2023.  \nBeyond these initiatives, our customers have strongly responded to our newest bundled product \nofferings and latest engagement initiatives.  Offering Harry & David wine with Shari’s Berries confections \nand 1-800-Flowers bouquets continues to be a big hit and increases our average order value.  And to \ncreate a true community for our customers, we amplified our interactive engagement through a broad \nrange of non-transactional experiences and content, including our Celebrations Pulse emails, \nCelebrations Chatter podcast, interactive blogs and virtual workshops, that feature collaborative design \nand confection of everything from floral arrangements to charcuterie boards. \nThese efforts, coupled with our Connections Communities social media platform and a growing number \nof influencer campaigns, enabled us to achieve more than 127 million non-transactional consumer \nengagements, well past our goal for the year. This is significant as customers who engage with our \ncontent convert significantly higher than those who do not. A combination of these initiatives and \ncontinued product expansion enabled us to attract more than 5 million new customers this  \nfiscal year. And our existing active customer base grew by 5.3 percent. \nIn addition, our Celebrations Passport loyalty program continued to grow at a double-digit rate during \nthe fiscal year with membership exceeding 1.4 million. This customer cohort along with those who \npurchase across our categories or brands represent our best customers.  We believe the significant size \nand robust growth of our customer file and our Celebrations Passport loyalty program, along with our \nexpanded product offerings positions us well to inspire our customers to give more, connect more, and \nbuild more and better relationships, which in turn will continue to grow our business over the long-\nterm. \nIn this current environment where the only certainty has been uncertainty, we remain focused on \nexecuting on our strategic initiatives to grow our customer base and increase revenue from our existing \ncustomer base, while simultaneously increasing operating efficiencies through automation and logistics."

The Company’s principal offices are located at Two Jericho Plaza, Suite 200, Jericho, NY 11753 and its \ntelephone number at that location is (516) 237-6000. \n  \nNarrative Description of Business \n  \nThe Origins of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM \n  \nThe Company’s operations began in 1976 when James F. McCann, the Company’s founder and current Executive Chairman of the \nBoard of Directors, acquired a single retail florist in New York City, which he subsequently expanded to a 14-store chain. Thereafter, \nthe Company modified its business strategy to take advantage of the rapid emergence of toll-free calling. The Company acquired the \nright to use the toll-free telephone number 1-800-FLOWERS, adopted it as its corporate identity and began to aggressively build a \nnational brand around it. \n  \nThe Company’s Strategy \n  \n1-800-FLOWERS.COM’s objective is to be the leading authority on thoughtful gifting, to serve an expanding range of our customers’ \ncelebratory needs, thereby helping our customers express themselves and connect with the important people in their lives. The Company \nwill continue to build on the trusted relationships with our customers by providing them with ease of access, tasteful and appropriate \ngifts, and superior service. By engaging with our customers, we help to inspire more human expression and connection – sentiments \nthat are more important than ever in the current environment. \n  \nThe Company believes that 1-800-FLOWERS.COM is one of the most recognized brands in the floral and gift industry. The strength \nof its brand has enabled the Company to extend its product offerings beyond the floral category into complementary products, which \ninclude gourmet popcorn, cookies and related baked and snack food products, premium chocolate and confections, wine gifts, gourmet \ngift baskets, fruit bouquet arrangements, and gift-quality fruit baskets, dipped berries, as well as steaks, chops and prepared meals. Most \nrecently, on August 3, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of PersonalizationMall.com LLC (\"PersonalizationMall\"), adding \nan extensive selection of personalized products to our offerings, and on October 27, 2021, acquired Vital Choice Seafood LLC (“Vital \nChoice”), a purveyor of wild-caught seafood and sustainably farmed shellfish, pastured proteins, and organic foods. On December 31, \n2021, the Company acquired Alice’s Table® to supplement our product portfolio with lifestyle offerings, including fully digital \nlivestreaming floral, culinary and other experiences to guests across the country. This extended line of gift offerings helps our customers \nwith all of their celebratory occasions, and will enable the Company to increase the purchase frequency and average order value for \nexisting customers who have come to trust the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brand, as well as continue to attract new customers. The \nCompany’s consolidated customer database and multi-brand website is designed to dynamically engage our customers, further \nenhancing the Company’s position as a leading, one-stop destination for all of our customers’ gifting and celebratory needs. \n  \nAs part of the Company’s continuing effort to serve the thoughtful gifting needs of our customers, and leverage its business platform, \nthe Company continues to execute its vision to build a “Celebratory Ecosystem”, including a collection of premium gifting brands, and \nan increasing suite of products and services designed to help our customers deliver smiles to the important people in their lives. \n  \nThe platform that the Company has built allows it to expand rapidly into new product categories using a “marketplace” concept, \nproviding its customers with a wider selection of solutions to help them express, connect and celebrate for all occasions and recipients \n– including themselves. The Company intends to accomplish this through organic development, and where appropriate, through \nacquisition of complementary businesses.

For example, the Company \nwas featured in an episode of the CBS TV hit reality show Undercover Boss, providing a great opportunity for its brands to receive \nbroad national exposure, while also being included in the Walk of Shame movie. Our “Summer of a Million Smiles” charitable efforts \ndeliver smiles to local charities, communities and service initiatives across the country. We also sponsor our enterprise-wide “Gifts That \nGive Back” collection in support of our Smiles Farms philanthropic initiative, which is focused on creating meaningful employment \nopportunities for individuals with developmental disabilities – a program that we are proud to have founded. And, in what can be \nconsidered one of the best compliments a brand can receive, 1-800-Flowers.com’s place in America’s cultural fabric was confirmed \nwhen the brand was featured in a great spoof on Mother’s Day family relations during a Saturday Night Live skit. \n  \nTechnology Infrastructure \n  \nThe Company believes it has been and continues to be a leader in implementing new technologies to give its customers the best possible \nshopping experience, whether online or over the telephone. Orders are fed directly from the Company’s secure websites, or with the \nassistance of a gift advisor, into our internally developed transaction processing system, which captures the required customer and \nrecipient information. The system then routes the order to the appropriate distribution center or, for florist fulfilled or drop-shipped \nitems, selects a florist or vendor to fulfill the customer's order and electronically refers the necessary information using BloomLink, the \nCompany’s proprietary Internet-based system. The Company’s gift advisors have electronic access to this system, enabling them to \nassist in order fulfillment and subsequently track other customer and/or order information. \n  \nFulfillment and Manufacturing Operations \n  \nThe Company’s customers primarily place their orders either online or over the telephone. The Company’s hybrid fulfillment system, \nwhich enables the Company to offer same-day, next-day and any-day delivery, combines the use of BloomNet (comprised of \nindependent florists operating retail flower shops and franchise florist shops) with Company-owned distribution centers and vendors \nwho ship directly to the Company’s customers. While providing a significant competitive advantage in terms of delivery options, the \nCompany’s fulfillment system also has the added benefit of reducing the Company’s capital investments in inventory and infrastructure. \nThe Company’s products are backed by a 100% satisfaction guarantee, and the Company’s business is not dependent on any single \nthird-party supplier. \n  \nFulfillment and manufacturing of products is as follows: \n  \nFlowers and Plants. A majority of the Company’s floral orders are fulfilled by one of the Company’s BloomNet members, allowing \nthe Company to deliver its floral and fruit bouquet products on a same-day or next-day basis to ensure freshness and to meet its \ncustomers’ need for immediate gifting. In addition to these florist designed products, the Company also offers fresh cut floral \narrangements in a wide assortment of combinations, themes and designer bouquets and collections through its direct ship products \nprogram, fresh from the farm. \n  \nPersonalized Gifts. Through its acquisition of PersonalizationMall, the Company offers a broad selection of personalized gifts and \nkeepsakes which are manufactured utilizing same-day/next-day capabilities, and distributed from its Bolingbrook, IL facility. \n  \nGourmet Foods & Gift Baskets. The Company offers a wide array of premium brand signature baked products, confections, gift baskets, \ngourmet popcorn, dipped berries, giftable fruit towers and baskets, and \"good for you\" products through its Gourmet Foods & Gift \nBaskets’ brands. The Company’s Cheryl’s cookies and baked gifts are manufactured in its baking facility in Westerville, Ohio, while \nThe Popcorn Factory and Moose Munch premium snack products are popped in Medford, Oregon and Lake Forest, Illinois. Harry & \nDavid products are grown and manufactured primarily from its facilities in Medford, Oregon, supplemented by specialty products that \nare sourced across the U.S. and the world. Gift basket confection and fulfillment for both wholesale and 1-800-Baskets.com is handled \nby DesignPac, located in Melrose Park, Illinois. Our products are distributed from a combination of Company owned and leased \ndistribution facilities, across the country, which are shared by our brands in order to reduce both transit time to customer and overall \nlogistics costs. Dipped berries and other specialty treats for our Shari’s Berries brand are manufactured and fulfilled through our network \nof dropship vendors. \n  \n7"

      "text": "Table of Contents \n  \nSources and Availability of Raw Materials \n  \nThe Company’s raw materials consist of ingredients for manufactured products (including various commodities such as sugar, flour, \ncacao, eggs, fruit and flowers), packaging supplies, and other supplies used in the manufacturing and transportation processes (such as \nfuel, natural gas and derivative products). Except for certain crops which are grown in our Harry & David orchards, all of the raw \nmaterials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source suppliers. The prices we pay, and the \navailability of these materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not \npass the change to our customers. We utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers. Our suppliers are \nsubject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other \napplicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume we need to meet customer demand, to receive those \nmaterials timely through our supply chain and to produce, manufacture and distribute those products determines, in part, our ability to \ngrow the business, and the appeal of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers. \n  \nSeasonality \n  \nThe Company’s quarterly results may experience seasonal fluctuations. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business, and its \ncontinued expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through Christmas holiday season, which falls within the Company’s \nsecond fiscal quarter, generates over 40% of the Company’s annual revenues, and all of its earnings. However, with the onset of the \npandemic of the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”), our customers increasingly turned to our brands and our expanded product \nofferings to help them connect and express themselves, and our “everyday” gifting product line had experienced significantly increased \nvolume. While the continuing impacts of COVID-19, and its after effects, are difficult to predict, the Company expects that its fiscal \nsecond quarter will continue to be its largest in terms of annual revenues and earnings. Due to the number of major floral gifting \noccasions, including Mother's Day, Valentine’s Day, Easter and Administrative Professionals Week, revenues also rise during the \nCompany’s fiscal third and fourth quarters in comparison to its fiscal first quarter. During fiscal 2022, our fiscal second quarter revenues \nrepresented approximately 43% of annual revenues, while our first, third and fourth quarters generated 14%, 21%, and 22% of annual \nrevenues, respectively. \n  \nIn preparation for the Company’s second quarter holiday season, the Company significantly increases its inventories. This seasonal build \nhas traditionally been financed by cash flows from operations, supplemented by a bank line of credit, which peaks in November. The \nCompany has historically repaid all revolving bank lines of credit with cash generated from operations, prior to the end of the Company’s \nfiscal second quarter. \n  \nCompetition \n  \nThe growing popularity and convenience of e-commerce shopping has continued to give rise to established businesses on the Internet. \nIn addition to selling their products over the Internet, many of these retailers sell their products through a combination of channels by \nmaintaining a website, a toll-free phone number and physical locations. Additionally, several of these merchants offer an expanding \nvariety of products and some are attracting an increasing number of customers. Certain mass merchants have expanded their offerings \nto include competing products and may continue to do so in the future. These businesses, as well as other potential competitors, may be \nable to: \n  \n● undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands and services; \n● adopt more aggressive pricing policies; and \n● make more attractive offers to potential employees, distributors and retailers. \n  \nIn addition, the Company faces intense competition in each of its individual product categories. In the floral industry, there are various \nproviders of floral products, none of which is dominant in the industry. The Company’s competitors include: \n  \n● retail floral shops, some of which maintain toll-free telephone numbers and websites; \n● online floral retailers, as well as retailers offering substitute gift products; \n● catalog companies that offer floral products; \n● floral telemarketers and wire services; and \n● supermarkets, mass merchants and specialty retailers with floral departments. \n  \nSimilarly, the plant, gift basket and gourmet foods categories are highly competitive. Each of these categories encompasses a wide range \nof products, is highly fragmented and is served by a large number of companies, none of which is dominant. Products in these categories \nmay be purchased from a number of outlets, including mass merchants, telemarketers, retail specialty shops, online retailers and mail-\norder catalogs. \n  \n8"

Because the Company’s products and services are available over the Internet anywhere in the world, multiple jurisdictions \nmay claim that the Company is required to do business as a foreign corporation in one or more of those jurisdictions. Failure to qualify \nas a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where the Company is required to do so could subject it to taxes and penalties.

From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other statements we release to \nthe public as well as oral forward-looking statements. Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they \ndo not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as \n“anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of \nfuture operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions; the effectiveness of our \nmarketing programs; the performance of our existing products and services; our ability to attract and retain customers and expand our \ncustomer base; our ability to enter into or renew online marketing agreements; our ability to respond to competitive pressures; expenses, \nincluding shipping costs and the costs of marketing our current and future products and services; the outcome of contingencies, including \nlegal proceedings in the normal course of business; and our ability to integrate acquisitions. \n  \nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and \nassumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risk, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should known or \nunknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially \nfrom past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward looking statements. \n  \nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or \notherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q and 8-K reports to the \nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Also note we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, \nuncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we \nthink could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors as \npermitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. \n  \nMacroeconomic Conditions and Related Risk Factors \n  \nThe financial and credit markets and consumer sentiment have and will experience significant volatility, which may have an adverse \neffect on our customers’ spending patterns and in turn our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s \nbusiness and operating results are subject to economic conditions and their impact on consumer discretionary spending. Factors that \nmay negatively impact consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth, \ndeclines in asset values, and related market uncertainty; home foreclosures and reductions in home values; fluctuating interest rates and \ncredit availability; fluctuating fuel and other energy costs; fluctuating commodity prices; and general uncertainty regarding the overall \nfuture political and economic environment. Consumer spending patterns are difficult to predict and are sensitive to the general economic \nclimate, the consumer’s level of disposable income, consumer debt, and overall consumer confidence. In the recent past, such \nfactors have impacted and may continue to impact our business in a number of ways. Included among these current and potential future \nnegative impacts are reduced demand and lower prices for our products and services. Adverse economic changes could reduce consumer \nconfidence and could thereby affect our operating results. In challenging and uncertain economic environments, including the COVID-\n19 pandemic, its after effects, and the geopolitical climate, we cannot predict when macroeconomic conditions uncertainty may arise \nand whether such circumstances could impact the Company. \n  \nThe impact of the spread of COVID-19 is creating significant uncertainty for our business, financial condition and results of operations \nand for the prices of our publicly traded securities. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial \nresults will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by market, including the \nduration and scope of the pandemic, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been \ntaken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic, and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some \nof which may be more than just temporary. \n  \n11"

      "text": "Table of Contents \n  \nOur operations expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in challenging operating environments. \nCOVID-19 has spread across the globe to the countries and states in which we do business. Authorities in many of these markets have \nimplemented numerous measures to stall the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, shelter \nin place orders, and business shutdowns. These measures have impacted and will further impact us and our business partners (such as \ncustomers, employees, suppliers, franchisees, florists and other third parties with whom we do business). There is considerable \nuncertainty regarding how these measures and future measures in response to the pandemic will impact our business, including whether \nthey will result in further changes in demand for our products, further increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our \nsupply chain or increases in employee costs or otherwise), how they will further impact our supply chain and whether they will result in \nfurther reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, each or all of which can impact our \nability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices, plants, \nwarehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our business partners to do the same, may impact the \navailability of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. If a significant percentage \nof our or our business partners’ workforce is unable to work, our operations will be negatively impacted. Any sustained interruption in \nour or our business partners’ operations, distribution network or supply chain or any significant continuous shortage of raw materials or \nother supplies as a result of these measures, restrictions or disruptions can impair our ability to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our \nproducts. \n  \nCompliance with governmental measures imposed in response to COVID-19 has caused and may continue to cause us to incur additional \ncosts, and any inability to comply with such measures can subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, \nany of which can adversely affect our business. The continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and various governmental responses may \ncontinue to restrict our ability to carry on business development activities and business-related travel, and our sales activity may be \nadversely affected. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has amplified certain risks to our business, \nincluding increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, increased phishing and other cybersecurity attacks \nas cybercriminals try to exploit the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in the number of points of potential \nattack, such as laptops and mobile devices (both of which are now being used in increased numbers), to be secured, and any failure to \neffectively manage these risks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks, may adversely affect our \nbusiness. \n  \nPublic concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 impacts demand from customers, including due to customers not leaving \ntheir homes or otherwise shopping in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our customers have lower \ndiscretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. As \nwe sell a wide variety of products, the profile of the products we sell and the amount of revenue attributable to such products varies by \njurisdiction and changes in demand as a result of COVID-19 will vary in scope and timing across these markets. In addition, changes in \nconsumer purchasing and consumption patterns may result in changes in demand for our products, thereby impacting our earnings. Any \nreduced demand for our products or change in customers purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic \nuncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, resulting in an inability to pay for our \nproducts, reduced or canceled orders of our products, closing of florist or franchise locations, stores, or our business partners’ inability \nto supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes \nin our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition may also result in our recording impairment charges for our inability to \nrecover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, or prepaid expenses. In addition, economic uncertainty associated \nwith the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets, and in foreign currency exchange rates, \ncommodity prices, and interest rates, which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at \nall. Even now that the COVID-19 global pandemic is subsiding, we may experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any \neconomic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. \n  \nWhile we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity \nplans and crisis management protocols in an effort to try to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on our employees and our \nbusiness, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results \nof operations and the prices of our publicly traded securities may be adversely affected. \n  \nConsumer spending on products sold by the Company may vary with general economic conditions. If general economic conditions \ndeteriorate and the Company’s customers have less disposable income, consumers may spend less on its products and its operating \nresults may suffer.  \n  \n12"

      "text": "Table of Contents \n  \nIncreased shipping costs and supply chain disruptions may adversely affect sales of the Company’s products. Many of the Company's \nproducts are delivered to customers either directly from the manufacturer or from the Company’s fulfillment centers. The Company has \nestablished relationships with Federal Express and other common carriers for the delivery of these products. If these carriers were to \nfurther increase the prices they charge to ship the Company’s goods, and if the Company is forced to pass these costs onto its customers, \nor if carrier capacity becomes constrained, the Company’s sales could be negatively impacted. In addition, ocean container availability \nand cost, as well as port disruptions could impact the Company’s ability to deliver products on a timely basis to our customers and \nadversely affect its customer relationships, revenues and earnings. \n  \nWe are dependent on international vendors for our supply of flowers, as well as certain components and products, exposing us to \nsignificant regulatory, global economic, taxation, political instability and other risks, which could adversely impact our financial results. \n  \nThe availability and price of flowers, as well as certain components and products that we rely on to manufacture and sell our products \ncould be adversely affected by a number of factors affecting international locations, including: \n  \n● import duties and quotas; \n● agricultural limitations and restrictions to manage pests and disease; \n● changes in trading status; \n● economic uncertainties and currency fluctuations; \n● severe weather; \n● work stoppages; \n● foreign government regulations and political unrest; and \n● trade restrictions, including United States retaliation against foreign trade practices. \n  \nThe U.S. administration has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade \nagreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and \nother government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct business. As a result, there may \nbe greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade and such changes have the potential to adversely impact the \nU.S. economy, our industry and the demand for our products. In addition, it may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our \nbusiness operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes, and as a result, such changes could have a material adverse \neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n  \nIf the supply of flowers for sale becomes limited, the price of flowers could rise or flowers may be unavailable and the Company’s \nrevenues and gross margins could decline. A variety of factors affect the supply of flowers in the United States and the price of the \nCompany’s floral products. If the supply of flowers available for sale is limited due to weather conditions, farm closures, economic \nconditions, or other factors, prices for flowers could rise and as a result customer demand for the Company’s floral products may be \nreduced, causing revenues and gross margins to decline. Alternatively, the Company may not be able to obtain high quality flowers in \nan amount sufficient to meet customer demand. Even if available, flowers from alternative sources may be of lesser quality and/or may \nbe more expensive than those currently offered by the Company. \n  \nMost of the flowers sold in the United States are grown by farmers located abroad, primarily in Colombia, Ecuador and Holland, and \nthe Company expects that this will continue in the future. \n  \nThe Company's operating results may suffer due to economic, political and social unrest or disturbances. Like other American \nbusinesses, the Company is unable to predict what long-term effect acts of terrorism, war, or similar unforeseen events may have on its \nbusiness. The Company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if such events cause an economic \nslowdown in the United States, or other negative effects that cannot now be anticipated. \n  \nDiscontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, or uncertainty related to the potential for any of the \nforegoing, may adversely affect our business. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR in \n2023. In addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. The discontinuation, reform or \nreplacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets \nor cause disruption to the broader financial markets. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement \nmay negatively impact interest expense related to borrowings under our credit facilities. We may in the future pursue amendments to \nour credit facilities to provide for a transition mechanism or other reference rate in anticipation of LIBOR’s discontinuation, but we may \nnot be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendments. \n  \n13"

Our ability to maintain the increased sales we have \nexperienced since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain. This uncertainty could result in volatility of our stock price. \n  \nThe Company’s operating results may fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause financial results to be below expectations. The \nCompany’s operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. In budgeting the Company’s operating \nexpenses for the foreseeable future, the Company makes assumptions regarding revenue trends; however, some of the Company’s \noperating expenses are fixed in the short term. Sales of the Company’s products are seasonal, concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter, \ndue to the Thanksgiving and Christmas-time holidays, and the second calendar quarter, due to Mother's Day and Administrative \nProfessionals’ Week. In anticipation of increased sales activity during these periods, the Company hires a significant number of \ntemporary employees to supplement its permanent staff and the Company increases its inventory levels. If revenues during these periods \ndo not meet the Company’s expectations, it may not generate sufficient revenue to offset these increased costs and its operating results \nmay suffer. \n  \nThe Company’s quarterly operating results may significantly fluctuate and you should not rely on them as an indication of its future \nresults. The Company’s future revenues and results of operations may significantly fluctuate due to a combination of factors, many of \nwhich are outside of management’s control. The most important of these factors include: \n  \n  \n● \nseasonality; \n  \n● \nthe retail economy; \n  \n● \nthe timing and effectiveness of marketing programs; \n  \n● \nthe timing of the introduction of new products and services; \n  \n● \nthe Company’s ability to find and maintain reliable sources for certain of its products; \n  \n● \nthe impact of severe weather or natural disasters on consumer demand; \n  \n● \nthe timing and effectiveness of capital expenditures; \n  \n● \nthe Company’s ability to enter into or renew online marketing agreements; and \n  \n● \ncompetition. \n  \nThe Company may be unable to reduce operating expenses quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall. If the Company \nhas a shortfall in revenue without a corresponding reduction to its expenses, operating results may suffer. The Company’s operating \nresults for any particular quarter may not be indicative of future operating results. You should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons \nof results of operations as an indication of the Company’s future performance. It is possible that results of operations may be below the \nexpectations of public market analysts and investors, which could cause the trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock to \nfall. \n  \nDuring peak periods, the Company utilizes temporary employees and outsourced staff, who may not be as well-trained or committed to \nits customers as its permanent employees, and if they fail to provide the Company’s customers with high quality customer service the \ncustomers may not return, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of \noperations and cash flows. The Company depends on its customer service department to respond to its customers should they have \nquestions or problems with their orders. During peak periods, the Company relies on its permanent employees, as well as temporary \nemployees and outsourced staff to respond to customer inquiries. These temporary employees and outsourced staff may not have the \nsame level of commitment to the Company’s customers or be as well trained as its permanent employees. If the Company’s customers \nare dissatisfied with the quality of the customer service they receive, they may not shop with the Company again, which could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n  \nIf the Company fails to develop and maintain its brands, it may not increase or maintain its customer base or its revenues. The Company \nmust continue to develop and maintain the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brands to expand its customer base and its revenues. In addition, \nthe Company has introduced and acquired other brands in the past, and may continue to do so in the future. The Company believes that \nthe importance of brand recognition will increase as it expands its product offerings. Many of the Company’s customers may not be \naware of the Company’s non-floral products. If the Company fails to advertise and market its products effectively, it may not succeed \nin establishing its brands and may lose customers leading to a reduction of revenues. \n  \n14"

      "text": "Table of Contents \n  \nThe Company’s success in promoting and enhancing the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brands will also depend on its success in providing \nits customers high-quality products and a high level of customer service. If the Company’s customers do not perceive its products and \nservices to be of high quality, the value of the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brands would be diminished and the Company may lose \ncustomers and its revenues may decline. \n  \nA failure to establish and maintain strategic online and social media relationships that generate a significant amount of traffic could \nlimit the growth of the Company’s business. Although the Company expects a significant portion of its online customers will continue \nto come directly to its website, it will also rely on third party websites, search engines and affiliates with which the Company has \nstrategic relationships for traffic. If these third-parties do not attract a significant number of visitors, the Company may not receive a \nsignificant number of online customers from these relationships and its revenues from these relationships may decrease or remain flat. \nThere continues to be strong competition to establish or maintain relationships with leading Internet companies, and the Company may \nnot successfully enter into additional relationships, or renew existing ones beyond their current terms. The Company may also be \nrequired to pay significant fees to maintain and expand existing relationships. The Company’s online revenues may suffer if it does not \nenter into new relationships or maintain existing relationships or if these relationships do not result in traffic sufficient to justify their \ncosts. \n  \nIf local florists and other third-party vendors do not fulfill orders to the Company’s customers' satisfaction, customers may not shop \nwith the Company again. In many cases, floral orders placed by the Company’s customers are fulfilled by local independent florists, a \nmajority of which are members of BloomNet. The Company does not directly control any of these florists. In addition, many of the non-\nfloral products sold by the Company are manufactured and delivered to its customers by independent third-party vendors. If customers \nare dissatisfied with the performance of the local florist or other third-party vendors, they may not utilize the Company’s services when \nplacing future orders and its revenues may decrease. \n  \nIf a florist discontinues its relationship with the Company, the Company’s customers may experience delays in service or declines in \nquality and may not shop with the Company again. Many of the Company’s arrangements with local florists for order fulfillment may \nbe terminated by either party with 10 days’ notice. If a florist discontinues its relationship with the Company, the Company will be \nrequired to obtain a suitable replacement located in the same geographic area, which may cause delays in delivery or a decline in quality, \nleading to customer dissatisfaction and loss of customers. \n  \nIf a significant number of customers are not satisfied with their purchase, the Company will be required to incur substantial costs to \nissue refunds, credits or replacement products. The Company offers its customers a 100% satisfaction guarantee on its products. If \ncustomers are not satisfied with the products they receive, the Company will either replace the product for the customer or issue the \ncustomer a refund or credit. The Company’s net income would decrease if a significant number of customers request replacement \nproducts, refunds or credits and the Company is unable to pass such costs onto the supplier.  \n  \nIf the Company fails to continuously improve its website (on all relevant platforms, including mobile), it may not attract or retain \ncustomers. If potential or existing customers do not find the Company’s website (on all relevant platforms, including mobile) a \nconvenient place to shop, the Company may not attract or retain customers and its sales may suffer. To encourage the use of the \nCompany’s website, it must continuously improve its accessibility, content and ease of use. Customer traffic and the Company’s business \nwould be adversely affected if competitors' websites are perceived as easier to use or better able to satisfy customer needs. \n  \nCompetition in the floral, plant, gift basket, gourmet food, and specialty gift industries is intense and a failure to respond to competitive \npressure could result in lost revenues. There are many companies that offer products in these categories. In the floral category, the \nCompany’s competitors include: \n  \n● retail floral shops, some of which maintain toll-free telephone numbers and websites; \n● online floral retailers; \n● catalog companies that offer floral products; \n● floral telemarketers and wire services; and \n● supermarkets, mass merchants and specialty gift retailers with floral departments. \n  \nSimilarly, the plant, gift basket, gourmet food, cookie, candy, fruit and specialty gift categories are highly competitive. Each of these \ncategories encompasses a wide range of products and is highly fragmented. Products in these categories may be purchased from a \nnumber of outlets, including mass merchants, retail shops, online retailers and mail-order catalogs. \n  \n15"

Increased competition could result in: \n  \n● price reductions, decreased revenue and lower profit margins; \n● loss of market share; and \n● increased marketing expenditures. \n  \nThese and other competitive factors could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.   \n  \nIf the Company does not accurately predict customer demand for its products, it may lose customers or experience increased costs. If \nthe Company overestimates customer demand for its products, excess inventory and outdated merchandise could accumulate, tying up \nworking capital and potentially resulting in reduced warehouse capacity and inventory losses due to damage, theft and obsolescence. If \nthe Company underestimates customer demand, it may disappoint customers who may turn to its competitors. Moreover, the strength \nof the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brands could be diminished due to misjudgments in merchandise selection. \n  \nVarious diseases, pests and certain weather conditions can affect fruit production. Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, \nfrosts, hail, wildfires, floods and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of our fruit production in our \nHarry & David orchards, decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability. Our producing orchards also \nrequire adequate water supplies. A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of crops, which could lead to a \nshortage of our product supply. \n  \nThe ripening of our fruits is subject to seasonal fluctuations which could negatively impact profitability. The ripening of our fruits in \nthe Harry & David orchards can happen earlier than predicted due to warmer temperatures during the year. This would result in an \noversupply of fruits that we might not be able to sell on a timely basis and could result in significant inventory write-offs. The ripening \nof the Company’s fruits can also happen later than predicted due to colder temperatures during the year. This can cause a delay in \nproduct shipments and not being able to timely meet customer demand during the critical holiday season. Both of these scenarios could \nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n  \nIf the Company is unable to hire and retain key personnel, its business may suffer. The Company’s success is dependent on its ability to \nhire, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel. In particular, the Company’s success depends on the continued efforts of its Chief \nExecutive Officer, Christopher G. McCann, as well as its senior management team which help manage its business. The loss of the \nservices of any of the Company’s executive management or key personnel or its inability to attract qualified additional personnel could \ncause its business to suffer and force it to expend time and resources in locating and training additional personnel. \n  \nA failure to integrate our acquisitions may cause the results of the acquired company, as well as the results of the Company to \nsuffer.  The Company has opportunistically acquired a number of companies over the past several years. Additionally, the Company \nmay look to acquire additional companies in the future. As part of the acquisition process, the Company embarks upon a project \nmanagement effort to integrate the acquisition onto our information technology systems and management processes.  If we are \nunsuccessful in integrating our acquisitions, the results of our acquisitions may suffer, management may have to divert valuable \nresources to oversee and manage the acquisitions, the Company may have to expend additional investments in the acquired company to \nupgrade personnel and/or information technology systems and the results of the Company may suffer.  \n  \nA failure to dispose of assets or businesses in a timely manner may cause the results of the Company to suffer. The Company continues \nto evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help it meet its objectives. When the Company decides \nto sell assets or a business, it may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely \nmanner, which could delay the accomplishment of its strategic objectives. Alternatively, the Company may dispose of a business at a \nprice or on terms that are less than it had anticipated. After reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the disposition of a business, \nthe Company is subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, which may prevent the Company from completing the transaction. \nDispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, \nguarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other \nconditions outside the Company’s control could affect its future financial results. \n  \n16"

We rely extensively on our computer systems for the successful operation of our business, \nincluding corporate email communications to and from employees, customers and retail operations, the design, manufacture and \ndistribution of our finished goods, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, the \nprocessing of credit card transactions, online e-commerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space. Our \nsystems are subject to damage or interruption from computer viruses, malicious attacks and other security breaches. The possibility of \na cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is always a serious threat and consumer awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches \nand cyber security threats is at an all-time high. If a cybersecurity incident occurs, or there is a public perception that we have suffered \na breach, our reputation and brand could be damaged and we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to \nalleviate problems. \n  \nAs part of our business model, we collect, retain, and transmit confidential information over public networks. In addition to our own \ndatabases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit this information on our behalf. Although we contractually \nrequire these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee \nthat a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. We have confidential security measures \nin place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. Despite these efforts, we may be vulnerable to targeted \nor random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other \nsimilar events. \n  \nGiven the robust nature of our e-commerce presence and digital strategy, it is imperative that we and our e-commerce partners maintain \nuninterrupted operation of our: (i) computer hardware, (ii) software systems, (iii) customer marketing databases, and (iv) ability to email \nour current and potential customers. \n  \nIf our systems are damaged or fail to function properly or reliably, we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data \nloss or theft and impediments to our ability to conduct our operations. Any material disruptions in our e-commerce presence or \ninformation technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n  \nThe Company’s business could be injured by significant credit card, debit card and gift card fraud. Customers typically pay for their \non-line or telephone orders with debit or credit cards as well as a portion of their orders using gift cards. The Company’s revenues and \ngross margins could decrease if it experienced significant credit card, debit card and gift card fraud. Failure to adequately detect and \navoid fraudulent credit card, debit card and gift card transactions could cause the Company to lose its ability to accept credit cards or \ndebit cards as forms of payment and/or result in charge-backs of the fraudulently charged amounts and/or significantly decrease \nrevenues. Furthermore, widespread credit card, debit card and gift card fraud may lessen the Company’s customers’ willingness to \npurchase products through the Company’s websites or toll-free telephone numbers. For this reason, such failure could have a material \nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n  \nUnexpected system interruptions caused by system failures may result in reduced revenues and harm to the Company’s brand. In the \npast, particularly during peak holiday periods, the Company has experienced significant increases in traffic on its website and in its toll-\nfree customer service centers. The Company’s operations are dependent on its ability to maintain its computer and telecommunications \nsystems in effective working order and to protect its systems against damage from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications \nfailure, security breaches (including breaches of our transaction processing or other systems that could result in the compromise of \nconfidential customer data) or similar events. The Company’s systems have in the past, and may in the future, experience: \n  \n● system interruptions; \n● long response times; and \n● degradation in service. \n  \nThe Company’s business depends on customers making purchases on its systems. Its revenues may decrease and its reputation could be \nharmed if it experiences frequent or long system delays or interruptions or if a disruption occurs during a peak holiday season. \n  \n17"

The Company is dependent on telecommunication providers to provide telephone services \nto its customer service centers and connectivity with its data centers. Although the Company maintains redundant telecommunications \nsystems, if these providers experience system failures or fail to adequately maintain the Company’s systems, the Company may \nexperience interruptions and will be unable to generate revenue. The Company depends upon these third-party relationships because it \ndoes not have the resources to maintain its service without these or other third parties. Failure to maintain these relationships or replace \nthem on financially attractive terms may disrupt the Company’s operations or require it to incur significant unanticipated costs. \n  \nFailure to remediate a material weakness related to our controls over logical access and segregation of duties, at the application control \nlevel, in certain information technology environments, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Our \nmanagement has identified a material weakness related to our controls over logical access and segregation of duties, at the application \ncontrol level, in certain information technology environments and has concluded that, due to such material weakness, our disclosure \ncontrols and procedures were not effective as of July 3, 2022. While remediation is in process, our failure to establish and maintain \neffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our \nfinancial statements, and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on \nour financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. \n  \nLegal, Regulatory, Tax and Other Risks \n  \nUnauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property by third parties may damage its brands. Unauthorized use of the Company’s \nintellectual property by third parties may damage its brands and its reputation and may likely result in a loss of customers. It may be \npossible for third parties to obtain and use the Company’s intellectual property without authorization. Third parties have in the past \ninfringed or misappropriated the Company’s intellectual property or similar proprietary rights. The Company believes infringements \nand misappropriations will continue to occur in the future. Furthermore, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual \nproperty in Internet-related industries is uncertain and still evolving. The Company has been unable to register certain of its intellectual \nproperty in some foreign countries and furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries are uncertain or do not protect intellectual \nproperty rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. \n  \nThe Company’s franchisees may damage its brands or increase its costs by failing to comply with its franchise agreements or its \noperating standards. The Company’s franchise business is governed by its Uniform Franchise Disclosure Document, franchise \nagreements and applicable franchise law. If the Company’s franchisees do not comply with its established operating standards or the \nterms of the franchise agreements, the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brands may be damaged. The Company may incur significant additional \ncosts, including time-consuming and expensive litigation, to enforce its rights under the franchise agreements. Additionally, the \nCompany is the primary tenant on certain leases, which the franchisees sublease from the Company. If a franchisee fails to meet its \nobligations as subtenant, the Company could incur significant costs to avoid default under the primary lease. Furthermore, as a \nfranchisor, the Company has obligations to its franchisees. Franchisees may challenge the performance of the Company’s obligations \nunder the franchise agreements and subject it to costs in defending these claims and, if the claims are successful, costs in connection \nwith their compliance. \n  \nIf third parties acquire rights to use similar domain names or phone numbers or if the Company loses the right to use its phone numbers, \nits brands may be damaged and it may lose sales. The Company’s Internet domain names are an important aspect of its brand recognition. \nThe Company cannot practically acquire rights to all domain names similar to www.1800flowers.com, or its other brands, whether under \nexisting top level domains or those issued in the future. If third parties obtain rights to similar domain names, these third parties may \nconfuse the Company’s customers and cause its customers to inadvertently place orders with these third parties, which could result in \nlost sales and could damage its brands. \n  \nLikewise, the phone number that spells 1-800-FLOWERS is important to the Company’s brand and its business. While the Company \nhas obtained the right to use the phone numbers 1-800-FLOWERS, 1-888-FLOWERS and 1-877-FLOWERS, as well as common toll-\nfree \"FLOWERS\" misdials, it may not be able to obtain rights to use the FLOWERS phone number as new toll-free prefixes are issued, \nor the rights to all similar and potentially confusing numbers. If third parties obtain the phone number that spells \"FLOWERS\" with a \ndifferent prefix or a toll-free number similar to FLOWERS, these parties may also confuse the Company’s customers and cause lost \nsales and potential damage to its brands. In addition, under applicable FCC rules, ownership rights to phone numbers cannot be acquired. \nAccordingly, the FCC may rescind the Company’s right to use any of its phone numbers, including 1-800-FLOWERS (1-800-356-\n9377). \n  \nDefending against intellectual property infringement claims could be expensive and, if the Company is not successful, could disrupt its \nability to conduct business. The Company has been unable to register certain of its intellectual properties in some foreign countries, \nincluding, “1-800-Flowers.com”, “1-800-Flowers” and “800-Flowers”. The Company cannot be certain that the products it sells, or \nservices it offers, do not or will not infringe valid patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third \nparties. The Company may be a party to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property of others from time to time in \nthe ordinary course of its business. The Company may incur substantial expense in defending against these third-party infringement \nclaims, regardless of their merit. Successful infringement claims against the Company may result in substantial monetary liability or \nmay materially disrupt its ability to conduct business. \n  \n18"

Several of the products the Company sells, including perishable \nfood and alcoholic beverage products may expose it to product liability claims in the event that the use or consumption of these products \nresults in personal injury or property damage. Although the Company has not experienced any material losses due to product liability \nclaims to date, it may be a party to product liability claims in the future and incur significant costs in their defense. Product liability \nclaims often create negative publicity, which could materially damage the Company’s reputation and its brands. Although the Company \nmaintains insurance against product liability claims, its coverage may be inadequate to cover any liabilities it may incur. \n  \nFuture litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Lawsuits and other administrative or \nlegal proceedings that may arise in the course of our operations can involve substantial costs, including the costs associated with \ninvestigation, litigation and possible settlement, judgment, penalty or fine. In addition, lawsuits and other legal proceedings may be time \nconsuming and may require a commitment of management and personnel resources that will be diverted from our normal business \noperations. Although we generally maintain insurance to mitigate certain costs, there can be no assurance that costs associated with \nlawsuits or other legal proceedings will not exceed the limits of insurance policies. Moreover, we may be unable to continue to maintain \nour existing insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all, or to secure additional coverage, which may result in costs associated with lawsuits \nand other legal proceedings being uninsured. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if \na judgment, penalty or fine is not fully covered by insurance. \n  \nA privacy or data security breach could expose us to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and adversely affect \nour business. An important component of our business involves the receipt, processing, transmittal, and storage of personal, confidential \nor sensitive information about our customers. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents. \nHowever, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently \nand may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive \nmeasures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or \nmanufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain \naccess to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceiving \nour team members, contractors, vendors, and temporary staff. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of intentional or \ninadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Any actual or suspected security \nbreach or other compromise of our security measures or those of our third party vendors whether as a result of banking efforts, denial-\nof-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering or otherwise, could harm our reputation \nand business, damage our brand and make it harder to retain existing customers or acquire new ones, require us to expend significant \ncapital and other resources to address the breach, and result in a violation of applicable laws regulations or other legal obligations. \nMoreover, any insurance coverage we may carry may be inadequate to cover the expenses and other potential financial exposure we \ncould face as a result of a privacy or data breach. \n  \nFailure to comply with federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer \nprotection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer \nprotection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.  A variety of federal, state and international laws and \nregulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing, export and security of personal information. We also may choose to comply \nwith, or may be required to comply with, self-regulatory obligations or other industry standards. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, \ndata protection and consumer protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and laws providing for new \nprivacy and security rights and requirements may be enacted or come into effect in different jurisdictions. These requirements may be \nenacted, interpreted or applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or in a manner that conflicts with other \nrules or our practices. As a result, our practices may not comply, or may not comply in the future with all such laws, regulations, \nrequirements and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any federal, state or international privacy or \nconsumer protection- related laws, regulations, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating \nto privacy or consumer protection could adversely affect our reputation, brand and business, and may result in claims, proceedings or \nactions against us by governmental entities or others, including claims for statutory damages asserted on behalf of purported classes of \naffected persons or other liabilities or require us to change our business practices, including changing, limiting or ceasing altogether the \ncollection, use, sharing, or transfer of data relating to customers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition \nand operating results. \n  \n19"

Any new law \nor regulation, or the application or interpretation of existing laws, may adversely impact the growth in the use of the Internet or the \nCompany’s websites. The Company expects there will be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the Internet in the \nUnited States and throughout the world. These laws or regulations may relate to liability for information received from or transmitted \nover the Internet, online content regulation, user privacy, taxation and quality of products and services sold over the Internet. Moreover, \nthe applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing intellectual property ownership and infringement, copyright, trademark, trade \nsecret, obscenity, libel, employment, personal privacy and other issues is uncertain and developing. This could decrease the demand for \nthe Company’s products, increase its costs or otherwise adversely affect its business. \n  \nRegulations imposed by the Federal Trade Commission may adversely affect the growth of the Company’s Internet business or its \nmarketing efforts. The Federal Trade Commission has proposed regulations regarding the collection and use of personal identifying \ninformation obtained from individuals when accessing websites, with particular emphasis on access by minors. These regulations may \ninclude requirements that the Company establish procedures to disclose and notify users of privacy and security policies, obtain consent \nfrom users for collection and use of information and provide users with the ability to access, correct and delete personal information \nstored by the Company. These regulations may also include enforcement and redress provisions. Moreover, even in the absence of those \nregulations, the Federal Trade Commission has begun investigations into the privacy practices of other companies that collect \ninformation on the Internet. One investigation resulted in a consent decree under which an Internet company agreed to establish programs \nto implement the principles noted above. The Company may become a party to a similar investigation, or the Federal Trade \nCommission's regulatory and enforcement efforts, or those of other governmental bodies, may adversely affect its ability to collect \ndemographic and personal information from users, which could adversely affect its marketing efforts. \n  \nThe price at which the Company’s Class A common stock will trade may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially. The stock \nmarket has from time to time experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities, particularly \nsecurities of companies with Internet operations. As a result, investors may experience a material decline in the market price of the \nCompany’s Class A common stock, regardless of the Company’s operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in \nthe market price of a particular company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. The \nCompany may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type is often expensive and diverts management's \nattention and resources and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and its results of operations. \n  \nAdditional Information \n  \nThe Company’s internet address is www.1800flowers.com.

Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock generally vote together as a single class on all \nmatters presented to the stockholders for their vote or approval, except as may be required by Delaware law. Class B common stock \nmay be converted into Class A common stock at any time on a one-for-one share basis. Each share of Class B common stock will \nautomatically convert into one share of Class A common stock upon its transfer, with limited exceptions. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, \n904,000 and 389,209 shares of Class B common stock were converted into shares of Class A common stock, respectively, while none \nwere converted during fiscal year 2020. \n  \nHolders \n  \nAs of September 9, 2022, there were approximately 201 stockholders of record of the Company’s Class A common stock, although the \nCompany believes that there is a significantly larger number of beneficial owners. As of September 9, 2022, there were approximately \n13 stockholders of record of the Company’s Class B common stock. \n  \nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer \n  \nThe Company has a stock repurchase plan through which purchases can be made from time to time in the open market and through \nprivately negotiated transactions, subject to general market conditions.

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company’s plans, estimates \nand beliefs. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.

See Item 1 in Part I for a detailed \ndescription of the Company’s business. \n  \nBusiness Segments \n  \nThe Company operates in the following three business segments: Consumer Floral & Gifts, Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets, and \nBloomNet. The Consumer Floral & Gifts segment includes the operations of the Company’s flagship brand, 1-800-Flowers.com, \nPersonalizationMall, FruitBouquets.com, Flowerama and Alice’s Table, while the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment includes the \noperations of Harry & David, Wolferman’s Bakery, Vital Choice, Moose Munch, Stock Yards, Cheryl’s, Mrs. Beasley’s, The Popcorn \nFactory, DesignPac, 1-800-Baskets.com, Simply Chocolate and Shari’s Berries. The BloomNet segment includes the operations of \nBloomNet and Napco. \n  \nFiscal 2022 Results \n  \nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company recorded revenue growth of 4.0%, with total revenues exceeding $2.2 billion. This growth comes on \ntop of the 42.5% revenue growth we saw in fiscal 2021, and represents revenue growth of 76.8% compared with fiscal 2019 (48.8%, \nexcluding the impact of acquisitions), our last full fiscal year prior to the start of the pandemic. However, this was a challenging year \nfor the Company due to a change in consumer behavior, in reaction to unprecedented inflation in the macro economy, which also resulted \nin a rapid rise of costs, that negatively impacted our gross margins and operating expenses. As a result, our earnings were well below \nour expectations. \n  \nOur business – and the macro-economy – have gone through several significant stages over the past few years. Prior to the pandemic, \nwe made the decision to step up our investments in marketing – particularly in our flagship 1-800-Flowers and Harry & David brands, \nto accelerate revenue growth. This enabled us to significantly accelerate our revenue growth rate from the second half of fiscal 2018 \nthrough the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, when we went from low single-digit to double-digit growth. During that period, we also \naccelerated the growth of our customer file and membership in our Celebrations Passport Loyalty program. These initiatives, along with \ncontinued investments in our business platform, positioned us well to respond to the surge that we saw in consumer demand when the \nworld changed dramatically in the spring of 2020 with the advent of the COVID pandemic. Through lockdowns, social distancing and \nthe shift to remote work, the resourcefulness and dedication of our team helped our customers stay connected with the important people \nin their lives. With the surge in demand, we saw our top and bottom-line results, and our customer file, grow to record levels. As the \nworld began to emerge from the pandemic last year, we once again saw dramatic changes in the macro-economy and consumer behavior, \nwith increased travel, dining out, group celebrations and other pent-up activities. We also experienced rapidly increasing price inflation, \nunprecedented disruptions in the global supply chain, geopolitical turmoil, and an extremely tight labor market. As a result, we saw \nconsumer demand moderate, while steep cost increases in everything from labor to shipping to commodities, have negatively impacted \nour gross margins, and increased digital advertising rates resulted in an unfavorable operating expense ratio. \n  \nAs a result, despite a 4.0% increase in revenues, the aforementioned cost pressures caused a 500 basis point decrease in gross margin, \nwhich combined with an inflationary increase in marketing costs, partially offset by non-gross margin related labor reductions due to \nthe elimination of performance bonuses for executives, resulted in a significant decline in Adjusted EBITDA from $213.1 million in \nfiscal 2021 to $99.0 million in fiscal 2022.

      "text": "Table of Contents \n  \nWhile inflationary pressures remain, as we enter fiscal 2023, we are beginning to see early improvements in certain areas, including fuel \nprices that have pulled back from their peak highs, albeit still significantly higher year-over-year, softening in ocean freight rates, and \nstabilization of labor rates with some improvement in availability. While we hope that these positive trends will continue, we have taken \nproactive steps to address these issues, utilizing our balance sheet to invest in our operating platform and continuing to build for the \nfuture. These investments, include: \n  \no \nthe automation of our warehouse and distribution facilities, which reduces our exposure to both labor rate increases and \nseasonal labor shortages; \n  \no \nbuying and building inventories early to mitigate continuing global supply chain issues, and; \n  \no \nimplementing logistics optimization programs to manage rising carrier rates. \n  \nWe anticipate that these initiatives, combined with strategic pricing programs across our brands, will help us manage rising costs and \ngradually improve our gross margins and bottom-line results during the latter half of fiscal 2023. \n  \nAcquisition of PersonalizationMall \n  \nOn August 3, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of PersonalizationMall.com LLC (\"PersonalizationMall\"), a leading \necommerce provider of personalized products. The extensive offerings of PersonalizationMall include a wide variety of personalization \nprocesses such as sublimation, embroidery, digital printing, engraving and sandblasting, while providing an industry-leading customer \nexperience based on a fully integrated business platform that includes a highly automated personalization process and rapid order \nfulfillment. \n  \nThe Company used a combination of cash on its balance sheet and its existing credit facility to fund the $245.0 million purchase (subject \nto certain working capital and other adjustments), which included its newly renovated, leased 360,000 square foot state-of-the-art \nproduction and distribution facility, as well as customer database, tradenames and website. PersonalizationMall’s revenues were \napproximately $171.2 million during its fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 - see Note 4 – Acquisitions in Item 15. \n  \nAcquisition of Vital Choice \n  \nOn October 27, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Vital Choice Seafood LLC (“Vital Choice”), a provider of wild-caught \nseafood and sustainably farmed shellfish, pastured proteins, organic foods, and marine-sourced nutritional supplements. The Company \nutilized its existing credit facility to fund the $20.0 million purchase (subject to certain working capital and other adjustments), which \nincluded tradenames, customer lists, websites and operations. Vital Choice revenues were approximately $27.8 million during its most \nrecent year ended December 31, 2020 - see Note 4 – Acquisitions in Item 15. \n  \nAcquisition of Alice’s Table \n  \nOn December 31, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Alice Table LLC (“Alice’s Table”), a lifestyle business offering fully \ndigital livestreaming floral, culinary and other experiences to guests across the country. The Company utilized existing cash of $0.8 \nmillion, converted the existing accounts receivable from Alice’s Table of $0.3 million and its previous $0.3 million cost method \ninvestment in Alice’s Table, in order to acquire 100% ownership in Alice’s Table, which included tradenames, customer lists, websites \nand operations. Alice’s Table revenues were approximately $3.8 million during the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021 - \nsee Note 4 – Acquisitions in Item 15. \n  \nAmended Credit Agreement \n  \nSubsequent to, but in contemplation of the acquisition of PersonalizationMall, on August 20, 2020, the Company entered into a First \nAmendment to its 2019 Credit Agreement to: (i) increase the aggregate principal amount of the existing revolving credit facility \n(\"Revolver\") commitments from $200.0 million to $250.0 million, (ii) establish a new tranche of term A-1 loans in an aggregate principal \namount of $100.0 million (the “2020 Term Loan”), (iii) increase the working capital sublimit with respect to the Revolver from $175.0 \nmillion to $200.0 million, and (iv) increase the seasonally-reduced Revolver commitments from $100.0 million to $125.0 million for \nthe period from January 1 through August 1 for each fiscal year of the Company. The 2020 Term Loan will mature on May 31, 2024. \nThe 2020 Term Loan is payable in 15 quarterly installments of principal and interest beginning on September 27, 2020, with escalating \nprincipal payments, at the rate of 5.0% per annum for the first four payments, and 10.0% per annum for the remaining 11 payments, \nwith the remaining balance of $67.5 million due upon maturity. The $100.0 million proceeds of the 2020 Term Loan were used to repay \nthe $95.0 million borrowing, which had been drawn on its existing Revolver to finance the acquisition, as well as financing fees of \napproximately $2.0 million. \n  \n25"

In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions to promote employee safety and business \ncontinuity, informed by the guidelines set forth by local, state and federal government and health officials. These initiatives are governed \nby our “Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan,” which established an internal “nerve center” to assist efforts surrounding: \ncommunication and coordination throughout the business, workforce protection and supply chain management, and support for the \nCompany’s customers, vendors, franchisees, and our BloomNet member florists. \n  \nFiscal 2023 Guidance \n  \nBased on the highly unpredictable nature of the current macro economy, the Company has decided to provide guidance on a quarter-by-\nquarter basis, including current business trends to date at the time of its regular quarterly results releases. \n  \n● \nThrough the first two months of fiscal 2023, we have seen continued cautious consumer spending behavior reflecting the impact \nof price inflation, particularly in food and gasoline. As a result, the Company anticipates that its fiscal first quarter revenues \nwill be down in a range of 3.0-to-6.0 percent, compared with the prior year period. \n  \n● \nIn terms of cost inputs, the Company anticipates that year-over-year costs for labor, shipping, commodities, and digital \nmarketing will remain high through the first quarter, compared with the prior year period. \n  \n● \nAs a result, the Company anticipates that its Adjusted EBITDA loss for the current fiscal first quarter will be in a range of \n$28.0 million-to-$33.0 million. \n  \n● \nLooking ahead, the Company anticipates that the combination of the investments it has made, and continues to make in its \nbusiness platform, along with strategic pricing programs and moderation of cost inputs, will enable it to gradually achieve \nimproved gross margins and bottom-line results during the latter half of the current fiscal year. \n  \n● \nFor the full year, the Company anticipates reduced capital expenditures as well as lower working capital needs compared with \nthe prior year. As a result, the Company expects to generate substantial positive year-over-year free cash flow. \n  \nDefinitions of non-GAAP financial measures: \n  \nWe sometimes use financial measures derived from consolidated financial information, but not presented in our financial statements \nprepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Certain of these are considered \"non-GAAP \nfinancial measures\" under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. See below for definitions and the reasons why we use \nthese non-GAAP financial measures. Where applicable, see the Segment Information and Results of Operations sections below for \nreconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP \nfinancial measures are referred to as “non-GAAP”, “ adjusted\" or “on a comparable basis” below, as these terms are used \ninterchangeably. Reconciliations for forward-looking figures would require unreasonable efforts at this time because of the uncertainty \nand variability of the nature and amount of certain components of various necessary GAAP components, including, for example, those \nrelated to compensation, tax items, amortization or others that may arise during the year, and the Company’s management believes such \nreconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. For the same reasons, the Company \nis unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. The lack of such reconciling information should be \nconsidered when assessing the impact of such disclosures. \n  \nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA \n  \nWe define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA \nadjusted for the impact of stock-based compensation, Non-Qualified Plan Investment appreciation/depreciation, and certain items \naffecting period to period comparability. See Segment Information for details on how EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA were calculated \nfor each period presented. \n  \n26"

      "text": "Table of Contents \n  \nThe Company presents EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because it considers such information meaningful supplemental measures of its \nperformance and believes such information is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of similarly situated \ncompanies. The Company uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as factors used to determine the total amount of incentive compensation \navailable to be awarded to executive officers and other employees. The Company's credit agreement uses EBITDA and adjusted \nEBITDA to determine its interest rate and to measure compliance with certain covenants. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are also used \nby the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates. \n  \nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for \nanalysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations are: (a) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not \nreflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs; (b) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect \nthe significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Company's debts; \nand (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced \nin the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. EBITDA should only be used on a \nsupplemental basis combined with GAAP results when evaluating the Company's performance. \n  \nSegment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin \n  \nWe define segment contribution margin as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, before the allocation of \ncorporate overhead expenses. Adjusted segment contribution margin is defined as contribution margin adjusted for certain items \naffecting period-to-period comparability. See Segment Information for details on how segment contribution margin was calculated for \neach period presented. \n  \nWhen viewed together with our GAAP results, we believe segment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin \nprovide management and users of the financial statements meaningful information about the performance of our business segments. \n  \nSegment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented \nin accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. The material limitation associated \nwith the use of the segment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin is that they are an incomplete measure of \nprofitability as they do not include all operating expenses or non-operating income and expenses. Management compensates for these \nlimitations when using this measure by looking at other GAAP measures, such as Operating Income and Net Income.  \n  \nAdjusted net income and adjusted net income per common share \n  \nWe define adjusted net income and adjusted net income per common share as net income and net income per common share adjusted \nfor certain items affecting period to period comparability. See Segment Information below for details on how adjusted net income and \nadjusted net income per common share were calculated for each period presented. \n  \nWe believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per common share are meaningful measures because they increase the \ncomparability of period-to-period results. \n  \nSince these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as \na substitute for, GAAP net income and net income per common share, as indicators of operating performance and they may not be \ncomparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. \n  \nFree Cash Flow \n  \nWe define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. The Company considers Free Cash \nFlow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the \nbusiness after the purchases of fixed assets, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the Company’s business, make \nstrategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock or retire debt. Free Cash Flow is a liquidity measure that is \nfrequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of similarly situated companies. Since Free Cash Flow is not a measure \nof performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the \nCompany's results as reported under GAAP. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it \ndoes not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period. \n  \n27"

These revenue increases were \nattributable to pricing initiatives and product mix, which drove a higher average order value ($78.77, +9.0%), partially offset \nby lower order volume (24.5 million, -5.6%, as compared with fiscal 2021). \n  \nE-commerce revenues increased 52.8% during fiscal 2021, comprised of 73.5% growth within the Consumer Floral & Gifts \nsegment and 34.0% growth in the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment. During fiscal 2021, the Company fulfilled \napproximately 26.0 million e-commerce orders (an increase of 54.9% compared to fiscal 2020) at an average order value of \n$72.22 (a decrease of 1.4% compared to fiscal 2020). \n  \n  \n● \nOther revenues are comprised of the Company’s BloomNet segment, as well as the wholesale and retail channels of its 1-800-\nFlowers.com Consumer Floral & Gifts and Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segments. Other revenues increased by 12.6% \nduring fiscal 2022 due to increased wholesale product demand, partially offset by a decrease in BloomNet services revenues. \n  \nOther revenues decreased 6.4% during fiscal 2021, primarily as a result of the disposition of Harry & David stores in April \n2020, and weak wholesale demand attributable to COVID-19, partially offset by 27.9% growth within the BloomNet segment. \n  \nRevenue by segment: \n  \nConsumer Floral & Gifts – this segment, which historically has consisted primarily of the operations of the 1-800-Flowers.com brand, \nbut now includes revenues attributable to PersonalizationMall and Alice’s Table, subsequent to their August 3, 2020 and December 31, \n2021 acquisition dates, respectively, derives revenue from the sale of consumer floral products and gifts, primarily through its e-\ncommerce sales channel (telephonic and online sales), as well as retail stores, and royalties from its franchise operations. \n  \nNet revenues increased 3.4% during fiscal 2022 (including the impact of PersonalizationMall acquired on August 3, 2020, and Alice’s \nTable, which was acquired on December 31, 2021). Adjusting for the acquisitions of PersonalizationMall and Alice’s Table, pro-forma \nsegment revenue growth was 2.0%, reflecting the marketing and merchandising investments made in our flagship brand, which are \ncontinuing to drive growth and market share gains, with more pronounced growth during the Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day holiday \nperiods as “Everyday” volume has slowed during this inflationary post-pandemic period. For point of reference, fiscal 2022 revenue \nincreased 112.9%, compared with pre-pandemic fiscal 2019 revenues. Excluding revenue from acquisitions, pro-forma revenue growth \nduring this period was 62.0%. \n  \nNet revenues increased 72.8%, during fiscal 2021, reflecting: (i) the marketing and merchandising investments made in our flagship \nbrand, which have driven our growth and market share gains that began in the second half of fiscal 2018, continued through fiscal 2020, \nand accelerated with the start of the pandemic, and (ii) the incremental revenues of PersonalizationMall. Excluding the revenues derived \nfrom PersonalizationMall, segment pro-forma revenue growth was 33.0% during fiscal 2021, despite the shift of the Valentine’s Day \ndate placement from Friday in fiscal 2020 to Sunday in fiscal 2021, which normally results in a 20% reduction in demand. The revenue \nincrease was supported by the Company’s customer acquisition strategy, and a strategic combination of organic and investment spend, \nresulting in growth across our “everyday” gifting occasions, which focused on “Birthday”, “Anniversary”, “Sympathy” and “Just \nBecause” occasions, as well as holiday specific occasions, including the Christmas, Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day holidays. The \nacquisition of PersonalizationMall and its complementary product line contributed to the accelerated growth rate as it filled the \npersonalization gift niche that our consumer and BGS customers requested. \n  \nBloomNet - revenues in this segment are derived from membership fees, as well as other product and service offerings to florists. \n  \nNet revenues increased 1.9% during fiscal 2022 due to wholesale products growth, partially offset by lower services revenue due to \nunfavorable membership/transaction fee revenues, resulting from unfavorable 1-800-Flowers and shop-to-shop order volume, \nattributable to overall macro-economic conditions, and lower referral fees, partially offset by increased directory services due to ad \nvolume and fee amount increases.

This growth was supported by the strategic decision made in April 2020, to \ntemporarily waive fees and establish health and safety protocols to help member florists, until they could safely re-establish operations \nduring the pandemic. \n  \nGourmet Foods & Gift Baskets – this segment includes the operations of Harry & David, Wolferman’s Bakery, Stock Yards, Cheryl’s \nCookies, The Popcorn Factory, 1-800-Baskets/DesignPac, Shari’s Berries (subsequent to its acquisition date of August 14, 2019), and \nVital Choice (subsequent to its acquisition date of October 27, 2021).

Wholesale/retail \nchannel revenues declined 34.8% during the fiscal year 2021, as big-box retail store customers reduced order volumes due to the \npandemic, and as a result of the closure of the Harry & David retail store operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. \n  \nGross Profit \n  \n  \n  \nYears Ended \n  \n  \n  \nJuly 3, 2022 \n    \n% Change \n    \nJune 27, \n2021 \n    \n% Change \n    June 28, 2020   \n  \n  \n(dollars in thousands) \n  \n  \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n  \nGross profit \n  $ \n821,738      \n-8.3 %  $ \n896,429      \n44.1 %  $ \n622,196  \nGross margin % \n    \n37.2 %    \n       \n42.2 %    \n       \n41.8 % \n  \nGross profit consists of net revenues less cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of florist fulfillment costs (fees paid directly to \nflorists), the cost of floral and non-floral merchandise sold from inventory or through third parties, and associated costs, including \ninbound and outbound shipping charges.

Adjusting for the impact of PersonalizationMall, Alice’s Table and Vital Choice, on a pro-forma basis, gross margin \npercentage remained 37.2%. Gross profit percentage decreased during fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower margins across all three \nsegments, reflecting macro-economic headwinds including: continued disruptions in the global supply chain, the escalation of increased \ncommodity costs, increased year-over-year labor rates, as well as widespread delays and increased costs for inbound and outbound \nshipping, including an acceleration in fuel surcharges related to rising oil prices, and the write-off of certain inventories of expired \nperishable products, reflecting softer than anticipated demand levels. The Company has and will continue to implement strategic \ninitiatives designed to mitigate the impact of these issues, including pricing initiatives across our product assortment, as well as pre-\nbuilding inventory to offset supply chain delays, implementing logistics optimization programs to enhance our outbound shipping \noperations and manage rising third-party shipping costs, and deploying automation to increase throughput and address labor shortages. \n  \nGross profit increased 44.1% during fiscal 2021 primarily due to the increase in revenues noted above. Gross profit percentage increased \n40 basis points during the fiscal year 2021, as higher margins within the Consumer Floral & Gifts (due to the acquisition of \nPersonalizationMall) and Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segments were offset, in part, by lower margins within the BloomNet segment. \nOn a pro-forma basis, excluding the impact of PersonalizationMall, gross margin percentage was 41.1%. \n  \nConsumer Floral & Gifts segment – Gross profit (including the impact of Pmall, acquired on August 3, 2020, and Alice’s Table, \nacquired on December 31, 2021) was unfavorable in comparison to prior year by 1.0%, as a result of an unfavorable gross profit \npercentage, partially offset by the higher revenues noted above.

The higher gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to the acquisition of PersonalizationMall, \nwhich carries higher margins, as well as pricing initiatives and reductions in promotional activity after the onset of COVID-19, partially \noffset by higher florist fulfillment, credits, product and delivery costs which increased as a result of the pandemic. On a pro-forma basis, \nexcluding the impact of PersonalizationMall, acquired on August 3, 2020, gross margin percentage was 37.9% during the fiscal year \n2021. \n  \nBloomNet segment – Gross profit from the BloomNet segment was unfavorable in comparison to prior year by 5.3%, due to lower \nmargins, partially offset by the increased revenues noted above. The lower margins were caused by the impact of sales mix (a greater \nproportion of revenues were derived from lower margin wholesale volume), compounded by higher cost of merchandise due to increased \nocean freight costs and product costs, as well as supply chain issues, partially offset by lower rebates (due to lower shop-to-shop \nvolumes). \n  \nGross profit increased 19.9% during fiscal 2021, due to the increase in revenues noted above, partially offset by a decrease in gross \nprofit percentage of 300 basis points to 45.5%. The decrease in gross margin % was due to higher rebates (higher florist to florist \nvolume), combined with unfavorable wholesale product margins due to product mix, and higher shipping/merchandising costs. \n  \nGourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment – Gross profit was unfavorable in comparison to prior year by 16.3%, due to a decrease in \ngross profit percentage of 870 basis points, to 34.2%, partially offset by the aforementioned increase in revenues. The unfavorable gross \nprofit percentage was due to macro-economic headwinds including: continued disruptions in the global supply chain, the escalation of \nincreased commodity costs, increased year-over-year labor rates across the Company, as well as widespread delays and increased costs \nfor inbound and outbound shipping, including an acceleration in fuel surcharges related to rising oil prices, and the write-off of certain \ninventories of expired perishable products, reflecting softer than anticipated demand levels, as well as certain product mix shift into \nlower margins channels, partially offset by pricing initiatives and increased average order value. \n  \nGross profit increased by 23.0% during fiscal 2021, due to the increase in revenues noted above, as well as an increase in gross profit \npercentage of 40 basis points, to 42.9%. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to lower promotions, \nmerchandise assortment, channel mix, and fixed cost efficiency, partially offset by higher transportation costs due to surcharges and \nexpedited ship methods, as well as increased labor costs.  \n  \n35"

At July 3, 2022, the Company had working capital of $82.5 \nmillion, including cash and cash equivalents of $31.5 million, compared to working capital of $134.1 million, including cash and cash \nequivalents of $173.6 million at June 27, 2021. \n  \nAs of July 3, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Company’s Revolver. \n  \nDue to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business, and its continued expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through \nChristmas holiday season, which falls within the Company’s second fiscal quarter, generates over 40% of the Company’s annual \nrevenues. Since the onset of the pandemic of the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”), our customers have turned to our brands \nand our expanded product offerings to help them connect and express themselves. While the continuing impacts of COVID-19 are \ndifficult to predict, the Company expects that its fiscal second quarter will continue to be its largest in terms of revenues, and the \nCompany will likely generate all of its earnings within this quarter. Due to the number of major floral gifting occasions, including \nMother's Day, Valentine’s Day, Easter and Administrative Professionals Week, revenues also have historically risen during the \nCompany’s fiscal third and fourth quarters in comparison to its fiscal first quarter. \n  \nThe Company utilized cash on hand to fund its operations through the first quarter of fiscal 2022. In the beginning of the second quarter, \nthe Company borrowed under its Revolver to fund short-term working capital needs, and the acquisition of Vital Choice, with borrowings \npeaking at $125.0 million in November 2021. Cash generated from operations during the Christmas holiday shopping season enabled \nthe Company to repay the borrowings under the Revolver in December 2021. Based on current projected cash flows, the Company \nexpects to borrow against its Revolver to fund pre-holiday manufacturing and inventory purchases during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. \nThe Company expects to be able to repay all working capital borrowings prior to the end of the second quarter in fiscal 2023. \n  \nWhile we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve \nmonths, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. We continually evaluate, and will, \nfrom time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, \nand technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to require additional financing. \n  \nTo date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information \ncurrently available to us, we do not expect the impact of COVID-19 to have a negative impact on our liquidity. We will continue to \nmonitor and assess the impact COVID-19 may have on our business and financial results. See Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Part \nII. Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further information. \n  \nCash Flows  \n  \nNet cash provided by operating activities of $5.2 million for the fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to the Company’s net income, \nadjusted for non-cash charges including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, offset by the accelerated timing \nof our seasonal inventory build to support holiday sales. \n  \nNet cash used in investing activities of $89.7 million was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Vital Choice and Alice’s Table for \na combined $21.3 million, and capital expenditures of $66.4 million related to the Company's technology initiatives, as well as \nmanufacturing production and warehousing equipment. \n  \nNet cash used in financing activities of $57.6 million related to net repayment of notes payable of $20.0 million, and the acquisition of \n$38.2 million of treasury stock. \n  \nStock Repurchase Program \n  \nSeeItem 5 in Part II for details. \n  \n39"

      "text": "Table of Contents \n  \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n  \nThe Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial \nstatements of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting \nprinciples. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \namount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management evaluates its \nestimates on an ongoing basis, and bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are \nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or \nconditions. We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both: (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the \nlevels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption \nis material to the Company’s financial condition. Our critical accounting policies relate to goodwill, other intangible assets and income \ntaxes. Management of the Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit \ncommittee of the Company’s board of directors. \n  \nGoodwill \n  \nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in each business combination, with \nthe carrying value of the Company’s goodwill allocated to its reporting units, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. \nGoodwill is not amortized, but it is subject to an annual assessment for impairment, which the Company performs during the fourth \nquarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. \nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether \nthe components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of \neach reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components. \n  \nIn applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative test (also known as “Step 0”) or a \nquantitative test ( “Step 1”). Under the Step 0 test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely \nthan not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, \neconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other \nentity and reporting unit specific events. If after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is “more-likely-than-not” \nthat the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then performing the Step 1 quantitative test is necessary. \n  \nStep 1 of the quantitative test requires comparison of the fair value of each of the reporting units to the respective carrying value. If the \ncarrying value of the reporting unit is less than the fair value, no impairment exists. Otherwise, the Company would recognize an \nimpairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill \nallocated to that reporting unit. \n  \nThe Company generally estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches. The \nCompany uses industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management. \nUnder the income approach, the Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant \nestimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, \nperpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, the Company uses the guideline public \ncompany method. Under this method the Company utilizes information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar \noperating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance \nof the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. The Company also reconciles the aggregate fair values \nof its reporting units determined in the first step (as described above) to its current market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable \ncontrol premium. \n  \nThe assessment of the recoverability of goodwill contains uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply \njudgment to estimate economic factors and the profitability of future operations. The Company’s stock price, and resulting market \ncapitalization reconciliation, are subject to the Company’s financial performance, as well as fluctuations in the equity market resulting \nfrom economic, geo-political, consumer-confidence, inflation, natural disasters and pandemics. Actual results could differ from these \nassumptions and projections, resulting in us revising our assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. \n  \nFor further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for Goodwill, \nseeNote 2and Note 6 in Part IV, Item 15 \n  \nOther Intangibles, net \n  \nOther intangibles consist of definite-lived intangible assets (such as investment in licenses, customer lists, and others) and indefinite-\nlived intangible assets (such as acquired trade names and trademarks). The cost of definite-lived intangible assets is amortized to reflect \nthe pattern of economic benefits consumed, over the estimated periods benefited, ranging from 3 to 16 years, while indefinite-lived \nintangible assets are not amortized. \n  \n41"

      "text": "Table of Contents \n  \nDefinite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying \namounts are not recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing \nprojected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the projected \nundiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying \nvalue over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows. \n  \nThe Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter, or whenever changes in \ncircumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. In applying the impairment test, the Company has \nthe option to perform a qualitative test (also known as “Step 0”) or a quantitative test. Under the Step 0 test, the Company assesses \nqualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. Qualitative factors \nmay include, but are not limited to economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, financial performance, legal \nand other entity and asset specific events. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is “more-likely-than-\nnot” that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then performing the quantitative test is necessary. The quantitative impairment \ntest for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the \nfair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, impairment is recognized for the difference. To determine \nfair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company uses an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method. This method \nassumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable \nasset. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets’ fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets’ estimated cash \nflows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value. \n  \nThe assessment of the recoverability of intangible assets contains uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply \njudgment to estimate economic factors and the profitability of future operations. Actual results could differ from these assumptions and \nprojections, resulting in us revising our assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. \n  \nFor further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for other intangibles, \nsee Note 2 and Note 6 in Part IV, Item 15. \n  \nIncome Taxes \n  \nThe Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. The Company has established deferred tax assets and \nliabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of its assets and liabilities at enacted \ntax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled. The Company recognizes as a deferred tax asset, \nthe tax benefits associated with losses related to operations. Realization of these deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to \ngenerate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized. The factors that the Company considers in assessing the \nlikelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented \nto realize the deferred tax assets. \n  \nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be \nsustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the \nfinancial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than a 50% likelihood of \nbeing realized upon settlement. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits (“UTBs”) is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and \ncircumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new \ninformation obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where \nappropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the \n“more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes.

The Company generally invests its cash and cash equivalents in investment grade corporate and U.S. \ngovernment securities. Due to the currently low rates of return the Company is receiving on its cash equivalents, the potential for a \nsignificant decrease in short-term interest rates is low and, therefore, a further decrease would not have a material impact on the \nCompany’s interest income. Borrowings under the Company’s credit facility bear interest at a variable rate, plus an applicable margin, \nand therefore expose the Company to market risk for changes in interest rates.

Internal control over \nfinancial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision \nof, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effectuated by the Company’s board of directors, management \nand other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial \nstatements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), and includes those \npolicies and procedures that: \n  \n● \npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the \nassets of the Company; \n  \n● \nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance \nwith U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made in accordance with authorization of \nmanagement and directors of the Company; and \n  \n● \nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the \nCompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n  \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any \nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, \nor that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n  \nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the \nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by \nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management \nconcluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of July 3, 2022, because of the material \nweakness described below. \n  \nBased on the COSO criteria, management identified control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness. A “material weakness” is \na deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is more than a reasonable \npossibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a \ntimely basis. The following material weakness was identified: \n  \nMaterial Weakness Related to Information Technology General Controls \n  \nDuring the year ended July 3, 2022, we identified deficiencies related to the design of our controls over logical access and segregation \nof duties, at the application control level, in certain information technology environments. \n  \nManagement has taken steps to remediate these deficiencies, including redesigning the logical access and placing enhanced segregation \nof duties, enhancing its internal documentation and monitoring approach to ensure that all procedures designed to restrict access to \napplications and data are operating in an optimal manner in order to provide management with comfort that access is properly limited \nto the appropriate internal personnel. Management began to implement these remedial steps during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. In \naccordance with our internal control compliance program, a material weakness is not considered remediated until the remediation \nprocesses have been operational for a sufficient period of time and successfully tested. \n  \nThe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, LLP, audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal \ncontrol over financial reporting as of July 3, 2022.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting \nbased on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the \nCompany in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the PCAOB. \n  \nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards \nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting \nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, \nassessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control \nbased on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. \nWe believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n  \nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a \nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or \ndetected on a timely basis. A material weakness regarding management’s failure to maintain effective controls over the logical access \nand segregation of duties at the application control level in certain information technology environments has been identified and \ndescribed in management’s assessment.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the \nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the \ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in \naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention \nor timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the \nfinancial statements. \n  \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

      "text": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n  \n  \nBoard of Directors and Stockholders \n1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. \nJericho, NY \n  \nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements \n  \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as \nof July 3, 2022 and June 27, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and \ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 3, 2022, and the related notes and schedule (collectively referred to as the \n“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the \nfinancial position of the Company at July 3, 2022 and June 27, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the \nthree years in the period ended July 3, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n  \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), \nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting as of July 3, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated \nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated \nSeptember 16, 2022 expressed an adverse opinion thereon. \n  \nBasis for Opinion \n  \nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion \non the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in \naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission \nand the PCAOB. \n  \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit \nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to \nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial \nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, \non a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included \nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation \nof the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n  \nCritical Audit Matter \n  \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements \nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and that: (1) relates to accounts \nor disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements; and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or \ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial \nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the \ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n  \nValuation of goodwill related to the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets Reporting Unit \n  \nAs described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $213.3 million at \nJuly 3, 2022, which was allocated between three reporting units. The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the \ncomparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Management assesses goodwill impairment annually in the \nfourth quarter. The Company prepared the valuations of the reporting units for the annual assessment using an equal weighting of the \nincome and market approaches, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and \nforecasts of future revenue and earnings. \n  \nF1"

      "text": "Table of Contents \n  \nWe identified the valuation of goodwill for the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets reporting unit during the annual impairment assessment \nas a critical audit matter. Auditing management’s impairment tests for its reporting units are complex and highly judgmental due to the \nsignificant estimation required in determining the fair value of the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets reporting unit. The determination of \nthe fair value of the Gourmet Foods and Gift Baskets reporting unit is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as the estimated future \nlevels of gross and operating profits, which are affected by expected future market and economic conditions. Auditing management’s \nimpairment assessment involved especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment due to the uncertainty surrounding future events \nand the extent of specialized skill required to test certain valuation inputs. \n  \nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: \n  \n•         Evaluating the reasonableness of assumptions used in the Company’s analysis, including the revenue growth rate, profit margins, \nand the macroeconomic and inflationary impacts, such as shipping costs and cost of logistics that is expected to have an impact on the \nCompany’s performance and this reporting unit by: (i) comparing to historical results and industry trends, (ii) assessing the \nreasonableness of management's expected timing to return to historical profitability levels, and (iii) comparing the actual results for the \nhistorical years to the projections that management used for their assessment. \n  \n•         Testing the accuracy and completeness of the data used by management to develop its projections. \n  \n•         Utilizing personnel with specialized skills and knowledge in valuation approach and methodologies to assist in: (i) assessing the \nappropriateness of the fair value methodology, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain assumptions used, including the discount \nrate. \n  \nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2014. \n  \n/s/ BDO USA, LLP \n  \n  \nMelville, New York \nSeptember 16, 2022 \n  \nF2"

Significant Accounting Policies \n  \nBasis of Presentation \n  \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant \nintercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net revenues from international sources \nwere not material during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n  \nFiscal Year \n  \nThe Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to June 30. Fiscal year 2022, which ended on July \n3, 2022, consisted of 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2021 and 2020, which ended on June 27, 2021 and June 28, 2020, respectively, each \nconsisted of 52 weeks. \n  \nUse of Estimates \n  \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make \nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could \ndiffer from those estimates. \n  \nCash and Cash Equivalents \n  \nCash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits with banks, highly liquid money market funds, United States government \nsecurities, overnight repurchase agreements and commercial paper with maturities of three months or less when purchased. \n  \nInventories \n  \nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method of accounting. \n  \nProperty, Plant and Equipment \n  \nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation expense is computed \nusing the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives. Amortization of leasehold improvements and capital leases is \ncomputed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives and the initial lease terms. The Company \ncapitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or develop internal-use software. Capitalized software costs are \namortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. Orchards in production, consisting of direct labor and \nmaterials, supervision and other items, are capitalized as part of capital projects in progress – orchards until the orchards produce fruit \nin commercial quantities, at which time they are reclassified to orchards in production. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed, \nand where appropriate, changes are made prospectively. \n  \nF7"

      "text": "Table of Contents \n  \nThe Company’s property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the following estimated lives: \n  \nBuilding and building improvements (years) \n  \n10 - 40 \nLeasehold improvements (years) \n  \n3 - 10 \nFurniture, fixtures and production equipment (years) \n  \n43 - 20 \nSoftware (years) \n  \n3 - 7 \nOrchards in production and land improvements (years) \n  \n15 - 45 \n  \nProperty, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying \namounts are not recoverable. \n  \nGoodwill \n  \nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in each business combination, with \nthe carrying value of the Company’s goodwill allocated to its reporting units, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. \nGoodwill is not amortized, but it is subject to an annual assessment for impairment, which the Company performs during the fourth \nquarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. \nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether \nthe components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of \neach reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components. \n  \nIn applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative test (also known as “Step 0”) or a \nquantitative test ( “Step 1”). Under the Step 0 test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely \nthan not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, \neconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other \nentity and reporting unit specific events. If after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is “more-likely-than-not” \nthat the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then performing the Step 1 quantitative test is necessary. \n  \nStep 1 of the quantitative test requires comparison of the fair value of each of the reporting units to the respective carrying value. If the \ncarrying value of the reporting unit is less than the fair value, no impairment exists. Otherwise, the Company would recognize an \nimpairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill \nallocated to that reporting unit. \n  \nThe Company generally estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches. The \nCompany uses industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management. \nUnder the income approach, the Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant \nestimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, \nperpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, the Company uses the guideline public \ncompany method. Under this method the Company utilizes information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar \noperating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance \nof the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. The Company also reconciles the aggregate fair values \nof its reporting units determined in the first step (as described above) to its current market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable \ncontrol premium. \n  \nDuring fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the Company performed a Step 0 analysis and determined that it was not “more likely than not” that \nthe fair values of its reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. During the year-ended July 3, 2022, the Company experienced \na sustained decline in its share price and a resulting decrease in its market capitalization, primarily due to the overall macroeconomic \nenvironment. Inflationary cost increases, which began during the earlier half of our fiscal year, were exacerbated by the war in the \nUkraine, further pressuring the Company’s gross margin and operating expenses. Due to this overall market decline and the Company’s \noperating performance, the Company performed a Step 1 analysis, quantitatively comparing the fair value of our three reporting units \n(only our Consumer Floral & Gifts and Gourmet Food & Gift Basket reporting units currently bear goodwill) to their respective carrying \namounts. As of July 3, 2022, utilizing an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, and a discount rate of 14%, the fair \nvalues of the Consumer Floral & Gifts and Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by \napproximately $128 million and $40 million, respectively. \n  \nF8"

      "text": "Table of Contents \n  \nThe assessment of the recoverability of goodwill contains uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply \njudgment to estimate economic factors and the profitability of future operations. Actual results could differ from these assumptions and \nprojections, resulting in us revising our assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. \n  \nOther Intangibles, net \n  \nOther intangibles consist of definite-lived intangible assets (such as investment in licenses, customer lists, and others) and indefinite-\nlived intangible assets (such as acquired trade names and trademarks). The cost of definite-lived intangible assets is amortized to reflect \nthe pattern of economic benefits consumed, over the estimated periods benefited, ranging from 3 to 16 years, while indefinite-lived \nintangible assets are not amortized. \n  \nDefinite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying \namounts are not recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing \nprojected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the projected \nundiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying \nvalue over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows. \n  \nThe Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter, or whenever changes in \ncircumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. In applying the impairment test, the Company has \nthe option to perform a qualitative test (also known as “Step 0”) or a quantitative test. Under the Step 0 test, the Company assesses \nqualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. Qualitative factors \nmay include, but are not limited to economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, financial performance, legal \nand other entity and asset specific events. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is “more-likely-than-\nnot” that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then performing the quantitative test is necessary. The quantitative impairment \ntest for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the \nfair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, impairment is recognized for the difference. To determine \nfair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company uses an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method. This method \nassumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable \nasset. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets’ fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets’ estimated cash \nflows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value. \n  \nDuring fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the Company performed a Step 0 analysis and determined that it was not “more likely than not” that \nthe fair values of the indefinite-lived intangibles were less than their carrying amounts. \n  \nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company performed a quantitative test, which determined that the estimated fair value of the Company's \nintangibles exceeded their respective carrying value in all material respects. Future changes in the estimates and assumptions above \ncould materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of intangibles. \n  \nThe assessment of the recoverability of intangible assets contains uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply \njudgment to estimate economic factors and the profitability of future operations. Actual results could differ from these assumptions and \nprojections, resulting in us revising our assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. \n  \nBusiness Combinations  \n  \nThe Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with ASC Topic 805, which requires, among other things, the acquiring \nentity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed; the recognition of \nacquisition-related costs in the consolidated results of operations; the recognition of restructuring costs in the consolidated results of \noperations for which the acquirer becomes obligated after the acquisition date; and contingent purchase consideration to be recognized \nat their fair values on the acquisition date with subsequent adjustments recognized in the consolidated results of operations. The fair \nvalues assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired are determined primarily by using an income approach, which is based on \nassumptions and estimates made by management. Significant assumptions utilized in the income approach are based on company \nspecific information and projections which are not observable in the market and are therefore considered Level 3 measurements. The \nexcess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identified assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Operating results of the \nacquired entity are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from date of acquisition. \n  \nF9"

The aggregate carrying amount of the Company’s cost method investments \nwas $3.5 million as of July 3, 2022 and $4.6 million as of June 27, 2021.  \n  \nEquity investments with a readily determinable fair value \n  \nThe Company also holds certain trading securities associated with its Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (“NQDC Plan”). \nThese investments are measured using quoted market prices at the reporting date and are included within the “Other assets” line item in \nthe consolidated balance sheets (see Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements). \n  \nConcentration of Credit Risk \n  \nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and \ncash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions. \nConcentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the Company's large number of customers and their \ndispersion throughout the United States, and the fact that a substantial portion of receivables are related to balances owed by major \ncredit card companies. Allowances relating to consumer, corporate and franchise accounts receivable ($2.4 million at July 3, 2022 and \n$4.0 million at June 27, 2021) have been recorded based upon previous experience and management’s evaluation. \n  \nRevenue Recognition \n  \nNet revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by discounts and estimates for credits \nand returns (calculated based upon previous experience and management’s evaluation). Service and outbound shipping charged to \ncustomers are recognized at the time the related merchandise revenues are recognized and are included in net revenues. Inbound and \noutbound shipping and delivery costs are included in cost of revenues. Net revenues exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from \ncustomers. \n  \nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows: \n  \n- \nE-commerce revenues - consumer products sold through our online and telephonic channels. Revenue is recognized when \ncontrol of the merchandise is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Payment is typically due prior \nto the date of shipment. \n  \n- \nRetail revenues - consumer products sold through our retail stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is \ntransferred to the customer, at the point of sale, at which time payment is received. \n  \n- \nWholesale revenues - products sold to our wholesale customers for subsequent resale. Revenue is recognized when control of \nthe goods is transferred to the customer, in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreement. Payment terms are typically \n30 days from the date control over the product is transferred to the customer. \n  \n- \nBloomNet Services - membership fees as well as other service offerings to florists. Membership and other subscription-based \nfees are recognized monthly as earned. Services revenues related to orders sent through the floral network are variable, based \non either the number of orders or the value of orders, and are recognized in the period in which the orders are delivered. The \ncontracts within BloomNet Services are typically month-to-month and as a result no consideration allocation is necessary \nacross multiple reporting periods. Payment is typically due less than 30 days from the date the services were performed.  \n  \nF10"

As such, customer orders are recorded as deferred revenue prior to shipment or rendering of product or services. Deferred \nrevenues primarily relate to e-commerce orders placed, but not shipped, prior to the end of the fiscal period, as well as for subscription \nprograms, including our various food, wine, and plant-of-the-month clubs and our Celebrations Passport® program. \n  \nOur total deferred revenue as of June 27, 2021 was $33.4 million (included in “Accrued expenses” on our consolidated balance sheets), \nof which, $32.8 million was recognized as revenue during the year ended July 3, 2022. The deferred revenue balance as of July 3, 2022 \nwas $33.7 million. \n  \nCost of Revenues \n  \nCost of revenues consists primarily of florist fulfillment costs (fees paid directly to florists), the cost of floral and non-floral merchandise \nsold from inventory or through third parties, and associated costs, including inbound and outbound shipping charges. Additionally, cost \nof revenues includes labor and facility costs related to manufacturing and production operations. \n  \nMarketing and Sales \n  \nMarketing and sales expense consists primarily of advertising expenses, catalog costs, online portal and search expenses, retail store and \nfulfillment operations (other than costs included in cost of revenues), and customer service center expenses, as well as the operating \nexpenses of the Company’s departments engaged in marketing, selling and merchandising activities. \n  \nThe Company expenses all advertising costs, with the exception of catalog costs (see Deferred Catalog Costs above), at the time the \nadvertisement is first shown. Advertising expense was $347.7 million, $307.9 million and $171.4 million for the years ended July 3, \n2022, June 27, 2021 and June 28, 2020, respectively. \n  \nTechnology and Development \n  \nTechnology and development expense consists primarily of payroll and operating expenses of the Company’s information technology \ngroup, costs associated with its websites, including hosting, content development and maintenance and support costs related to the \nCompany’s order entry, customer service, fulfillment and database systems. Costs associated with the acquisition or development of \nsoftware for internal use are capitalized if the software is expected to have a useful life beyond one year and amortized over the software’s \nuseful life, typically three to seven years. Costs associated with repair maintenance or the development of website content are expensed \nas incurred, as the useful lives of such software modifications are less than one year. \n  \nStock-Based Compensation \n  \nThe Company records compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards and other forms of equity compensation based \nupon the fair value of stock-based awards as measured at the grant date. The cost associated with share-based awards that are subject \nsolely to time-based vesting requirements is recognized over the awards’ service period for the entire award on a straight-line basis. The \ncost associated with performance-based equity awards is recognized for each tranche over the service period, based on an assessment of \nthe likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved. \n  \nDerivatives and Hedging \n  \nThe Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes, but rather, on occasion to manage its exposure to interest \nrate fluctuations. When entering into these transactions, the Company has periodically managed its floating rate debt using interest rate \nswaps in order to reduce its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash \noutflows for interest. The Company did not have any open derivative positions at July 3, 2022 and June 27, 2021. \n  \nF11"

      "text": "Table of Contents \n  \nIncome Taxes \n  \nThe Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. The Company has established deferred tax assets and \nliabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of its assets and liabilities at enacted \ntax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled. The Company recognizes as a deferred tax asset, \nthe tax benefits associated with losses related to operations. Realization of these deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to \ngenerate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized. The factors that the Company considers in assessing the \nlikelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented \nto realize the deferred tax assets. \n  \nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be \nsustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the \nfinancial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being \nrealized upon settlement. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits (“UTBs”) is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and \ncircumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new \ninformation obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where \nappropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the \n“more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes.  \n  \nNet Income Per Share \n  \nBasic net income per common share is computed by dividing the net income during the period by the weighted average number of \ncommon shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing the net income during \nthe period by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and the potential dilutive \ncommon shares (consisting of employee stock options and unvested restricted stock awards). \n  \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted \n  \nFinancial Instruments – Measurement of Credit Losses. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-\nCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 introduces a new forward-looking \n“expected loss” approach, to estimate credit losses on most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade receivables. \nThe estimate of expected credit losses requires entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and \nreasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to \nunderstand the entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. We adopted ASU 2016-13 for the \nCompany’s fiscal 2021 (quarter ending September 27, 2020), using the modified-retrospective approach. There was no material impact \nof adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. \n  \nGoodwill – Impairment Test. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): \nSimplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\" which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, an \nentity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up \nto the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We adopted this guidance for the Company’s fiscal 2021 (quarter ending \nSeptember 27, 2020), on a prospective basis. There was no material impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial \nstatements. \n  \nCOVID-19 \n  \nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law. The CARES Act provided \na substantial stimulus and assistance package intended to address the impact of COVID-19, including tax relief and government loans, \ngrants and investments. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements during \nfiscal 2022 and 2021. \n  \nF12"

Raw materials inventory was valued at book value, as there have not been any significant price fluctuations \nor other events that would materially change the cost to replace the raw materials. \n  \nOf the acquired intangible assets, $4.5 million was assigned to customer lists, which is being amortized over the estimated remaining \nlife of 5 years, $5.3 million was assigned to tradenames (indefinite life), and $4.4 million was assigned to goodwill (indefinite life), \nwhich is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill recognized is primarily related to synergistic value created in terms \nof both operating costs and revenue growth opportunities, enhanced financial and operational scale, and other strategic benefits. \n  \nThe estimated fair value of the acquired tradenames was determined using the relief from royalty method, which is a risk-adjusted \ndiscounted cash flow approach. The relief from royalty method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through \nownership of the asset. The relief from royalty method requires identifying the future revenue that would be generated by the trademark, \nmultiplying it by a royalty rate deemed to be avoided through ownership of the asset and discounting the projected royalty savings \namounts back to the acquisition date. The royalty rate used in the valuation was based on a consideration of market rates for similar \ncategories of assets. The discount rate used in the valuation was based on the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, the riskiness \nof the earnings stream associated with the trademarks and the overall composition of the acquired assets. \n  \nThe estimated fair value of the acquired customer lists was determined using the excess earnings method under the income approach. \nThis method requires identifying the future revenue that would be generated by existing customers at the time of the acquisition, \nconsidering an appropriate attrition rate based on the historical experience of the Company. Appropriate expenses are then deducted \nfrom the revenues and economic rents are charged for the return on contributory assets. The after-tax cash flows attributable to the asset \nare discounted back to their net present value at an appropriate intangible asset rate of return and summed to calculate the value of the \ncustomer lists. \n  \nOperating results of the Vital Choice business are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of \nacquisition within the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented, as the impact \non the Company’s consolidated financial results was not material. \n  \nF17"

The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of July 3, 2022. The Existing Credit Agreement is \nsecured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. \n  \nFuture principal payments under the Term Loan and 2020 Term Loan, in the aggregate, are as follows: $20.0 million – fiscal 2023 and \n$145.0 million – fiscal 2024. \n   \n  \nNote 10. Fair Value Measurements \n  \nCash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, prepaids, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reflected in the consolidated \nbalance sheets at carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Although no trading \nmarket exists, the Company believes that the carrying amount of its debt approximates fair value due to its variable nature. The \nCompany’s investments in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies are carried at cost and are periodically assessed for \nother-than-temporary impairment, when an event or circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have \noccurred. The Company’s remaining financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value (see table below). The \nCompany’s non-financial assets, such as definite lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost and are \nassessed for impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred. \nGoodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events occur or circumstances change \nsuch that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist, as required under the accounting standards. \n  \nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous \nmarket for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The authoritative \nguidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure \nfair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level \n1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy \nunder the guidance are described below: \n  \n  \nLevel 1 \nValuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to \naccess. \n  \nF21"

At  July 3, 2022, the Company has an unrecognized tax benefit, including accrued interest and penalties, of \napproximately $1.4 million. The Company believes that $0.2 million of the unrecognized tax positions will be resolved over the \nnext twelve months. \n   \n  \nNote 12.

      "text": "Table of Contents \n   \n  \nNote 16. Leases \n  \nThe Company currently leases plants, warehouses, offices, store facilities, and equipment under various leases through fiscal 2036. \nWhile most lease agreements are of a long-term nature (over a year), the Company also enters into short-term leases, primarily for \nseasonal needs. Lease agreements may contain renewal options and rent escalation clauses and require the Company to pay real estate \ntaxes, insurance, common area maintenance and operating expenses applicable to the leased properties. The Company accounts for its \nleases in accordance with ASC 842. At contract inception, we determine whether a contract is, or contains, a lease by determining \nwhether it conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time, by assessing whether we have the right to \nobtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset, and the right to direct the use of the identified asset. \n  \nAt the lease commencement date, we determine if a lease should be classified as an operating or a finance lease (we currently have no \nfinance leases) and recognize a corresponding lease liability and a right-of-use asset on our Balance Sheet. The lease liability is initially \nand subsequently measured as the present value of the remaining fixed minimum rental payments (including base rent and fixed common \narea maintenance) using discount rates as of the commencement date. Variable payments (including most utilities, real estate taxes, \ninsurance and variable common area maintenance) are expensed as incurred. Further, we elected a short-term lease exception policy, \npermitting us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of 12 months or less) \nand an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets. The right-\nof-use asset is initially and subsequently measured at the carrying amount of the lease liability adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease \npayments, remaining balance of lease incentives received, unamortized initial direct costs, or impairment charges relating to the right-\nof-use asset. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment using the long-lived assets impairment guidance. The discount rate used to \ndetermine the present value of lease payments is our estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate, based on the yield curve for \nthe respective lease terms, as we generally cannot determine the interest rate implicit in the lease. \n  \nWe recognize expense for our operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As these leases expire, it can be expected that \nin the normal course of business they will be renewed or replaced. Renewal option periods are included in the measurement of lease \nliability, where the exercise is reasonably certain to occur. Key estimates and judgments in accounting for leases include how we \ndetermine: (1) lease payments, (2) lease term, and (3) the discount rate used in calculating the lease liability. \n  \nAdditional information related to our leases is as follows: \n  \n  \n  \nYears Ended \n  \n  \n  \nJuly 3, 2022 \n    \nJune 27, 2021 \n  \n  \n  \n(in thousands) \n  \nLease costs: \n      \n        \n  \nOperating lease costs \n  $ \n19,402    $ \n14,308  \nVariable lease costs \n    \n21,823      \n19,342  \nShort-term lease cost \n    \n5,224      \n6,639  \nSublease income \n    \n(751 )     \n(812 ) \nTotal lease costs \n  $ \n45,698    $ \n39,477  \n  \n  \n  \nYears Ended \n  \n  \n  \nJuly 3, 2022     June 27, 2021   \n  \n  \n(in thousands) \n  \nCash paid for amounts included in measurement of operating lease liabilities \n  $ \n16,486    $ \n14,802  \nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities \n  $ \n57,494    $ \n30,622  \n  \n  \n  July 3, 2022     June 27, 2021   \n  \n  \n(in thousands) \n  \nWeighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases (in years) \n    \n9.5      \n8.7  \nWeighted-discount rate - operating leases \n    \n3.9 %    \n3.8 % \n  \nF29"

Commitments and Contingencies \n  \nOther Commitments \n  \nThe Company’s purchase commitments consist primarily of inventory, equipment and technology (hardware and software) purchase \norders made in the ordinary course of business, most of which have terms less than one year. As of July 3, 2022, the Company had fixed \nand determinable off-balance sheet purchase commitments with remaining terms in excess of one year of approximately $20.6 million, \nprimarily related to the Company’s technology infrastructure and inventory commitments. \n  \nThe Company had approximately $2.3 million in unused stand-by letters of credit as of July 3, 2022 and June 27, 2021. \n  \nLitigation \n  \nBed Bath & Beyond:  \n  \nOn April 1, 2020, the Seller commenced an action against the Company in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware, which is \ncaptioned Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. v. 1-800-Flowers.com, et ano., C.A. (the “Complaint”), alleging a breach of the Equity Purchase \nAgreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated February 14, 2020, between Seller, PersonalizationMall, the Company and the Purchaser, \npursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell to Purchaser, and the Purchaser agreed to purchase from Seller, all of the issued and \noutstanding membership interests of PersonalizationMall. The action was initiated after the Company requested a reasonable delay of \nthe closing under the Purchase Agreement due to the unprecedented circumstances created by COVID-19. The Complaint requested an \norder of specific performance to consummate the transaction under the Purchase Agreement plus attorney’s fees and costs in connection \nwith the action. The Company filed its answer to the Complaint on April 17, 2020 and an order governing expedited proceedings was \napproved on April 9, 2020 that set a trial date for late September 2020. On July 21, 2020, the Company and Seller entered into a \nsettlement agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to move forward with its purchase of PersonalizationMall for $245.0 \nmillion, subject to certain working capital and other adjustments. The transaction closed on August 3, 2020. In connection with the \nsettlement agreement, the parties executed a Stipulation and Proposed Order of Dismissal, resulting in the voluntary dismissal with \nprejudice of the litigation relating to the transaction. \n  \nCall Center Worker Claim: \n  \nIn March of 2018, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against a subsidiary of the Company (the “Subsidiary”) in the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Oregon, Medford Division (the “Court”), alleging violations of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) \nand Oregon state law. The complaint was brought on behalf of a putative class of call center workers and alleged that certain Subsidiary \npolicies and practices resulted in class members’ performance of unpaid work. The plaintiff sought class certification, compensation for \nalleged unpaid and underpaid wages, civil penalties, prejudgment interest, liquidated damages, litigation costs, and attorneys’ fees. \nFollowing mediation, the parties reached an agreement in April 2022 to resolve all claims. The settlement agreement remains subject to \ncertain judicial approvals. The Subsidiary’s payment liability under the settlement agreement is capped at a maximum amount of $3.3 \nmillion, and the amount payable will depend on the number of claims filed by class members and the amounts of attorneys’ fees and \nlitigation costs approved by the Court. We anticipate that final Court approval, and determination and payment of the final settlement \namount, may occur during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. In entering into the settlement agreement, the Subsidiary is making no \nadmission of liability.  \n  \nIn addition, there are various claims, lawsuits, and pending actions against the Company and its subsidiaries incident to the operations \nof its businesses. It is the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, that the final resolution of such claims, lawsuits and \npending actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or \nliquidity. \nF30"
