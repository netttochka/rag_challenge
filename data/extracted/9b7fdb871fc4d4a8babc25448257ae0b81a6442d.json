You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in our Annual Report \non Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022 (our “Annual Report”) and in subsequent reports filed on Form 6-K, including our consolidated \nfinancial statements and the related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are those significant risk factors, currently known and specific to us, \nthat we believe are relevant to our business, results of operations and financial condition. If any of these risks materialize, our business, results of \noperations or financial condition could suffer and the price of the ADSs could decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that \nwe now deem immaterial may also harm us and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n \nSummary of Risk Factors\n           An investment in our ADSs is subject to a number of risks, including risks related to our business and industry, risks related to development of our \nproduct candidates, and risks related to our ADSs. The following summarizes some, but not all, of these risks. Please carefully consider all of the \ninformation discussed in our Annual Report and in subsequent reports filed on Form 6-K for a more thorough description of these and other risks.\n \nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n•\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve \nor maintain profitability.\n•\nWe depend heavily on the success of our product candidates NUC-3373 and NUC-7738. We cannot give any assurance that these product \ncandidates will receive regulatory approval for any indication, which is necessary before any of them can be commercialized. If we, and any \ncollaborators with whom we may enter into agreements for the development and commercialization of any of these product candidates, are \nunable to commercialize them, or experience significant delays in doing so, our ability to generate revenue and our financial condition will be \nadversely affected.\n•\nOur lack of any approved products may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future \nviability.\n2"

      "text": "•\nOur business could be significantly and adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n•\nExchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n \nRisks Related to Development of Our Product Candidates\n•\nInitial success in the ongoing and completed early-stage clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained when these trials are \ncompleted or in later stage trials.\n•\nDrug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays \nin completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and may experience delays in obtaining, or ultimately be unable to \nobtain, the approval of our product candidates.\n•\nDue to our limited resources and access to capital, we must, and have in the past decided to, prioritize development of certain ProTide \ncandidates over other potential candidates and certain indications over other potential indications. These decisions may prove to have been \nwrong and may adversely affect our performance.\n•\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use and expand our technology platform to build a pipeline of additional ProTide candidates.\n \nRisks Related to Marketing Approval of Our Product Candidates\n•\nIf we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required marketing approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our \nproduct candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be impaired.\n•\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their marketing approval, limit the commercial profile \nof an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\n•\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to extensive post-marketing regulatory requirements and \ncould be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with \nregulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\n \nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties \n•\nWe rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, third parties to conduct our clinical trials for our product candidates. If these third parties do not \nsuccessfully carry out their contractual duties, comply with regulatory requirements or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain \nmarketing approval for or commercialize our product candidates, and our business could be substantially harmed. \n•\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture and shipment of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials and expect \nto continue to do so for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our \nproduct candidates or drugs or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or \ncommercialization efforts.\n•\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our license and collaboration agreement with Cardiff ProTides Ltd., we could lose rights to \nlicensed and assigned intellectual property that are necessary for developing and commercializing certain potential product candidates.\n \nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\n•\nEven if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, \npatients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\n•\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products before or more \nsuccessfully than we do.\n•\nEven if we are able to commercialize any product candidates, such drugs may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-\nparty coverage and reimbursement policies.\n3"

While the scope of regulatory approval is similar in many countries, to obtain separate regulatory approval in multiple \ncountries requires us to comply with the numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, \namong other things, clinical trials, commercial sales, pricing and distribution of NUC-3373 and NUC-7738, and we cannot predict success in these \njurisdictions.\n \n           Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit \nover existing treatments may receive accelerated approval from the FDA and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials \nestablishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or an effect on an intermediate \nclinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality.

Drug products marketed under an \naccelerated approval NDA also are subject to a requirement that all promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA at least 30 days prior to their \ndissemination. The FDA could seek to withdraw accelerated approval for multiple reasons, including if we fail to conduct the required post-marketing \nstudy with due diligence, the post-marketing study fails to verify the product’s clinical benefit, other evidence shows that the product is not safe or effective \nunder the conditions of use, or we disseminate promotional materials that are found by the FDA to be false and misleading.\n \nOur lack of any approved products may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\n \n           Biopharmaceutical drug development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. Our operations to date have been \nlimited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates, \nundertaking preclinical studies, and conducting clinical trials of our product candidates. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete \nlarge-scale, randomized, pivotal clinical trials compared to standards of care, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale product, or \narrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Typically, it \ntakes several years to develop one new drug from the time it is discovered to when it is available for treating patients. In addition, we may encounter \nunforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We will need to transition from a company with a research \nand development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition.\n \nWe will require substantial additional funding which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional financing, \nwe may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or continue our development programs.\n \n           The development of pharmaceutical drugs is capital-intensive. We expect our expenses to increase with our ongoing activities, particularly as we \nconduct larger-scale clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our \nproduct candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We may \nalso need to raise additional funds sooner if we choose to pursue additional indications or geographies for our product candidates or otherwise expand more \nrapidly than we presently anticipate. Furthermore, we will continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need \nto obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.\n \n           As of December 31, 2022, we had £41.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe, based upon our current operating plan, that, our cash and \ncash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operations for at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements and the \nperiod for which we expect our existing resources to support our operations may vary significantly from what we expect. Our monthly spending levels vary \nbased on new and ongoing research and development and other corporate activities. Because the length of time and activities associated with successful \nresearch and development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any \napproved marketing and commercialization activities. In addition, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, and could increase \nsignificantly as a result of many factors, including: \n•\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n•\nthe scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs;\n•\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n•\nthe extent to which we enter into non-exclusive, jointly funded clinical research collaboration arrangements, if any, for the development of \nour product candidates in combination with other companies’ products;\n8"

Average review times at the \nagency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may \nrely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\n \n           Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary \ngovernment agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several \ntimes and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop \ncritical activities. Moreover, recent shutdowns or slowdowns in normal agency work caused by the federal response to the COVID-19 public health \nemergency can increase the time needed for the agency to complete its review or make final approval or other administrative decisions. If a prolonged \ngovernment shutdown or slowdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, \nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, in our operations as a public company, future government shutdowns could impact our \nability to access the public market and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\n \nWe may be unable to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments or benefit from \nfavorable United Kingdom tax legislation.\n \n           As a United Kingdom resident company, we are subject to U.K. corporate taxation. We have generated losses since inception. As of December 31, \n2022, we had cumulative carry forward tax losses of £84.6 million. Subject to any relevant restrictions, including the Corporate Income Loss Restriction \nand the Corporate Capital Loss Restriction that, broadly, restrict the amount of carried forward losses that can be utilized to 50% of group profits or gains \narising above £5.0 million per tax year, we expect these to be available to carry forward and offset against future operating profits.\n \n           As a company that carries out extensive research and development activities, we benefit from the United Kingdom research and development tax \ncredit regime for small and medium-sized companies, whereby we are able to surrender the trading losses that arise from our qualifying research and \ndevelopment activities for a payable tax credit of up to 33.35% in respect of eligible research and development expenditures incurred prior to April 1, 2023. \nThis rate generally reduces to a general rate of 18.6% in respect of expenditure incurred on or after April 1, 2023. However, at the Spring Budget 2023, the \nU.K. Government announced a new tax credit rate under this scheme for R&D intensive companies, which will amount to a payable tax credit of up to \n26.97% of eligible research and development expenditures incurred on or after April 1, 2023. R&D intensive companies will be those that spend 40% or \nmore of their total expenditure on qualifying R&D in a given period, although detailed guidance and draft legislation on this new rate is yet to be published. \nBased on the amount of our qualifying R&D expenditure in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and our expectations as to the amount of our \nqualifying R&D expenditure in the current fiscal year, we believe that we qualified as an R&D intensive company for 2022 and we currently expect to \nqualify for 2023. Our qualifying expenditures largely comprise employment costs for research staff, consumables and subcontract costs incurred as part of \nresearch projects. Certain subcontracted qualifying research expenditures are eligible for a cash rebate of up to 21.68% in respect of eligible research and \ndevelopment expenditures incurred prior to April 1, 2023 (reducing to a general rate of 12.09%, or, on the assumption that the new R&D intensive \ncompanies rules will also apply to subcontracted R&D, an enhanced rate of 17.53% for R&D intensive companies, in respect of expenditure incurred on or \nafter April 1, 2023). The majority of our pipeline research, clinical trials management and manufacturing development activities are currently eligible for \ninclusion within these tax credit cash rebate claims.  In relation to accounting periods beginning on or after April 1, 2021 there is a cap on payable credit \nclaims in excess of £20,000 by reference to, broadly, three times the total Pay As You Earn, or PAYE, and national insurance contributions, or NICs, \nliability of the company. Unless an exemption applies, this could restrict the amount of payable credit that we can claim. In addition to the rate reductions \nreferred to above, there are further changes to the U.K.’s research and development tax regime which will apply in respect of expenditure incurred on or \nafter April 1, 2024. These include the introduction of a territoriality restriction to refocus the relief on activity carried out in the U.K.. This is subject to an \nexemption where it would be wholly unreasonable for the claimant to replicate the conditions necessary for the research and development activity within \nthe U.K.. This new requirement may have an impact on our ability to claim relief in respect of certain costs in the future.

For example, His Majesty’s \nRevenue & Customs, or HMRC, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or another tax authority could challenge our allocation of income by tax jurisdiction and \nthe amounts paid between our affiliated companies pursuant to our intercompany arrangements and transfer pricing policies, including methodologies for \nvaluing developed technology and amounts paid with respect to our intellectual property development. Similarly, a tax authority could assert that we are \nsubject to tax in a jurisdiction where we believe we have not established a taxable connection, often referred to as a “permanent establishment” under \ninternational tax treaties, and such an assertion, if successful, could increase our expected tax liability in one or more jurisdictions.\n \n           A tax authority may take the position that material income tax liabilities, interest and penalties are payable by us, for example where there has been a \ntechnical violation of contradictory laws and regulations that are relatively new and have not been subject to extensive review or interpretation, in which \ncase we expect that we might contest such assessment. Contesting such an assessment may be lengthy and costly and if we were unsuccessful in disputing \nthe assessment, the implications could increase our anticipated effective tax rate, where applicable.\n \nChanges and uncertainties in the tax system in the countries in which we have operations, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and \nresults of operations, and reduce net returns to our shareholders.\n \n           We are unable to predict what tax reform may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such \nchanges, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in jurisdictions in which we operate or in the future into which \nwe sell our products, could increase the estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheets, and otherwise affect \nour financial position, future results of operations, cash flows in a particular period and overall or effective tax rates in the future in countries where we \nhave operations or may sell our products, reduce post-tax returns to our shareholders and increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance.\n \nOur business may become subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations.\n \n           As a company based in the United Kingdom, our business is subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally. Many of our \nsuppliers and collaborative and clinical trial relationships are located outside of the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a \nvariety of factors, including:\n•\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability;\n•\ndiffering and changing regulatory requirements for drug approvals;\n•\ndiffering jurisdictions could present different issues for securing, maintaining or obtaining freedom to operate in such jurisdictions;\n•\npotentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n11"

The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, \nsupply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced and may \ncontinue to experience, cost increases. Although we may take measures to mitigate the impact of this inflation, if these measures are not effective our \nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Even if such measures are effective, there could be a \ndifference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and when the cost inflation is incurred.\n \nAdverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by \nfinancial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and its financial condition \nand results of operations. \n \nActual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional \ncounterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of \nthese kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon \nValley Bank, or SVB, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, or the FDIC, as receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership.  A \nstatement issued on March 12, 2023, by the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC stated that all depositors of SVB would have \naccess to all of their money, including funds held in uninsured deposit accounts, borrowers under credit agreements, letters of credit and certain other \nfinancial instruments with SVB, Signature Bank or any other financial institution that is placed into receivership by the FDIC.

However, if any of our other counterparties to \ninstruments such as uninsured deposit accounts, credit agreements, letters of credit and certain other financial instruments were to be placed into \nreceivership, we may be unable to access such funds. In addition, if any parties with whom we conduct business are unable to access funds pursuant to such \ninstruments or lending arrangements with such a financial institution, such parties’ ability to pay their obligations to us or to enter into new commercial \narrangements requiring additional payments to us could be adversely affected. In this regard, counterparties to SVB credit agreements and arrangements, \nand third parties such as beneficiaries of letters of credit (among others), may experience direct impacts from the closure of SVB and uncertainty remains \nover liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry. Similar impacts have occurred in the past, such as during the 2008-2010 financial crisis. \n \nInflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously issued government securities with interest rates below \ncurrent market interest rates. Although the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board have announced a program to provide up to $25 \nbillion of loans to financial institutions secured by certain of such government securities held by financial institutions to mitigate the risk of potential losses \non the sale of such instruments, widespread demands for customer withdrawals or other liquidity needs of financial institutions for immediate liquidity may \nexceed the capacity of such program.

These factors could include, \namong others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity \nagreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the \nprospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions or financial services industry companies with \nwhich we have financial or business relationships, but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally.\n \nThe results of events or concerns that involve one or more of these factors could include a variety of material and adverse impacts on our current and \nprojected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. These could include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n \n•\nDelayed access to deposits or other financial assets or the uninsured loss of deposits or other financial assets;\n•\nLoss of access to revolving existing credit facilities or other working capital sources and/or the inability to refund, roll over or extend the \nmaturity of, or enter into new credit facilities or other working capital resources;\n•\nPotential or actual breach of contractual obligations that require us to maintain letters of credit or other credit support arrangements; or\n•\nTermination of cash management arrangements and/or delays in accessing or actual loss of funds subject to cash management arrangements.\n \nIn addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S., U.K. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, \nincluding higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, \nthereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and \nliquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other \nobligations, result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations or result in violations of federal or state wage and hour laws.

Any bankruptcy or insolvency, or the failure to make payments when due, of any counterparty of ours, or the loss of any significant \nrelationships, could result in material losses to us and may material adverse impacts on our business.\n \nThe COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics or public health crises could adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and \nclinical trials.\n \n           Public health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. The coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes \nCOVID-19, and its variants have spread to every country in the world and throughout the United States and the United Kingdom. Many countries, as well \nas most states of the United States, reacted by instituting quarantines, “lockdowns” and other public health restrictions on leisure activities, work and travel. \nAlthough pandemic-related restrictions have been eased or removed in most geographies, our business remains subject to pandemic-related controls, which \nmay become more restrictive at any time. We rely on third-party manufacturers, distributors, information technology and software service providers, law \nand accounting firms, CROs, and consultants who are subject to, or may become subject to, pandemic-related controls. COVID-19 may also affect \nemployees of third-party CROs located in affected geographies that we rely upon to carry out clinical trials. If these third parties cannot perform the \nservices we require in a timely way and we cannot successfully implement replacements or workarounds, our business, results of operations, and financial \ncondition could be harmed. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or potential future pandemics, we have experienced and may in the future experience \ndisruptions that could severely impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including:\n•\ndelays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n•\ndelays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n•\ndelays or disruptions in preclinical experiments and investigational new drug application-enabling good laboratory practice standard \ntoxicology studies due to unforeseen circumstances at contract research organizations and vendors along their supply chain;\n•\nincreased rates of patients withdrawing from our clinical trials following enrollment as a result of contracting COVID-19, being forced to \nquarantine, or not wanting to attend hospital visits;\n•\ndiversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites \nand hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n•\ninterruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by \nnational, state or local governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and trial procedures (particularly any \nprocedures that may be deemed non-essential), which may impact the integrity of subject data and clinical trial endpoints;\n•\ninterruption or delays in the operations of the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory agencies, which may impact approval timelines;\n•\ninterruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of our product candidates from our contract manufacturing organizations due to staffing \nshortages, production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in our supply chain or distribution vendors’ ability to ship product candidates; \nand\n•\nlimitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including \nbecause of sickness of employees or their families, the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people, an increased reliance \non working from home or mass transit disruptions.\n \n           These and other factors arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could worsen in countries that are already afflicted with COVID-19, could continue to \nspread to additional countries, or could return to countries where the pandemic has been partially contained, each of which could further adversely impact \nour ability to conduct clinical trials and our business generally, and could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition and \nresults.\n \n           In addition, the trading prices for our ADSs and for the securities of other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile during certain \nperiods as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital through sales of our ADSs or such sales may be on \nunfavorable terms. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The extent to which this pandemic may impact our business, preclinical studies and \nclinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the emergence, severity and \nspread of new variants of the disease, the duration of the pandemic and any outbreak of future variants, the potential \n14"

Although the length and impacts of \nany military action are highly unpredictable, clinical trial sites in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus and neighboring countries could suspend or terminate their \nparticipation in trials, and patients and physicians could be forced to evacuate or voluntarily choose to relocate far from clinical trial sites, making them \nunavailable and potentially making data collection more difficult or not possible.  Any such difficulties at clinical trial sites, or the unavailability of such \nclinical trial sites, could result in delays in enrolling or completing clinical trials, the need to identify alternative clinical trial sites, and increased overall \ndevelopment costs.  Furthermore, the United States and its European allies have imposed significant sanctions against Russia and Belarus, including \nembargoes, sanctions and other restrictions targeting major Russian financial institutions.  Our ability to conduct future clinical trials or purchases from \nsuppliers located in Russia, Belarus and parts of Ukraine and elsewhere in the region has become restricted under applicable sanctions laws. All of the \nforegoing could impede the execution of our clinical development plans, which could materially harm our business.\n \nExchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n \n           Owing to the international scope of our operations, fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar, may \nadversely affect us. Although we are based in the United Kingdom, we source our active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and other raw materials and our \nresearch and development, manufacturing, consulting and other services worldwide, including from the United States, the European Union and India. Any \nweakening of the pound sterling against the currencies of such other jurisdictions makes the purchase of such goods and services more expensive for us. \nFurther, potential future revenue may be derived from abroad, particularly from the United States. As a result, our business and the price of our ADSs may \nbe affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates not only between the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar, but also the currencies of other countries, \nwhich may have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows from period to period. Currently, we do not have any exchange rate \nhedging arrangements in place.\n \nOur business may be negatively impacted by future changes in applicable regulatory regimes.\n \n           We may face new regulatory costs and challenges that could have an adverse effect on our operations. The regulatory frameworks applicable to our \noperations and the development of our product candidates, including those with respect to the FDA and the EMA, can change at any time as a result of \npolitical decisions. Any changes to the applicable regulatory frameworks could have a material impact on our plans and development strategy, including our \nsupply of investigational medicinal products. Furthermore, the implications of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and any \nother significant European political changes could result in disruption that could in turn delay the approval of new medicines at the EMA. \n \nRisks Related to Development of Our Product Candidates\n \nInitial success in the completed and ongoing early-stage clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained when these trials are completed or in \nlater stage trials.\n \n           NUC-3373 is currently being evaluated, in combination with other agents, in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \nWe have also initiated a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of NUC-3373, in combination with other agents, for the second-line treatment of patients with \nadvanced colorectal cancer. In addition, we have initiated a Phase 1b/2 modular clinical trial of NUC-3373 in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor \npembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors and in combination with docetaxel in patients with lung cancer.  Favorable results obtained from our \nPhase 1 clinical trial of NUC-3373 in patients with advanced solid tumors and our ongoing Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of NUC-3373 in patients with advanced \ncolorectal cancer may not be replicated in any future clinical trials.  Similarly, while NUC-7738 is currently being evaluated in the Phase 2 part of a Phase \n1/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors which is evaluating NUC-7738 as a monotherapy and in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor \npembrolizumab, favorable results obtained to date may not be replicated in any future clinical trials.

Furthermore, the results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory \nauthorities for marketing approval. Statistical significance means that an effect is unlikely to have occurred by chance. Clinical trial results are considered \nstatistically significant when the probability of the results occurring by chance, rather than from the efficacy of the product candidate, is sufficiently low. \nThere can be no assurance that any of our clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support further clinical development of any of our product \ncandidates. There is a high failure rate for drugs proceeding through clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology \nindustries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical development even after achieving promising results in earlier studies.\n \nPreliminary and interim data from our clinical trials that we may announce or publish from time to time may change as patient enrollment continues, \npatient data are further examined and more patient data become available.\n \n           From time to time, we may announce or publish preliminary or interim data from our clinical studies, which include preliminary or interim data from \nour clinical trials, including those from the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, Phase 2 clinical trial of NUC-3373 for the \nsecond-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer, or the Phase 1b/2 modular clinical trial of NUC-3373 in patients with advanced solid \ntumors, the Phase 2 part of the Phase 1/2 trial of NUC-7738 for patients with advanced solid tumors, and any future clinical trials of any of product \ncandidates. Preliminary and interim data from a clinical trial are not always entirely representative of final data. Preliminary and interim data are subject to \nthe risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues, patient data are further examined, more patient \ndata become available, and we prepare and issue our final clinical trial report. As a result, preliminary and interim data should be viewed with caution until \nthe final data are available. Material adverse changes in the final data compared to the preliminary or interim data could significantly harm our business \nprospects.\n \nWe are relatively early in our development efforts. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates or experience \nsignificant delays in doing so, our business will be harmed.\n \n           We currently do not have any products that have gained marketing approval. We have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources \nidentifying and developing our ProTides, such as NUC-3373 and NUC-7738, as well as Acelarin for which we discontinued the NuTide:121 clinical trial in \nMarch 2022. Our ability to generate product revenues, which may not occur for several years, if ever, will depend on the successful development and \neventual commercialization of our product candidates: NUC-3373, for which a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, Phase 2 \nclinical trial of NUC-3373 for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer and Phase 1b/2 modular clinical trial of NUC-3373 in \ncombination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab, in patients with advanced solid tumors or in combination with docetaxel in patients with lung cancer \nare ongoing; and NUC-7738, for which the Phase 2 part of the Phase 1/2 trial is ongoing which is evaluating NUC-7738 as a monotherapy and in \ncombination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab for patients with advanced solid tumors. We currently do not generate any revenues from sales of any \nproducts, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable drug. Each of our product candidates will require development, management \nof development and manufacturing activities, marketing approval in multiple jurisdictions, obtaining manufacturing supply, building of a commercial \norganization, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenues from drug sales.\n \n           We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new \nand rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. For example, to execute our business plan, we will need to successfully:\n•\nexecute development activities for our product candidates, including successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;\n•\nmanage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to preclinical development, clinical trials, marketing approvals and \ncommercialization;\n•\nobtain required marketing approvals for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;\n•\nobtain and maintain patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates and ensure that we do not \ninfringe the valid patent rights of third parties;\n•\nprotect, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n•\nestablish and maintain clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities or make arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical \nand commercial manufacturing;\n16"

We may incur additional costs or experience delays in \ncompleting, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and may experience delays in obtaining, or ultimately be unable to obtain, the \napproval of our product candidates.\n \n           The risk of failure in drug development is high. NUC-3373 is currently being studied in two Phase 1b/2 trials and a Phase 2 trial, and NUC-7738 is \nin the Phase 2 part of a Phase 1/2 trial. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must \ncomplete preclinical development and conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in patients. Clinical \ntrials are expensive, difficult to design and implement and can take several years to complete, and their outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at \nany time during the clinical trial process. Further, the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive \nof the results of later-stage clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data \nare often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in \npreclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our \nproduct candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval.\n17"

Furthermore, NUC-7738 is a transformation of 3’-deoxyadenosine, a \nnucleoside analog that has never been successfully developed or approved as a chemotherapy, which may result in the need for more preclinical studies or \nclinical trials than would be the case for transformations of approved chemotherapeutic agents.\n \n           If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we \nare unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other studies, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only \nmodestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n•\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n•\nnot obtain marketing approval for our product candidates at all;\n•\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n•\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings that would reduce the potential \nmarket for our products or inhibit our ability to successfully commercialize our products;\n•\nbe subject to additional post-marketing restrictions or requirements, including confirmatory trials; or\n•\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\n \n           Our product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in preclinical and clinical development or receiving the requisite marketing \napprovals. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. \nSignificant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product \ncandidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates \nand may harm our business and results of operations.\n \nWe face regulation and potential liability related to the privacy of health information we obtain from clinical trials sponsored by us or our \ncollaborators.\n \n           The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, and these laws and regulations are increasing \nin complexity and number, and may change frequently and sometimes conflict. We are subject to numerous regulations governing the protection of personal \nand confidential information of our clinical trial subjects, clinical investigators, and employees, including in relation to medical records, credit card data \nand financial information, which encompass state privacy and confidentiality laws (including state laws requiring disclosure of breaches), federal and state \nconsumer protection and employment laws, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and European and other foreign data \nprotection laws. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is applicable in all E.U. member states and member \nstates of the European Economic Area, or E.E.A. Following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, the data protection obligations of \nthe GDPR continue to apply to U.K.-related processing of personal data in substantially unvaried form and fashion (retained in U.K. law as the “U.K. \nGDPR”).\n \n           We are subject to the GDPR and/or U.K. GDPR when conducting clinical trials involving U.K.- or E.E.A.-based data subjects (whether the trials are \nconducted directly by us or through a clinical vendor or collaborator) or offering approved products (or any other products or services) to U.K. or E.E.A. \nbased data subjects (regardless of whether involving a U.K. or E.E.A. based subsidiary or operation), when monitoring of their behavior of data subjects in \nthe United Kingdom or E.E.A. and/or when acting through a U.K.- or E.E.A.-based subsidiary, operation or other establishment.\n \n           The GDPR (and U.K. GDPR) sets out a number of requirements that must be complied with when handling personal data (i.e. data relating to an \nidentified or identifiable living individual) in these circumstances, including: the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; \naccountability and record-keeping obligations; transparency obligations for data controllers; the obligation to carry out  ‘data protection impact \nassessments’ in certain circumstances; rights for data subjects (such as rights for individuals to be “forgotten”, rights to data portability, rights to object \netc.); a stringent standard of data subject consent; and the obligation to notify certain significant personal data breaches to the relevant Supervisory \nAuthority(ies) and affected individuals. In addition, the GDPR provides a very broad definition of what \n19"

      "text": "constitutes personal data (for example, the GDPR expressly clarifies that it applies to ‘pseudonymized’ (i.e., key-coded) data).  A number of opinions from \nSupervisory Authorities has further supported a very wide interpretation of the concept of personal data and, thus, the application of the GDPR.\n \n           The GDPR and U.K. GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the E.E.A. and U.K. to U.S. and other Third Countries. \nRecent legal developments in the European Union have created further complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the E.E.A. and \nUnited Kingdom to the United States, e.g. on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, made it clear that reliance on any of the \nspecific safeguards for data transfers provided for in the GDPR (the most common of which is the standard contractual clauses, a standard form contract \napproved by the European Commission) alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of the standard contractual clauses must now be \nassessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and \nrights of individuals and additional measures and/or contractual provisions may need to be put in place, however, the nature of these additional measures is \ncurrently uncertain. Guidance from the European Data Protection Board on what is required by way of additional measures further emphasized the \nchallenges of transferring personal data, in particular unencrypted data, from the E.E.A. A small number of enforcement decisions have also been issued. \nAs supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses \ncan/cannot be used, and/or increase their enforcement activities, we could suffer additional costs, complaints, and/or regulatory scrutiny, investigations or \nfines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner \nin which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial \nresults and generally increase compliance risk.\n \n           On June 28, 2021, the European Commission adopted an ‘adequacy decision’ in respect of the United Kingdom, allowing the unrestricted transfer of \npersonal data  from the E.E.A. to the United Kingdom. The adequacy decision is intended to apply for a period of four years; however, the Commission is \nalso tasked with monitoring developments in the United Kingdom on an ongoing basis; if it considers that the United Kingdom no longer ensures an \nessentially equivalent level of data protection, the decision could be suspended or repealed. Were the adequacy decision to be invalidated or withdrawn, this \nwould likely necessitate additional compliance costs and increase our overall risk.\n \n           On December 13, 2022, the European Commission launched the process to adopt a new adequacy decision for the ‘E.U. - U.S. Data Privacy \nFramework’, which would allow personal data to be transferred from the E.E.A to U.S. entities who self-certify under the Data Privacy Framework. \nAlthough there is no specified timeframe for the adequacy decision, it is expected to be approved at some point in the Summer of 2023. While the Data \nPrivacy Framework adequacy decision (if issued) will, in principle, make it easier to transfer personal data from the E.E.A. to the U.S., prominent European \nprivacy campaigners have already indicated their intention to bring a legal challenge against any such decision. Consequently, it is expected that the \nuncertainty surrounding data transfers will continue in 2023 and beyond.\n           \n           The GDPR also provides that E.E.A. member states may make their own further laws and regulations to introduce specific requirements related to \nthe processing of: “special categories of personal data”, including personal data related to health, biometric data used for unique identification purposes and \ngenetic information; as well as personal data related to criminal offences or convictions — for example, in the United Kingdom, the Data Protection Act \n2018 complements the GDPR in this regard in the United Kingdom. This fact may lead to greater divergence on the law that applies to the processing of \nsuch data types across the E.E.A. and U.K., compliance with which as and where applicable may increase our costs and could increase our overall risk.\n \n           Now that the United Kingdom is no longer a member of the European Union, there is increasing scope for divergence in application, interpretation \nand enforcement of the data protection law between the United Kingdom and European Union.  On March 8, 2023, the U.K. Government presented the \n‘Data Protection and Digital Information Bill’ to Parliament, seeking to amend various aspects of the United Kingdom’s data protection regime.  As \ncurrently drafted, the Bill will result in only minor changes to the substance of the U.K. GDPR, and so the United Kingdom will remain very closely \naligned with the European Union in this regard. However, any changes relating to the U.K. and E.U. position regarding aspects of data protection law may \nlead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk. There are also concerns that changes to the U.K. regime, in particular changes to the \ndata transfer rules, could increase the risk of the European Commission’s adequacy decision in respect of the U.K. being invalidated or withdrawn.\n \n           Alongside the GDPR, the European Union has a number of new laws currently going through the legislative process, including the European Health \nData Space (EHDS) Regulation. The EHDS Regulation may, for example, require us to make health data available to other organizations in this sector (in \nan anonymized form) and to the patients themselves. Although \n20"

Complying with these numerous, complex and often changing regulations is expensive and difficult. Failure by us, any partners, our \nservice providers, or our employees or contractors to comply with the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, enforcement notices and/or fines of \nup to the higher of €20 million or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover. Further, following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the \nEuropean Union, we now have to comply with the GDPR and U.K. GDPR separately, each regime separately having the ability to fine up to the higher of \n€20 million / £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. Numerous multi-million € / £ fines have been issued by supervisory authorities across the E.E.A. and \nby the U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office. In addition to administrative fines, a wide variety of other potential enforcement powers are available to \ncompetent authorities in respect of potential and suspected violations of the GDPR, including extensive audit and inspection rights, and powers to order \ntemporary or permanent bans on all or some processing of personal data carried out by non-compliant actors.\n \n           In addition to the foregoing, a breach of privacy laws or data security laws, particularly those resulting in a significant security incident or breach \ninvolving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of sensitive or confidential patient or consumer information, could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business, reputation and financial condition. In addition, widely publicized security breaches are increasingly being followed \nin the European Union by large ‘class action’ style claims. Although these have yet to succeed in any significant compensation orders, defending these \nclaims is costly and could still result in substantial liability for compensation and legal fees. As a data controller, we are accountable for any third-party \nservice providers we engage to process personal data on our behalf, including our CROs. We attempt to mitigate the associated risks by performing security \nassessments and due diligence of our vendors and requiring all such third-party providers with data access to sign agreements, and obligating them to only \nprocess data according to our instructions and to take sufficient security measures to protect such data. There is no assurance that these contractual \nmeasures and our own privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated with the third-party processing, storage and \ntransmission of such information. Any violation of data or security laws by our third-party processors could have a material adverse effect on our business \nand result in the fines, penalties and/or other enforcement actions outlined above.\n \n           We strive to comply with all applicable laws, but they may conflict with each other, and by complying with the laws or regulations of one \njurisdiction, we may find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction. Despite our efforts, we may not have fully complied in the \npast and may not in the future. If we become liable under laws or regulations applicable to us, we could be required to pay significant fines and penalties \n(including those described above), our reputation may be harmed and we may be forced to change the way we operate. That could require us to incur \nsignificant expenses or to discontinue certain services, which could negatively affect our business.\n \nDue to our limited resources and access to capital, we must, and have in the past decided to, prioritize development of certain ProTide candidates over \nother potential candidates. These decisions may prove to have been wrong and may adversely affect our performance.\n \n           Because we have limited resources and access to capital to fund our operations, we must decide which ProTides to pursue and the resources to \nallocate to each. Our decisions concerning the allocation of research, collaboration, management and financial resources toward particular ProTides or \ntherapeutic areas may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources away from better opportunities. Similarly, our \ndecisions to delay, terminate or collaborate with third parties in respect of product development programs may also prove not to be optimal and could cause \nus to miss valuable opportunities. If we make incorrect determinations regarding the market potential of our ProTides or misread trends in the \nbiopharmaceutical industry, in particular for our lead ProTides, then our business may be adversely affected.\n \nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use and expand our technology platform to build a pipeline of additional ProTide candidates.\n \n           A key element of our strategy is to use and expand our proprietary ProTide technology to build a pipeline of additional ProTide candidates and \nprogress these ProTide candidates through clinical development for the treatment of cancer. Although our research and development efforts to date have \nresulted in a pipeline of ProTide candidates directed at the treatment of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies, we may not be able to develop \nProTide candidates that are safe and effective.

Before we can commercialize any of our product candidates, each such product candidate must be approved by the FDA \npursuant to an NDA in the United States, by the EMA pursuant to an MAA in the European Union, and by similar regulatory authorities outside the United \nStates prior to commercialization.\n \n           The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and takes several years, if approval is obtained at \nall, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Failure to \nobtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received approval to market \nany of our product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have limited experience in planning and conducting the clinical trials \nrequired for marketing approvals, and we expect to rely on third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, to assist us in this process. Obtaining \nmarketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each \ntherapeutic indication to establish the product candidate’s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information \nabout the product manufacturing process, and in many cases the inspection of manufacturing facilities by the regulatory authorities. Our product candidates \nmay not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that \nmay preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. Because a number of our clinical trials will be in combination with \nother approved therapies, there may also be undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics resulting from the other therapy or \nfrom its combination with our product candidate. \n \n           In addition, because our product candidates are transformations of nucleoside analogs, including those that are approved chemotherapeutic agents \nand those that have never been approved as chemotherapeutic agents, our product candidates could be negatively impacted by the identification of any new \nundesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics in such existing nucleoside analogs, in particular in those that have never been \napproved as chemotherapeutic agents. \nRegulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the new drug approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our \ndata are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. Our product candidates could be delayed in receiving, or fail to \nreceive, marketing approval for many reasons, including the following:\n•\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials or require that we \nperform additional clinical trials, including toxicology trials;\n•\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe \nand effective for its proposed indication;\n•\nthe results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory \nauthorities for marketing approval;\n•\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate’s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n•\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n22"

Any of the foregoing scenarios could harm the commercial prospects for our product \ncandidates.\n \n           If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product \ncandidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be impaired.\n \nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their marketing approval, limit the commercial profile of an \napproved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\n \n           Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or the FDA or other regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt our \nclinical trials and could result in more restrictive labels or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of our \nproduct candidates. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an \nevent, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of \nor deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the \nability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims.\n \n           Further, clinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population.

The FDA has broad discretion whether to grant this designation. \nEven if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it. Even if we do \nreceive Fast Track Designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The \nFDA may withdraw Fast Track Designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval \nmarketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved \nlabeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding use of their products, and if we promote our products \nbeyond their approved indications or in a way that is inconsistent with the FDA-approved labeling, we may be subject to enforcement actions or \nprosecution arising from that off-label promotion.

In addition, if any of the physicians or other \nhealthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to \nsignificant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\n \nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates \nand affect the prices we may obtain.\n \n           In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding \nthe healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our \nability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. For example, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was \nsigned into law, which reauthorized the FDA’s user fee programs and included additional drug and device provisions. On September 30, 2022, the FDA \nUser Fee Reauthorization Act of 2022 was signed into law, which reauthorized the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA VII) from fiscal year 2023 \nthrough 2027. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to \nmaintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, \nwhich would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n \n           In addition, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs and \nimprove the quality of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted in the United States, substantially changing the way healthcare is \nfinanced by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affecting the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contained a number of provisions, \nincluding those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and changes to fraud and abuse laws. As another \nexample, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020 incorporated extensive health care provisions and amendments \nto existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of drugs products covered under Medicare Part B report the product’s average sales price to \nthe federal.\n \n                  Since the enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive and legislative challenges to certain of its \nprovisions. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically \nruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, \nPresident Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining \nhealth insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their \nexisting policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining \n26"

      "text": "Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to \nhealth insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.\n \n           In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, on March 11, \n2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at \n100% of a drug’s AMP, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Payment methodologies may also be subject to \nchanges in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment \nmodels. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their products. Such scrutiny has \nresulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more \ntransparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient \nprograms, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. By way of example, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of \n2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare \n(beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price \nincreases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in \n2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as \nopposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated, or the impact of the IRA on \nour business.\n \n           Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have \nresulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to \nproduct pricing, contain the cost of drugs, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program \nreimbursement methodologies for products. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \n           In addition, Congress has been considering ways to decrease drug prices and increase access to drugs. Although a number of the considered \nmeasures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or \nadministrative measures to control drug costs. In July 2021, the Biden administration issued an executive order to promote competition in the U.S. \neconomy, which included measures intended to lower drug prices through increased competition in the pharmaceutical industry. In particular, the executive \norder seeks to continue ongoing action plans to increase access to and market competitiveness of generics and biosimilars and to expand drug importation \nprograms. The executive order also supports legislative reforms to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, redesign Part D to reduce costs, and implement \nrebate penalties for exorbitant drug price increases.\n \n           In addition, individual states in the U.S. have also passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product \npricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and \ntransparency measures, and regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what \npharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. In December 2020, the U.S. \nSupreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers, or PBMs and other \nmembers of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this \narea.\n \n           In the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our products. In \naddition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European Union or E.U. member state level may \nresult in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs.\n \n           We expect that the ACA and the IRA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous \ncoverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we will receive for any approved product. Any reduction in payments from \nMedicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment \nmeasures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize any of our products for \nwhich we receive marketing approval.\n \n27"

The approval procedure varies among countries and economic areas and can involve additional \ntesting. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval process outside \nthe United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is \nrequired that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We or these third parties may not \nobtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by \nregulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by \nregulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. Additionally, a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one jurisdiction \nmay have a negative effect on the marketing approval process in others. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and \nadministrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. Obtaining \nforeign marketing approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could \ndelay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries.

To \nobtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our \nproduct candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at \nunsatisfactory levels, our financial results would suffer.\n \nWe are subject to the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, import \nand customs laws, trade and economic sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations.\n \n           Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or the Bribery Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or \nFCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. §201, the U.S. Travel Act, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we \ndo business.

In addition, anti-corruption laws present particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are \noperated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials under anti-corruption laws. Certain payments to \nhealth care providers in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to \nenforcement actions.\n \n           Our operations are also subject to the Criminal Finances Act 2017, or CFA 2017, which contains offences of failing to prevent the facilitation of tax \nevasion in the United Kingdom and abroad. This legislation makes organizations accountable for any part played by their personnel in deliberately and \ndishonestly facilitating tax evasion by others, where those organizations have not made reasonable efforts to prevent such facilitation.\n \n           We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of \nthe United States and the United Kingdom, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions and \nembargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively \nreferred to as the Trade Control laws.

We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and \nother third parties, such as CROs, to conduct or otherwise support clinical trials for our product candidates. We expect to rely heavily on these parties for \nperformance of clinical trials for our product candidates. Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in \naccordance with the applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards.\n \n           We, our investigators, and our CROs will be required to comply with regulations, including good clinical practice, or GCP, and other related \nrequirements for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible \nand accurate, and that the trial patients are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials and their rights are protected. These \nregulations are enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory \nauthorities for any drugs in clinical development. The FDA enforces GCPs through periodic inspections of clinical trial sponsors, principal investigators \nand trial sites. If we, our investigators or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be called into \nquestion and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before considering our marketing \napplications for approval. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA will determine that any of our future clinical trials will comply with GCPs.\n \n           In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced under cGMPs. Our failure or the failure of our investigators or \nCROs to comply with these requirements may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the marketing approval process and could also subject \nus to enforcement action. We also are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of such completed clinical trials involving product \ncandidates for which we receive marketing approval on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so \ncan result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\n \n           Although we intend to design the clinical trials for our product candidates, CROs and individual site investigators will administer the clinical trials. \nAs a result, many important aspects of our development programs, including their conduct and timing, will be outside of our direct control. Our reliance on \nthird parties to conduct future clinical trials will also result in less direct control over the management of data developed through clinical trials than would \nbe the case if we were relying \n30"

If our current \ncontract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturers. Although we believe that there are several potential \nalternative manufacturers who could manufacture our product candidates, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such \nreplacement.\n \n           Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture and shipment of our product candidates or drugs may adversely \naffect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any drugs that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\n \nWe, or our third-party manufacturers, may be unable to successfully scale-up manufacturing of our product candidates in sufficient quality and \nquantity, which would delay or prevent us from developing our product candidates and commercializing approved products, if any.\n \n           In order to conduct large-scale clinical trials of our product candidates, we will need to manufacture them in large quantities. We, or any of our \nmanufacturing partners, may be unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or cost-effective \nmanner, or at all. In addition, quality issues may arise during scale-up activities. If we, or any manufacturing partners, are unable to successfully scale up \nthe manufacture of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, the development, testing, and clinical trials of that product candidate may be \ndelayed or infeasible, and regulatory approval or commercial launch of any resulting product may be delayed or not obtained, which could significantly \nharm our business.\n \nThe third parties upon which we rely for the supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, formulations, and drug products for certain of our \nproduct candidates are our sole sources of supply and have limited capacity, and the loss of any of these suppliers could harm our business.\n \n           The API, formulations and drug products for certain of our product candidates are supplied to us from single-source suppliers with limited capacity. \nOur ability to successfully develop our product candidates, and to ultimately supply our commercial drugs in quantities sufficient to meet the market \ndemand, depends in part on our ability to obtain the API, formulations and drug products in accordance with cGMP requirements and in sufficient \nquantities for commercialization and clinical trials. \n \n           We do not know whether our suppliers will be able to meet our demand, either because of the nature of our agreements with those suppliers, our \ncurrent experience with those suppliers or our relative importance as a customer to those suppliers. It may be difficult for us to assess their ability to timely \nmeet our demand in the future based on past performance. While our suppliers have generally met our demand for their products on a timely basis in the \npast, they may subordinate our needs in the future to their other customers.\n \n           For all of our product candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide API, formulations and drug products prior to \nsubmission of an NDA to the FDA or an MAA to the EMA. Establishing additional or replacement suppliers for the API, formulations and drug products \nfor our product candidates, if required, may not be accomplished quickly. If we are able to find a replacement supplier, such replacement supplier would \nneed to be qualified, or we may have to perform comparative studies comparing the drug product from a new manufacturer to the product used in any \ncompleted clinical trials. All of this may require additional marketing approval, which could result in further delay. While we seek to maintain adequate \ninventory of the API, formulations and drug products for our product candidates, any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials, or our \ninability to obtain such API, formulation and drug product from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner could impede, delay, limit or \nprevent our development efforts.\n32"

We face competition with respect to our current product \ncandidates and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major \npharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and \nbiotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications \nfor which we are developing our product candidates. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same \nas, or similar to, our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government \nagencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for \nresearch, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\n \n           Specifically, there are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many major pharmaceutical and \nbiotechnology companies. If NUC-3373 is approved, it would compete with (a) existing chemotherapies, including 5-FU, (b) existing targeted therapies or \nimmunotherapies and, if approved, targeted therapies or immunotherapies in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with cancer and (c) multiple \napproved drugs or drugs that may be approved in the future for indications for which we may develop NUC-3373. If NUC-7738 is approved, it would \ncompete with existing chemotherapies and multiple approved drugs or drugs that may be approved in the future for indications for which we may develop \nNUC-7738. Existing chemotherapies with which we may compete, including 5-FU and gemcitabine, are no longer under patent and are produced by \nnumerous generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. As a result, these chemotherapies are and will continue to be substantially less expensive to patients than \nmany other potential therapies, including our ProTide candidates, if approved.\n \n           Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, \nmore convenient or less expensive or have fewer or less severe side effects than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA \nor other marketing approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a \nstrong market position before we are able to enter the market or slow our marketing approval.

Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources \nbeing concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, \nparticularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining \nqualified scientific and management personnel and in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring \ntechnologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\n \nEven if we are able to commercialize any product candidates, such drugs may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party \ncoverage and reimbursement policies.\n \n           The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Some countries \nrequire approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing approval is \ngranted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is \ngranted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product candidate in a particular country but then be subject to price regulations that delay \nour commercial launch of the product candidate, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale \nof the product candidate in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, \neven if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\n \n           Our ability to successfully commercialize any product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate \nreimbursement for these product candidates and related treatments will be available from government authorities, private health insurers and other \norganizations. In the United States, the principal decisions about coverage and reimbursement for new medicines under Medicare are made by the Centers \nfor Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. Private payors ultimately \ndetermine which drugs they will cover and the amount of reimbursement they will provide for a covered drug. While there is no uniform system among \npayors for making coverage and reimbursement decisions, private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS \nwill decide with respect to reimbursement. Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more conservative than CMS. For example, a number of cancer \ndrugs are generally covered and paid for in the United States but have not been approved for reimbursement in certain European countries. A primary trend \nin the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by \nlimiting coverage and the amount of payments for particular drugs. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with \npredetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for drugs. We may also need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic \nstudies, in addition to the costly studies required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals, in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and \ncost-effectiveness of the product in order to secure coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product \ncandidate that we commercialize and, if coverage is available, the level of payments. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any \nproduct candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to \nsuccessfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\n \n           There may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for \nwhich the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply \nthat any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim \nreimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may \nvary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and \nmay be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by \ngovernment healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they \nmay be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded \nand private payors for any approved drugs that we develop could compromise our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize \ndrugs and our overall financial condition.\n36"

If we are unable to establish effective sales or marketing capabilities or enter into agreements \nwith third parties to sell or market our product candidates, we may not be able to effectively sell or market our product candidates, if approved, or \ngenerate product revenues.\n \n           We currently have no marketing capability or sales force, but we intend to commercialize or participate in the commercialization of our product \ncandidates for which we receive regulatory approval in major markets, such as the United States and Europe. This may necessitate building a specialized \nsales force and other commercial capabilities in such markets. To achieve commercial success for any approved product candidate for which we retain sales \nand marketing responsibilities, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties \nto perform these services. There are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with \nthird parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any drug launch. \nIf the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any \nreason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if \nwe cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\n \n           Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates on our own include:\n•\nour inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n•\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future drugs;\n•\nthe lack of complementary drugs to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with \nmore extensive product lines; and\n•\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\n \n           If we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our drug revenues or the profitability of these \ndrug revenues to us are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any product candidates that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be \nsuccessful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so when needed or on terms \nthat are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to \nsell and market our product candidates effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration \nwith third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates that receive marketing approval or any such commercialization may \nexperience delays or limitations.\n \nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop. \nIf we are unable to obtain adequate insurance or are required to pay for liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our \ninsurance coverage, a material liability claim could adversely affect our financial condition.\n \n           We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the evaluation of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an \neven greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product \ncandidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n•\ndecreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n•\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n•\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n•\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n•\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n•\nloss of revenue;\n•\nreduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n•\nthe inability to successfully commercialize any products that we may develop.\n37"

We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials or if we commence commercialization of our product candidates. \nInsurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy \nany liability that may arise.\n \nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n \nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the intellectual property \nprotection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability \nto successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired. In addition, if we infringe the valid patent rights of others, we may be \nprevented from making, using or selling our products or may be subject to damages or penalties.\n \n           Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents in the United States and other countries that adequately protect our \nproprietary technology and products. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and in foreign countries \nthat cover our novel product candidates and their uses, pharmaceutical formulations and dosages, and processes for the manufacture of them. Our patent \nportfolio currently includes both patents and patent applications.\n \n           The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent \napplications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue \npatent protection in certain jurisdictions. Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, patents or other intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited \nin scope. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\n \n           We currently solely own or exclusively license our patents and patent applications and we have the right to control the prosecution of the in-licensed \npatent applications. In the future, we may choose to in-license additional patents or patent applications from third parties that we conclude are useful or \nnecessary for our business goals. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing, prosecution or maintenance of such patent applications. \nTherefore, if we do license additional patents or patent applications in the future, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a \nmanner consistent with the best interests of our business.\n \n           The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and \nhas in recent years been the subject of much litigation. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and \npatent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or, in some cases, not at all. \nTherefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent \napplications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and \ncommercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect \nour technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes \nin either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the \nscope of our patent protection.\n \n           Patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or \ndefense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-\nSmith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and \nmay also affect patent litigation. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of \nthe Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, \nbecame effective on March 16, 2013. The Leahy-Smith Act also created certain new administrative adversarial proceedings, discussed below. It is not clear \nwhat, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase \nthe uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\n \n           The U.S. Supreme Court has issued opinions in patent cases in the last few years that many consider may weaken patent protection in the United \nStates, either by narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances, \n38"

Additionally, there have \nbeen recent proposals for additional changes to the patent laws of the United States and other countries that, if adopted, could impact our ability to obtain \npatent protection for our proprietary technology or our ability to enforce our proprietary technology. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the \nU.S. courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable \nways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\n \nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors \nfrom competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage.

Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims \nbeing narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or \nidentical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. In particular, third parties, such as generics \ncompanies, may seek to develop or acquire intellectual property rights proximate to our patents, including with respect to formulation and process matters, \nand may be able to do so in a non-infringing manner. Additionally, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of \nnew product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned \nand licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. \nLikewise, a court could uphold and enforce a third-party patent that it rules we have infringed, which would subject us to damages or prevent us from \nmaking, using or selling our products.\n \n           During patent prosecution in the United States and in most foreign countries, a third party can submit prior art or arguments to the reviewing patent \noffice to attempt to prevent the issuance of a competitor’s patent. For example, our pending patent applications may be subject to a third-party preissuance \nsubmission of prior art to the USPTO or Third Party Observations in Europe. Such submission may convince the receiving patent office not to issue the \npatent. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is reduced by such third-party submission, it \ncould affect the value of our resulting patent or dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future \nproduct candidates. We may also seek to have issued patents re-issued for purposes of strengthening our patent position; however, such requests for \nreissuance may not result in the issuance of the new patent and could result in loss of the originally issued patent.\n \n           The risks described here pertaining to our patents and other intellectual property rights also apply to any intellectual property rights that we currently \nlicense or may license in the future. In some cases, we may not have control over the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of the patents that we \nlicense, and our licensors may fail to take the steps that we believe are necessary or desirable in order to obtain, maintain and enforce the licensed patents.\n \nThird parties seeking to acquire intellectual property rights in our technology and products may be successful in securing such rights through the grant \nof patent applications in the United States and in other jurisdictions; if we are forced to defend our granted intellectual property rights for any of our \nproduct candidates, we may become involved in costly litigation or other administrative proceedings before the USPTO or comparable non-U.S. \nregulatory authorities, which could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our current or future product candidates.\n \n           Biopharmaceutical drug development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment such as ours in which there may be \nnumerous patent applications pending in multiple jurisdictions at any given time, many of which are confidential when filed, with regard to the same or \nsimilar technologies. Any patents issued to third parties may contain claims that conflict with our patents and that may place restrictions on the commercial \nviability of our products and technologies. For example, we are aware of several issued, allowed or pending patent applications in several countries, \nincluding the United States, filed by BrightGene Bio-Medical Technology Co., Ltd., or BrightGene, a pharmaceutical company based in Suzhou, China, \ndirected to various aspects of a process for the manufacture of Acelarin. While we believe that BrightGene’s process patent filings are invalid, challenging \nsuch filings could compel us to engage in costly patent litigation or certain other administrative proceedings before the USPTO, in U.S. federal courts, or in \nthe courts or patent offices of other countries. These activities could result in substantial cost to us and could result in diversion of the efforts of our \nmanagement and technical personnel.\n39"

      "text": "In addition, BrightGene has also pursued patent claims to the composition of matter of Acelarin in the United States and several other foreign \ncountries. We believe that their claims to the composition of matter of Acelarin are invalid. BrightGene’s claims to Acelarin in the United States were \nrejected by the USPTO as lacking novelty over our prior filed patents. Patents have been issued to BrightGene with composition of matter claims directed \nto Acelarin in Japan and Canada which we believe are invalid for the same reasons stated by the USPTO. To address these patents in Japan and Canada, and \nany equivalent patents that may be issued in other jurisdictions, may require oppositions, patent litigation or other administrative proceedings as necessary, \nwhich may be costly and time-consuming. If we do not choose to challenge any such granted patent, or are not successful in the challenge, then there is the \npossibility of a patent infringement lawsuit by BrightGene, which may also be costly and time-consuming for us to challenge in order to establish the \ninvalidity of its patents. These activities could also result in substantial cost to us and could result in significant diversion of the efforts of our management \nand technical personnel.\n \n           An adverse outcome of any such litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be \nlicensed from third parties (which licenses may not be available at all or on reasonable terms) or require us to cease using our technology, which could \ndelay or prevent the development and commercialization of our current or future product candidates. If we engage in patent litigation or other \nadministrative proceedings to defend our patents, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our patents, which would result in a loss of \nthe challenged patent right to us and thus adversely affect our business.\n \nWe may become involved in administrative adversarial proceedings in the USPTO or in the patent offices of foreign countries brought by a third party \nto attempt to cancel or invalidate our patent rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and cause a loss of patent rights.\n \n           The Leahy-Smith Act created for the first time new procedures to challenge issued patents in the United States, including post-grant review and inter \npartes review proceedings, which some third parties have been using to cause the cancellation of selected or all claims of issued patents of competitors. For \na patent with a priority date of March 16, 2013 or later, a petition for post-grant review can be filed by a third party in a nine-month window from issuance \nof the patent. A petition for inter partes review can be filed immediately following the issuance of a patent if the patent was filed prior to March 16, 2013. \nA petition for inter partes review can be filed after the nine-month period for filing a post-grant review petition has expired for a patent with a priority date \nof March 16, 2013 or later. Post-grant review proceedings can be brought on any ground of challenge, whereas inter partes review proceedings can only be \nbrought to raise a challenge based on published prior art. These administrative adversarial actions at the USPTO review patent claims without the \npresumption of validity afforded to U.S. patents in lawsuits in U.S. federal courts, use a lower burden of proof than used by U.S. federal courts and interpret \npatent claims using a “broadest reasonable construction” instead of “plain and ordinary meaning,” which is used in court litigation. Because of these \ndifferences between U.S. administrative and judicial adversarial patent proceedings, it is generally considered easier for a competitor or third party to have \na U.S. patent cancelled in a patent office post-grant review or inter partes review proceeding than invalidated in a litigation in a U.S. federal court. If any of \nour patents are challenged by a third party in such a U.S. patent office proceeding, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending the patent, \nwhich would result in a loss of the challenged patent right to us.\n \n           Opposition or invalidation procedures are also available in most foreign countries. Many foreign authorities, such as the authorities at the European \nPatent Office, or EPO, have only post-grant opposition proceedings. However, certain countries, such as India, have both pre-grant and post-grant \nopposition proceedings. These procedures have been used frequently against pharmaceutical patents in foreign countries. For example, in some foreign \ncountries, these procedures are used by generic companies to hold up an innovator’s patent rights as a means to allow the generic company to enter the \nmarket. This activity is particularly prevalent in India, China and South America and may become more prevalent in Africa and other parts of Asia as \ncertain countries reach more established economies. If any of our patents are challenged in a foreign opposition or invalidation proceeding, we could face \nsignificant costs to defend our patents and may not be successful. Further, in many foreign jurisdictions, the losing party must pay the attorneys’ fees of the \nwinning party, which can be substantial.\n \nWe may have to file one or more lawsuits in court to prevent a third party from selling a product or using a product in a manner that infringes our \npatent, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful, and ultimately result in the loss of our proprietary market.\n \n           Because competition in our industry is intense, competitors may infringe or otherwise violate our issued patents, patents of our licensors or other \nintellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement lawsuits, which can be expensive and time \nconsuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their \npatents. In addition, in a patent \n40"

An adverse result \nin any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. We may also elect to enter into license \nagreements in order to settle patent infringement claims or to resolve disputes prior to litigation, and any such license agreements may require us to pay \nroyalties and other fees that could be significant. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual \nproperty litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure.\n \n           Because our ProTides are small molecules, after commercialization they will be subject to the patent litigation process of the Hatch-Waxman Act, \nwhich allows a generic company to submit an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, to the FDA to obtain approval to sell our drug using \nbioequivalence data only. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, since our candidates will be considered new chemical entities, we will have the opportunity to list \nall of our patents that cover our drug product or its method of use in the FDA’s compendium of “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence \nEvaluation,” sometimes referred to as the FDA’s Orange Book. A generic company can submit an ANDA to the FDA four years after our drug approval. \nThe submission of the ANDA by a generic company is considered a technical act of patent infringement. The generic company can certify that it will wait \nuntil the natural expiration date of our listed patents to sell a generic version of our product or can certify that one or more of our listed patents are invalid, \nunenforceable, or not infringed. If the latter, we will have 45 days to bring a patent infringement lawsuit against the generic company. This will initiate a \nchallenge to one or more of our Orange Book-listed patents based on arguments from the generic company that either our patent is invalid, unenforceable or \nnot infringed. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, if a lawsuit is brought, the FDA is prevented from issuing a final approval on the generic drug until the earlier \nof seven-and-a-half years from our drug approval or a final decision of a court holding that our asserted patent claims are invalid, unenforceable or not \ninfringed. If we do not properly list our relevant patents in the Orange Book, timely file a lawsuit in response to a certification from a generic company \nunder an ANDA or prevail in the resulting patent litigation, we can lose our proprietary market, which can rapidly become generic. Further, even if we do \ncorrectly list our relevant patents in the Orange Book, bring a lawsuit in a timely manner and prevail in that lawsuit, it may be at a very significant cost to \nus of attorneys’ fees and employee time and distraction over a long period. Further, it is common for more than one generic company to try to sell an \ninnovator drug at the same time, so we may be faced with the cost and distraction of multiple lawsuits. We may also determine it is necessary to settle the \nlawsuit in a manner that allows the generic company to enter our market prior to the expiration of our patent or otherwise in a manner that adversely affects \nthe strength, validity or enforceability of our patent.\n \n           A number of pharmaceutical companies have been the subject of intense review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, or a corresponding \nagency in another country based on how they have conducted or settled drug patent litigation, and certain reviews have led to an allegation of an antitrust \nviolation, sometimes resulting in a fine or loss of rights. We cannot be sure that we would not also be subject to such a review or that the result of the \nreview would be favorable to us, which could result in a fine or penalty.\n \n           The FTC has brought a number of lawsuits in federal court in the past few years to challenge Hatch-Waxman ANDA litigation settlements between \ninnovator companies and generic companies as anti-competitive. The FTC has taken an aggressive position that anything of value is a payment, whether \nmoney is paid or not. Under their approach, if an innovator as part of a patent settlement agrees not to launch or delay launch of an authorized generic \nduring the 180-day period granted to the first generic company to challenge an Orange Book-listed patent covering an innovator drug, or negotiates a delay \nin entry without payment, the FTC may consider it an unacceptable reverse payment. The biopharmaceutical industry argues that such agreements are \nrational business decisions to dismiss risk and are immune from antitrust attack if the terms of the settlement are within the scope of the exclusionary \npotential of the patent. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a five-to-three decision in FTC v. Actavis, Inc., rejected both the biopharmaceutical industry’s \nand FTC’s arguments with regard to so-called reverse payments, and held that whether a “reverse payment” settlement involving the exchange of \nconsideration for a delay in entry is subject to an anticompetitive analysis depends on five considerations: (a) the potential for genuine adverse effects on \ncompetition; (b) the justification of payment; (c) the patentee’s ability to bring about anticompetitive harm; (d) whether the size of the payment is a \nworkable surrogate for the patent’s weakness; and (e) that antitrust liability for large unjustified payments does not prevent litigating parties from settling \ntheir lawsuits, for example, by allowing the generic to enter the market before the patent expires without the patentee’s paying the generic. Furthermore, \nwhether a reverse payment is justified depends upon its size, its scale in relation to the patentee’s anticipated future litigation costs, its independence from \nother services for which it might represent payment, as was the case in Actavis, and the lack of any other convincing justification. The Court held that \nreverse payment settlements can potentially violate antitrust laws and are subject to the standard antitrust rule-of-reason analysis, with the burden of \nproving that an agreement is unlawful on the FTC and leaving to lower courts the structuring of such rule of reason analysis. If we are faced with drug \npatent litigation, including Hatch-Waxman litigation with a generic company, we could be faced with such an FTC challenge based on that activity, \nincluding \n41"

ProTidesTM is our trademark. Any additional trademark applications in the United States, Europe \nand in other foreign jurisdictions where we may file may not be allowed or may subsequently be opposed. Once filed and registered, our trademarks or \ntrade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. Moreover, there can be no \nguarantee that FDA will approve the use of the trade name that we propose for our product candidates, which would require us to develop different \nproprietary names for any such drug product that could meet the agency’s standards related to reducing the risk of medication errors and other regulatory \nconsiderations (and take additional measures under trademark law to protect such new proprietary name). As a means to enforce our trademark rights and \nprevent infringement, we may be required to file trademark claims against third parties or initiate trademark opposition proceedings. This can be expensive \nand time-consuming, particularly for a company of our size. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need \nto build name recognition among potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks \nsimilar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade \nname or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or \nunregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then \nwe may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to \ntrademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of \nresources and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.\n \nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain \nand could hurt our business.\n \n           Our commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell NUC-3373 and NUC-7738 and our other potential \nproduct candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. While our product candidates are in \npreclinical studies and clinical trials, we believe that the use of our product candidates in these preclinical studies and clinical trials falls within the scope of \nthe exemptions provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e) in the United States, which exempts from patent infringement liability activities reasonably related to \nthe development and submission of information to the FDA. As NUC-3373, NUC-7738 and our other potential product candidates progress toward \ncommercialization, the possibility of patent infringement claims against us increases. There can be no assurance that our product candidates do not infringe \nother parties’ patents or other proprietary rights, however, and competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event.\n \n           We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights covering our products \nand technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO, in U.S. federal courts, or in the courts or patent offices of other \ncountries. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, including against \nour product candidates themselves, our formulation and manufacturing processes or our drug administration methods. In particular, because NUC-3373 is a \ntransformation of widely used approved chemotherapeutic agents, there is significant intellectual property held by third parties with respect to the \nformulation and manufacturing of those existing agents, which may increase the risk that such third parties allege infringement by us in the formulation and \nmanufacture processes of our product candidates. Furthermore, if any of our future ProTides are transformations of an existing chemotherapeutic agent that \nremains on patent, we could be subject to claims of infringement by the holder of such patents.\n \n           If we are found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue \ndeveloping and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or \nat all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. \nAlternatively, we may need to redesign infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Under certain \ncircumstances, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found \nliable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement \ncould prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could harm our business.

      "text": "We may not be able to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\n \n           We generally file our first patent application, or priority filing, at the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office. International applications under \nthe Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, are usually filed within 12 months after the priority filing. Based on the PCT filing, national and regional patent \napplications may be filed in additional jurisdictions where we believe our product candidates may be marketed or manufactured. Filing, prosecuting and \ndefending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and therefore we only file for patent \nprotection in selected countries. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly in developing countries. Moreover, our \nability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws.\n \n           The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, Europe, India, China and \ncertain other countries do not allow patents for methods of treating the human body. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting \nand defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions that do not favor patent protection on drugs. This could make it difficult for us to \nstop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions \nwhere we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own drugs and, further, may export otherwise infringing drugs to territories where we have \npatent protection, if our ability to enforce our patents to stop infringing activities is inadequate. These drugs may compete with our product candidates, and \nour patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\n \n           Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and \nresources from other aspects of our business. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in the major markets for our product \ncandidates, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our product \ncandidates. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate.\n \n           A number of foreign countries have stated that they are willing to issue compulsory licenses to patents held by innovator companies on approved \ndrugs to allow the government or one or more third-party companies to sell the approved drug without the permission of the innovator patentee where the \nforeign government concludes it is in the public interest. India, for example, has used such a procedure to allow domestic companies to make and sell \npatented drugs without innovator approval. There is no guarantee that patents covering any of our drugs will not be subject to a compulsory license in a \nforeign country, or that we will have any influence over if or how such a compulsory license is granted. Further, Brazil allows its regulatory agency, \nANVISA, to participate in deciding whether to grant a drug patent in Brazil, and patent grant decisions are made based on several factors, including \nwhether the patent meets the requirements for a patent and whether such a patent is deemed in the country’s interest. In addition, several other countries \nhave created laws that make it more difficult to enforce drug patents than patents on other kinds of technologies. Further, under the treaty on the Trade-\nRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property, or TRIPS, as interpreted by the Doha Declaration, countries in which drugs are manufactured are required to allow \nexportation of the drug to a developing country that lacks adequate manufacturing capability. Therefore, our drug markets in the United States or foreign \ncountries may be affected by the influence of current public policy on patent issuance, enforcement or involuntary licensing in the healthcare area.\n \n           In November 2015, members of the World Trade Organization, or the WTO, which administers TRIPS, voted to extend the exemption against \nenforcing pharmaceutical drug patents in least developed countries until 2033. We currently have no patent applications filed in least developed countries, \nand our current intent is not to file in these countries in the future, at least in part due to this WTO pharmaceutical patent exemption.\n \n           In addition, some countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. Further, \nsome countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have \nlimited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with \nrespect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired.\n \nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other \nrequirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these \nrequirements.\n \n43"

We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a \nlate fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules.

Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce \nthe resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities.\n \n           For example, in 2018, we were granted a European patent from the European Patent Office, or EPO, EP 2955190, or EP 190, that covered the \ncomposition of matter of a genus of phosphoramidate nucleotide compounds that includes sofosbuvir, sold under the brand name Sovaldi®, a leading drug \nfor the treatment of hepatitis C sold by Gilead Sciences, Inc. Sofosbuvir is also a key component of Harvoni®, Vosevi® and Epclusa®.  Later in 2018, Gilead \nfiled an Opposition to EP 190 at the EPO in an attempt to revoke it. In February 2021, the Opposition Division of the EPO upheld EP 190 in an amended \nform. In June 2021, this decision was appealed by Gilead to the EPO Technical Boards of Appeal. We also filed an appeal regarding the Opposition \nDivision’s decision only to allow the patent in an amended form. On March 24, 2023, the EPO Technical Boards of Appeal issued an oral decision revoking \nEP 190. This decision is final and has retroactive effect.\n \n           Subsequent to the decision of the Opposition Division, but also in February 2021, Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Gilead Sciences Limited filed a lawsuit \nagainst us in the Patents Court of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales requesting revocation of the U.K. part of EP 190. In March 2021, we filed \na counterclaim against Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Gilead Sciences Limited alleging infringement of EP 190 resulting from acts including the sale of \nSovaldi®, as well as its combination products Harvoni®, Vosevi®and Epclusa®, in the United Kingdom. In September 2022, we were granted a further \nEuropean patent from the EPO, EP 3904365, orEP 365, that covered the composition of matter of a smaller genus of phosphoramidate nucleotide \ncompounds that includes sofosbuvir. The Patents Court of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales heard this case between January 20, 2023 and \nFebruary 3, 2023 and a judgment was handed down on March 21, 2023. In its judgment, the High Court deemed that EP 190 and EP 365 were invalid in the \nUnited Kingdom. As a result of this decision, we will be liable to pay a proportion of Gilead’s legal fees for these legal proceedings in the United Kingdom.\n \n           In April 2021, we initiated legal proceedings against Gilead Sciences Ireland UC and Gilead Sciences GmbH in the German Regional Court of \nDusseldorf for patent infringement for the sale of Sovaldi as well as its combination products Harvoni, Vosevi and Epclusa in Germany. In July 2022, the \nGerman Regional Court of Dusseldorf issued a judgment that Gilead Sciences Ireland UC and Gilead Sciences GmbH had infringed the German part of EP \n190.  Gilead has appealed this decision and the Higher Regional Court of Dusseldorf appeal hearing is currently scheduled for August 17, 2023.  In \naddition, Gilead has launched proceedings before the German courts to request a compulsory license under EP 190. However, as a result of the decision by \nthe EPO Technical Boards of Appeal in March 2023, we plan to abandon further proceedings in Germany and, as a result, we will be liable to pay a \nproportion of Gilead’s legal fees for these legal proceedings in Germany.\n \n           We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct litigation or proceedings relating to intellectual property claims. Some \nof our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial \nresources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios.

If we experience any of the \nforegoing, it could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results or operations and prospects.\n \n           If we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise \nexperience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\n \n           We have entered into license agreements with third parties and may need to obtain additional licenses from one or more of these same third parties or \nfrom others to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. It is possible that we may be unable to obtain additional licenses \nat a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign our product \ncandidates or the methods for manufacturing them or to develop or license replacement technology, all of which may not be feasible on a technical or \ncommercial basis. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize our product candidates, which would harm our business. We \ncannot provide any assurances that third-party patents or other intellectual property rights do not exist which might be enforced against our current \nmanufacturing methods, product candidates or future methods, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our manufacture or sales, or, with respect to our \nsales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties or other forms of compensation to third parties.\n \n           It is possible that in any future license agreements, patent prosecution of our licensed technology may be controlled solely by the licensor, and we \nmay be required to reimburse the licensor for their costs of patent prosecution. If our licensors fail to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for the \nproprietary intellectual property we license from them, we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, \nand our competitors could market competing products using the intellectual property. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a \nlicensing agreement, including:\n•\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n•\nthe extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing \nagreement;\n•\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n•\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n•\nthe inventorship or ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors \nand us and our partners; and\n45"

Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we \nmay be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of \nany such employee’s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\n \n           In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to \nexecute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops \nintellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced \nto bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\n \n           If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or \npersonnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to \nmanagement.\n \nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\n \n           In addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, \ntechnology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-\ndisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific \ncollaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We seek to protect our confidential proprietary information but \nenforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is \nunpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets \nwere to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, \nfrom using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a \ncompetitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\n \nOur proprietary information, or that of our suppliers and any future collaborators, may be lost or we may suffer security breaches.\n \n           In the ordinary course of our business, our CROs and other third parties on which we rely, collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual \nproperty, clinical trial data, proprietary business information, personally identifiable information of our employees and, potentially in the future, personally \nidentifiable information of our clinical trial subjects, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this \ninformation is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by \nhackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Although to our knowledge we have not experienced any such material \nsecurity breach to date, any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or \nstolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of \npersonal information, regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in us and our ability to conduct \nclinical trials, which could adversely affect our reputation and delay the clinical development of our product candidates.\n \nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\n \n46"

We are highly \ndependent on the research and development, clinical and business development expertise of Hugh Griffith, our Chief Executive Officer, as well as the other \nprincipal members of our management team and our collaborators’ scientific and clinical team. Although we have entered into service agreements with our \nexecutive officers, each of them may at any time serve notice to terminate their employment with us. Other than for Mr. Griffith, we do not maintain “key \nperson” insurance for any of our executives or other employees. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, \nto assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers \nother than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we or our \ncollaborators are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\n \n           Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing, finance, sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. The \nloss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization \nobjectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees \nmay be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and \nexperience required to successfully develop, obtain marketing approval of and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense \nand we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and \nbiotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and \nresearch institutions. Failure to succeed in clinical trials may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel. If we or our \ncollaborators are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\n47"

Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate \namount of its attention away from its day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities. Due to our \nlimited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. This may \nresult in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity \namong remaining employees. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, \nsuch as the development of our product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected development and expansion, our \nexpenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our \nbusiness strategy.

The terms of a withdrawal agreement, provided for a “Transition Period” during \nwhich E.U. rules continued to apply in the United Kingdom until December 31, 2020. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the TCA, which governs \nthe future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, was agreed upon in December 2020 and implemented in the United Kingdom \nthrough the European Union (Future Relationship) Act 2020, which came into force when the Transition Period ended. The TCA provides for zero \ntariff/zero quota trade in goods (including medicinal products) between the United Kingdom and E.U. member states, and includes commitments from the \nUnited Kingdom and the European Union to maintain common high standards across a number of areas, such as intellectual property, competition and \ntaxation, as well as a number of other benefits, such as a commitment to the United Kingdom’s continued access to the Horizon Europe research program. \nHowever, the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union single market has resulted in substantial changes for U.K. businesses, including an end \nto the free movement of persons, goods and services between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and the loss of a number of other benefits \nafforded to citizens and businesses in the United Kingdom and the European Union prior to the withdrawal, such as the mutual recognition of professional \nqualifications, or passporting for financial services. Furthermore, as the United Kingdom is no longer subject to E.U. law, or the jurisdiction of the \nEuropean Court of Justice, there is increasing scope for divergence between United Kingdom and E.U. member states’ laws and regulations, including \nthrough the amendment, application, interpretation and enforcement of the body of domestic law, as retained E.U. law, which is based on the E.U. law that \napplied to the United Kingdom at the end of the Transition Period.\n \n           These developments, and continued uncertainty around how the United Kingdom’s legal, political and economic relationship with the European \nUnion will evolve following the withdrawal, have had and may continue to have a significant adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability \nof global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be \nespecially subject to increased market volatility. These developments may also have a significant effect on our ability to attract and retain employees, \nincluding scientists and other employees who are important for our and our collaborators’ research and development efforts.\n \nIf Scotland decides to secede from the United Kingdom, our business may be adversely affected.\n \n           We are headquartered in Scotland. A referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom took place on September 18, 2014, the result \nof which was that Scotland remained part of the United Kingdom. There may in the future be a second referendum on Scottish independence from the \nUnited Kingdom. Any such referendum, even if it again ultimately resulted in Scotland remaining part of the United Kingdom, could lead to uncertainty \nand disrupt the markets in which we operate, and might cause us to lose potential customers, suppliers, collaborators and employees, including scientists \nand other key employees employed by us or our collaborators. In the event that Scotland determined to secede from the United Kingdom, the changes that \nwould result are impossible to predict with certainty at present, and would depend on post-referendum negotiations and agreements between the Scottish \nGovernment and other organizations in the United Kingdom (and, potentially, the E.U.). Independence could result in changes in the monetary system, \ncurrency, taxation and the regulatory and legal framework, and even Scotland seeking to reinstate its membership of the European Union.

For example, \nthe 2008 global financial crisis and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic each caused volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or \nprolonged economic downturn, such as resulted from each of the 2008 global financial crisis and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could result in a \nvariety of risks to our business, including our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy \ncould also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption.\n \nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of information technology and other internal infrastructure system failures.\n \n           Despite the implementation of security measures, our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems and those of our third-party \nCROs and other contractors and consultants, including corporate firewalls, servers, leased lines and connections to the Internet, are vulnerable to damage \nfrom computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Furthermore, we have little or \nno control over the security measures and computer systems of our third-party CROs and other contractors and consultants. While we have not experienced \nany such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a \nmaterial disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data for our product candidates could result in delays in our marketing approval \nefforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or \ndamage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential \nor proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\n \nOur employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with \nregulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\n \n           We are exposed to the risk that our employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal \nactivity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate the \nregulations of the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such \nauthorities; healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad; or laws that require the reporting of financial information or \ndata accurately. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to \nprevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, \ndiscounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws \nalso involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or creating fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, \nwhich could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees \nand other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or \nlosses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. \nAdditionally, we are subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted \nagainst us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including \nthe imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, \nMedicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting \nrequirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and \ncurtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\n \n \n49"

As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of \nopportunities with other product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to \ncapitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and \nproduct candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates.

The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious \ndisaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans.\n \nRisks Related to the ADSs\n \nThe price of our ADSs may be volatile and may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control.\n \n           The trading price of the ADSs has fluctuated, and is likely to continue to fluctuate substantially. The trading price of those securities depends on a \nnumber of factors, including those described in this “Risk Factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating \nperformance. In addition, although the ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or Nasdaq, we cannot assure you that a trading market for those \nsecurities will be maintained.\nSince the ADSs were sold in our initial public offering in October 2017 at a price of $15.00 per ADS, the closing price per ADS has ranged as low as $0.59 \nand as high as $29.84 through March 28, 2023. The market price of our ADSs may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are \nbeyond our control, including:\n•\npositive or negative results from, or delays in, testing and clinical trials by us, collaborators or competitors;\n•\ntechnological innovations or commercial product introductions by us or competitors;\n•\nchanges in government regulations;\n•\ndevelopments concerning proprietary rights, including patents and litigation matters;\n•\npublic concern relating to the commercial value or safety of NUC-3373 or NUC-7738 or any of our other potential product candidates;\n•\nfinancing, collaborations or other corporate transactions;\n•\npublication of research reports or comments by securities or industry analysts;\n•\ngeneral market conditions in the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries or in the economy as a whole;\n50"

Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our ADSs and may impair investors’ ability \nto sell or purchase our ADSs when they wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we may take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq’s listing \nrequirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our ADSs to become listed again, stabilize the market price or \nimprove the liquidity of our ADSs, or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements.\n \n           These and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our ADSs to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual \noperating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their ADSs and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our \nADSs. In addition, the stock market in general, and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations \nthat have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been \nvolatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of the holders of our ADSs were to bring \nsuch a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our senior management would be diverted from the \noperation of our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\n \nWe will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company in the United States, and our management is required to devote \nsubstantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\n \n           As a public company whose ADSs commenced trading in the United States in September 2017, we incur, and particularly now that we no longer \nqualify as an “emerging growth company”, or EGC, we will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur \npreviously. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq, and \nother applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on non-U.S. reporting public companies, including the establishment and \nmaintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our senior management and other personnel need to devote a \nsubstantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial \ncompliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations have made it more difficult and \nmore expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified senior \nmanagement personnel or members for our board of directors.\n \n           However, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their \napplication in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty \nregarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\n \n           Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our senior management on our \ninternal control over financial reporting. We no longer remain an EGC and we would now be required to include an attestation report on internal control \nover financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm; however, we remain exempt from this requirement due to our current \nstatus as a non-accelerated filer. We ceased to be an EGC on the last day of 2022. To prepare for compliance with Section 404(b), once we no longer qualify \nas a non-accelerated filer, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and \nchallenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants, adopt a detailed work plan to \nassess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through \ntesting that controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial \nreporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our internal control over \nfinancial reporting is effective as required by Section 404(b).

If any of our large shareholders or members of our management team sell substantial amounts of our securities in the public market, or \nthe market perceives that such sales may occur, the market price of our ADSs and our ability to raise capital through an issue of equity securities in the \nfuture could be adversely affected. We have also entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we have agreed under specified \ncircumstances to file a registration statement to register the resale of the ordinary shares (which may be converted to ADSs) held by some of our existing \nshareholders, as well as to cooperate in specified public offerings of such shares.\n \nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our ADSs or ordinary shares in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be \nthe sole source of potential gains with respect to such securities.\n \n           Under current English law, a company’s accumulated realized profits must exceed its accumulated realized losses on a non-consolidated basis before \ndividends can be paid. Therefore, we must have distributable profits before issuing a dividend. We have not paid dividends in the past on our ordinary \nshares. We intend to retain earnings, if any, for use in our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, \ncapital appreciation, if any, on our ADSs or ordinary shares will be the sole source of potential gains with respect to such securities for the foreseeable \nfuture.\n \nHolders of our ADSs may not have the same voting rights as the holders of our ordinary shares and may not receive voting materials in time to be able \nto exercise their right to vote.\n \n           Except as described in this Annual Report, holders of our ADSs will not be able to exercise voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares evidenced \nby our ADSs on an individual basis. Holders of our ADSs appoint the depositary or its nominee as their representative to exercise the voting rights \nattaching to the ordinary shares in the form of ADSs in accordance with the deposit agreement. Holders of ADSs may not receive voting materials in time \nto instruct the depositary to vote, and it is possible that they, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have \nthe opportunity to exercise a right to vote. In certain cases, the shares represented by ADSs may be voted contrary to the holder’s instructions and the \nholder may be deemed to have instructed the depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person we designate to vote shares represented by the ADSs in \nsuch person’s discretion. Furthermore, the depositary will not be liable for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote, for the manner in which any vote \nis cast or for the effect of any such vote. As a result, holders of ADSs may not be able to exercise voting rights and may lack recourse if their ADSs are not \n52"

Holders of our ADSs will receive these distributions in \nproportion to the number of our ordinary shares their ADSs represent. However, in accordance with the limitations set forth in the deposit agreement, it \nmay be unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to holders of ADSs. We have no obligation to take any other action to permit the \ndistribution of our ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or anything else to holders of our ADSs. This means that holders of our ADSs may not receive the \ndistributions we make on our ordinary shares or any value from them if it is unlawful or impractical to make them available to them.

The rights of holders of ordinary shares and, therefore, certain of the rights of holders of ADSs, are governed \nby English law, including the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, and by our Articles of Association. These rights differ in certain respects from the \nrights of shareholders in typical U.S. corporations. See “Description of Issued Share Capital—Differences in Corporate Law” in Item 10. B of this Annual \nReport for a description of the principal differences between the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to us and, for example, the Delaware \nGeneral Corporation Law relating to shareholders’ rights and protections.\n \nShareholder protections found in provisions under the U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, or the Takeover Code, will not apply if our place of \nmanagement and control is considered to change to outside the United Kingdom.\n \n           We are a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales and have our place of central management and control in the United Kingdom. \nAccordingly, we are currently subject to the Takeover Code and, as a result, our shareholders are entitled to the benefit of certain takeover offer protections \nprovided under the Takeover Code. The Takeover Code provides a framework within which takeovers of companies are regulated and conducted. If, at the \ntime of a takeover offer, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, or the Panel, determines that we do not have our place of central management and control in \nthe United Kingdom, then the Takeover Code would not apply to us and our shareholders would not be entitled to the benefit of the various protections that \nthe Takeover Code affords. In particular, we would not be subject to the rules regarding mandatory takeover bids. The Panel had published a brief summary \nof some of the most important rules of the Takeover Code, which we quote here:\n•\n“When a person or group acquires interests in shares carrying 30% or more of the voting rights of a company, they must make a cash offer to \nall other shareholders at the highest price paid in the 12 months before the offer was announced (30% of the voting rights of a company is \ntreated by the Code as the level at which effective control is obtained).\n•\nWhen interests in shares carrying 10% or more of the voting rights of a class have been acquired by an offeror (i.e. a bidder) in the offer \nperiod and the previous 12 months, the offer must include a cash alternative for all shareholders of that class at the highest price paid by the \nofferor in that period. Further, if an offeror acquires for cash any interest in shares during the offer period, a cash alternative must be made \navailable at that price at least.\n•\nIf the offeror acquires an interest in shares in an offeree company (i.e. a target) at a price higher than the value of the offer, the offer must be \nincreased accordingly.\n53"

Substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States. The majority of our senior management \nand board of directors reside outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States \nupon such persons or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or us, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of \nthe U.S. federal securities laws.\n \n           The United States and the United Kingdom do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments \n(other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by a court in the United States, whether \nor not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, uncertainty \nexists as to whether the English and Welsh courts would entertain original actions brought in England and Wales against us or our directors or senior \nmanagement predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States. Any final and conclusive monetary judgment for a \ndefinite sum obtained against us in U.S. courts would be treated by the courts of England and Wales as a cause of action in itself and sued upon as a debt so \nthat no retrial of the issues would be necessary, provided that certain requirements are met consistent with English law and public policy. Whether these \nrequirements are met in respect of a judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws is an issue for the English court making \nsuch decision. If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods \ngenerally available for this purpose.\n \n           As a result, U.S. investors may not be able to enforce against us or our senior management, board of directors or certain experts named herein who \nare residents of the United Kingdom or countries other than the United States any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, \nincluding judgments under the U.S. federal securities laws.\n \nWe qualify as a foreign private issuer and, as a result, we are not subject to U.S. proxy rules and are subject to Exchange Act reporting obligations that, \nto some extent, are more lenient and less frequent than those of a U.S. domestic public company.\n \n           We report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as a non-U.S. company with foreign private issuer status. \nBecause we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the Exchange Act that are applicable to \nU.S. domestic public companies, including (i) the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect \nof a security registered under the Exchange Act; (ii) the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and \ntrading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and (iii) the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the \nfiling with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q containing unaudited financial and other \n54"

In addition, foreign private issuers are not \nrequired to file their annual report on Form 20-F until 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, while U.S. domestic issuers that are accelerated filers are \nrequired to file their annual report on Form 10-K within 75 days after the end of each fiscal year. Foreign private issuers also are exempt from Regulation \nFair Disclosure, aimed at preventing issuers from making selective disclosures of material information. As a result of the above, our shareholders may not \nhave the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are not foreign private issuers.\n \nAs a foreign private issuer, we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices in relation to corporate governance matters that differ \nsignificantly from Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards. These practices may afford less protection to shareholders than they would enjoy if \nwe complied fully with Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards.\n \n           As a foreign private issuer listed on Nasdaq, we are subject to corporate governance listing standards. However, Nasdaq rules permit a foreign \nprivate issuer like us to follow the corporate governance practices of its home country in lieu of certain Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards. \nCertain corporate governance practices in the United Kingdom, which is our home country, may differ significantly from Nasdaq corporate governance \nlisting standards. For example, neither the corporate laws of the United Kingdom nor our Articles of Association require a majority of our directors to be \nindependent; we can and do include non-independent directors as members of our nominations; and our independent directors are not required to hold \nregularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. Therefore, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they \notherwise would have under Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.\n \nWe may lose our foreign private issuer status, which would then require us to comply with the Exchange Act’s domestic reporting regime and cause us \nto incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses.\n \n           As a foreign private issuer, we are not required to comply with all of the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act \napplicable to U.S. domestic issuers. We may no longer be a foreign private issuer as of June 30, 2023 (the end of our next second fiscal quarter), which \nwould require us to comply with all of the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to U.S. domestic issuers \nas of January 1, 2024. In order to maintain our current status as a foreign private issuer, either (a) a majority of our voting securities must be either directly \nor indirectly owned of record by non-residents of the United States or (b)(i) a majority of our executive officers or directors cannot be U.S. citizens or \nresidents, (ii) more than 50% of our assets must be located outside the United States and (iii) our business must be administered principally outside the \nUnited States. If we lose our status as a foreign private issuer, we would be required to comply with the Exchange Act reporting and other requirements \napplicable to U.S. domestic issuers, which are more detailed and extensive than the requirements for foreign private issuers. We may also be required to \nmake changes in our corporate governance practices in accordance with various SEC and Nasdaq rules. The regulatory and compliance costs to us under \nU.S. securities laws if we are required to comply with the reporting requirements applicable to a U.S. domestic issuer may be significantly higher than the \ncost we incur as a foreign private issuer. As a result, we expect that a loss of foreign private issuer status would increase our legal and financial compliance \ncosts and would make some activities highly time consuming and costly. We also expect that if we were required to comply with the rules and regulations \napplicable to U.S. domestic issuers, it would make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be \nrequired to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for \nus to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors.\n \nWe are no longer an “emerging growth company,” and will thus be subject to additional reporting requirements.\n \n           We ceased to be an EGC as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, on the last day of 2022. As a result, we may no longer \ntake advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are available to EGCs, including not being required to comply with the auditor \nattestation requirements of Section 404(b); however, we remain exempt from this requirement due to our current status as a non-accelerated filer. We are no \nlonger able to report only two years of financial results and selected financial data and will have to report three and five years, respectively. \n \nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or \nprevent fraud. As a result, shareholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the \ntrading price of our ADSs.\n \n           Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure \ncontrols and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their \nimplementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404, or any \nsubsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that \n55"

Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have \na negative effect on the trading price of our ADSs.\n \n           Management is required to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls annually.  We are no longer an EGC under the JOBS Act and our \nindependent registered public accounting firm would be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to \nSection 404(b); however, we remain exempt from this requirement due to our current status as a non-accelerated filer.  We ceased to be an EGC on the last \nday of 2022.  An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management’s assessment might not. \nUndetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements requiring us to incur the expense of remediation and \ncould also result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\n \nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of our ADSs and \nour trading volume could decline.\n \n           The trading market for our ADSs depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. \nSecurities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on us. If no or too few securities or industry analysts commence coverage \non us, the trading price for our ADSs would likely be negatively affected. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the \nanalysts who cover us downgrade our ADSs or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our ADSs would likely decline. \nIf one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our ADSs could decrease, which might cause the \nprice of our ADSs and trading volume to decline.\n \nWe may be a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for any taxable year, which could result in material adverse U.S. federal income tax \nconsequences if you are a U.S. investor.\n \n           Generally, if for any taxable year, at least 75% of our gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of the value of our assets is attributable to \nassets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income, including cash, we would be characterized as a passive foreign \ninvestment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The determination of whether we are a PFIC depends on the particular facts and \ncircumstances (such as the valuation of our assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, and the characterization of our income, including whether \ncertain research and development tax credits received from the government of the United Kingdom will constitute gross income, and if they do, whether \nthey will constitute passive income for purposes of the PFIC income test) and may also be affected by the application of the PFIC rules, which are subject \nto differing interpretations. In addition, for purpose of the PFIC asset test, the value of our assets will depend in part on the market price of our ordinary \nshares, which may fluctuate significantly. Based on our estimated gross income, the average value of our assets, including goodwill and the nature of our \nactive business, we believe we were a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the taxable year ended December 31, 2022. There can be no assurance \nregarding our PFIC status for the current taxable year or any particular year in the future because PFIC status is factual in nature, depends upon factors not \nwholly within our control, generally cannot be determined until the close of the taxable year in question and is determined annually. Accordingly, U.S. \ninvestors should invest in our ADSs only if they are willing to bear the U.S. federal income tax consequences associated with investments in PFICs.\n \n           If we are a PFIC, U.S. holders of our ADSs may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, such as the ineligibility for any \npreferred tax rates on capital gains or on actual or deemed dividends for individuals who are U.S. holders, having interest apply to distributions by us and \nthe proceeds of sales of the ADSs, and additional reporting requirements under U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations. Investors should consult their \nown tax advisors regarding all aspects of the application of the PFIC rules to our ADSs. We intend to provide the information necessary for a U.S. investor \nto make a qualifying electing fund election with respect to us.

Information on the Company\nA.\t History and Development of the Company\n \n           We were incorporated under the laws of England and Wales in 1997 under the name Biomed (UK) Limited, and commenced operations in 2008. On \nApril 28, 2008, we changed our name to NuCana BioMed Limited. On August 29, 2017, we re-registered as a public limited company and changed our \nname to NuCana plc. On October 2, 2017, we completed our initial public offering of American Depositary Shares, or ADSs, on The Nasdaq Global Select \nMarket. Our ADSs are traded under the symbol “NCNA”. \n \n           Our registered office is located at 77/78 Cannon Street, London EC4N 6AF, United Kingdom. Our principal executive offices are located at 3 \nLochside Way, Edinburgh, EH12 9DT, United Kingdom, our general telephone number is +44 (0)131 357 1111 and our internet address is \nhttps://www.nucana.com. Our website and the information contained on or accessible through our website are not part of this Annual Report. Our agent for \nservice of process in the United States is Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808. The SEC maintains an internet site \nthat contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC (http://www.sec.gov).\nB.\t\nBusiness\n \nOverview \n \n           We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on significantly improving treatment outcomes for patients with cancer by applying our \nProTide™ technology to transform some of the most widely prescribed chemotherapy agents, nucleoside analogs, into more effective and safer medicines. \nWhile these conventional agents are central to the treatment of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies, their efficacy can be limited by: rapid \nbreakdown, which can lead to the generation of toxic by-products; poor uptake by cell membrane transporters; inefficient metabolism to the active anti-\ncancer metabolite; and poor pharmacokinetic, or PK, properties which often require challenging administration schedules. Utilizing our proprietary \ntechnology, we are developing new medicines called ProTides, designed to overcome all these key limitations, resulting in much higher concentrations of \nthe active anti-cancer metabolites in cancer cells and avoiding the off-target toxicity associated with conventional chemotherapy.  \n \n           NUC-3373 is a new chemical entity derived from the nucleoside analog 5-fluorouracil, a widely used chemotherapy agent, which we believe has the \npotential to replace 5-FU as the standard of care in the treatment of a wide range of cancers. 5-FU is one of the world’s most widely prescribed anti-cancer \nagents and is on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines. NUC-3373 has been evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with \nadvanced solid tumors. NUC-3373 is currently in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, in combination with other agents, for patients with advanced colorectal cancer.  \nWe have also initiated a randomized Phase 2 study of NUC-3373, in combination with other agents, for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced \ncolorectal cancer. In addition, NuCana has initiated a Phase 1b/2 modular clinical trial of NUC-3373 in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor \npembrolizumab for patients with advanced solid tumors and in combination with docetaxel for patients with lung cancer. \n \n           NUC-7738 is a ProTide transformation of 3’-deoxyadenosine, a novel anti-cancer nucleoside analog, that has shown potent anti-cancer activity in \npreclinical studies but due to rapid breakdown has not been successfully developed or approved as an anti-cancer agent. NUC-7738 is in the Phase 2 part of \na Phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients with advanced solid tumors which is evaluating NUC-7738 as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab.\n \n           The treatment of cancer can be divided into three major categories: surgery, radiotherapy and therapeutics. Therapeutics include chemotherapy, \nimmunotherapy, cell-based therapies and targeted and hormonal agents. The backbone of treatment for patients with cancer consists of chemotherapeutics, \nwhich are expected to achieve global revenues of approximately $74.3 billion by 2027. Despite significant progress having been made in the development \nof new therapeutics, most patients continue to receive chemotherapy either in combination with other treatments or as single agents at some point in their \ntreatment pathway. Thus, we believe that more effective and safer chemotherapeutic agents will have an important role to play in the treatment of patients \nwith cancer for the foreseeable future. We are transforming an important class of chemotherapeutic agents, nucleoside analogs, by applying a well-validated \nmedicinal chemistry approach to overcome their limitations.  \n \n           Through harnessing the power of phosphoramidate chemistry, we convert nucleoside analogs into activated nucleotide analogs with the addition of a \nphosphate group, which is protected by specific combinations of aryl, ester and amino acid groupings. By adding and protecting this phosphate group, we \ndesign our ProTides to avoid or overcome the limitations \n57"

In the antiviral field, this phosphoramidate chemistry approach has \nresulted in the most successful drug launches in the history of medicine, Gilead’s sofosbuvir, or Sovaldi® which is also a key component of Harvoni®, \nVosevi® and Epclusa®;and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate, or TAF, which is a key component of Genvoya®, Descovy® and Odefsey®.  In addition, \nphosphoramidate chemistry is used in Gilead’s remdesivir, or Veklury®, for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.\n \n           In preclinical studies, NUC-3373 overcame the key limitations associated with 5-FU, generating higher intracellular levels of the active anti-cancer \nmetabolite than 5-FU while not generating toxic metabolites commonly associated with 5-FU’s side effects. NUC-3373 has been evaluated in a Phase 1 \nclinical trial, also known as the NuTide:301 trial, in patients with advanced solid tumors. Enrollment in this trial has been completed with 59 patients \nreceiving NUC-3733. The maximum tolerated dose and schedule for NUC-3373 monotherapy was established as 2500 mg/m2 weekly. NUC-3373 \ngenerated high levels of the active anti-cancer metabolite inside the patients’ cells and demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile. \nEvidence of durable anti-cancer activity was observed, with at least 10 patients remaining on treatment for more than four months and three of these \npatients achieving prolonged stable disease with progression-free survival, or PFS, lasting more than nine months. The results of this trial suggest that \nNUC-3373 has the potential to overcome the limitations associated with 5-FU and may be capable of achieving anti-cancer activity even in patients who \nhave progressed on prior treatment with a fluoropyrimidine. \n \n           NUC-3373 is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1b/2 trial, known as the NuTide:302 trial, in patients with advanced colorectal cancer in which \nNUC-3373 is being combined with agents typically used with 5-FU, including leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. In October 2019, we \npresented interim data from this trial at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. These interim \ndata supported the previously reported favorable pharmacokinetic profile of NUC-3373. In April 2021, we presented further interim data from this trial at \nthe virtual AACR Annual Meeting. These interim data highlighted 38 patients who received NUC-3373 either as monotherapy or in combination with \nleucovorin. Eleven patient case studies showed NUC-3373’s ability to stabilize disease in a heavily pre-treated population of patients with advanced \ncolorectal cancer and achieve prolonged durations of progression-free survival. Several patients achieved periods of progression-free survival that were \nlonger than those achieved on previous regimens and tumor shrinkages have been observed, including in a patient known to be refractory to all prior \nfluoropyrimidine-containing regimens. NUC-3373 was also shown to have a favorable safety profile with no hand-foot syndrome observed, which is \nassociated with the toxic metabolite, FBAL, and no neutropenia or Grade 3 or 4 mucositis or diarrhea adverse events, which are associated with the toxic \nmetabolite, FUTP.  In September 2022, we presented data from this trial at the ESMO Congress. These data demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity and \na favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile as a single agent and in combination of leucovorin in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced colorectal \ncancer.\n \n           The anti-cancer mechanism of action of NUC-3373 has been established in preclinical studies, which we believe further supports the biological \nadvantages of NUC-3373 over 5-FU. We believe NUC-3373 has significant commercial potential as approximately 500,000 patients in North America are \nestimated to receive intravenous 5-FU each year. Replacing 5-FU with NUC-3373 in the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer offers a substantial \ncommercial opportunity. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer type globally, representing 10% of the overall annual global cancer incidence. \nIn the United States alone, more than 150,000 new cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed each year. It is expected that the global colorectal cancer burden \nwill increase by 60% from approximately 1.9 million cases in 2020 to approximately 3.1 million cases in 2040. As colorectal cancer is often diagnosed late \nin most patients when it is locally advanced or metastatic, and only 14% of patients with stage 4 disease survive for five years, there is a high unmet need \nfor more effective treatment options.\n \n           The NuTide:302 trial had completed Part 2 of the trial and data from this Part were presented at the ESMO Congress in September 2022. These data \ndemonstrated promising anti-tumor activity and a favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile in combination with leucovorin and either irinotecan \n(NUFIRI) or oxaliplatin (NUFOX) in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced colorectal cancer. NuTide:302 is currently enrolling patients into Part 3 of \nthe trial, which is evaluating NUFIRI and NUFOX in combination with bevacizumab for the second-line treatment of patients with colorectal cancer. We \nexpect to report additional data from Part 3 of the NuTide:302 trial in 2023.\n \n           A randomized Phase 2 trial, known as the NuTide:323 trial, of NUC-3373 in combination with other agents for the second-line treatment of patients \nwith advanced colorectal cancer was initiated in 2022. We expect to report initial data from the NuTide:323 trial in 2023.\n \n58"

We expect to report initial data \nfrom the NuTide:303 trial in 2023.\n \n           In preclinical studies, NUC-7738, generated significantly higher levels of the key anti-cancer metabolite, 3’deoxyadenosine triphosphate or 3’-dATP, \ninside cancer cells compared to the parent nucleoside analog, 3’-dA, causing increased cancer cell injury. In October 2019, we announced preclinical data \non NUC-7738, detailing multiple potential anti-cancer modes of action.\n \n           NUC-7738, is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial, known as the NuTide:701 trial, in patients with advanced solid tumors and is \ncurrently in the Phase 2 part of the clinical trial. In September 2021, we presented interim data from the first 29 patients treated in this trial at the ESMO \nVirtual Congress. These interim data indicated a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile for NUC-7738. Additionally, three case studies highlighted \npatients with encouraging tumor reductions who remained on NUC-7738 treatment for extended periods of time. The NuTide:701 trial has completed the \nPhase 1 dose-finding part with the maximum tolerated dose established. In June 2022, we presented data at the European Hematology Association 2022 \nHybrid Congress that showed that NUC-7738 can suppress the expansion and survival of AML cells by reducing ß-catenin signaling, a key pathway in \nAML.  In September 2022, we presented data from the Phase 1 the NuTide:701 trial at the ESMO Congress. These data showed encouraging signals of \nanti-tumor activity across a range of tumor types, particularly melanoma. Promising data were observed in a variety of solid tumors with numerous patients \nstaying on treatment for extended periods, including one patient with metastatic melanoma who became eligible for complete surgical resection following \neleven months of treatment with NUC-7738. NUC-7738 also had a favorable safety profile with low rates of treatment-related AEs (TRAEs), very few \nGrade 3 TRAEs and no patients experiencing Grade 4 or 5 TRAEs. We expect to report additional data from the NuTide:701 trial in 2023. \n \n           Acelarin is a ProTide transformation of the nucleoside analog gemcitabine. In clinical trials, Acelarin was well tolerated and showed anti-cancer \nactivity in patients who were refractory to, or had progressed on, prior gemcitabine treatment. Disease control, as well as tumor shrinkages, including \npartial and complete responses, were observed in challenging indications, including ovarian and biliary tract cancers. In March 2022, we announced the \ndiscontinuation of the Phase 3 clinical trial, also known as the NuTide:121 trial, investigating Acelarin in combination with cisplatin versus the standard of \ncare, gemcitabine plus cisplatin, in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer. This decision was made following \na pre-planned futility analysis by the trial’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Although a higher objective response rate, as assessed by Blinded \nIndependent Central Review, was observed in the Acelarin plus cisplatin arm, this did not translate into an overall survival benefit. We are assessing future \ndevelopment options for Acelarin in biliary tract cancer which may explore lower doses of Acelarin, alternative combination partners or specific sub-sets of \nbiliary tract cancer patients. Indications other than biliary tract cancer are also being assessed as future development options for Acelarin. \n \n           Our proprietary ProTide technology was invented in the Cardiff University laboratory of our late Chief Scientific Officer, Professor Christopher \nMcGuigan, who conceived of and filed the original composition of matter patents for our initial ProTides. The unique feature of his discovery was the \nspecific combination of aryl, ester and amino acid groupings that protect the activated, or phosphorylated, nucleoside analog. This phosphoramidate \nchemistry approach is the key to the ProTide technology. Every ProTide grouping is distinct, and Professor McGuigan and his team synthesized and tested \nthousands of compounds in order to identify the optimal ProTide grouping for each underlying nucleoside analog. \n \n           We have licensed what we believe to be the foundational patent estate for the application of phosphoramidate chemistry in oncology. We have \ngranted patents in key markets, including the United States, Europe and Japan, protecting the composition of matter of NUC-3373, NUC-7738, Acelarin \nand other of our product candidates. Professor McGuigan’s work preceded and helped lead to the development of several FDA-approved anti-viral drugs \ncontaining ProTides, including: sofosbuvir, or Sovaldi®, which is also a key component of Harvoni®, Vosevi® and Epclusa®; and tenofovir alafenamide \nfumarate, or TAF, which is a key component of Genvoya®, Descovy® and Odefsey®; and remdesivir, or Veklury®.\n \n           We are led by Hugh Griffith, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, who brings over 30 years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry, \nincluding at Abbott Laboratories (now AbbVie Inc.) and Parke-Davis Warner Lambert (now Pfizer Inc.). Before founding NuCana, he led the operations of \nBioenvision, Inc. from start-up through its acquisition by Genzyme Corporation.

Our pipeline of product candidates in clinical development and their current development stage is summarized below. \n \n \n \nCancer and the Need for Improved Treatment Options\n \n           Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 1.96 million new cases and approximately 610,000 deaths \nexpected in 2023 according to the American Cancer Society.\n \n           The treatment of cancer can be divided into three major categories: surgery, radiotherapy and therapeutics. Therapeutics include chemotherapy, \nimmunotherapy, cell-based therapies and targeted and hormonal agents.\n \n           The backbone of treatment for patients with cancer consists of chemotherapeutics, which are expected to achieve revenues of approximately $74.3 \nbillion by 2027. The number of new patients requiring chemotherapy each year is also predicted to increase, with projections estimated to rise from 9.8 \nmillion in 2018 to 15 million in 2040. Chemotherapeutics exert their effects by killing cancer cells or preventing them from replicating and are often used \nin combination with other therapies. Within the larger universe of chemotherapy, nucleoside analogs, such as 5-FU, play a significant role. Nucleoside \nanalogs have been in clinical use for over 50 years and have become cornerstones of treatment for patients with cancer. The FDA has approved 16 \nnucleoside analogs for the treatment of cancer and many of these have become the standard of care globally for patients. FDA-approved anti-cancer \nnucleoside analogs are: 5-FU; capecitabine; gemcitabine; floxuridine; clofarabine; fludarabine; cytarabine; azacytidine; decitabine; nelarabine; cladribine; \npentostatin; 6-mercaptopurine; tipiracil; 6-thioguanine; and trifluorothymidine. The World Health Organization has classified seven of these nucleoside \nanalogs, including 5-FU, as Essential Medicines, which they define as medicines that satisfy the priority healthcare needs of the population and should be \navailable at all times. \n \n           Many chemotherapies have generated significant sales. Approximately 500,000 patients per year in North America receive 5-FU, which is widely \nused for the treatment of many cancers, including colorectal, breast, stomach, head and neck, and pancreatic cancers. The oral version of a derivative of 5-\nFU, known as capecitabine and marketed as Xeloda® for the treatment of colorectal and breast cancer, had worldwide sales of $1.5 billion in 2012, before \nthe market launch of generic competitors. We believe the number of patients receiving capecitabine represents a small proportion of the overall number of \npatients treated with 5-FU and its derivatives. \n \n61"

      "text": "Shortcomings of Nucleoside Analogs\n \n           Despite the widespread use of nucleoside analogs, their efficacy and safety is severely limited by major shortcomings, including breakdown, poor \npharmacokinetic properties, requirement for uptake by transporters, and inefficient metabolic pathways to generate the active anti-cancer metabolite.\n           \n           Nucleoside analogs block the replication of cancer cells by providing faulty DNA and RNA building blocks during the cell replication process or by \nblocking enzymes necessary for the production of these DNA and RNA building blocks. These processes lead to disruption of DNA and RNA replication \nresulting in cancer cell death, known as apoptosis. However, there are several major shortcomings that limit the efficacy of existing nucleoside analogs \nincluding:\n•\nBreakdown. Multiple enzymatic processes can break down nucleoside analogs, resulting in their degradation prior to phosphorylation. In \naddition to preventing the generation of the active anti-cancer metabolite, breakdown can also result in the release of metabolites that can lead \nto off-target toxicity. For example, the breakdown of 5-FU is known to result in the generation of a toxic byproduct called FBAL, which has \nbeen associated with off-target toxicity including “hand-foot syndrome”, a debilitating side effect that commonly causes dose reductions or \ndiscontinuation of therapy. Breakdown can take place either inside or outside the cancer cell.\n•\nUptake by transporters. Nucleoside analogs require specific active-transport proteins in the cell membrane to enter cancer cells. If these \nproteins are missing or down-regulated, nucleoside analogs cannot enter the cancer cell to exert their anti-cancer effect. Transport proteins are \noften not expressed at sufficient levels in many solid tumor cancers which can result in poorer outcomes for patients treated with nucleoside \nanalogs. \n•\nInefficient metabolic pathways. Nucleoside analogs are all dosed as inactive precursors, or prodrugs, because their active forms are unstable \nand their negative charge further prevents them from entering cells. They must therefore undergo activation through complex pathways to \ngenerate the anti-cancer metabolites. Naturally occurring enzymes are required for this activation and the levels of these enzymes vary from \nperson to person and can also be poorly expressed in cancer cells. This results in unpredictable metabolism and activation of nucleoside \nanalogs.\n•\nPoor pharmacokinetic properties. Due to rapid breakdown and poor PK properties, nucleoside analogs can require challenging \nadministration schedules, which are burdensome and inconvenient for both patients and healthcare providers. For example, the plasma half-\nlife of 5-FU is very short at 8 to 14 minutes, resulting in the need for prolonged infusion times over 46 hours to enable uptake and activation \nof 5-FU’s main anti-cancer metabolite in the cancer cell. \n \n \n62"

      "text": "Two other drugs have been approved that aim to generate the same active anti-cancer metabolite as 5-FU: fluorodeoxyuridine, or Floxuridine, \nmarketed as FUDR ®, and capecitabine, marketed as Xeloda ®. Capecitabine is a derivative of 5-FU containing a chemical modification of the nucleoside \nring, which allows oral dosing.\n \n           The anti-cancer activity of 5-FU and its other forms, FUDR and capecitabine, is largely attributed to the phosphorylated active anti-cancer \nmetabolite, fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate, FdUMP or FUDR-MP, which binds to and inhibits the intracellular enzyme, thymidylate synthase, or TS. \nTS, a critical enzyme in de novo nucleotide synthesis and cell survival, is required to convert uridine, specifically deoxy-uridine monophosphate, or dUMP, \nto thymidine, specifically deoxy-thymidine monophosphate, or dTMP, one of the four nucleotides that comprise DNA. The inhibition of TS therefore \nresults in an imbalance in the ratio of the nucleotides dUMP and dTMP, disrupting DNA synthesis and repair, which leads to cancer cell death.\n \n           Several key limitations have been associated with a poor prognosis to a 5-FU therapeutic regimen. We believe NUC-3373, overcomes these \nlimitations, as well as the dosing administration challenges, associated with 5-FU.\n \n       1. Subject to breakdown. Approximately 85% of 5-FU is degraded by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, or DPD, an enzyme largely expressed in the \nliver. This breakdown destroys most of the drug before it has an opportunity to enter the cancer cell, become activated and exert any therapeutic effect. \nFurthermore, this breakdown results in the generation of a toxic byproduct, FBAL, which has been associated with off-target toxicity, including “hand-foot \nsyndrome,” which is reported in various sources as affecting 25% to 75% of patients treated with fluoropyrimidines. Hand-foot syndrome is a debilitating \nside effect characterized by reddening, swelling, numbness and skin sloughing or peeling on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and commonly \nleads to dose reductions or discontinuation of therapy for patients receiving 5-FU. In addition, high levels of DPD have also been found to be elevated in \ntumors that are resistant to 5-FU.\n \n       2. Requires active transport. 5-FU relies on specific transporters in order to cross the cellular membrane. If these transporters are not present or are \nexpressed at low levels, 5-FU’s ability to enter the cancer cell will be limited. For example, low expression of the nucleoside transporter, hENT1, has been \nassociated with cancer cell resistance to 5-FU.\n \n       3. Inefficient metabolic pathways. Once 5-FU enters cells, it must be processed by a series of enzymes to generate the active anti-cancer metabolite, \nFUDR-MP. FUDR-MP binds to and inhibits TS, leading to increased levels of uridine and decreased levels of thymidine which result in cancer cell death. \nThere are several key enzymes involved in the conversion of 5-FU to FUDR-MP. One of these is orotate phosphoribosyl transferase, or OPRT. Lower levels \nof OPRT in tumor cells are associated with resistance to 5-FU. Another intracellular enzyme, thymidine phosphorylase, or TP, can reversibly convert 5-FU \nto fluorodeoxyuridine, or FUDR, an intermediate to the formation of FUDR-MP. Low expression of TP in human cancer cells is associated with resistance \nto 5-FU. In addition, thymidine kinase, or TK, is the enzyme that converts FUDR to the active anti-cancer metabolite, FUDR-MP. Low expression of TK in \nhuman cancer cells is associated with resistance to 5-FU. 5-FU’s metabolic pathway also results in the generation of the metabolite FUTP, which is \nassociated with dose limiting toxicities such as diarrhea, mucositis and neutropenia.\n \n       4. Poor pharmacokinetic profile. The pharmacokinetic properties of 5-FU also lead to dosing administration challenges. 5-FU has a short half-life of \nbetween 8 and 14 minutes in plasma. In an effort to counter the short time period that cells are exposed to 5-FU, healthcare providers often administer 5-FU \nas a continuous infusion over extended periods of time. For example, patients being treated for colorectal cancer typically receive 5-FU through a \ncontinuous infusion over 46 hours using a portable pump. This dosing requirement creates burdens for providers, inconveniences patients and contributes \nadditional costs to the healthcare system. Furthermore, 5-FU’s pharmacokinetic profile is unpredictable and patients with certain characteristics can \nexperience dangerously high levels of 5-FU, which can be fatal, or ineffective levels of 5-FU.\n \nOur Solution: NUC-3373\n \n           NUC-3373 is a protected form of the active anti-cancer metabolite, FUDR-MP, specifically designed to overcome the key shortcomings that limit the \nclinical utility of the fluoropyrimidines. NUC-3373 is a nucleotide analog that releases the same active anti-cancer metabolite, FUDR-MP, that 5-FU aims \nto generate within a cancer cell, but at significantly higher intracellular concentrations. NUC-3373 has been evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial, \nNuTide:301, in patients with advanced solid tumors. NUC-3373, is currently in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, NuTide:302, in combination with other agents, \nfor patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

This moiety protects \nthe FUDR-MP making it resistant to breakdown by the enzyme DPD, which reduces the generation of toxic byproducts such as FBAL. It also confers a \nmore predictable pharmacokinetic profile including a longer half-life, estimated at between 6 to 14 hours in plasma, and a better distribution into tissues. \nThese properties allow NUC-3373 to be administered through a short infusion of approximately 2 hours. The chemical structure of the ProTide alters the \nlipophilicity of the molecule, allowing NUC-3373 to enter cancer cells without the need for membrane transporters. Once inside the cancer cell, the \nphosphoramidate moiety is cleaved off, resulting in deprotection and the release of FUDR-MP. This bypasses the need for any activating enzymes, resulting \nin significantly higher levels of the active anti-cancer metabolite, which we believe will lead to improved efficacy as compared to 5-FU. Furthermore, the \nmetabolic pathways utilized by NUC-3373 avoid the generation of the toxic metabolite FUTP so toxicities such as neutropenia, diarrhea and mucositis \nshould be significantly reduced.\n \n           The metabolism of NUC-3373 compared to 5-FU as described above is illustrated in the following graphic.\n \n \nNUC-3373 Preclinical Data\n \n           NUC-3373 has greater anti-cancer activity than 5-FU. In preclinical studies, NUC-3373 was not reliant on activating enzymes, including OPRT, \nTP and TK, all of which are essential for activating 5-FU. In addition, we measured the anti-cancer activity of NUC-3373 and 5-FU across a range of \nhuman tumor cell lines, including colorectal, ovarian and lung cancers. NUC-3373 had up to 330 times greater activity than 5-FU. The following figure \nshows the levels of NUC-3373 or \n66"

      "text": "5-FU required, in various tumor cell lines, to kill half of the cancer cells, with the shorter bars representing more potent activity.\n \n \n           Preclinical studies in human colorectal cancer cells showed that NUC-3373 generated intracellular levels of the active anti-cancer metabolite, \nFUDR-MP, 366 times higher than those achieved by administering equivalent amounts of 5-FU. We believe that these increased intracellular levels of \nFUDR-MP could translate into the ability of NUC-3373 to kill various cancer cells at much lower equimolar doses than those of 5-FU. Moreover, in a \npreclinical colorectal cancer xenograft study, NUC-3373 showed a greater ability to reduce tumor weight and volume than 5-FU.\n \n           NUC-3373 has multiple potential anti-cancer mechanisms of action. Experiments in human colorectal cancer cell lines have shown that NUC-3373 \nmay kill cancer cells through several different mechanisms. In cells, the enzyme thymidylate synthase, or TS, is required to convert uridine, specifically \ndeoxy-uridine monophosphate, or dUMP, to thymidine, specifically deoxy-thymidine monophosphate or dTMP. Thymidine is one of the nucleotides that \ncomprises DNA. The inhibition of TS therefore results in an imbalance in the ratio of the nucleotides dUMP and dTMP, disrupting DNA synthesis and \nrepair, which leads to cancer cell death. Patients with cancer can have different levels of the enzyme TS in their tumor cells, and this is thought to affect \nhow well drugs such as 5-FU work. However, in our experiments we found that the level of TS in different colorectal cancer cells did not predict the ability \nof NUC-3373 to kill the cancer cells. This suggests that NUC-3373 may have anti-cancer activity against tumors even when their TS levels are high. In \nanother experiment, adding thymidine to the cancer cells reduced the ability of NUC-3373 to cause cell death. This confirms that NUC‑3373 causes cancer \ncell death by inhibiting TS and reducing thymidine levels. In addition, when cancer cells were treated with NUC-3373, more of them had TS in the \ncytoplasm of the cell compared to untreated cells, which mostly had TS in the nucleus of the cell. We believe that by keeping TS in the cell cytoplasm and \npreventing it from moving to the nucleus, NUC-3373 causes a further imbalance in the levels of dUMP and dTMP.  \n \n           In another set of experiments, the activity and metabolism of NUC-3373 was directly compared to that of 5-FU in colorectal cancer cell lines. The \nactive anti-cancer metabolite, FUDR-MP, inhibits thymidine synthesis through binding to and forming a ternary complex with TS. This causes an \nimbalance in the cellular nucleotide pools by preventing the conversion of dUMP to dTMP and leads to disruption of DNA synthesis and repair. In these \nexperiments, NUC-3373 was shown to cause greater TS complex formation than 5-FU, even at lower drug concentrations. This suggests that NUC-3373 \nmay be a more potent inhibitor of TS than 5‑FU. Furthermore, when anti-cancer metabolite generation was assessed in these cell lines it was found that \nNUC-3373 generated significantly higher levels of FUDR-MP compared to 5-FU and had a more pronounced effect on the dUMP levels, suggesting a \ngreater impact on nucleotide pools. NUC-3373’s ability to generate high intracellular levels of FUDR-MP resulted in the generation of the triphosphate \nform of the anti-cancer metabolite, or FUDR-TP (also referred to as FdUTP), which was shown to be incorporated into the DNA of cancer cells. This effect \nwas not observed with 5-FU. These results suggest that NUC-3373 may be not only a more potent TS inhibitor, but also a more efficient DNA- damaging \nagent compared to 5-FU. Finally, while 5-FU treatment led to the production of the toxic metabolite FUTP in these cells, FUTP was not detectable \nfollowing treatment of these cells with NUC-3373.\n67"

This leads to the release of molecules called Damage Associated Molecular Patterns, or DAMPs, from the cancer cells as they die, or so-called \nimmunogenic cell death, or ICD. This process of ICD is characterized by the cell surface exposure or extracellular release of calreticulin, or CRT, and high-\nmobility-group box 1 protein, or HMGB1, from dying cells, as depicted in the diagram below. These DAMPs help the immune system to recognize cancer \ncells in the body, thus promoting the further killing of cancer cells by immune cells.\n \n \n           Overall, these non-clinical studies suggest that NUC-3373 potentially has the ability to enhance the activity of immunotherapy agents by making \ntumors more visible to the immune system. This was demonstrated in a series of experiments in which cancer cells treated with NUC-3373 were exposed to \nimmune cells in combination with the immunotherapy agent nivolumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor.

In \nthe United States, over 150,000 new cases of colorectal cancer and approximately 53,000 deaths due to the disease occur annually. Worldwide, there were \nan estimated 1.9 million new colorectal cancer cases and 916,000 deaths in 2020, and the global burden is expected to increase by 60% to approximately \n3.1 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths annually by 2040. Most treatment regimens for colorectal cancer include 5-FU as the cornerstone of therapy, \neither as monotherapy or in combination with another chemotherapeutic, typically oxaliplatin or irinotecan. Nevertheless, despite being the standard of \ncare, the effectiveness of 5-FU is modest. Overall response rates are in the range of 10% to 15%. Furthermore, colorectal cancer is typically diagnosed late \nwhen it is already locally advanced or metastatic and only 14% of patients with Stage 4 disease at diagnosis survive five years. Thus, there is a high unmet \nneed for more effective and safer treatment options than the current standard of care, 5-FU.\n  \nNUC-7738: A Transformation of 3’-dA\n \n           NUC-7738 is a ProTide transformation of 3’-deoxyadenosine, or 3’-dA, also known as cordycepin, a nucleoside analog that was originally isolated \nfrom the fungus Cordyceps sinensis in 1950. Since that time, 3’-dA has shown potent anti-cancer activity in preclinical studies, but has not been \nsuccessfully developed or approved as a treatment for patients with cancer. The cytotoxic effect of 3’-dA is largely attributed to the generation of the main \nactive anti-cancer metabolite, 3'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate, or 3'-dATP. Similar to our other ProTides, NUC-7738 is designed to generate the active anti-\ncancer metabolite of 3’-dA directly inside cells, bypassing the key limitations associated with breakdown, transportation and activation. \n \n3’-dA and its limitations\n \n           Similar to other nucleoside analogs, major shortcomings have limited the successful clinical development of 3’-dA.\n \n           1. Subject to breakdown. 3’-dA is rapidly broken down by the enzyme adenosine deaminase, or ADA, preventing its activation and generation of its \nactive anti-cancer form. As a result, the anti-cancer effect of 3’-dA is readily negated by ADA. This rapid breakdown is the key limiting factor that has \nprevented the successful development of 3’-dA in the clinic.\n \n           2. Requires active transport. 3’-dA requires the nucleoside transporter, hENT1, to cross the cancer cell membrane. Therefore, hENT1-deficient \ncancer cells are highly resistant to 3’-dA.\n \n           3. Requires activation within the cancer cell. 3’-dA must be converted to its active form once inside the cancer cell. The rate-limiting step of \nactivation requires the addition of the first phosphate group, in this case by an enzyme called adenosine kinase, or AK. This phosphorylated form of 3’-dA, \n3’-dA monophosphate, or 3’-dAMP, is subsequently converted into 3’-dA diphosphate, or 3’-dADP, which is then converted to 3’-dA triphosphate, or 3’-\ndATP.\n \n           4. Poor PK properties. 3’-dA has a short half-life both in plasma and intracellularly, due to rapid deamination by the enzyme adenosine deaminase, \nor ADA. These poor PK properties lead to dosing administration challenges and have also prevented the clinical development of 3’-dA as a cancer therapy.\n \nOur Solution: NUC-7738\n \n           NUC-7738 is a ProTide transformation of 3’-dA, specifically designed to generate the active anti-cancer metabolite, 3’-dATP, in cancer cells. \nImportantly, NUC-7738 is not a substrate for ADA and is therefore not broken down by this enzyme. This results in greater stability and increased \ngeneration of 3’-dATP following administration. NUC-7738 is highly lipophilic and is able to enter cells independently of nucleoside transporters, \nincluding hENT1. Once inside the cancer cell, \n72"

These attributes result in significantly higher levels of the active anti-cancer metabolite 3’-dATP inside cancer cells \ncompared to 3’-dA. Primarily, 3'-dATP disrupts RNA polyadenylation, causing changes in the expression of genes involved in metabolism, differentiation, \nand apoptosis, ultimately leading to metabolic stress, cessation of cancer cell growth and cell death.\n \n           The metabolism of NUC-7738 compared to 3’-dA as described above is shown in the following graphic.\n \n \nNUC-7738 Preclinical Data\n \n           NUC-7738 is resistant to breakdown. In our preclinical studies in human leukemia cell lines, NUC-7738, unlike 3’-dA, was resistant to breakdown \nby the enzyme ADA, which rapidly breaks down 3’-dA into an inactive metabolite and is a major factor in reducing the potential clinical benefit of 3’-dA. \nThe ability of NUC-7738 to resist breakdown by ADA should result in greater stability and much higher intracellular concentrations of the active anti-\ncancer metabolite, 3’-dATP. In addition, NUC-7738 does not have the dosing administration challenges that have also limited the clinical utility of 3’-dA.   \n \n           NUC-7738 enters cancer cells independently of nucleoside transporters. In human leukemia cell lines, inhibition of nucleoside transporter activity \ndid not have an effect on the cytotoxicity of NUC-7738 or on its ability to generate the active anti-cancer metabolite, 3’-dATP, demonstrating that the \nactivity of NUC-7738 is not dependent on nucleoside transporters. By contrast, the activity of 3’-dA was reduced in the presence of nucleoside transporter \ninhibitors, as shown by a decrease in cytotoxicity as well as in the ability to generate 3’-dATP. \n \n           NUC-7738 does not require activation to 3’-dAMP. As NUC-7738 is presented in the phosphorylated form, 3’-dAMP, it bypasses the first rate-\nlimiting phosphorylation step by the enzyme AK which is required for 3’-dA to generate the active anti-cancer metabolite, 3’-dATP. \n73"

The Phase 2 part of the trial is to evaluate efficacy and further \ncharacterize the safety profile of NUC-7738 at the recommended Phase 2 dose both as a monotherapy and in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor, \npembrolizumab.\n \n \n \n           In September 2021, at the Virtual ESMO Congress, we presented interim data from the first 29 patients treated in this trial. These interim data \nindicated a favorable pharmacokinetic and tolerability profile of NUC-7738.

It is approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs for the \ntreatment of advanced ovarian, metastatic breast, and non-small cell lung cancers. Gemcitabine is also used to treat many other types of tumors, including \nbiliary tract cancer, both as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutics.\n \n           Gemcitabine is a conventional nucleoside analog which, like all nucleoside analogs, is an inactive prodrug. There are key limitations that have been \nassociated with a poor survival prognosis for gemcitabine therapy: breakdown, transport and activation. While there have been attempts to address the \nrequirement for active transport of gemcitabine into cancer cells, we believe we are the first to address all three limitations at once. \n \n           1. Subject to breakdown. Gemcitabine, prior to being phosphorylated to its active form, is susceptible to being broken down chemically by \nmetabolic enzymes, such as cytidine deaminase, or CDA, which irreversibly degrades up to 90% of gemcitabine to an inactive form.

Requires active transport. Gemcitabine requires the membrane transporter hENT1 to enter cancer cells. Patients with a low level of hENT1 who \nreceive gemcitabine have lower overall survival as compared to patients with a high level of hENT1. In a study published in 2004 in the journal Clinical \nCancer Research, it was reported that pancreatic cancer patients with a high level of hENT1 expression had a median overall survival of 13 months \ncompared to four months for those patients with a low level of hENT1 expression.\n \n           Some previous product candidates that have been tested clinically by others were designed to address the challenge of membrane transport but these \nefforts failed even when the transport of these candidates across the cell membrane appeared to succeed. We believe that this was due to the failure of those \ncandidates to address the other cancer resistance mechanisms of breakdown and activation.\n \n           3. Requires activation within the cancer cell. Once gemcitabine enters cells, it must be activated by the addition of phosphate groups before it can \nexert its cell-killing effect. The rate-limiting addition of the first phosphate group is rapidly followed by the addition of a second and third phosphate group. \nThe end result of this phosphorylation is the creation of the active anti-cancer metabolite, which is known as dFdCTP. A specific enzyme, deoxycytidine \nkinase, or dCK, is responsible for the first rate-limiting phosphorylation step. Initially, about one-third of cancer cells have reduced levels of dCK, which \nhas negative consequences for the efficacy of gemcitabine. A study published in the journal Gastroenterology in 2012 reported that decreased expression of \ndCK led to resistance to gemcitabine treatment in cellular assays. In another published study, low levels of dCK in the pancreatic cancer cells of patients \nwho were treated with gemcitabine were associated with a median overall survival that was seven months shorter than that observed in patients with \nmedium to high levels of dCK. dCK is also associated with acquired resistance, and studies have shown that cancer cells can downregulate the production \nof dCK in the presence of gemcitabine leading to drug resistance and reduced efficacy.\n \n           Because gemcitabine has a short half-life ranging from 42 to 94 minutes, even with dCK present in the cancer cell, much of the gemcitabine will \nhave broken down before it can be converted to its active anti-cancer metabolite, dFdCTP.\n \nContribution of resistance mechanisms to survival\n \n           Each of these resistance mechanisms on its own negatively impacts the survival of patients with cancer receiving gemcitabine therapy by at least five \nmonths. While studies have not been done to assess the effect of the combination of all three of these resistance mechanisms, one study in patients with \npancreatic cancer who had undergone resection found that two of these resistance mechanisms had a cumulative effect. Specifically, patients with low \nlevels of hENT1 and any level of dCK experienced a median overall survival of 16.2 months, while patients with high levels of hENT1 and low levels of \ndCK had a median overall survival of 33.6 months, and patients with high levels of hENT1 and moderate to high levels of dCK had a median overall \nsurvival of 61.4 months.\n \nOur Solution: Acelarin\n \n           Acelarin was designed to overcome the key cancer resistance mechanisms associated with gemcitabine by generating and maintaining higher \nconcentrations of the active anti-cancer metabolite inside the tumor compared to gemcitabine. Acelarin is comprised of gemcitabine, a phosphate group and \na specific combination of aryl, ester and amino acid, also referred to as the phosphoramidate moiety. Acelarin’s distinctive feature is this proprietary moiety, \nwhich protects the phosphate group. The moiety also enables Acelarin to enter cancer cells independent of the presence of the hENT1 transporter. Once \nAcelarin has entered the cell, the protective groups are cleaved off, releasing a pre-phosphorylated form of gemcitabine, dFdCMP. Accordingly, the delivery \nof dFdCMP means that cancer cell deficiency of the activating enzyme, dCK, which drives the rate-limiting phosphorylation of gemcitabine, does not result \nin resistance to Acelarin, as it does with gemcitabine. This activated nucleotide analog, dFdCMP, is then rapidly converted to dFdCDP and then the key \nanti-cancer metabolite, dFdCTP. Moreover, Acelarin, like the phosphorylated forms of gemcitabine, is not subject to breakdown by CDA, thus bypassing \nanother key resistance mechanism. As a result, Acelarin generates much higher levels of dFdCTP than does gemcitabine.\n \n \n76"

Despite the heavily pre-treated nature of the patient populations in the early phase clinical trials, Acelarin has been well \ntolerated and showed anti-cancer activity in patients who were resistant to, or had progressed on, prior gemcitabine treatment.\n \nAcelarin: Phase 1 clinical trial (PRO-001)\n \n           In the completed Phase 1 trial, 68 patients with advanced solid tumors and metastatic disease who had exhausted all other standard treatment options \nreceived Acelarin as monotherapy at doses ranging from 375 mg/m 2 to 1,000 mg/m 2. All of these patients had rapidly progressing recurrent disease and \nhad received on average 2.7 prior lines of chemotherapy. Initial signs of efficacy were evaluated using the standard scoring system known as Response \nEvaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors, \n77"

A subset of 49 patients received two or more cycles of Acelarin, equivalent to two or more months of therapy, and had at least one follow-up \nradiographic assessment to measure changes in tumor size. Of these patients, five achieved a partial response, with at least a 30% decrease in tumor size, \nalthough not all of these five patients received a final confirmatory scan as technically required by the RECIST criteria for classification as a partial \nresponse. Another 33 patients had tumors that either decreased by up to 30% or increased by less than 20% and were scored as having stable disease. This \nresulted in an overall disease control rate, the combination of both partial response and stable disease, of 78% in the total 49-patient evaluable population.\n \n           We observed intracellular levels of the active anti-cancer metabolite, dFdCTP, that were still higher 24 hours after dosing with Acelarin than the \nmaximum reported concentration generated with gemcitabine at its peak level two hours after dosing. Furthermore, the concentration of intracellular \ndFdCTP over a 24-hour period, as measured by the area under the curve, or AUC, a measure of drug exposure over time, was 139 times higher for Acelarin \non an equimolar dose comparison compared to the levels reported for gemcitabine in the literature.\n \n           Acelarin was generally well-tolerated. The most common Grade 3 and Grade 4 treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (19%), decreased \nlymphocytes (18%), neutropenia (15%), decreased white blood cells (13%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). A total of eight dose-limiting toxicities were \nobserved in four patients at doses of 725 mg/m 2 and above. These included Grade 3 increases in liver enzymes known as transaminases, and Grade 4 \ndecreases in platelets and neutrophils. All of these adverse events were transient and all patients recovered. To date, we have not observed any treatment-\nrelated adverse events that have not previously been associated with gemcitabine.\n \nAcelarin: Phase 1b clinical trial in combination with carboplatin (PRO-002)\n \n           In the Phase 1b trial, 25 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer received Acelarin at doses from 500 mg/m 2 to 750 mg/m2 in combination with \ncarboplatin for a maximum of six treatment cycles lasting three weeks each. Patients had received on average four prior lines of chemotherapy and had a \nmedian age of 65. Of the 25 patients enrolled, 23 were evaluable and these patients were characterized by their platinum status: seven were platinum-\nrefractory, 10 were platinum-resistant, three were partially platinum-sensitive and three were platinum-sensitive. Efficacy was evaluated using the RECIST \nstandard scoring system. The 23 evaluable patients had received one or more cycles of Acelarin in combination with carboplatin and had at least one \nfollow-up radiographic assessment to measure changes in tumor size. Of the evaluable patients, one achieved a confirmed complete response, with a \ncomplete disappearance of all target lesions, and eight achieved a partial response (four confirmed), with at least a 30% decrease in tumor size. This \nresulted in an overall response rate of 39% (22% confirmed). Another 13 patients had tumors that either decreased by up to 30% or increased by less than \n20% and were scored as having stable disease. This resulted in a disease control rate of 96%. The median progression-free survival duration was 6.2 \nmonths. In all 25 patients, the incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 52% and 28%, respectively. The results of the \nPhase 1b Acelarin trial suggest that Acelarin can be combined with carboplatin at a higher, more optimal carboplatin dose. \n \n           Initial success with either interim or final data in early-stage clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained in later-stage trials, and the \nresults of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for \nmarketing approval. Statistical significance means that an effect is unlikely to have occurred by chance. Clinical trial results are considered statistically \nsignificant when the probability of the results occurring by chance, rather than from the efficacy of the product candidate, is sufficiently low. We plan to \ndesign our later stage trials to establish the statistical significance of the efficacy of our ProTides.\n \nAcelarin: Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PRO-105)\n \n           Acelarin was evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Part I of the trial compared a 500 mg/m2 dose of \nAcelarin with a 750 mg/m2 dose of Acelarin in heavily pre-treated patients who had received at least 3 prior lines of chemotherapy. Part II of the trial was \ndesigned to then investigate the optimal dose identified in part I in an expansion cohort. In December 2019, consistent with our previous announcement that \nwe were prioritizing our resources on our key programs of Acelarin in biliary tract cancer and NUC-3373 in colorectal cancer, we decided not to proceed \nwith part II of the PRO-105 trial. In part I of the trial, doses of 500 mg/m2 and 750 mg/m2 were assessed with dosing on days one, eight and fifteen of a 4-\nweek cycle. Fifty patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer were evaluable for response and all responders had confirmatory scans. The patient \npopulation included in Part I was heavily pre-treated, with a median of 5 prior lines of therapy, and 72% had underlying comorbidities. Despite this, NUC-\n1031 was well-tolerated, with no unexpected adverse events reported. Based on an assessment by blinded independent central review, anti-cancer activity \nwas observed with one patient achieving a complete response, two patients achieving a partial response and 16 patients \n78"

Across both treatment arms, 11 patients had reductions of at least 10% in the size of their tumors. \n \n           By contrast, in a 2019 report from the CLIO trial in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, no patients in the chemotherapy group achieved \na complete response and only one patient achieved a confirmed partial response which resulted in a confirmed overall response rate of 3%. The CLIO study \nreported on the efficacy of the current chemotherapy standards of care, namely paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan and gemcitabine. \nThirty-three patients received chemotherapy in the CLIO trial and were significantly less heavily pre-treated than those in the PRO-105 trial, with a median \nof 3 prior lines of treatment. However, given differences in trial design and statistical analyses, comparisons across studies should be interpreted with \ncaution.\n \n           The advent of PARP inhibitors has changed the ovarian cancer treatment landscape markedly in recent years resulting in a more complex regulatory \npathway for single-agent therapy. In addition, we have been very encouraged by the synergy we have observed with Acelarin in combination with platinum \nagents, both in patients with biliary tract cancer and ovarian cancer. Based on the regulatory pathway for single-agent therapy, our review of the results \nfrom the PRO-105 trial of single-agent Acelarin, and the promising activity we have observed of Acelarin in combination therapy, should we elect to pursue\nany further development of Acelarin in patients with ovarian cancer, we would anticipate combining it with platinum agents.\n \nAcelarin: Phase 1b clinical trial in combination with cisplatin (ABC-08) in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer \n \nIn November 2020, the final results from the ABC-08 trial were published in The Oncologist. In this Phase 1b multi-center, open-label trial, Acelarin, when \ncombined with cisplatin, achieved a high response rate and was well-tolerated as first-line treatment for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer. Twenty-\none patients received Acelarin (625 mg/m2 or 725 mg/m2) and cisplatin (25 mg/m2) on days one and eight of 21-day cycles. Of the 21 patients in the intent-\nto-treat, or ITT, population, 16 patients with measurable disease received at least one cycle of study treatment and had at least one follow-up radiographic \nscan and were thus efficacy evaluable. In the efficacy-evaluable population, an ORR (based on unconfirmed responses) of 44% was achieved (1 complete \nresponse and 6 partial responses). In addition, 6 patients had Stable Disease, resulting in a disease control rate of 81%. Responses were seen across all five \nbiliary tract cancer sub-types. One additional patient, who was initially assessed as having measurable disease at baseline, achieved a partial response with \na 67% reduction in the volume of target lesions based on investigator assessment. However, the baseline target lesion was subsequently reclassified as non-\nmeasurable by the Sponsor resulting in the exclusion of this patient from the efficacy-evaluable population. Furthermore, one patient with stable disease, \nwhose tumor was initially considered unsuitable for surgical resection, became eligible for surgical resection following treatment with Acelarin plus \ncisplatin and underwent surgery that resulted in complete removal of the tumor. Four patients were still alive at the end of follow-up, having survived \nbetween 16 and 36 months. The results showed that the combination of Acelarin and cisplatin was well-tolerated over multiple cycles with no unexpected \nadverse events, no dose-limiting toxicities, and no discontinuations due to Acelarin-associated toxicity. \n              \nAcelarin: Phase 3 clinical trial (ACELARATE) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer \n \n           ACELARATE was a Phase 3, open-label, randomized trial, facilitated by the National Cancer Research Institute in the United Kingdom, and was \ndesigned to compare Acelarin to gemcitabine as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic carcinoma who were not eligible for combination \nchemotherapy. Acelarin (825 mg/m2) and gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2) were administered on days one, eight, and 15 of 28-day cycles. \n \n           The primary objective was to determine whether Acelarin is superior to gemcitabine in terms of overall survival. A total of 200 patients were \nenrolled, with 100 patients receiving Acelarin, which included 48 males and 52 females with an average age of 73 years.\n \n           This trial included a prespecified futility analysis, which indicated that the primary efficacy objective of Acelarin monotherapy reducing the risk of \ndeath by at least 42% compared to gemcitabine was unlikely to be met in this difficult-to-treat patient population. Upon review of the interim data by the \nIndependent Safety and Data Monitoring Committee, the sponsor decided to suspend recruitment, allow the data to mature and conduct additional sub-\ngroup analyses. Patients who were deriving benefit could continue treatment with Acelarin. The additional analyses also indicated that achieving the \nprimary objective was unlikely and the trial was closed in June 2021. \n \n \n79"

      "text": "Acelarin: Phase 3 clinical trial (NuTide:121)\n \n           A Phase 3 clinical trial, also known as the NuTide:121 trial, comparing Acelarin in combination with cisplatin to gemcitabine in combination with \ncisplatin as a first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer was closed in March 2022 following the first pre-\nplanned interim analysis.\n \n           NuTide:121 was a global, multi-center, randomized Phase 3 trial in approximately 125 sites across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. \nPatients were randomized 1:1 and treated with either a combination of Acelarin (725 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (25 mg/m2) or the current standard of care \nregimen, gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (25 mg/m2). The dual primary endpoints of the trial were overall survival, or OS, and overall response \nrate, or ORR.\n \n           Three interim efficacy analyses, including two designed to support accelerated approval of Acelarin in the United States, were planned in addition to \nthe final analysis. The first interim analysis was performed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee after 418 patients with measurable disease at \nbaseline had been randomized and followed for 28 weeks. This analysis evaluated the ORR primary endpoint and also included a pre-planned futility \nanalysis.\n \n           Following the first interim analysis, NuCana made the decision to discontinue the NuTide:121 trial in March 2022 based on the recommendations of \nthe trial’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Analysis of the study dataset demonstrated that the overall response rate (ORR), as assessed by \nBlinded Independent Central Review, was 18.7% (3 Complete Responses and 50 Partial Responses) in the Acelarin plus cisplatin arm and 12.4% (0 \nComplete Responses and 34 Partial Responses) in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. However, this improvement in ORR was not reflected by an \nimprovement in overall survival (OS). Median OS was 9.2 months in the Acelarin plus cisplatin arm and 12.6 months in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm \ncorresponding to a hazard ratio of 1.79. Treatment exposure was lower in the Acelarin plus cisplatin arm, which may be at least partially explained by a \nhigher discontinuation rate due to treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the Acelarin plus cisplatin arm (30%) compared to the gemcitabine plus \ncisplatin arm (16%). More patients discontinued during the first 30 days of treatment in the Acelarin plus cisplatin arm (11% vs 1%) and this was \npredominantly due to liver-related TEAEs, which occurred with a higher incidence in the Acelarin plus cisplatin arm. An evaluation of the liver-related \nTEAEs observed in this trial suggested that the assessment of drug-induced liver toxicity is potentially confounded by disease progression and the \ncorresponding high frequency of liver dysfunction in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer which are difficult to distinguish from the pattern of drug \nrelated liver toxicity.\n \n           The development of Acelarin in biliary tract cancer was accelerated from Phase 1b to Phase 3; therefore, limited data were available to support the \nAcelarin dose in NuTide:121. Given that Acelarin is designed to enter cells more easily and generate higher tissue levels of active metabolite than \ngemcitabine, the selected Phase 3 dose may have been too high in some patients, potentially causing increased toxicity without additional durable tumor \ncontrol benefit. \n \n           Overall, the Acelarin safety profile was generally similar to that of gemcitabine. The lower treatment exposure in the Acelarin plus cisplatin arm due \nto adverse event related early discontinuations may partially explain why the increased ORR did not translate into a survival benefit. We are assessing \nfuture development options for Acelarin in biliary tract cancer which may explore lower doses of Acelarin, alternative combination partners or specific sub-\nsets of biliary tract cancer patients. Indications other than biliary tract cancer are also being assessed as future development options for Acelarin.\n \n           NuCana believes that the pattern of liver-related TEAEs observed in NuTide:121 is specific to biliary tract cancer and potentially the combination \nwith cisplatin. The pattern of liver-related TEAEs observed in NuTide:121 was not observed in trials that assessed Acelarin as a monotherapy (PRO-001, \nPRO-105 and ACELARATE) or in combination with carboplatin (PRO-002). Furthermore, this pattern of liver-related TEAEs has not been observed in \nclinical studies assessing NUC-3373 as a monotherapy (NuTide:301) or in combination with leucovorin, bevacizumab and either irinotecan or oxaliplatin \n(NuTide:302) or in the clinical study assessing NUC-7738 as a monotherapy (NuTide:701). \n \nMolecular Profiling\n \n           Healthcare professionals often use molecular-profiling tools to help choose the optimal therapy for patients with cancer. Therapeutic responses vary \namong patients because cancers are heterogeneous, even for tumors arising from the same site in the body. Molecular diagnostics assays that detect specific \nbiomarkers can provide a framework to classify tumors according to their molecular signature. In turn, the cancer profile can guide the choice of therapy for \na particular patient.\n \n           As part of our clinical development strategy, we are investigating the molecular profile of cancer cells with the aim of identifying patients who may \nreceive the greatest benefit from our ProTides compared with the current nucleoside analog standards of care. We are working to identify and quantify key \nbiomarkers relevant to NUC-3373, NUC-7738 and Acelarin, \n80"

In addition, such assays may become relevant to our eventual commercial and \nreimbursement strategy by helping to pre-identify those patients for whom existing nucleoside analogs are unlikely to provide a significant benefit.\n \nManufacturing\n \n           We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the supply of clinical trial \nmaterials of NUC-3373, NUC-7738 and Acelarin, and any future product candidates under the cGMP specified by the FDA and other regulatory \norganizations. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals to be used in humans. In the future, we intend to also rely on our CMOs \nto produce sufficient commercial quantities of our ProTides, if approved. We source key materials from third parties, either directly from suppliers or \nindirectly through our CMOs. These raw materials are generally available from multiple vendors, which provides us with a robust and cost-effective supply \nchain.\n \n           Manufacturing of any product candidate is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements \ngoverning recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. We expect that all of our \nCMOs will manufacture NUC-3373, NUC-7738 and Acelarin under cGMP conditions and in compliance with any similar regulatory requirements outside \nthe United States.\n \nCompetition\n \n           The development and commercialization of new drug therapies is highly competitive. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, proprietary \nProTide technology and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, \nincluding major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and \nprivate research institutions. Any ProTide candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new \nproducts that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include \nefficacy, safety profile, price, convenience of administration and level of promotional activity.\n \n           The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, \nimmunotherapy and targeted drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer, including many which are administered in \ncombination to enhance efficacy. We believe that our product candidates, if approved, will principally face competition from other chemotherapies, \nimmunotherapy and targeted drug therapies. In the field of chemotherapy, our competitors include companies that manufacture off-patent chemotherapies, \nincluding 5-FU, as well as companies that have developed new or improved chemotherapies.\n \n           In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may face competition from cancer therapies developed by other companies using phosphoramidate \nchemistry, as well as other approved drugs or drugs that may be approved in the future for indications for which we may develop our product candidates.\n \n           The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our \nproducts. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which \ncould result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Many of the companies against which we may \ncompete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical \ntrials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant \ncompetitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

These patents and patents arising \nfrom these pending applications are expected to expire in 2035 and 2036, excluding any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.      \n \nLaws and Regulations Regarding Patent Terms\n \n           The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we \nfile, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent term may be shortened if a \npatent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee. A patent’s term may be lengthened by a \npatent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent. The patent term of a European patent is \n20 years from its effective filing date, which, unlike in the United States, is not subject to patent term adjustments in the same way as U.S. patents.\n \n           The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term \nrestoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration \nAct of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent \nterm extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent \nbeyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are \navailable in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, for example Supplementary Protection Certificates. \nIn the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We \nanticipate that some of our issued patents may be eligible for patent term extensions but such extensions may not be available and therefore our commercial \nexclusivity may be restricted.\n \nCollaboration and License Agreements\n \nCardiff University License \n \n           In August 2009, we entered into a research, collaboration and license agreement with Cardiff University and University College Cardiff Consultants \nLtd., or Cardiff Consultants, which we refer to as the Cardiff Agreement. The Cardiff Agreement was renewed with an effective date of January 1, 2018 for \nan additional two years on substantially the same terms. In February 2020, we amended the Cardiff Agreement to expire at the end of 2020, which \namendment afforded us (at our sole discretion) an option to extend the expiration for one additional year until the end of 2021, and for further periods \nthereafter upon written agreement by the parties. In December 2020, we further amended the Cardiff Agreement to expire at the end of 2021. \n \n           At the end of 2021, the Cardiff Agreement expired pursuant to its terms and we exercised our right under the Cardiff Agreement to extend the \nlicense of the ProTide-related intellectual property owned or controlled by Cardiff University as of the date of the Cardiff Agreement or owned or \ncontrolled by Cardiff University during the term of that Agreement, which we refer to as the Cardiff Intellectual Property, granted to NuCana under the \nCardiff Agreement for a period of three months from the expiration of the Cardiff Agreement at the end of 2021 in order to continue evaluating additional \nProTides generated under the Cardiff Agreement. \n \n           Prior to the expiration of the Cardiff Agreement, we collaborated pursuant to the Cardiff Agreement with Cardiff University in the design, synthesis, \ncharacterization and evaluation of phosphoramidate prodrugs, which we refer to as ProTides, based on certain nucleosides. We were responsible for funding \ncertain work performed by Cardiff University and making other payments, which totaled £175,052 in 2020, £136,481 in 2021, and £68,737 in 2022. Cardiff \nUniversity and Cardiff Consultants, which is a holder of intellectual property developed by Cardiff University, have assigned to us all rights in the results of \nthe research under the Cardiff Agreement. \n \n           Upon our completion of the evaluation of the ProTides, we had the right to select one or more of the evaluated ProTides as candidates for potential \ndevelopment of commercial products. At the end of March 2022, we notified Cardiff University and Cardiff Consultants regarding our selected ProTides. \nPursuant to the terms set out in the Cardiff Agreement, Cardiff University and Cardiff Consultants have granted us an exclusive worldwide license to use \nfor all purposes the Cardiff intellectual property in respect of the nucleoside family of our selected ProTides. This license survives the expiration of the \nCardiff Agreement. During the license period, Cardiff University and Cardiff Consultants may not undertake any research for any competing third party on \nnucleoside families covered by the license where such research would make use of the Cardiff intellectual property, or to grant rights in the Cardiff \nintellectual property to any third party for use in connection with nucleosides covered by the licenses. \n \n83"

If we or our sublicensees develop and commercialize a product resulting from such research, we will owe Cardiff Consultants \nclinical development milestone payments of up to £1,875,000, provided that such milestone payments are due only with respect to the first product within \neach nucleoside family to achieve the milestone. We will also owe Cardiff Consultants royalties equal to a low-single digit percentage on our sales of a \nproduct resulting from such research. Should we sublicense our right to commercialize a product resulting from the research, we will owe Cardiff \nConsultants a high-single digit percentage of payments received in consideration of the sublicense.\n \nCardiff ProTides Agreement\n \n           In October 2009, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Cardiff ProTides Ltd., or Cardiff ProTides, which agreement was \nsubsequently amended and restated as an assignment, license and collaboration agreement in March 2012 and was further amended in May 2012, which we \nrefer to as the ProTides Agreement. Under the ProTides Agreement, we collaborated with Cardiff ProTides in the discovery, drug design and in vitro \nscreening of purine and pyrimidine-based nucleosides as potential drug candidates. We funded certain work at Cardiff ProTides, and Cardiff ProTides has \nassigned to us all rights in the results of its research under the ProTides Agreement. Cardiff ProTides also assigned to us patents related to certain \ncompounds of interest, including with respect to Acelarin, and granted us an exclusive, worldwide license, including the right to grant sublicenses, to rights \nin and technical information related to certain unpatented compounds for all therapeutic, diagnostic, prognostic and prophylactic applications.\n \n           If we or a sublicensee develop one or more products covered by a valid claim of an assigned patent or patent resulting from Cardiff ProTides’ \nresearch, such as Acelarin, we will owe Cardiff ProTides up to approximately $4.5 million in development and approval milestone payments in the \naggregate for the first such product. Additional development and approval milestones would be payable for the first additional product in a new nucleoside \nseries covered by a valid claim of an assigned patent or a patent resulting from Cardiff ProTides’ research, although the maximum potential value of such \nmilestone payments is approximately half the value of the milestone payments associated with the first product. We will also owe Cardiff ProTides royalties \nequal to a percentage in mid- to high-single digits on sales of such products, subject to reduction under certain circumstances. Royalties on sales by \nsublicensees are set by formula, which formula would be likely to result in a royalty in the mid-single digits.\n \n           The ProTides Agreement expires, on a country-by-country basis, on the later of the expiration, invalidity, abandonment, lapsing or rejection of the \nlast valid claim of an assigned patent or patent resulting from Cardiff ProTides’ research, or, if certain technical information licensed from Cardiff ProTides \nremains confidential or the product is covered by a period of data exclusivity, ten years from the date of first commercial sale of a product in such country. \nThe ProTides Agreement may be sooner terminated on an uncured material breach, bankruptcy of a party or, by Cardiff ProTides, if we challenge, or assist \nin a challenge, of the validity or ownership of an assigned patent or patent resulting from Cardiff ProTides’ research, or fail to pay amounts payable under \nthe ProTides Agreement. It may also be sooner terminated where sums payable by us remain unpaid for 45 days after we receive a notice from Cardiff \nProTides that the relevant sums are overdue. Upon a termination of the ProTides Agreement, our license rights will terminate except where the breach \nresults from certain breaches by Cardiff ProTides, in which case our license rights continue on a non-exclusive basis, subject to reduced payment \nobligations. Upon termination of the ProTides Agreement, including as a result of our breach, we will be under an obligation to assign back to Cardiff \nProTides the patents which Cardiff ProTides originally assigned to us.\n \nGovernment Regulation and Product Approval\n \nFDA Approval Process\n \n           In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FD&C Act and other federal and state statutes and \nregulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and \nmarketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with \napplicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug \napplications, or NDAs, warning letters, voluntary product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, \nfines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\n \n           Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves the performance of preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the \nsubmission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to \nestablish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval \nrequirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or \ndisease.\n \n84"

      "text": "Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics \nand potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical and other nonclinical tests must comply with certain federal regulations and \nrequirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other \ninformation, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term nonclinical tests, \nsuch as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.\n \n           Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified \ninvestigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an \ninternational standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors, and \n(iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. \nEach protocol and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.\n \n           A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has \nneither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.\n \n           The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time (including prior to its initiation in response to the \noriginal IND submission) or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements \nor presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The clinical trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must \nalso be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, at each site where a clinical trial will be performed for approval. An IRB may also require the \nclinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or it may impose other conditions. \nAn IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.\n \n           Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, \nthe initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological \nactions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves clinical trials in a limited \npatient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common \nadverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 \nclinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically \ndispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the \nlabeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A \nsingle Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the clinical trial is a large multicenter trial \ndemonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or \nprevention of a disease with potentially serious outcome, and confirmation of the result in a second clinical trial would be practically or ethically \nimpossible. In some cases, Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials may be conducted after initial marketing approval to gain additional experience from the \ntreatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the \nperformance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of marketing approval for an NDA.\n \n           After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before \nmarketing of the drug product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a \ncompilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is \nsubstantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee (for example, for fiscal year 2023 \nthis application fee exceeds $3.2 million). These fees are typically increased annually.\n \n           This FDA review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA (for a standard review) and eight months from the \ndate the NDA is submitted (for a “priority review”) because the FDA has approximately two months, or 60 days, after NDA submission to make a “filing” \ndecision. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold \ndetermination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. \nUnder the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals \nin the review of NDAs. For most applications involving first-in-kind molecular entities, FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its \ninitial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. Priority \nreview can be applied to drugs intended to treat a serious condition and that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment by providing a \n85"

The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA \ngoal dates, and the review process for both standard and priority new drug applications may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider \ncertain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.\n \n           The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory \ncommittee, which is typically a panel made up of independent clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the \napplication should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when \nmaking final decisions on approval. The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan if it determines that \na REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the drug or biological product. The REMS plan \ncould include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution \nmethods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on \na case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve an \nNDA without a REMS, if required.\n \n           Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will \ninspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good \nmanufacturing practice requirements, or cGMP, is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and \neffective in the indication studied.\n \n           The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied \nor may require additional clinical or other data and information. On the basis of the FDA’s evaluations of the NDA and accompanying information, \nincluding the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response \nletter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider \nthe application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval \nletter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the \nsubmission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.\n \n           An NDA approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications as described in \nthe application. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included \nin the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, \nrequire testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use \nrestrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, \nthe FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. Once granted, product \napprovals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing or any \ntime thereafter, and certain types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling \nclaims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.\n \nDisclosure of Clinical Trial Information\n \n           Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial \ninformation within specific timeframes on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health called ClinicalTrials.gov. Information \nrelated to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as \npart of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of these clinical trials after completion if the product candidate \nis ultimately approved, and disclosure of the results of these clinical trials will be delayed until such approval. Competitors may use this publicly-available \ninformation to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.\n \nThe Hatch-Waxman Act\n \n           Orange Book Listing.

An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed \ndrug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence \ntesting, ANDA applicants are not required or allowed to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of \ntheir drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by \npharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. In contrast, the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway does not preclude the possibility that a \nfollow-on applicant would need to conduct additional clinical trials or preclinical studies; for example, they may be seeking approval to market a previously \napproved drug for new indications or for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness.\n \n           Any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book for the NDA-\napproved drug product on which it is relying (in whole or in part). Specifically, the follow-on applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information \nhas not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after \npatent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. An ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii \nstatement, certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain or carve out any language regarding the patented method-of-use, rather than certify to a \nlisted method-of-use patent.\n \n           If the follow-on applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents \nclaiming the referenced drug have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such \npatents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the \napplicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the follow-on application has been accepted for filing \nby the FDA. The referenced NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV \ncertification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from \napproving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement \ncase that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant.\n \n           An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the \nreferenced product has expired.\n \n           Exclusivity. Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been previously \napproved by the FDA in any other NDA, the NCE receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA or \n505(b)(2) NDA seeking approval of a generic or follow-on version of that drug if the follow-on applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to \nall the data required for approval. \n \n           However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is \nno listed patent in the Orange Book for the reference drug, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, in which case no ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may \nbe filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period attached to the referenced NDA product.\n \n           The FD&C Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical \ninvestigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval \nof the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use \nassociated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-\nyear and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full traditional NDA filed under Section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act. \nHowever, an applicant submitting a full traditional NDA would be required to either conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies \nand adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.\n \n           Patent Term Extension. After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent term extension. The allowable \npatent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between IND submission and NDA submission—and all of the review \nphase—the time between NDA submission and approval up to a \n87"

      "text": "maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term \nafter the extension may not exceed 14 years.\n \n           For patents that might expire during the application review phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent \nextension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent \nextension is reduced by one year. The director of the USPTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is \nbeing sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.\n \nPost-Marketing Requirements\n \n           Once an NDA is approved, the manufacturer and the new drug product will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other \nthings, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which \ninclude restrictions on promoting approved drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”). The FDA closely regulates the \npost-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-\nsponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs \nfor off-label uses, manufacturers may market their drugs only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. \nThe FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have \nimproperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Prescription drug promotional materials also must be submitted to the FDA in \nconjunction with their first use. Further, changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, \nlabeling, or certain manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can \nbe implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the \nsame procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.\n \n           Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA, in addition to annual marketing reports \nspecific to each NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, sometimes called Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects \nof an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. \n \n           In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures, among other things, must continue to conform to cGMP after \napproval. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and \ndrug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, \nrecords and reports and returned or salvaged products. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments \nwith FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency \ninspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas \nof production, quality control and recordkeeping to maintain compliance with cGMP. Regulatory authorities may impose a range of enforcement actions, \nincluding bringing a seizure and injunction in court, withdraw product approvals or request a product recall if a company fails to comply with cGMP \nrequirements, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved \nNDA, including recall.\n \n           Once an approval or clearance of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is \nnot maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including \nadverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in \nmandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or \nimposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:\n•\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n•\nfines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;\n•\nrefusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;\n•\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n•\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n88"

The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or \nFDASIA, enacted in 2012, made permanent PREA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a \nnew active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or \nPSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the \npediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, \nor a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the \nrequirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A \nsponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected \nfrom preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for \nsubmission of pediatric data. The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 amended the FD&C Act to require pediatric investigations of drugs intended for \ntreatment of an adult cancer if directed at a molecular target the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric \ncancer, unless the FDA waives or defers the requirement.\n \n           In addition, pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity available in the United States that, if granted, provides for the \nattachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. This six-month \nexclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a Written Request from the FDA for such data. The data do not \nneed to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the \nadditional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever \nstatutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it \neffectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the \nsponsor to undertake the described studies.\n \nSpecial Protocol Assessment\n \n           A company may reach an agreement with FDA under the Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, process as to the required design and size of clinical \ntrials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. Under the FDC Act and FDA guidance implementing the statutory requirement, an SPA is \ngenerally binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety \nor efficacy after the clinical trial begins, public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, the sponsor and FDA \nagree to the change in writing, or if the clinical trial sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA.\n \nExpedited Development and Review Programs\n \n           The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in \nthe treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and \npriority review designation. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these expedited development and review programs, the FDA may later decide that \nthe drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened, and the designation may \nbe withdrawn. \n \n           To be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or \nlife-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy \nthat may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent \ninteractions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the NDA for a Fast Track \nproduct on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the \napplication sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first \n89"

      "text": "section of the NDA. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre-NDA meeting. The FDA will respond \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. \n \n           Priority review, which is requested at the time of NDA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a \ntreatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months (starting from the date \nof filing for a new molecular entity, or NME, or from the date of receipt for a non-NME application). The FDA determines on a case-by-case basis whether \nthe proposed drug represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. \nSignificant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a \ntreatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety \nand effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall agency attention and resources to the evaluation of \nsuch applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action under its PDUFA agreements. \n \n           In addition, with the enactment of FDASIA in 2012, Congress created a new regulatory program for product candidates designated by FDA as \n“breakthrough therapies” upon a request made by the IND sponsors. A Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and \nreview of drugs that are intended to treat, alone or in combination with another therapy, a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary \nclinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A \nsponsor may request Breakthrough Therapy designation at the time that the IND is submitted, or no later than at the end-of-Phase 2 meeting. The FDA will \nrespond to a Breakthrough Therapy designation request within 60 days of receipt of the request. A drug that receives Breakthrough Therapy designation is \neligible for all fast track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase 1 and commitment \nfrom the FDA involving senior managers.\n \n           Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately \nexpedite the development or NDA approval process.\n \nAccelerated Approval\n \n           Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit \nover existing treatments may receive accelerated approval from the FDA and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials \nestablishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant \naccelerated approval for such a drug or biologic when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an \neffect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account \nthe severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Discussions with the FDA about the feasibility of an \naccelerated approval typically begin early in the development of the drug in order to identify, among other things, an appropriate endpoint. As a condition \nof approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the \npredicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures. Drugs and biologics granted \naccelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.\n \n           For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or \nother measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more \neasily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably \nlikely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate \nclinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval when the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint \nis not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the \nultimate long-term clinical benefit of a drug.\nThe accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to \nmeasure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated \napproval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally \nto improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate \na clinical or survival benefit.\n \n90"

      "text": "The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval \nconfirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-\nmarketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. \nFailure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of the product during post-marketing studies, would allow the \nFDA to withdraw approval of the drug. All promotional materials for product candidates being considered and approved under the accelerated approval \nprogram are subject to prior review by the FDA.\n \nRegulation of Companion Diagnostic Devices\n \n           If we decide that a diagnostic test would provide useful information for patient selection following commercialization of our future drug products or \nif the FDA requires us to develop such a test and to include screening requirements in the prescribing information for our future approved drug products, \nwe may work with a collaborator to develop an in vitro diagnostic, or companion test. The FDA regulates in vitro diagnostic tests as medical devices and \nrequires separate regulatory authorization prior to commercialization. The type of regulation to which such a test will be subjected will depend in part on a \nrisk assessment by the FDA as well as a determination of whether the test is intended to yield results that would be helpful for prescribers to know versus \nresults that the FDA or we believe are necessary for the safe and effective use of our drugs under development.\n \n           Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; \nidentify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to \ntreatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics \nand complementary diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. The level of risk associated with a new diagnostic test combined with \navailable controls to mitigate risk determines whether a companion diagnostic device requires Premarket Approval (PMA) from the FDA or if it can be \ncleared by the agency through the 510(k) premarket notification process based on a showing of substantial equivalence to a commercially available device. \nThe use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product will be stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the \ndiagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product, including the labeling of any generic equivalents of the therapeutic product. For a novel \ntherapeutic product for which a companion diagnostic device is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, the FDA expects that the therapeutic \nsponsor will address the need for an approved or cleared IVD companion diagnostic device in its therapeutic product development plan and that, in most \ncases, the therapeutic product and its corresponding companion diagnostic will be developed contemporaneously, such that the companion diagnostic \ndevice is PMA-approved or 510(k)-cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic product.\n \nEurope/Rest of World Government Regulation\n \n           In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of \nregulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved.\n \n           Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior \nto the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval in other countries and \njurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure \nregulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory \nprocess in others.\n \n           Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a CTA much like an IND prior to the commencement of \nhuman clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in \neach country in which a company plans to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trials may \nproceed in that country.\nThe requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country, even \nthough there is already some degree of legal harmonization in the E.U. member states resulting from the national implementation of underlying E.U. \nlegislation. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements. The Clinical Trials \nRegulation (Regulation (E.U.) 536/2014) began to harmonize the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the European Union \nand when it came in to force on January 31, 2022, it repealed the existing E.U. Clinical Trials Directive (EC) 2001/20/EC and national legislation that was \nput in place to implement the Directive.\n91"

      "text": "To obtain regulatory approval of a new drug, or medicinal product, in the European Union, a sponsor must obtain approval of a marketing \nauthorization application, or MAA. The way in which a medicinal product can be approved in the European Union depends on the nature of the medicinal \nproduct.\n \n           The centralized procedure results in a single MAA granted by the European Commission that is valid across the European Union, as well as in \nIceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as \ngenetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, \nneurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated “orphan drugs” (drugs used for rare \nhuman diseases) and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized \nprocedure may, at the request of the applicant, also be used for human drugs which do not fall within the above mentioned categories if the human drug (a) \ncontains a new active substance which, on the date of entry into force of this Regulation, was not authorized in the Community; or (b) the applicant shows \nthat the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization in the centralized \nprocedure is in the interests of patients or animal health at European Community level.\n \n           Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days (excluding \nclock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal \nProducts for Human Use, or CHMP), with adoption of the actual marketing authorization by the European Commission thereafter. Accelerated evaluation \nmight be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest from the point of view of \ntherapeutic innovation, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated; the absence of an appropriate alternative \ntherapeutic approach, and anticipation of exceptional high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the \nCHMP is completed within 150 days and the opinion issued thereafter.\n \n           The mutual recognition procedure, or MRP, for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing \nauthorizations within the European Union. Basically, the MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. \nThe MRP is applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products, and is based on the principle of recognition of an already existing national \nmarketing authorization by one or more member states.\n \n           The characteristic of the MRP is that the procedure builds on an already existing marketing authorization in a member state of the European Union \nthat is used as reference in order to obtain marketing authorizations in other E.U. member states. In the MRP, a marketing authorization for a drug already \nexists in one or more E.U. member states and subsequently marketing authorization applications are made in other E.U. member states by referring to the \ninitial marketing authorization. The member state in which the marketing authorization was first granted will then act as the reference member state. The \nmember states where the marketing authorization is subsequently applied for act as concerned member states.\n \n           The MRP is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by E.U. member states of their respective national marketing authorizations. Based on a \nmarketing authorization in the reference member state, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other member states. In such case, the \nreference member state shall update its existing assessment report about the drug in 90 days. After the assessment is completed, copies of the report are sent \nto all member states, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states then have \n90 days to recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National \nmarketing authorizations shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement.\n \n           Should any Member State refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, on the grounds of potential serious risk to \npublic health, the issue will be referred to a coordination group. Within a timeframe of 60 days, member states shall, within the coordination group, make \nall efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee \nis then forwarded to the Commission, for the start of the decision making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various \nEuropean Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human Medicinal Products or Veterinary Medicinal Products, as appropriate.\n \n           The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020. At that time, U.K. legislation was updated via the Human Medicines \nRegulations (Amendment etc.) (E.U. Exit) Regulations 2019, or the Exit Regulations. The Exit Regulations updated the existing U.K. legislation by, for \nexample, replacing references to E.U. databases and community marketing authorization with newly established U.K. databases and U.K. marketing \nauthorizations. From January 1, 2021, E.U. pharmaceutical law has applied to the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland only. U.K. \n92"

      "text": "pharmaceutical legislation moving forward will depend on negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The United Kingdom may \nelect to adopt the Swiss model; i.e., the United Kingdom would adopt E.U. pharmaceutical legislation into U.K. law so that U.K. medicines law shadows \nE.U. medicines legislation while it remains outside of both the European Union and the European Economic Area. \n \n           For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the \nconduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in \naccordance with GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements.\n \n           If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, \nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. \n \nCoverage, Pricing and Reimbursement\n \n           Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval from the \nFDA. Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-\nparty payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private payors, such as commercial health insurers and \nmanaged care organizations. Third-party payors determine which drugs they will cover and the amount of reimbursement they will provide for a covered \ndrug. In the United States, there is no uniform system among payors for making coverage and reimbursement decisions. In addition, the process for \ndetermining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor \nwill pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which \nmight not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication.\n \n           In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for our products, if approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies \nin order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costly studies required to obtain FDA or other \ncomparable regulatory approvals. Even if we conduct pharmacoeconomic studies, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or \ncost-effective by payors. Further, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be \napproved.\n \n           The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this \neffort. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to \nlimit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic \nproducts for branded prescription drugs. For example, in the United States, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of products, \nincluding, for example, increased rebates for products sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, \nmandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care \nprograms. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could \nlimit future payments for our products. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the \nstatutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, \nbeginning January 1, 2024. Payment methodologies may also be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. There also has been heightened \ngovernmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny \nhas resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring \nmore transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient \nprograms and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. By way of example, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of \n2022, or the IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare \n(beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price \nincreases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in \n2025).

For that and other reasons, it \nis currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated, or the impact of the IRA on our business.\n \n           The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors \nfail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. The focus on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will \ncontinue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if we \nattain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and \nreimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\n \n           In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements \ngoverning drug pricing vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price \nhas been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to currently \navailable therapies (so called health technology assessment, or HTA) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European \nUnion provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide \nreimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it \nmay instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Other member \nstates allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit \nprescriptions. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow \nfavorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price \nstructures of the United States and generally tend to by significantly lower.\n \nOther U.S. Healthcare Laws and Regulations\n \n           Physicians, other healthcare providers, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product \ncandidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our current and future business \noperations are and will be subject to various U.S. federal and state and other foreign fraud and abuse laws and other healthcare laws and regulations. These \nlaws and regulations may impact, among other things, our arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare professionals who participate in our clinical \nresearch programs, healthcare professionals and others who purchase, recommend or prescribe our approved products, and our proposed sales, marketing, \ndistribution, and education programs. The U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n•\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, \noffering or paying anything of value, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or \nthe purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federally funded healthcare programs, \nsuch as Medicare and Medicaid;\n•\nthe federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal civil monetary penalties law and the civil False \nClaims Act (which can be enforced by private citizens through qui tamactions), which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other \nthings, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, or \ncausing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay \nmoney to the federal government;\n•\nHIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program \nand prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in \nconnection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n•\nHIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual \nterms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without the \nappropriate authorization by entities subject to the law, such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their \nrespective business associates that perform certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on \ntheir behalf;\n94"

In the United States, healthcare reform legislation has strengthened \nthese federal and state healthcare laws. For example, the ACA amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare \nfraud statutes to clarify that liability under these statutes does not require a person or entity to have actual knowledge of the statutes or a specific intent to \nviolate them. Moreover, the ACA provided that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the \nfederal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Because of the breadth of these laws and the \nnarrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one \nor more of such laws.\n \n           Violations of these laws can subject us to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions including monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, \nindividual imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting \nrequirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with \nthese laws, reputational harm, and we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Moreover, we expect that there will continue to be federal \nand state laws and regulations, proposed and implemented, that could impact our future operations and business.\n \nHealthcare Reform in the United States and Potential Changes to Health Care Laws\n \n           The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or \ndelay regulatory approval of our product candidates. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The \nCures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and devices and to spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is \nuncertain. In addition, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was signed into law, which reauthorized the FDA’s user fee programs and included \nadditional drug and device provisions that build on the Cures Act. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of \nnew requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have \nobtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of \noperations.\n \n           A primary trend in the U.S. health care industry and elsewhere is cost containment. We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and \nstate proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. For example, \nin March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, ACA, which, among other things, the ACA increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed \nby most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the \nMedicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate \nProgram to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D \nbeneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the \nUS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid \nspending. \n \n           Since its enactment, there have been judicial, administrative, executive and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021 \nthe U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the \nconstitutionality of the ACA.

Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, President Biden issued an executive order to, among other things, instruct certain \ngovernmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to health care, including among others, reexamining \nMedicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to \nhealth insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.\n \n           In addition, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA that affect health care \nexpenditures. There has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have \nresulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more \ntransparency to product pricing, contain the cost of drugs, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform \ngovernment program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.\n \n           Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. Individual states in the United \nStates have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological \nproduct pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and \ntransparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Under the Trump \nAdministration’s Safe Importation Plan, at the end of December 2019, the FDA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a system whereby state \ngovernmental entities could lawfully import and distribute prescription drugs sourced from Canada, although the impact of such future programs is \nuncertain. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could also compromise our ability to profitably \ncommercialize any of our product candidates, if approved for marketing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are \nincreasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other \nhealthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively affect our \nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n \n           In the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize any of our \nproduct candidates, if approved. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European \nUnion or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs. The delivery of healthcare \nin the European Union, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively \na matter for national, rather than European Union, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and \napproaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary \nconstraints in most E.U. member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. \nCoupled with increasing European Union and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could prevent or delay \nmarketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to commercialize any products for which we \nobtain marketing approval. In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have \ninstituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. \n \n           Since the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the U.K. regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory \nAgency, or MHRA, has issued guidance on how to apply for Marketing Authorization. In addition, the MHRA has outlined the European Commission, or \nEC, Decision Reliance Procedure, whereby the United Kingdom may rely on a decision taken by the EC on the approval of a new Marketing Authorization \nin the European Union via the centralized procedure. When an EC Decision Reliance Procedure submission is made, the MHRA will aim to grant U.K. \nMarketing Authorization as soon as possible, and within 67 days at the latest.\n \n           We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive \naction, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of \nwhich could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, including prescription pharmaceuticals.\n \nLegal Proceedings\n \n                From time to time, we may be party to litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. Other than as discussed below, we do not have \nany pending litigation that, separately or in the aggregate, would, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, \nfinancial condition or cash flows.\n \n                In 2018, we were granted a European patent from the European Patent Office, or EPO, EP 2955190, or EP 190, that covered the composition of \nmatter of a genus of phosphoramidate nucleotide compounds that includes sofosbuvir, sold under the brand name Sovaldi®, a leading drug for the treatment \nof hepatitis C sold by Gilead Sciences, Inc.

In February 2021, the EPO Opposition Division disagreed with Gilead and upheld \namended patent claims that cover sofosbuvir. In June 2021, the decision by the EPO Opposition Division to uphold our EP 190 was appealed by Gilead to \nthe EPO Technical Boards of Appeal. We also filed an appeal to the EPO Technical Boards of Appeal against the decision by the EPO Opposition Division \nto only allow the patent in an amended form. On March 24, 2023, the EPO Technical Boards of Appeal issued an oral decision revoking EP 190. This \ndecision is final and has retroactive effect. Subsequent to the decision of the EPO Opposition Division, but also in February 2021, Gilead Sciences, Inc. and \nGilead Sciences Limited filed a lawsuit against us in the Patents Court of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales requesting revocation of the U.K. \npart of EP 190. In March 2021, we filed a counterclaim against Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Gilead Sciences Limited alleging infringement of our patent \nresulting from acts including the sale of Sovaldi®, as well as its combination products Harvoni®, Vosevi® and Epclusa®, in the United Kingdom. In 2022, we \nwere granted a further European patent from the EPO, EP 3904365, or EP 365, that covered the composition of matter of a smaller genus of \nphosphoramidate nucleotide compounds that includes sofosbuvir. Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Gilead Sciences Limited subsequently amended their claim to \nrequest revocation of the U.K. part of EP 365 and we counterclaimed for infringement. The U.K. Patents Court trial for this case took place between \nJanuary 20, 2023 and February 3, 2023 and a judgment was handed down by the court on March 21, 2023. In its judgment, the High Court deemed that EP \n190 and EP 365 were invalid in the United Kingdom. As a result of this decision, we will be liable to pay a proportion of Gilead’s legal fees for these legal \nproceedings in the United Kingdom.\n \n                Additionally, in April 2021, we initiated legal proceedings against Gilead Sciences Ireland UC and Gilead Sciences GmbH in the German \nRegional Court of Dusseldorf for patent infringement for the sale of Sovaldi® as well as its combination products Harvoni®, Vosevi® and Epclusa® in \nGermany. In July 2022, the German Regional Court of Dusseldorf issued a judgment that Gilead Sciences Ireland UC and Gilead Sciences GmbH had \ninfringed EP 190. Gilead has appealed this decision and the Higher Regional Court of Dusseldorf appeal hearing is currently scheduled for August 17, \n2023. However, as a result of the decision in March 2023 by the EPO Technical Boards of Appeal, we plan to abandon further proceedings in Germany and, \nas a result, we will be liable to pay a proportion of Gilead’s legal fees for these legal proceedings in Germany.\n \n                The litigation described above has, and any future litigation regarding our intellectual property could, subject us to significant legal expense.

Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results together with the information in “Selected \nConsolidated Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \nWe present our consolidated financial statements in pounds sterling and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, as issued \nby the International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB, which may differ in material respects from generally accepted accounting principles in other \njurisdictions, including generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. \nThe statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and \nother non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including \nthe risks and uncertainties described in the section titled “Risk Factors.” Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any \nforward-looking statements.  \nA.\t Operating Results\nCOVID-19\nWe continue to evaluate and assess the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and believe if there is a resurgence in COVID-19 that this will \npotentially cause some delays to the timing and progress of our clinical trials. \nFinancial Operations Overview \nRevenues \nWe do not have any approved products. Accordingly, we have not generated any revenue, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the \nsale of any products unless and until we obtain regulatory approvals for, and commercialize any of, our product candidates. In the future, we will seek to \ngenerate revenue primarily from product sales and, potentially, regional or global collaborations with strategic partners. \nOperating Expenses \nWe classify our operating expenses into two categories: research and development expenses and administrative expenses. Personnel costs, including \nsalaries, benefits, bonuses and share-based payment expense, comprise a component of each of these expense categories. We allocate expenses associated \nwith personnel costs based on the function performed by the respective employees. \nResearch and Development Expenses. The largest component of our total operating expenses since inception has been costs related to our research \nand development activities, including the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Our research and development expense primarily consists of: \n•\ncosts incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, and investigative sites that conduct preclinical studies and \nclinical trials; \n•\ncosts related to manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug products for preclinical studies and clinical trials; \n•\nsalaries and personnel-related costs, including bonuses, benefits and any share-based payment expense, for our personnel performing research \nand development activities or managing those activities that have been out-sourced;\n•\nfees paid to consultants and other third parties who support our product candidate development; \n•\ncosts of maintaining and defending patents;\n•\nother costs incurred in seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates; and\n•\npayments under our license agreements. \n98"

      "text": "The successful development of our ProTides is highly uncertain. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher \ndevelopment costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. \nHowever, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program specific expenses through commercialization. We are also \nunable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our product candidates to offset these expenses. Our expenditures on current \nand future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. \nThe duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors including: \n•\nthe scope, rate of progress, results and expenses of our ongoing and future clinical trials, preclinical studies and research and development \nactivities; \n•\nthe potential need for additional clinical trials or preclinical studies requested by regulatory agencies; \n•\npotential uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rates or drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; \n•\ncompetition with other drug development companies in, and the related expense of, identifying and enrolling patients in our clinical trials and \ncontracting with third-party manufacturers for the production of the drug product needed for our clinical trials; \n•\nthe achievement of milestones requiring payments under in-licensing agreements; \n•\nany significant changes in government regulation; \n•\nthe terms and timing of any regulatory approvals; \n•\nthe expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and \n•\nthe ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates, if approved. \nWe track research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis for both clinical-stage and preclinical product candidates. Where \nappropriate, manufacturing and non-clinical research and development expenses are assigned or allocated to individual product candidates. \nAdministrative Expenses. Administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, depreciation, amortization and other expenses for outside professional \nservices, including legal, audit and accounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based payment expense. Other \nadministrative expenses include office-related costs, professional fees and costs of our information systems. We anticipate that our administrative expenses \nwill continue to increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of \nour product candidates. We also incur expenses as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC \nand The Nasdaq Global Select Market, additional insurance expenses, and expenses related to investor relations and other administrative and professional \nservices. \nNet Foreign Exchange Gains (Losses)\nNet foreign exchange gains (losses) primarily relates to cash held in U.S. dollars. \nFinance Income \nFinance income relates to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. \n99"

      "text": "Income Tax Credit \nWe are subject to corporate taxation in the United Kingdom and our wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, NuCana, Inc., is subject to corporate taxation in \nthe United States. Due to the nature of our business, since our inception, we have generated losses in the United Kingdom. Our income tax credit \nrecognized represents the sum of the research and development tax credits recoverable in the United Kingdom and in the United States, and income tax \npayable in the United States. \nAs a company that carries out extensive research and development activities, we benefit from the U.K. and U.S. research and development tax credit \nregimes. In the United Kingdom, we are able to surrender some of our losses for a cash rebate of up to 33.35% of eligible expenditures on qualifying \nresearch and development projects incurred prior to April 1, 2023 (set to reduce with respect to eligible expenditures incurred on or after April 1, 2023). In \nthe United States, we are able to offset the research and development credits against corporation tax payable. Our qualifying expenditures in the United \nKingdom largely comprise clinical trial and manufacturing costs, employment costs for relevant staff and consumables incurred as part of research and \ndevelopment projects. In the United Kingdom, where we receive the larger proportion of the research and development credit, certain subcontracted \nqualifying research and development expenditures incurred prior to April 1, 2023 are eligible for a cash rebate of up to 21.68% (set to reduce with respect \nto eligible expenditures incurred on or after April 1, 2023). These rates are subject to the introduction of a territoriality restriction which may restrict our \nability to claim relief in respect of research and development activity taking place outside the United Kingdom, which will apply to accounting periods \nbeginning after April 1, 2024. A large portion of costs relating to our research and development, clinical trials and manufacturing activities are eligible for \ninclusion within these tax credit cash rebate claims. \nWe may not be able to continue to claim research and development tax credits in the United Kingdom in the future under the current research and \ndevelopment tax credit scheme because we may no longer qualify as a small or medium-sized company. However, in that scenario, we may be able to file \nunder a large company scheme. \nUnsurrendered tax losses are carried forward to be offset against future taxable profits. After accounting for tax credits receivable, we had \naccumulated tax losses for carry forward in the United Kingdom of £84.6 million as of December 31, 2022. There were also temporary differences on \nshare-based compensation arrangements of £1.3 million. No deferred tax asset is recognized in respect of accumulated tax losses or temporary differences \non share-based compensation arrangements because future profits are not sufficiently certain.\nIn the event we generate revenues in the future, we may benefit from the “patent box” initiative that allows profits attributable to revenues from \npatents or patented products to be taxed at a lower rate than other revenue. The effective rate of tax for relevant streams of revenue for companies receiving \nthis relief is currently 10%. \nResults of Operations \nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2021 and 2022\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022. \n \n \n \nYear ended December 31,\n \n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n \n \n \n(in thousands)\n \nResearch and development expenses\n  £\n(36,426)  £\n(36,834)\nAdministrative expenses\n   \n(7,291)   \n(8,529)\nImpairment of intangible assets\n   \n(292)   \n(2,809)\nNet foreign exchange gains\n   \n4,887     \n267 \nOperating loss\n   \n(39,122)   \n(47,905)\nFinance income\n   \n669     \n103 \nLoss before tax\n   \n(38,453)   \n(47,802)\nIncome tax credit\n   \n6,432     \n7,269 \nLoss for the year\n   \n(32,021)   \n(40,533)\nOther comprehensive income:\n \n    \n  \nItems that may be reclassified subsequently to\n   profit or loss:\n \n    \n  \nExchange differences on translation of foreign\n   operations\n   \n61     \n5 \nTotal comprehensive loss for the year\n  £\n(31,960)  £\n(40,528)\n \n100"

The decrease resulted from lower expenses incurred related to clinical trials of £16.5 million in 2022, \ncompared with £20.4 million in 2021. Manufacturing costs in 2022 were £2.2 million compared to £3.3 million in 2021, a decrease of £1.1 million.

In 2021 the gain primarily arose from cash balances held in U.S. dollars and the U.S. dollar appreciating \nrelative to the U.K. pound sterling and conversely in 2020 the loss arose from cash balances held in U.S. dollars and the U.S. dollar depreciating relative to \nthe U.K. pound sterling.\nFinance Income \nFinance income represents bank interest and was £0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and £0.2 million for the year ended December \n31, 2020.\nIncome Tax Credit \nThe income tax credit, which is largely comprised of research and development tax credits, amounted to £7.3 million for the year ended December \n31, 2021 and £5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn the United Kingdom, research and development tax credits are obtained at a maximum rate of 33.35% of our qualifying research and development \nexpenses incurred prior to April 1, 2023 (set to reduce for expenditure incurred from April 1, 2023 onwards). The increase in the income tax credit was \nprimarily attributable to an increase in our eligible research and development expenses.\n  \n \nB.\t\n Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview \nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and negative operating cash flows. We anticipate that we will continue to incur \nlosses for at least the next several years. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity \nfinancings, debt financings, research funding, collaborations, contract and grant revenue or other sources. \nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of £41.9 million and £60.3 million, respectively. We do not \ncurrently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. To date we have financed our operations primarily through \nthe issuances of our equity securities. \nIn August 2021, we entered into an “at-the-market” (ATM) sales agreement with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, pursuant to which we may sell from \ntime to time ADSs having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million through Jefferies, acting as our agent. Sales of our ADSs pursuant to this \nATM program are subject to certain conditions specified in the sales agreement. In connection with entering into the agreement with Jefferies, we \nterminated a previous ATM sales agreement between us and Cowen and Company, LLC. Sales under the ATM program are registered on a shelf registration\nstatement on Form F-3 that we filed with the SEC in August 2021, and which permits the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate \noffering price of $400.0 million of our securities, inclusive of our ADSs sold under the ATM program. \n103"

      "text": "Equity Compensation Plans\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have granted options to purchase our shares under four share option schemes, which are summarized in this section. \n2009 Share Option Scheme\nOn August 1, 2009, we adopted a share option scheme, or the 2009 Share Option Scheme, for the purpose of enabling the grant of share options to \nincentivize our employees, consultants and directors and those employees, consultants and directors of our subsidiary companies. The 2009 Share Option \nScheme was subsequently amended and approved by our board of directors and by our shareholders on November 15, 2011, November 17, 2011, \nSeptember 14, 2017 and October 2, 2017, respectively. \nThe 2009 Share Option Scheme permits grants of (i) enterprise management incentive options which are potentially tax-advantaged in the United \nKingdom under the terms of Schedule 5 to the United Kingdom Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (subject to the relevant conditions being met \nby the company and the grantee) and (ii) “unapproved” options (which do not attract tax advantages as they have not been “approved” by the U.K. tax \nauthority, HMRC). \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had granted options to purchase 1,032,500 ordinary shares to directors, employees and consultants under the 2009 \nShare Option Scheme. 10,000 of these options lapsed before December 31, 2022 and 1,022,500 were exercised by December 31, 2022, which includes \n437,500 exercised in 2022. There are no remaining options under the 2009 Share Option Scheme. \nClass of Share. An option granted under the 2009 Share Option Scheme entitles the option holder, subject to the satisfaction, waiver or acceleration \nof specific exercise conditions, to subscribe for ordinary shares. \nExercise Conditions. Options granted under our 2009 Share Option Scheme may be granted subject to vesting schedules, performance targets or \nother conditions which must be satisfied or waived before exercise. Exercise conditions may be removed or varied by our board of directors, provided that \nany variation shall be (in the reasonable opinion of our board of directors) no more difficult to satisfy than the original exercise condition. \nEach option grant is documented through an option agreement. Most of the option agreements entered into under the 2009 Share Option Scheme \nprovide that all unexercised options are exercisable upon one or more of the following events: (i) the admission of part of or the entirety of issued share \ncapital (or of any holding company) to listing on the Official List of the U.K. Listing Authority and to trading on the market for listed securities of London \nStock Exchange plc, or to trading on AIM, a market of the London Stock Exchange, or to trading on any recognized investment exchange (as that term was \ndefined in Section 841 of Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, or ICTA, and as now contained in Section 1137 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010, or \nCTA); (ii) a change of control; or (iii) a sale of the company. \nTakeovers and Corporate Events. If (a) any person or group of persons acting in concert obtains control (as defined in section 840 of ICTA and as \nnow contained in section 995 Income Tax Act, or ITA) of the company, as a result of making either (i) an offer to acquire shares amounting to more than \n50% of the issued share capital of the company on a condition such that if it is satisfied the person or group of persons will have control of the company, or \n(ii) a general offer to acquire all of the issued share capital of the company (or all of the ordinary shares of the company in issue); or (b) any person \nbecomes entitled or bound to acquire shares in the company under sections 428 to 430F of the Companies Act 1985 (since repealed and replaced by \nsections 974 to 991 of the Companies Act 2006); or (c) under section 425 of the Companies Act 1985 (since repealed and replaced by sections 895 to 901 \nof the Companies Act 2006) the courts of England and Wales sanction a compromise or arrangement proposed for the purpose of or in connection with a \nscheme for the reconstruction of the company or its amalgamation with any other company or companies, and, in each case an option holder’s option \nagreement expressly so provides, an option holder may at any time exercise his or her options or any part thereof which has not lapsed within a specified \nperiod. To the extent they are not exercised, such options will lapse at the end of the specified period for exercise. \nLapse of Options. If not otherwise lapsed in accordance with the provisions of the 2009 Share Option Scheme, an option granted under the 2009 \nShare Option Scheme shall lapse at 5 p.m. on the day before the 10th anniversary of the grant of the option. \n111"

Absent summary dismissal with just cause, options will be retained by an option holder once they have ceased to be an employee \nor director of the company or a subsidiary. Where an option holder has been summarily dismissed for cause, such option holder’s unexercised options shall \nimmediately cease to be exercisable and shall lapse after 90 days unless our board of directors determines within such 90 day period that the option holder \nmay exercise all or part of his options within a specified period. \nLapse of Options.

To the extent they are not exercised, such options will lapse at the end of the specified period for exercise. \nAdjustment of Awards. In the event that there is any variation in our share capital that affects the value of the options, our board of directors will \nmake such adjustments to the number and exercise price of shares subject to each option or the option price as our board of directors considers appropriate \nin accordance with the rules of the 2020 LTIP. \nTransferability.

The CSOP is an option scheme that provides for the grant of options under a \nCompany Share Option Plan in accordance with Schedule 4 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 which affords some tax advantages to the \noption holder. We no longer qualify for the tax-advantageous EMI option scheme rules but will qualify for the CSOP scheme. While the CSOP scheme is \nbroadly similar in terms of its tax advantages it is more limited in terms of the quantum of the award. Grants under the CSOP would only be applicable to \nU.K. taxpayers. As of December 31, 2022, we have not granted any options under the 2020 CSOP.\nKey points:\n•\nCSOP options must only be granted to full-time directors or employees;\n•\neach recipient can receive options to buy company shares worth up to £30,000 (as valued (ignoring any restrictions) at the date of grant or \nsuch earlier agreed time) with this figure increasing to £60,000 with effect from 6 April 2023;\n•\non grant of the CSOP option, there is generally no liability to income tax or NICs (employee’s and employer’s) unless the exercise price \n(together with any grant price) is less than the market value of the shares at the date of grant;\n•\nno income tax or NICs will be payable on the exercise of a tax advantaged CSOP option if the CSOP option is exercised whilst the \nscheme is still a tax advantaged scheme and the option is exercised;\no\non or before the tenth anniversary of the date of grant of the option, and either;\no\non or after the third anniversary of the date of grant; or\no\npursuant to the terms of the CSOP, prior to the third anniversary of the date of grant and, broadly, within six months of certain \ntakeover events;\n•\nthere is no capital gains tax (CGT) payable on the grant or exercise of a qualifying CSOP option. On sale of the option shares, CGT may \nbe payable on any gain;\n•\nthe CSOP scheme rules include the concept of a vesting requirement before they can be exercised and CSOP option awards are generally \nstructured so that they do not become exercisable/vest earlier than three years from grant so that they provide the preferential tax \ntreatment to the option holder;\n•\noption awards which have not vested on an option holder’s cessation of employment lapse; and\n•\nthe option holder indemnifies the Company in relation to Tax Liabilities (as defined in the CSOP rules).\n116"

      "text": "Employee Benefit Trust \nOn December 19, 2011, we established a discretionary employee benefit trust under the terms of a trust deed, or the Employee Benefit Trust, to \noperate in conjunction with our share option schemes. The beneficiaries of the Employee Benefit Trust are our employees and former employees (including \nexecutive directors) and their spouses, civil partners, surviving spouses and civil partners, children and step-children under the age of 18. The trustee of the \nEmployee Benefit Trust is NuCana BioMed Trustee Company Limited, or the Trustee, our wholly owned subsidiary. As of December 31, 2022, the Trustee \nholds 500,000 of our ordinary shares in trust under the terms of the trust deed, which, pursuant to the terms of our three option schemes, and at the election \nof the Trustee, may be used to satisfy awards under our share option schemes. Under the terms of the trust deed, unless we direct otherwise, the Trustee \nmust abstain from voting at a general meeting any of our shares held in the trust fund for which the Trustee holds the whole of the beneficial interest. \nC.\t Board Practices\nBoard Composition and Director Independence \nOur business affairs are managed under the direction of our board of directors, which is currently composed of seven members. Under the rules and \nregulations of Nasdaq a director will qualify as “independent” if our board of directors affirmatively determines that he or she has no material relationship \nwith us (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us). Our board of directors has established \nguidelines to assist it in determining whether a director has such a material relationship. Ownership of a significant amount of our shares, by itself, does not \nconstitute a material relationship. \nPursuant to Nasdaq rules, a director employed by us cannot be deemed to be an “independent director,” and consequently Hugh Griffith does not \nqualify as an independent director. \nOur board of directors has reviewed the materiality of any relationship that each of our directors has with us, either directly or indirectly. Based on \nthis review, our board of directors has determined that the following directors are “independent directors” as defined by the applicable rules and regulations \nof Nasdaq: Martin Mellish, Adam George, Cyrille Leperlier, Bali Muralidhar, Elliott Levy and Andrew Kay. \nTerms of Directors and Executive Officers\nOur executive officers are selected by and serve at the discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, with \nthe members of each class serving staggered three year terms. See “Memorandum and Articles of Association — Directors — Classified board of directors” \nin this Annual Report for a description of each director’s current term of office. \nThere are no arrangements or understanding between us and any of the members of our board of directors providing for benefits upon termination of \ntheir service.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors and Corporate Governance \nSubject to certain exceptions, the rules of the Nasdaq permit a foreign private issuer to follow its home country practice in lieu of the listing \nrequirements of Nasdaq. \nThe committees of our board of directors consist of an audit committee, a remuneration committee, a nominations committee and a development \ncommittee. As permitted by home country practice, our remuneration and nominations committees may include non-independent directors. Each of these \ncommittees has the responsibilities described below. Our board of directors may also establish other committees from time to time to assist in the discharge \nof its responsibilities. \nAudit Committee \nThe members of our audit committee are currently three of our non-executive directors, Adam George, Martin Mellish and Cyrille Leperlier. Each of \nthese members is an “independent director” as such term is defined in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. Mr. George serves as chair of the audit \ncommittee. Our board of directors has determined that Mr. George is a financial expert as contemplated by the rules of the SEC implementing Section 407 \nof the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Our audit committee meets at least four times per year and oversees the monitoring of our internal controls, accounting \npolicies and financial reporting and provides a forum through which our external auditors and independent registered public accounting firm reports. Our \naudit committee meets at least once a year with the external auditors and our independent registered public accounting firm without executive board \nmembers present. The audit committee is also responsible for overseeing the activities of the external auditors and our independent registered public \naccounting firm, including their appointment, reappointment, or removal as well as monitoring their objectivity and independence. The audit committee \nalso reviews and approves the fees paid to our external auditors and independent registered public accounting firm and determines whether the fee levels \nfor non-audit services, individually and in aggregate, relative to the audit fee are appropriate so as not to undermine their independence. \n117"

Andrew Kay serves as chair of the nominating and governance committee and oversees the evaluation of the board of directors’ performance. \nThe nominating and governance committee meets at least twice a year and reviews the structure, size and composition of the board of directors, supervises \nthe selection and appointment process of directors, making recommendations to the board of directors with regard to any changes and using an external \nsearch consultancy if considered appropriate. For new appointments, the nominating and governance committee makes a final recommendation to the board \nof directors, and the board of directors has the opportunity to meet the candidate prior to approving the appointment. Once appointed, the nominating and \ngovernance committee oversees the induction of new directors and provides the appropriate training to the board of directors during the course of the year \nin order to ensure that they have the knowledge and skills necessary to operate effectively. The nominating and governance committee is also responsible \nfor annually evaluating the performance of the board of directors, both on an individual basis and for the board of directors as a whole, taking into account \nsuch factors as attendance record, contribution during board of directors meetings and the amount of time that has been dedicated to board matters during \nthe course of the year. \nDevelopment Committee\nThe members of the development committee are two of our non-executive directors, Elliott Levy and Cyrille Leperlier. Dr. Leperlier serves as chair \nof the development committee. The development Committee meets at least twice a year and reviews and advises the board of directors on the Company’s \nstrategic direction and investment in the research and development of the Company’s pipeline and products.

Such re-registration required the passing of special resolutions by our shareholders to approve the re-registration as a \npublic limited company, the name change to NuCana plc and to effect certain amendments to our articles of association. \nOur registered office is located at 77/78 Cannon Street, London, EC4N 6AF, United Kingdom.

On March 20, 2008, we \nissued 4,499,950 ordinary shares of £0.04 each. \nOn July 27, 2008, we issued a further 200,000 ordinary shares of £0.04 each. \nOn August 20, 2009, we issued 350,000 ordinary shares of £0.04 each. \nOn December 18, 2009, we issued 1,816,976 ordinary shares of £0.04 each (500,000 of which were available for such issue, having previously been \nissued to, but subsequently surrendered by, a shareholder). \nOn December 14, 2010, we issued 1,566,359 ordinary shares of £0.04 each. \nOn November 24, 2011, we issued 7,483,334 series A convertible participating shares of £0.04 each. \nOn March 28, 2012, we issued 222,222 ordinary shares of £0.04 each. \nOn March 31, 2014, we issued 8,462,500 series B convertible participating shares of £0.004 each. \nOn November 30, 2016, we issued 37,500 ordinary shares of £0.04 each, pursuant to the exercise of share options granted under the 2012 Share \nOption Scheme. \nOn December 31, 2016, we issued 45,750 ordinary shares of £0.04 each, pursuant to the exercise of share options granted under the 2016 Share \nOption Scheme. \nOn August 17, 2017, we issued 30,000 ordinary shares of £0.04 each, pursuant to the exercise of share options granted under the 2016 Share Option \nScheme. \nOn September 14, 2017, we completed a one-for-four reverse share split and an associated, prior, bonus allotment of three ordinary shares and five \nseries A convertible participating shares to eliminate fractional entitlements.

      "text": "Articles of Association \nThe following is a summary of certain provisions of our articles of association. Please note that this is only a summary and is not intended to be \nexhaustive. For further information please refer to the full version of our articles of association, which is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report. \nShares and Rights Attaching to Them \nGeneral. All ordinary shares have the same rights and rank pari passu in all respects. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and any \nother relevant legislation, our board of directors may, from time to time, allot and issue shares following an ordinary resolution of the shareholders granting \nauthority to the directors to allot shares (and if applicable, and not already disapplied, a special resolution to disapply pre-emption rights). \nOur shares may be issued with or have attached to them any preferred, deferred, qualified or other special rights or restrictions, whether in relation to \ndividends, returns of capital, voting or otherwise, as set out in our articles of association or as the shareholders may determine by ordinary resolution (or, if \nthe shareholders have not so determined, as our board of directors may determine). \nVoting rights. Subject to any other provisions of our articles of association and without prejudice to any special rights, privileges or restrictions as to \nvoting attached to any shares forming part of our share capital, the voting rights of shareholders are as follows. Unless a poll vote is demanded, \nshareholders shall vote on all resolutions on a show of hands. Our articles of association provide that a poll vote may be demanded before, or on the \ndeclaration of, the result of a vote on a show of hands: (a) by the chairman of a general meeting, (b) by at least five shareholders present at a meeting and \nentitled to vote, or (c) by any shareholder or shareholders present representing not less than ten per cent of the total voting rights or more than ten per cent \nof the total sum paid up on all voting shares. For these purposes, a shareholder will be present at a meeting if attending in person, by proxy, or, in the case \nof a shareholder that is a corporation (as broadly defined under the Companies Act 2006), by duly authorized representative. \nOn a show of hands, each shareholder present in person, and each duly authorized representative present in person of a shareholder that is a \ncorporation, has one vote. On a show of hands, each proxy present in person who has been duly appointed by one or more shareholders has one vote, but a \nproxy has one vote for and one vote against a resolution if the proxy is instructed to vote on a resolution by more than one shareholder and is instructed to \nvote in different ways on such resolution. \nOn a poll, each shareholder present in person or by proxy or, with respect to a corporation, by a duly authorized representative has one vote for each \nshare held by the shareholder. We are prohibited from exercising any rights to attend or vote at meetings in respect of any shares held by us as treasury \nshares. \nRestrictions on voting where sums overdue on shares. None of our shareholders is entitled to vote at any general meeting or at any separate class \nmeeting in respect of any share held by him or her unless all calls or other sums payable by him or her in respect of that share have been paid. \nCalls on shares. The directors may from time to time make calls on shareholders in respect of any amounts unpaid on their shares, whether in \nrespect of nominal value of the shares or by way of premium. Shareholders are required to pay the called amount on shares subject to receiving at least 14 \nclear days’ notice specifying the time and place for payment. Under our articles of association, a period of “clear days” excludes the day on which a notice \nis given or deemed to have been given and the day for which it is given or on which it is to take effect. If a shareholder fails to pay any part of a call, the \nboard of directors may serve further notice naming another day not being less than 14 clear days from the date of the further notice requiring payment and \nstating that in the event of non-payment the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. Subsequent forfeiture requires a \nresolution by the board of directors. \nDividends. Subject to the Companies Act 2006 and the provisions of all other relevant legislation, we may by ordinary resolution declare dividends \nout of profits available for distribution in accordance with the respective rights of shareholders, but no such dividend shall exceed the amount \nrecommended by the board of directors. If, in the opinion of the board of directors, our profits available for distribution justify such payments, the board of \ndirectors may pay fixed dividends payable on any of our shares with preferential rights, half-yearly or otherwise, on fixed dates and from time to time pay \ninterim dividends to the holders of any class of shares. Subject to any special rights attaching to, or terms of issue of, any shares, all dividends shall be \ndeclared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares on which the dividend is paid. No dividend shall be payable to us in respect of any shares \nheld by us as treasury shares. \n126"

Subject to any special rights attaching to, or the terms of issue of any shares, on any winding-up of the \ncompany our surplus assets remaining after satisfaction of our liabilities will be distributed among our shareholders in proportion to their respective \nholdings of shares and the amounts paid up on those shares. \nOn any winding-up of the company (whether the liquidation is voluntary, under supervision or by the Court), the liquidator may with the authority of \na special resolution of the company and any other sanction required by any relevant legislation, divide among our shareholders (excluding the company \nitself to the extent that it is a shareholder by virtue of its holding any shares or treasury shares) in specie or in kind the whole or any part of our assets \n(subject to any special rights attached to any shares issued by us in the future) and may for that purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any one or \nmore class or classes of property and may determine how that division shall be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders. \nThe liquidator may, with that sanction, vest the whole or any part of the assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the shareholders as he with the \nrelevant authority determines, and the liquidation of the company may be closed and the company dissolved, but so that no shareholders shall be compelled \nto accept any shares or other property in respect of which there is a liability. \nVariation of rights. The rights or privileges attached to any class of shares may (unless otherwise provided by the terms of the issue of the shares of \nthat class) be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of three-fourths in requisite nominal value of the issued shares of that class \n(excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares) or with the approval of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the \nshareholders of that class, but not otherwise. \nTransfer of shares. All of our shares are in registered form and may be transferred by a transfer in any usual or common form or any form \nacceptable to the board of directors and permitted by the Companies Act 2006 and any other relevant legislation. \nThe board of directors may decline to register a transfer of a share that is: \n•\nnot fully paid or on which we have a lien;\n•\n(except where uncertificated shares are transferred without a written instrument) not lodged duly stamped (if it is required to be stamped) at \nour registered office or at such other place as the board of directors may appoint;\n•\n(except where a certificate has not been issued) not accompanied by the certificate of the share to which it relates or such other evidence \nreasonably required by the directors to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;\n•\nin respect of more than one class of share; or\n•\nin the case of a transfer to joint holders of a share, the number of joint holders to whom the share is to be transferred exceeds four.\n127"

We may, by ordinary resolution, consolidate and divide all or any of our share capital into shares of a larger nominal amount than \nour existing shares or sub-divide our shares, or any of them, into shares of a smaller nominal amount than our existing shares. Subject to the provisions of \nthe Companies Act 2006 and any other applicable legislation, we may by special resolution reduce our share capital, any capital redemption reserve fund or \nany share premium account and may redeem or purchase any of our own shares. \nPre-emption rights. There are no rights of pre-emption under our articles of association in respect of transfers of issued ordinary shares. In certain \ncircumstances, our shareholders may have statutory pre-emption rights under the Companies Act 2006 in respect of the allotment of new shares in the \ncompany. These statutory pre-emption rights, when applicable, would require us to offer new shares for allotment to existing shareholders on a pro rata \nbasis before allotting them to other persons. In such circumstances, the procedure for the exercise of such statutory pre-emption rights would be set out in \nthe documentation by which such ordinary shares would be offered to our shareholders. These statutory pre-emption rights may be disapplied by a special \nresolution passed by shareholders in a general meeting in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. \nDirectors \nNumber. Unless and until we in a general meeting of our shareholders otherwise determine, the number of directors comprising our board of \ndirectors shall not be subject to any maximum but shall not be less than two. \nClassified board of directors. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, “Class I,” whose initial term expires at the annual general meeting \nof the shareholders to be held in 2023, “Class II,” whose initial term expires at the annual general meeting of the shareholders to be held in 2025, and \n“Class III”, whose term expires at the annual general meeting of the shareholders to be held in 2024, with the classes as nearly equal in number as possible. \nThe Class I directors are Hugh Griffith, Andrew Kay and Bali Muralidhar, the Class II directors are Elliott Levy and Cyrille Leperlier, and the Class III \ndirectors are Adam George and Martin Mellish.\nBorrowing powers. Our board of directors may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, mortgage or charge all or any part or parts \nof its undertaking, property and uncalled capital, and issue debentures and other securities whether outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or \nobligation of the company or of any third party. \nDirectors’ interests and restrictions \n(a) The board of directors may, in accordance with our articles of association and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, authorize a matter \nproposed to us which would, if not authorized, involve a breach by a director of his or her duty under section 175 of the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a \nsituation in which he or she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with our interests. A director is not \nrequired, by reason of being a director, to account to the company for any remuneration or other benefit that he or she derives from a relationship involving \na conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest that has been authorized by the board of directors. \n(b) Subject to the provisions of any relevant legislation and provided that he or she has disclosed to the directors the nature and extent of any \nmaterial interest of his or hers, a director may be a party to, or otherwise interested in, any transaction, contract or arrangement and that director shall not, \nby reason of his or her office, be accountable to the company for any benefit that he or she derives from any such transaction or arrangement; and no such \ntransaction or arrangement shall be liable to be voided on the ground of any such interest or benefit. \n(c) Except as provided in our articles of association, a director shall not vote at a meeting of the directors in respect of any transaction or \narrangement or any other proposal whatsoever in which he or she has an interest that is to his or her knowledge material (together with any person \nconnected with him or her within the meaning of section 252 of the Companies Act 2006), other than (i) an interest in shares or debentures or other \nsecurities of the company, (ii) where permitted by the terms of any authorization of a conflict of interest, or (iii) in the circumstances set out in paragraph \n(d) below, and shall not be counted in the quorum at a meeting in relation to any resolution on which he or she is not entitled to vote. \n128"

The consideration offered to the outstanding minority shareholders whose shares are compulsorily acquired under the Companies \nAct 2006 must, in general, be the same as the consideration that was available under the takeover offer. \nSell-out. The Companies Act 2006 also gives our minority shareholders a right to be bought out in certain circumstances by an offeror who has \nmade a takeover offer for all of our shares. The holder of shares to which the offer relates, and who has not otherwise accepted the offer, may require the \nofferor to acquire his shares if, prior to the expiry of the acceptance period for such offer, (i) the offeror has acquired or agreed to acquire not less than 90% \nin value of our voting shares, and (ii) not less than 90% of the voting rights carried by those shares. The offeror may impose a time limit on the rights of \nminority shareholders to be bought out that is not less than three months after the end of the acceptance period. If a shareholder exercises his rights to be \nbought out, the offeror is required to acquire those shares on the terms of the takeover offer or on such other terms as may be agreed. \nDisclosure of interest in shares. Pursuant to Part 22 of the Companies Act 2006 and our articles of association, we are empowered to require, by \nnotice in writing, any person whom we know to be, or have reasonable cause to believe to be, is interested in our shares, or at any time during the three \nyears immediately preceding the date on which the notice is issued has been so interested, within a reasonable time to disclose to us particulars of that \nperson’s own interest and (so far as is within that person’s knowledge) particulars of any other interest, agreement or arrangement relating to the exercise of \nany rights conferred by the holding of the shares that subsists or subsisted in those shares. \nUnder our articles of association, if a person defaults in supplying us with the required particulars in relation to the shares in question (referred to \nherein as “default shares”), the board of directors may by notice direct that: \n•\nin respect of the default shares, the relevant shareholder shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any other right conferred by his holding \nshares in relation to general meetings; or\n•\nwhere the default shares represent at least 0.25% of their class, (a) any dividend or other money payable in respect of the default shares shall \nbe retained by us without liability to pay interest and, if applicable, any election to receive ordinary shares instead of money in respect of the \ndefault shares shall be ineffective; (b) no transfers of shares by the relevant shareholder other than certain approved transfers may be \nregistered (unless the shareholder himself is not in default and the transfer does not relate to default shares) or (c) any shares held by the \nrelevant shareholder in uncertificated form shall be converted into certificated form.\nPurchase of own shares. Under English law, a limited company may only purchase its own shares out of its distributable profits or the proceeds of a \nfresh issue of shares made for the purpose of financing the purchase, provided it is not restricted from doing so by its articles. A limited company may not \npurchase its own shares if, as a result of the purchase, there would no longer be any issued shares of the company other than redeemable shares or shares \nheld as treasury shares. Shares must be fully paid in order to be repurchased. \nWe may purchase our own fully paid shares otherwise than on a recognized investment exchange pursuant to a purchase contract authorized by \nresolution of shareholders before the purchase takes place. Any authority will not be effective if any shareholder from whom we propose to purchase shares \nvotes on the resolution and the resolution would not have been passed if he had not done so. The resolution authorizing the purchase must specify a date, \nnot being later than five years after the passing of the resolution, on which the authority to purchase is to expire. \n131"

English law generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash; however, it is possible \nfor a company’s articles of association, or shareholders in general meeting, to exclude preemptive rights.

As a public company incorporated in England and Wales with its place of central \nmanagement and control in the United Kingdom, we are subject to the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (referred to herein as the \nTakeover Code). The Takeover Code contains rules concerning the conduct of takeover offers for the company. For example, under Rule 9 of the Takeover \nCode, if a person: \n(a) acquires an interest in our shares that, when taken together with shares in which he or persons acting in concert with him are interested, carries \n30% or more of the voting rights of our shares; or \n(b) who, together with persons acting in concert with him, is interested in shares that in the aggregate carry not less than 30% and not more than \n50% of the voting rights in the company, acquires additional interests in shares that increase the percentage of shares carrying voting rights in which that \nperson is interested; \nthe acquirer and, depending on the circumstances, its concert parties, would be required (except with the consent of the Takeover Panel) to make a \ncash offer for our outstanding shares at a price not less than the highest price paid for any interests in the shares by the acquirer or its concert parties during \nthe previous 12 months. Some provisions in the Takeover Code might have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others even if \nan acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. \nDistributions and dividends. Under the Companies Act 2006, before a company can lawfully make a distribution or dividend, it must ensure that it \nhas sufficient distributable reserves (on a non-consolidated basis). The basic rule is that a company’s profits available for the purpose of making a \ndistribution are its accumulated, realized profits, so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less its accumulated, realized losses, so \nfar as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made. The requirement to have sufficient distributable reserves before a \ndistribution or dividend can be paid applies to us and to each of our subsidiaries that has been incorporated under English law. \n132"

      "text": "Standard of Conduct for \nDirectors\n \nUnder English law, a director owes various statutory and \nfiduciary duties to the company, including:\n \n•      to act in the way he considers, in good faith, would \nbe most likely to promote the success of the \ncompany for the benefit of its shareholders as a \nwhole, subject in certain specified circumstances to \nconsider or act in the interests of the creditors of \nthe company;\n \n•      to avoid a situation in which he has, or can have, a \ndirect or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly \nconflicts, with the interests of the company;\n \n•      to act in accordance with the company’s \nconstitution and only exercise his powers for the \npurposes for which they are conferred;\n \n•      to exercise independent judgement;\n \n•      to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence;\n \n•      not to accept benefits from a third party conferred \nby reason of his being a director or doing, or not \ndoing, anything as a director; and\n \n•      a duty to declare any interest that he has, whether \ndirectly or indirectly, in a proposed or existing \ntransaction or arrangement with the company.\n \n  \nDelaware law does not contain specific provisions setting \nforth the standard of conduct of a director. The scope of \nthe fiduciary duties of directors is generally determined by \nthe courts of the State of Delaware. In general, directors \nhave a duty to act without self-interest, on a well-informed \nbasis and in a manner they reasonably believe to be in the \nbest interest of the stockholders.\n \nDirectors of a Delaware corporation owe fiduciary duties \nof care and loyalty to the corporation and to its \nshareholders. The duty of care generally requires that a \ndirector act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily \nprudent person would exercise under similar \ncircumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform \nhimself of all material information reasonably available \nregarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty \nrequires that a director act in a manner he reasonably \nbelieves to be in the best interests of the corporation. He \nmust not use his corporate position for personal gain or \nadvantage. In general, but subject to certain exceptions, \nactions of a director are presumed to have been made on \nan informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief \nthat the action taken was in the best interests of the \ncorporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted \nby evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. \nDelaware courts have also imposed a heightened standard \nof conduct upon directors of a Delaware corporation who \ntake any action designed to defeat a threatened change in \ncontrol of the corporation.\n \nIn addition, under Delaware law, when the board of \ndirectors of a Delaware corporation approves the sale or \nbreak-up of a corporation, the board of directors may, in \ncertain circumstances, have a duty to obtain the highest \nvalue reasonably available to the shareholders.\n \n \n \nShareholder Litigation\n \nUnder English law, generally, the company, rather than its \nshareholders, is the proper claimant in an action in respect of \na wrong done to the company or where there is an irregularity \nin the company’s internal management. Notwithstanding this \ngeneral position, the Companies Act 2006 provides that (i) a \ncourt may allow a shareholder to bring a derivative claim \n(that is, an action in respect of and on behalf of the company) \nin respect of a cause of action arising from an act or omission \ninvolving a director’s negligence, default, breach of duty or \nbreach of trust and (ii) a shareholder may bring a claim for a \ncourt order where the company’s \n  \nUnder Delaware law, a stockholder may initiate a \nderivative action to enforce a right of a corporation if the \ncorporation fails to enforce the right itself.

This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or the Code for \npurposes of this discussion, in effect as of the date of this Annual Report and on U.S. Treasury regulations in effect or, in some cases, proposed, as of the \ndate of this Annual Report, as well as judicial and administrative interpretations thereof available on or before such date. All of the foregoing authorities are \nsubject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below. \nThis discussion applies only to U.S. Holders that hold the ADSs as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It does not purport to be a \ncomprehensive description of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the ADSs by any particular investor. In particular, this \ndiscussion does not address tax considerations applicable to a U.S. Holder that may be subject to special tax rules, including, without limitation, a dealer in \nsecurities or currencies, a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings, banks, thrifts, or other \nfinancial institutions, an insurance company, a tax-exempt organization, a person that holds the ADSs as part of a hedge, straddle or conversion transaction \nfor tax purposes, a person whose functional currency for tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar, certain former citizens or residents of the United States or a \nperson that owns directly, indirectly or constructively shares representing 10% or more of the  company by vote or value. Moreover, this description does \nnot address the U.S. federal estate, gift, or alternative minimum tax consequences, or any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences, of the acquisition, \nownership and disposition of the ADSs. In addition, the discussion does not address tax consequences to an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership \nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds the ADSs, or a partner in such partnership. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of each partner of such \npartnership generally will depend upon the status \n139"

Prospective purchasers that are partners in a partnership holding the ADSs are urged to consult their own \ntax advisers. \nThe discussion below of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to “U.S. Holders” will apply to an investor that is a beneficial owner of ADSs \nand that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, \n•\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;\n•\na corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) organized under the laws of the United States, \nany state therein or the District of Columbia;\n•\nan estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or\n•\na trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and subject to the control of one or more U.S. persons \nfor all substantial decisions or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, a beneficial owner of ADSs generally will be treated as the owner of the underlying ordinary shares \nrepresented by such ADSs. Accordingly, deposits or withdrawals of the underlying ordinary shares for ADSs generally will not be subject to U.S. federal \nincome tax. The discussion below assumes that the representations contained in the deposit agreement are true and that the obligations in the deposit \nagreement and any related agreement will be complied with in accordance with their terms. U.S. Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom \nADSs are released before shares are delivered to the depositary or intermediaries in the chain of ownership between the U.S. Holder of an ADS and the \nissuer of the security underlying the ADS may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits by U.S. Holders of ADSs. \nThese actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced rate of tax, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain \nnoncorporate U.S. Holders. As a result, the creditability of non-U.S. withholding taxes (if any), and the availability of the reduced tax rate for dividends \nreceived by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders, each described below, could be affected by actions taken by such parties or intermediaries. Accordingly, \nU.S. persons considering an investment in ADSs should consult their own tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences applicable to them relating to \nthe purchase, ownership and disposition of ADSs, including the applicability of U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and non-U.S. tax laws.\nYou are urged to consult your tax advisors about the application of the U.S. federal income tax rules to your particular circumstances as \nwell as the state, local, non-U.S. and other tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the ADSs. \nPassive Foreign Investment Company Considerations \nIn general, a corporation organized outside the United States will be classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, in a particular \ntaxable year if either (i) 75% or more of the corporation’s gross income for the taxable year is passive income or (ii) on average at least 50% of the value of \nthe corporation’s assets produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. Passive income for this purpose generally includes, \namong other things, certain dividends, interest, royalties, rents and gains from commodities and securities transactions and from the sale or exchange of \nproperty that gives rise to passive income. \nIn making this determination, we will be treated as earning our proportionate share of any income and owning our proportionate share of any assets \nof any corporation in which we hold a 25% or greater interest (by value). Because PFIC status must be determined annually based on tests which are factual \nin nature, our PFIC status will depend on our income, assets and activities each year, including whether certain research and development tax credits \nreceived from the government of the United Kingdom will constitute gross income, and, if they do, whether they will constitute passive income for \npurposes of the PFIC income test. In addition, for purposes of the PFIC asset test, the value of our assets will depend in part on the market price of our \nordinary shares, which may fluctuate significantly. If we are classified as a PFIC for any taxable year, a U.S. Holder may be able to mitigate some of the \nresulting adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences described below with respect to owning the ADSs, provided that such U.S. Holder is eligible to \nmake, and validly makes a “mark-to-market” election, described below. In certain circumstances a U.S. Holder can make a “qualified electing fund” \nelection to mitigate some of the adverse tax consequences described with respect to an ownership interest in a PFIC by including in income its share of the \nPFIC’s income on a current basis. We intend to provide the information necessary for a U.S. investor to make a qualified electing fund or election, or “QEF \nElection” with respect to us. A U.S. Holder can make a QEF Election in the first taxable year that the entity is treated as a PFIC with respect to the U.S. \nHolder. A U.S. Holder making a QEF election other than for the first taxable year in which it owns (or is treated as owning) an equity interest in a PFIC \nwould continue to be \n140"

      "text": "subject to the rules described in the preceding paragraph with respect to such PFIC, unless the U.S. Holder makes a “deemed sale” election with respect to \nthe PFIC and recognizes gain taxed under the general PFIC rules described above with respect to the PFIC stock’s appreciation before the year for which \nthe QEF Election is made.\nWe expect to post the information necessary to make QEF Elections on our website. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year, the consequences to any \nU.S. Holder will depend in part on whether the U.S. Holder makes a valid QEF Election or mark-to-market election as described below.\nIf a U.S. Holder makes a QEF Election with respect to a PFIC, the U.S. Holder will be taxed on its pro rata share of the PFIC’s ordinary earnings \nand net capital gain (at ordinary income and capital gain rates, respectively) for each taxable year that the entity is a PFIC. If a U.S. Holder makes a QEF \nElection with respect to us, any distributions we pay out of our earnings and profits that were previously included in the U.S. Holder’s income under the \nQEF Election would not be taxable to the U.S. Holder. A U.S. Holder will increase its tax basis in its ADSs or ordinary shares by an amount equal to any \nincome included under the QEF Election and will decrease its tax basis by any amount distributed on the ADSs or ordinary shares that is not included in the \nU.S. Holder’s income. In addition, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital gain or loss on the disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares in an amount equal to the \ndifference between the amount realized and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the ADSs or ordinary shares, as determined in U.S. dollars. A U.S. \nHolder will not be taxed on the ordinary income and net capital gain under the QEF rules for any year that we are not a PFIC.\nIn the event that we are classified as a PFIC in any year in which a U.S. Holder holds the ADSs, and neither a QEF Election nor the “mark-to-\nmarket” election described below is made by a taxable U.S. Holder, a special tax regime will apply with respect to such U.S. Holder to both (a) any gain \nrealized on the sale or other disposition of the ADSs and (b) any “excess distribution” by us to such U.S. Holder (generally, such U.S. Holder’s ratable \nportion of distributions received by such U.S. Holder in any year which are greater than 125% of the average annual distribution received by such U.S. \nHolder in the shorter of the three preceding years or such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ADSs). Any gain recognized by such U.S. Holder on a sale \nor other disposition (including a pledge) of the ADSs and any excess distribution would be allocated ratably over such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the \nADSs. The amounts allocated to the taxable year of the sale or other disposition and to any year before we became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary \nincome. The amount allocated to each other taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals or corporations, as appropriate, \nfor that taxable year, and the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax would be imposed on taxes deemed to have been payable in for \nthe relevant taxable PFIC years. Classification as a PFIC may also have other adverse tax consequences, including, in the case of U.S. Holders that are \nindividuals, the denial of a step-up in the basis of such U.S. Holder’s ADSs at death. \nBased on our estimated gross income, the average value of our assets, including goodwill and the nature of our active business, we believe we were \na PFIC for U.S. income tax purposes for the taxable year ending December 31, 2022. There can be no assurance regarding our PFIC status for the current \ntaxable year or any particular year in the future because PFIC status is factual in nature, depends upon factors not wholly within our control, generally \ncannot be determined until the close of the taxable year in question and is determined annually. Whether we will be a PFIC in the current or any future \ntaxable year is uncertain because, among other things, we currently own a substantial amount of passive assets, including cash, and because the valuation of \nour assets that generate non-passive income for PFIC purposes, including our goodwill and other intangible assets, is uncertain and may vary substantially \nover time. In addition, the composition of our assets and income may vary substantially over time. The average quarterly value of our assets for purposes of \ndetermining our PFIC status for any taxable year (to the extent applicable) will generally be determined in part by reference to our market capitalization, \nwhich has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly over time. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC in the current \nor for any future taxable year. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should invest in our ADSs only if they are willing to bear the U.S. federal income tax \nconsequences associated with investments in PFICs. \nMark-to-Market Election \nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds the ADSs, then in lieu of being subject to the special tax regime and interest \ncharge rules discussed above, a U.S. Holder may make an election to include gain on the ADSs as ordinary income under a mark-to-market method, \nprovided that the ADSs are treated as “regularly traded” on a “qualified exchange.” In general, the ADSs will be treated as “regularly traded” for a given \ncalendar year if more than a de minimis quantity of the ADSs are traded on a qualified exchange on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter of such \ncalendar year. Although the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, has not published any authority identifying specific exchanges that may constitute \n“qualified exchanges,” Treasury Regulations provide that a qualified exchange is (a) a U.S. securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and \nExchange Commission, or the SEC, (b) the U.S. market system \n141"

We have received approval to list our ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which is a U.S. securities \nexchange that is registered with the SEC. However, no assurance can be given that the ADSs will meet the requirements to be treated as “regularly traded” \nfor purposes of the mark-to-market election. In addition, because a mark-to-market election cannot be made for any lower-tier PFICs that we may own, a \nU.S. Holder may continue to be subject to the special tax regime with respect to such holder’s indirect interest in any investments held by us that are treated \nas an equity interest in a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including shares in any future subsidiary of ours that is treated as a PFIC. \nIf a U.S. Holder makes this mark-to-market election, such U.S. Holder will be required in any year in which we are a PFIC to include as ordinary \nincome the excess of the fair market value of such U.S. Holder’s ADSs at year end over its basis in those ADSs. In addition, the excess, if any, of such U.S. \nHolder’s basis in the ADSs over the fair market value of such U.S. Holder’s ADSs at year end is deductible as an ordinary loss in an amount equal to the \nlesser of (i) the amount of the excess or (ii) the amount of the net mark-to-market gains that have been included in income in prior years by such U.S. \nHolder. Any gain recognized by such U.S. Holder upon the sale of such U.S. Holder’s ADSs will be taxed as ordinary income in the year of sale. Amounts \ntreated as ordinary income will not be eligible for the preferential tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income or long-term capital gains. A U.S. \nHolder’s adjusted tax basis in the ADSs will be increased by the amount of any income inclusion and decreased by the amount of any deductions under the \nmark-to-market rules. If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to market election, it will be effective for the taxable year for which the election is made and all \nsubsequent taxable years unless the ADSs are no longer regularly traded on a qualified exchange or the IRS consents to the revocation of the election. \nControlled Foreign Corporation \nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act eliminated the prohibition on “downward attribution” from non-U.S. persons to U.S. persons under \nSection 958(b)(4) of the Code for purposes of determining constructive stock ownership under the controlled foreign corporation, or CFC  rules. As a \nresult, our U.S. subsidiary will be deemed to own all of the stock of our non-U.S. subsidiaries held by the Company for CFC purposes. To the extent a non-\nU.S. subsidiary is treated as a CFC for any taxable year, each U.S. person treated as a “10% U.S. Shareholder” with respect to such CFC that held our \nordinary shares directly or indirectly through non-U.S. entities (including the Company) as of the last day in such taxable year that the subsidiary was a \nCFC would generally be required to include in gross income as ordinary income its pro rata share of certain investment income of the CFC, regardless of \nwhether that income was actually distributed to such U.S. person (with certain adjustments). A “10% U.S. Shareholder” of a non-U.S. corporation includes \nany U.S. person that owns (or is treated as owning) stock of the non-U.S. corporation possessing 10% or more of the total voting power or total value of \nsuch non-U.S. corporation’s stock. The legislative history under the Tax Act indicates that this change was not intended to cause our non-U.S. subsidiaries \nto be treated as CFCs with respect to a 10% U.S. Shareholder that is not related to our U.S. subsidiary. However, it is not clear whether the IRS or a court \nwould interpret the change made by the Tax Act in a manner consistent with such indicated intent. \nYou are strongly urged to consult your own tax advisors to determine whether your ownership of the ADSs will cause you to become a 10% U.S. \nShareholder and the impact of such a classification. \n142"

      "text": "Information Reporting Requirements \nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds the ADSs, each such U.S. Holder generally will be required to file an annual \ninformation return on IRS Form 8621 containing such information as the U.S. Treasury Department may require. The failure to file IRS Form 8621 could \nresult in the imposition of penalties and the extension of the statute of limitations with respect to U.S. federal income tax. \nThe U.S. federal income tax rules relating to PFICs are complex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the purchase, \nownership and disposition of the ADSs, the availability of the mark-to-market election and whether making the election would be advisable in their \nparticular circumstances, and the IRS information reporting obligations with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the ADSs. \nTaxation of Dividends and Other Distributions on the ADSs \nSubject to the discussion above under the heading “—Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations”, generally the gross amount of \ndistributions made by us, if any, to a U.S. Holder with respect to the ADSs, before reduction for any non-U.S. taxes withheld therefrom, will be includable \nin gross income as a dividend to the extent that such distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. \nfederal income tax principles). To the extent, if any, that the amount of any cash distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, it \nwill be treated first as a tax-free return of such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its ADSs, and to the extent the amount of the distribution exceeds such U.S. \nHolder’s tax basis, the excess will be taxed as capital gain. We do not intend to calculate our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles. \nTherefore, a U.S. Holder should expect that a distribution will generally be treated as a dividend even if that distribution would otherwise be treated as a \nnon-taxable return of capital or as capital gain under the rules described above. A dividend in respect of the ADSs will not be eligible for the dividends-\nreceived deduction allowed to corporations in respect of dividends received from other U.S. corporations. Non-corporate U.S. Holders may qualify for the \nlower rates of taxation with respect to dividends on ADSs applicable to long term capital gains (i.e., gains from the sale of capital assets held for more than \none year), provided that certain conditions are met, including certain holding period requirements and the absence of certain risk reduction transactions. \nHowever, such reduced rate shall not apply if we are a PFIC for the taxable year in which we pay a dividend, or were a PFIC in the preceding taxable year. \nAs indicated in the section titled “Dividend Policy” herein, we intend to retain any earnings for use in our business and do not currently intend to pay \ndividends on our ordinary shares. \nSubject to the paragraph below, dividends generally will constitute income from sources outside the United States, which may be relevant in \ncalculating a U.S. Holder’s foreign tax credit limitation. For this purpose, dividends that we distribute generally should constitute “passive category \nincome,” or, in the case of certain U.S. Holders, “general category income.” Dividend payments may be made without withholding or deduction for or on \naccount of U.K. tax.\nNotwithstanding the paragraph above, if 50% or more of the ADSs are treated as held by U.S. persons, we will be treated as a “U.S.-owned foreign \ncorporation.” In that case, dividends may be treated for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes as income from sources outside the United States to the extent paid \nout of our non-U.S. source earnings and profits, and as income from sources within the United States to the extent paid out of our U.S. source earnings and \nprofits. There can be no assurance that we will not be treated as a U.S.-owned foreign corporation. If the dividends are taxed at the lower tax rates generally \napplicable to long-term capital gains (as discussed above), the amount of the dividend taken into account for purposes of calculating the U.S. foreign tax \ncredit limitation will generally be limited to the gross amount of the dividend, multiplied by the preferential rate divided by the highest rate of tax normally \napplicable to dividends. The rules relating to the determination of the foreign tax credit are complex, and U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax \nadvisors to determine whether and to what extent such U.S. Holder will be entitled to a foreign tax credit. \n143"

      "text": "Taxation of Dispositions of ADSs \nSubject to the discussion above under “—Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations”, a U.S. Holder will recognize taxable gain or loss \non any sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of an ADS equal to the difference between the amount realized (the amount of cash (in U.S. dollars) plus \nthe fair market value of any property received) for the ADS and such U.S. Holder’s tax basis (in U.S. dollars) in the ADS. The gain or loss will generally be \ncapital gain or loss. Such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain taxable at a reduced rate for non-corporate U.S. Holders or long-term \ncapital loss if, on the date of sale, exchange or other disposition, the ADSs were held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. The deductibility of capital \nlosses is subject to limitations. Any such gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. \nDisposition of Foreign Currency \nU.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of receiving, converting or disposing of any non-U.S. currency \nreceived as dividends on our ADSs or on the sale or retirement of an ADS. \nTax on Net Investment Income \nAn additional 3.8% Medicare tax may be imposed on some or all of such U.S. Holder’s “net investment income.” Net investment income generally \nincludes income from the ADSs unless such income is derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business \nthat consists of certain passive or trading activities). You should consult your tax advisors regarding the effect this Medicare tax may have, if any, on your \nacquisition, ownership or disposition of the ADSs. \nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding \nDistributions with respect to ADSs and proceeds from the sale, exchange or disposition of ADSs may be subject to information reporting to the IRS, \nand possible U.S. backup withholding. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification \nnumber and makes any other required certification or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. U.S. Holders who are required to establish their \nexempt status generally must provide such certification on U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors \nregarding the application of the U.S. information reporting and backup withholding rules. \nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income \ntax liability, and a U.S. Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for \nrefund with the IRS and furnishing any required information. \nForeign Financial Asset Information Reporting \nU.S. Holders who are either individuals or certain domestic entities may be required to submit certain information to the IRS with respect to such \nholder’s beneficial ownership of the ADSs, if such ADSs are not held on such holder’s behalf by a financial institution, as our ordinary shares are \nconsidered “specified foreign financial assets.” This law also imposes penalties and potential other adverse tax consequences if a U.S. Holder is required to \nsubmit such information to the IRS and fails to do so. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential information reporting \nobligations that may be imposed with respect to the ownership and disposition of the ADSs. \nThe above description is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating to acquisition, ownership and \ndisposition of the ADSs. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences related to their particular \ncircumstances. \n \nUnited Kingdom Tax Considerations\nThe following is a general summary of certain United Kingdom tax considerations relating to the ownership and disposal of the ADSs and does not \naddress all possible tax consequences relating to an investment in the ADSs. It is based on current U.K. tax law and published HM Revenue & Customs, or \nHMRC, practice as of the date of this Annual Report, both of which are subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. \n144"

A U.K. Holder within the charge to U.K. corporation tax may be entitled to exemption from U.K. corporation \ntax in respect of dividend payments. If the conditions for the exemption are not satisfied, or such U.K. Holder elects for an otherwise exempt dividend to be \ntaxable, United Kingdom corporation tax will be chargeable on the amount of any dividends. The main rate of United Kingdom corporation tax for the \n2022/2023 corporation tax year is 19% rising to 25% for U.K. corporations (or corporate groups) with annual profits of £250,000 or higher with effect from \nApril 1, 2023. If potential investors are in any doubt as to their position, they should consult their own professional advisers. \nA corporate holder of ADSs that is not a U.K. Holder will not be subject to U.K. corporation tax on dividends received from the company, unless it \ncarries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment to which the ADSs are attributable. In these circumstances, such holder may, \ndepending on its individual circumstances and if the exemption from U.K. corporation tax discussed above does not apply, be chargeable to U.K. \ncorporation tax on dividends received from the company. \nTaxation of Disposals\nU.K. Holders. A disposal or deemed disposal of ADSs by an individual U.K. Holder may, depending on his or her individual circumstances, give \nrise to a chargeable gain or to an allowable loss for the purpose of U.K. capital gains tax. The principal factors that will determine the capital gains tax \nposition on a disposal of ADSs are the extent to which the U.K. Holder realizes any other capital gains in the tax year in which the disposal is made, the \nextent to which the holder has incurred capital losses in that or any earlier tax year and the level of the annual allowance of tax-free gains in that tax year \n(the 'annual exemption'). The annual exemption for the 2022/2023 tax year is £12,300, and will be reduced to £6,000 on April 6, 2023 and further reduced \nto £3,000 on April 6, 2024. If, after all allowable deductions, an individual U.K. Holder who is subject to U.K. income tax at either the higher or the \nadditional rate becomes liable to U.K. capital gains tax on the disposal of ADSs, the current applicable rate would be 20%. For an individual U.K. Holder \nwho is subject to U.K. income tax at the basic rate and, after all allowable deductions, liable to U.K. capital gains tax on such disposal, the current \napplicable rate would be 10%, save to the extent that any capital gains exceed the unused basic rate tax band. In that case, the current rate applicable to the \nexcess would be 20%. \nAn individual U.K. Holder who ceases to be resident in the United Kingdom (or who fails to be regarded as resident in a territory outside the United \nKingdom for the purposes of double taxation relief) for a period of less than five years and who disposes of his or her ADSs during that period of temporary \nnon-residence may be liable to U.K. capital gains tax on a chargeable gain accruing on such disposal on his or her return to the United Kingdom (or upon \nceasing to be regarded as resident outside the United Kingdom for the purposes of double taxation relief) (subject to available exemptions or reliefs). \nA disposal or deemed disposal of ADSs by a corporate U.K. Holder may give rise to a chargeable gain or an allowable loss for the purpose of U.K. \ncorporation tax. Indexation allowance (which historically would have applied to reduce the amount of chargeable gain that is subject to corporation tax) \nwill not operate to reduce any gains on disposals of ADSs acquired on or after January 1, 2018 that arise to corporate U.K. Holders. \nNon-United Kingdom Holders. The paragraphs below relating to the liability of non -U.K. Holders to U.K. tax on chargeable gains assume that the \ncompany does not (and will not) derive 75% or more of its gross asset value from U.K. land.\nAn individual holder who is not a U.K. Holder will not be liable to U.K. capital gains tax on capital gains realized on the disposal of his or her ADSs \nunless such holder carries on (whether solely or in partnership) a trade, profession or vocation \n146"

In these circumstances, a \ndisposal of ADSs by such holder may give rise to a chargeable gain or an allowable loss for the purposes of U.K. corporation tax. \nStamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax \nThe statements below in relation to U.K. stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax, or SDRT, apply irrespective of whether the relevant holder of ADSs \nis resident or domiciled in the United Kingdom. \nIssue and Transfer of Ordinary Shares \nIssue (including to a depositary or clearance service). No U.K. stamp duty is payable on the issue of the ordinary shares. \nBased on current published HMRC practice and recent case law, there should be no SDRT payable on the issue of ordinary shares to a depositary \nreceipt system or a clearance service. We understand that HMRC recognizes The Depositary Trust Company, or DTC, as a clearance service for United \nKingdom stamp duty and SDRT purposes. \nTransfer to a depositary or clearance service. Transfers of, and unconditional agreements to transfer, ordinary shares to, or to a nominee or agent \nfor, a person whose business is or includes issuing depositary receipts or the provision of clearance services, will generally be regarded by HMRC as \nsubject to SDRT (and where the transfer is effected by a written instrument, stamp duty) at a rate of 1.5% of the amount or value of the consideration or, in \ncertain circumstances, the value of the ordinary shares transferred unless, in the case of a clearance service, it has made an election under section 97A(1) \nFinance Act 1986, or such transfer can be regarded as an integral part of an issue of share capital. Transfers of ordinary shares between depositary receipt \nsystems and clearance services will generally be exempt from stamp duty and SDRT unless, in the case of a clearance service, it has made an election under \nsection 97A(1) Finance Act 1986. Our understanding is that DTC has not made such an election. \nTransfer on sale. The transfer on sale of ordinary shares by a written instrument of transfer will generally be liable to U.K. stamp duty at the rate of \n0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration for the transfer. The purchaser normally pays the stamp duty. \nThe transfer of ordinary shares within a depositary receipt system or clearance service should not be subject to stamp duty or SDRT, except where a \nclearance service has made an election under section 97A(1) Finance Act 1986. Our understanding is that DTC has not made such an election. \nAn agreement to transfer ordinary shares outside a depositary receipt system or a clearance service will generally give rise to a liability on the \npurchaser to SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration. Such SDRT is payable on the seventh day of the month following the \nmonth in which the charge arises, but where an instrument of transfer is executed and duly stamped before the expiry of a period of six years beginning \nwith the date of that agreement, (i) any SDRT that has not been paid ceases to be payable, and (ii) any SDRT that has been paid may be recovered from \nHMRC, generally with interest. \nIssue or Transfer of ADSs/ADRs \nBased on current HMRC published practice, no U.K. stamp duty or SDRT should be payable on the issue or transfer of (including an unconditional \nagreement to transfer) a depositary receipt and the ADS to which they relate, on the basis that a depositary receipt is not regarded as “stock” or a \n“marketable security” for U.K. stamp duty purposes and is not considered a “chargeable security” for the purposes of SDRT.\nF.\t\nDividends and Paying Agents\nNot Applicable.\n147"

You may inspect and copy reports and other information filed with the SEC at the \nPublic Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by \ncalling the SEC at 1-800-732-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports and other information about issuers, like us, \nthat file electronically with the SEC. The address of that website is www.sec.gov.\nWe also make available on our website, free of charge, our Annual Report and the text of our reports on Form 6-K, including any amendments to \nthese reports, as well as certain other SEC filings, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk arises from our exposure to fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates. These risks are managed by maintaining an \nappropriate mix of cash deposits in the two main currencies we operate in, placed with a variety of financial institutions for varying periods according to \nexpected liquidity requirements. \nInterest Rate Risk \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of £41.9 million (2021: £60.3 million). Exposure to interest rate sensitivity is \nimpacted primarily by changes in the underlying bank interest rates. The Company’s surplus cash and cash equivalents are invested in interest-bearing \naccounts and certificates of deposit from time to time which earn interest at fixed or variable rates based on the terms agreed for each account. The \nCompany has not entered into investments for trading or speculative purposes.  \nAn increase in the bank interest rates by 0.5 percentage points would increase the net annual interest income applicable to the cash and cash \nequivalents held on variable and short-term fixed rate deposits by £169,000 (2021: £278,000).\nCurrency Risk \nThe Company’s functional currency is U.K. pounds sterling, and our transactions are commonly denominated in that currency. However, a portion of \nexpenses are incurred in other currencies, primarily U.S. dollars, and are exposed to the effects of this exchange rate. \nAlthough the Company is based in the United Kingdom, it sources active pharmaceutical ingredient, raw materials, research and development, \nmanufacturing, consulting and other services worldwide, including from the United States, the European Union and India. Any weakening of the pound \nsterling against the currencies of such other jurisdictions makes the purchase of such goods and services more expensive for the Company. The Company \nseeks to minimize this exposure by maintaining currency cash balances at levels appropriate to meet foreseeable short to mid-term expenses in these other \ncurrencies. The Company thus holds a significant portion of cash and cash equivalents in U.S. dollars and reports the impact of exchange rates movements \non these balances.  The Company does not use derivative instruments to manage exchange rate exposure.  A 1% increase in the value of the pound sterling \nrelative to the U.S. dollar would reduce the carrying value of net financial assets and liabilities in foreign currencies at December 31, 2022 by £283,000 \n(2021: £417,000).\nFor additional information about our quantitative and qualitative risks, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in \nthis Annual Report.\n148"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial \nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations \nand its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards \n(IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and in conformity with U.K. adopted international accounting standards.\n \n \nBasis for Opinion\n \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s \nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and \nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain \nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required \nto have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an \nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal \ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n \nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and \nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in \nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as \nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n \nCritical Audit Matter \n \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or \nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) \ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion \non the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion \non the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n \n \nF-1"

      "text": "Recognition of clinical trial and contracted manufacturing expenses\n \nDescription of the Matter \nAt December 31, 2022, the Company has recognized accruals for clinical trial and contracted manufacturing \nexpenses of £6.6 million and £0.4 million, respectively, and prepayments for clinical trials and contracted \nmanufacturing expenses of £1.8 million and £0.1 million, respectively. As disclosed in note 2 of the \nconsolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes clinical trial and contracted manufacturing \nexpenses in the statement of operations in the period in which they are incurred, which depends on \nmanagement’s assessment of the progress of clinical trials and third-party contracted manufacturing at the \nperiod end. \n\n \nAuditing the accounting for clinical trial and contracted manufacturing expenses was challenging due to the \njudgement and subjectivity involved in management’s assessment of the progress of clinical trial and \ncontracted manufacturing activities, relative to the costs incurred, to estimate the related accruals and \nprepayments, and the evaluation of the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the estimate.\n\n\n\n \nHow we addressed the matter in our \naudit\nTo assess the accounting for clinical trial and contracted manufacturing expenses our audit procedures \nincluded, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management to \nestimate costs incurred by inspecting the related contracts and amendments to the contracts with third-party \nservice providers. In order to assess the progress of clinical trials and third-party contracted manufacturing \nactivities at the period end our procedures included inquiry of research and development personnel regarding \nsuch progress and comparing third-party reports to the underlying contracts and change orders. We \nconsidered the consistency of materials reviewed by the Board of Directors’ regarding the status of clinical \ntrial and third-party contracted manufacturing activities with the judgements applied by management in \nrecording the accruals and prepayments.  We also inspected invoices received from third-party service \nproviders and compared payments to contracted billing milestones and contract change orders prior and \nsubsequent to December 31, 2022.\n \n \n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.\n \nEdinburgh, United Kingdom\nApril 4, 2023\n \nF-2"

      "text": "NUCANA PLC\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n \n \n1. General information\nNuCana plc (“NuCana” or the “Company”) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of new medicines to treat patients \nwith cancer. Nucana is harnessing the power of phosphoramidate chemistry to generate new medicines called ProTides. These compounds have the \npotential to improve cancer treatment by enhancing the efficacy and safety of several current standards of care.\n \nThe Company has had American Depository Shares (“ADSs”) registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and has been \nlisted on Nasdaq since October 2, 2017. The Company is incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Company’s \nregistered office is located at 77/78 Cannon Street, London EC4N 6AF, United Kingdom and its principal place of business is located at 3 Lochside Way, \nEdinburgh, EH12 9DT, United Kingdom.\nThe Company has three wholly owned subsidiaries, NuCana Limited, NuCana, Inc. and NuCana BioMed Trustee Company Limited. The financial \nstatements for the Company were authorized for issue by the board of directors on April 4, 2023.\n2. Significant accounting policies\nBasis of preparation\nThe financial statements have been prepared in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International \nAccounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and in conformity with U.K. adopted international accounting standards.\nThe Company’s financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2022. The financial \nstatements are presented in pounds sterling, which is also the Company’s functional currency. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand, except where \notherwise indicated.\n \nGoing concern\nIn common with many companies in the biopharmaceutical sector, the Company incurs significant expenditure in its early years as it researches and \ndevelops its potential products for market.\nThe Company’s board of directors, having reviewed the operating budgets and development plans for the 18 month period to June 30, 2024, \nconsiders that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. The board of directors is therefore satisfied that it is \nappropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents \nof £41.9 million at December 31, 2022 will be sufficient to fund its current operating plan for at least the next 12 months. \nAs the Company continues to incur losses, the transition to profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval and \ncommercialization of its product candidates and achieving a level of revenues adequate to support its cost structure. The Company may never achieve \nprofitability, and unless and until it does, it will continue to need to raise additional capital. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding \nwill be available on acceptable terms. \nCOVID-19\nThe Company continues to evaluate and assess the impact of COVID-19 on its operations and believes if there is a resurgence in COVID-19 that this \nwould potentially cause some delays to the timing and progress of its clinical trials.\nCOVID-19 has had no impact on the judgements and estimates used in the preparation of these financial statements.\n \nF-8"

Significant accounting policies (continued)\nJudgements and estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported \nfor assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the amounts reported for revenue and expenses during the year. The nature of estimations means that \nactual outcomes could differ from those estimates.\nThe following judgements have had the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements:\nResearch and development expenses\nThe Company recognizes research and development expenses in the statement of operations in the period in which they are incurred. When \ndevelopment activities reach the advanced stage, as set out in the specific criteria of International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 38, Intangible Assets, there \nwill be a requirement to capitalize such costs as intangible assets. Management will continue to exercise judgement in the appropriate treatment of research \nand development costs.\n \n \nTaxation\nManagement judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that should be recognized, based upon the likely timing and level \nof future taxable profits. Further details are contained in Note 7.\nThe following estimates have had the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements:\nRecognition of clinical trial expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we may be required to estimate accrued or prepaid expenses related to our \nclinical trials. In order to obtain reasonable estimates, we review open contracts and master service agreements. In addition, we communicate with \napplicable personnel in order to identify services that have been performed, but for which we have not yet been invoiced, and services not yet performed for \nwhich we have been invoiced in advance. In most cases, our vendors provide us with monthly invoices in arrears for services performed. The following are \nexamples of our accrued expenses: \n•\nfees paid to CROs for services performed on clinical trials; and \n•\npass-through costs for activities at clinical trial investigator sites.\nAccruals for clinical trial expenses, including estimated amounts recognized consistent with the above policy, were £6.6 million at December 31, \n2022 as compared to £7.2 million at December 31, 2021.\nPrepayments for clinical trial expenses, including estimated amounts recognized consistent with the above policy, were £1.8 million at December 31, \n2022 as compared to £1.5 million at December 31, 2021.  These amounts include sums that are expected to be utilized over the period of the associated \ntrials, which in some cases could be greater than one year.\n \nRecognition of contracted manufacturing expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we may be required to estimate accrued or prepaid expenses related to our \ncontracted manufacturing expenses. In order to obtain reasonable estimates, we review open contracts and master service agreements. In addition, we \nconsult with applicable personnel in order to identify services that have been performed and which have not yet been invoiced, and services not yet \nperformed for which we have been invoiced in advance. \nAccruals for contracted manufacturing expenses, including estimated amounts recognized consistent with the above policy, were £0.4 million at \nDecember 31, 2022 as compared to £0.1 million at December 31, 2021.\nPrepayments for contracted manufacturing expenses, including estimated amounts recognized consistent with the above policy, were £0.1 million at \nDecember 31, 2022 as compared to £0.1 million at December 31, 2021.\n \nF-9"

Significant accounting policies (continued)\nShare-based payments\nEstimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which depends on the \nterms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model, including the expected \nlife of the share option, historical volatility of the share price, dividend yield and assumptions about them, and the actual market value of an ordinary share \nin the Company at the date of grant. For the measurement of the fair value of equity-settled transactions at the grant date, the Company uses the Black-\nScholes model. The assumptions used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are detailed in Note 14.\n \nLegal proceedings\n The Company may be party to a number of litigation and other legal proceedings. The Company recognizes a provision for any cost reimbursement \ndue to other parties involved in the legal proceedings if a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event exists at the balance sheet date, it is \nprobable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reasonable estimate can be made of the amount of the \nobligation, even although the timing or amount of the liability is uncertain. The final amount of any cost reimbursement may be materially different to \nmanagement’s estimate. \nSimilarly, the Company recognizes an asset for any settlement or cost reimbursement in relation to the legal proceedings due to the Company if it is \nvirtually certain that the income will be received.\nWhere an outflow of economic resources is not probable or an inflow of economic resources is not virtually certain, the Company will disclose a \ncontingent liability or contingent asset, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had a provision of £4.1 million (2021: £nil) with respect to legal proceedings.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Company obtains control, and continue to be consolidated \nuntil the date when such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using \nconsistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealized gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are \neliminated in full.\nAssets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements \nfrom the date the Company gains control until the date the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.\n \n \nForeign currencies\n \nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is also the parent company’s functional currency. For each \ngroup entity, the Company determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that \nfunctional currency. \nTransactions and balances \n \nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Company’s entities at their respective functional currency spot rates of exchange at \nthe date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.\n \nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting \ndate. Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\n \nF-10"

The exchange \ndifferences arising on translation for consolidation are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income or loss.  \n \nSegment reporting\nThe Company operates in one operating segment. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the \nCompany’s chief operating decision maker (“the CODM”). The Company’s CODM, its Chief Executive Officer, views the Company’s operations and \nmanages its business as a single operating segment, which is the business of developing and commercializing ProTides for use in Oncology.  The \nCompany’s principal operations and decision-making functions are located in the United Kingdom from where global decisions are made.\nShare issue expenses \n \nIncremental costs incurred and directly attributable to the issuance of shares are deducted from the related proceeds of the issuance.

Further patents are granted in various jurisdictions to extend the territorial coverage of \nthe primary patent. These patents are granted up to the period of the related primary patent.  Costs are thus amortized over the remaining life of the relevant \nprimary patent. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the statements of operations as an administrative expense. \nThe amortization method and the amortization period for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year end. \nChanges in the expected useful economic life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for \nby changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate. \nIntangible assets are tested for impairment when there is an indicator of impairment.\nCash and cash equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position include cash at banks with deposit maturity terms of less than three months. \nOther assets\n          The Company provided a fixed euro deposit with respect to ongoing patent infringement litigation in Germany. The sum deposited is a monetary \nasset. Further details are contained in Note 10.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses are currently recognized in the statement of operations in the year in which they are incurred. Development \nexpenditures on an individual project will be recognized as an intangible asset when the Company can demonstrate:\n•\nthe technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale;\n•\nits intention to complete and its ability and intention to use or sell the asset;\n•\nhow the asset will generate future economic benefits;\n•\nthe availability of resources to complete the asset; and\n•\nthe ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development.\n \n \nIncome Taxes\nCurrent income tax\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates \nand tax laws used to compute the amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Company \noperates within the tax regime.\nDeferred income tax\nDeferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities \nand their carrying amounts in the Company’s financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition \nof an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or \nloss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the year end date and are expected to \napply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is \nprobable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.\nF-12"

Significant accounting policies (continued)\nIncome tax credit\nThe Company benefits from the U.K. and U.S. research and development tax credit regimes. In the United Kingdom, a portion of the Company’s \nlosses can be surrendered for a cash rebate of up to 33.35% of eligible expenditures incurred prior to April 1, 2023. This rate will reduce in respect of \nexpenditure incurred from April 1, 2023 onwards. In the U.S. the Company is able to offset the research and development credits against corporation tax \npayable. Such credits are accounted for within the tax provision in the year in which the expenditures are incurred.\n \nLeases \nThe Company assesses, at contract inception, whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of \nan identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nThe Company applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The \nCompany recognizes lease liabilities to make lease payments and right of use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.\nRight of use assets\nThe Company recognizes right of use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right of \nuse assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost \nof right of use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the \ncommencement date less any lease incentives received. Right of use assets, which relate solely to office space, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over \nthe shorter of the lease terms, which are between two and five years, or the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nLease liability\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognizes a lease liability measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over \nthe lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, and any variable lease payments that depend on an index. \n \nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the \ninterest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of the lease liability is increased to reflect the \naccretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of the lease liability is remeasured if there is a modification, \na change in the lease term or a change in the lease payments.\nThe Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease \nif it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\nThe Company has a number of lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Company applies judgement in evaluating \nwhether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an \neconomic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination. After the commencement date, the Company reassesses the lease term if there is a \nsignificant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate, \nsuch as the construction of significant leasehold improvements.\nRefer to Note 15 for information on potential future rental payments relating to periods following the exercise date of extension options that are not \nincluded in the lease liability.\nProvisions\nProvisions are recognized when either a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event exists at the balance sheet date, it is probable that \nan outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reasonable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation, even \nalthough the timing or amount of the liability is uncertain.\nF-13"

Significant accounting policies (continued)\n \nImpairment of non-financial assets\nThe Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, the Company \nestimates the recoverable amount of the asset.\nAn impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment \nlosses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\n \nA cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from \nother assets or groups of assets.\nCalculation of recoverable amount\nThe recoverable amount of assets and cash-generating units is the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in \nuse, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time \nvalue of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is \ndetermined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\nReversal of impairment\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication that a previously recognized impairment loss may no longer exist \nor may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.\nA previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount since \nthe last impairment loss was recognized. If that is the case, the carrying value is increased to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to \nthe extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no \nimpairment loss had been recognized.\n \nShare-based payments\nEmployees, directors and consultants of the Company receive remuneration in the form of share options, whereby individuals render services as \nconsideration for equity instruments and the cost is recognized as share-based payments under IFRS 2.\n \n \nUnder IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, equity share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Details \nregarding the determination of fair value of equity settled share-based transactions are set out in Note 14.\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of equity settled share-based payments, after adjusting for an assumed forfeiture rate, is expensed on a \nstraight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity to the share option reserve.\n \nF-14"

The Cardiff Agreement was renewed with an effective date of January 1, 2018 for \nan additional two years on substantially the same terms. In February 2020, we amended the Cardiff Agreement to expire at the end of 2020, which \namendment afforded us (at our sole discretion) an option to extend the expiration for one additional year until the end of 2021, and for further periods \nthereafter upon written agreement by the parties. In December 2020, we further amended the Cardiff Agreement to expire at the end of 2021. \nAt the end of 2021 we took the decision not to further extend the Cardiff Agreement. In December 2021 we served notice on Cardiff University and \nCardiff Consultants to extend the license of the ProTide-related intellectual property owned or controlled by Cardiff University as of the date of the Cardiff \nAgreement or owned or controlled by Cardiff University during the term of that Agreement, which we refer to as the Cardiff Intellectual Property, granted \nto NuCana under the Cardiff Agreement for a period of three months from expiry of the Cardiff Agreement on December 31, 2021 in order to continue \nevaluating additional ProTides generated under the Cardiff Agreement. The option to extend this license for a further three months from March 31, 2022 in \nexchange for making an additional payment to Cardiff University was not taken up.\nUnder the Cardiff Agreement, we collaborated with Cardiff University in the design, synthesis, characterization and evaluation of phosphoramidate \nprodrugs, which we refer to as ProTides, based on certain nucleosides. Cardiff University and Cardiff Consultants, which is a holder of intellectual property \ndeveloped by Cardiff University, have assigned to us all rights in the results of the research under the Cardiff Agreement.\nUpon our completion of the evaluation of the ProTides, we had the right to select one or more of the evaluated ProTides as candidates for potential \ndevelopment of a commercial product. Cardiff University and Cardiff Consultants have granted us an exclusive worldwide license to use for all purposes \nthe Cardiff intellectual property in respect of the nucleoside family of our selected ProTides. This license survives expiration of the Cardiff Agreement. \nDuring the license period Cardiff University and Cardiff Consultants may not undertake any research for any competing third party on nucleoside families \nof interest to us where such research would make use of the Cardiff intellectual property, or to grant rights in the Cardiff intellectual property to any third \nparty for use in connection with nucleosides of interest to us. \nOn our filing, or that of a sublicensee, of patent applications resulting from research under the Cardiff Agreement, we will owe Cardiff Consultants \ncertain immaterial payments. If we or our sublicensees develop and commercialize a product resulting from such research, we will owe Cardiff Consultants \nclinical development milestone payments of up to £1,875,000, provided that such milestone payments are due only with respect to the first product within \neach nucleoside family to achieve the milestone. We will also owe Cardiff Consultants royalties equal to a low-single digit percentage on our sales of a \nproduct resulting from such research.

For options with an estimated life of greater than three years, the underlying expected volatility was determined by using the \nhistorical volatility of similar listed entities as a proxy. The volatility percentage applied to each tranche is the average of the historical volatility of \ncomparable companies to the Company. Options granted with an estimated life of three years or less, have been valued using the Company’s own historical \nvolatility rates.\n \nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, an employee remuneration expense, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payments, of £4.3 \nmillion has been included in the statement of operations and credited to equity.\n \n \nF-30"

Financial instruments risk management (continued)\n \nCurrency Risk \nThe Company’s functional currency is U.K. pounds sterling, and our transactions are commonly denominated in that currency. However, a portion of \nexpenses are incurred in other currencies, primarily U.S. dollars, and are exposed to the effects of this exchange rate. \nAlthough the Company is based in the United Kingdom, it sources active pharmaceutical ingredient, raw materials, research and development, \nmanufacturing, consulting and other services worldwide, including from the United States, the European Union and India. Any weakening of the pound \nsterling against the currencies of such other jurisdictions makes the purchase of such goods and services more expensive for the Company. The Company \nseeks to minimize this exposure by maintaining currency cash balances at levels appropriate to meet foreseeable short to mid-term expenses in these other \ncurrencies. The Company thus holds a significant portion of cash and cash equivalents in U.S. dollars and will therefore report the impact of exchange rates \nmovements on these balances.\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to manage exchange rate exposure. \nFinancial assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, primarily held in U.S. dollars, are as follows:\n \n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n \n \n \n(in thousands)\n \n \n \nCarrying\namount\n   \nCarrying\namount\n \n \n \n£\n   \n£\n \nFinancial assets\n   \n     \n \nPrepayments, accrued income and other receivables\n   \n2,891    \n2,063 \nCurrent income tax receivable\n   \n1    \n4 \nCash and cash equivalents\n   \n27,924    \n41,371 \n \n \n     \n  \nFinancial liabilities\n \n     \n  \nTrade payables\n   \n727    \n773 \nPayroll taxes and social security\n   \n—    \n1 \nLease liabilities\n   \n132    \n55 \nAccrued expenditure\n   \n1,694    \n915 \n \nA 1% increase in the value of the U.K. pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar would reduce the carrying value of net financial assets and liabilities \nin foreign currencies by £283,000 (2021: £417,000).\n \nCredit risk\nThe Company actively manages cash and cash equivalents across a number of banks and has deposits with different maturity dates. The Company \nmonitors the credit rating of those banks.\nAll of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 were held at U.K. and U.S. financial institutions with short-term A-rated \ncredit ratings, as assessed by recognized international credit rating agencies.

The judgment is a post balance sheet adjusting event, so a provision of £3.0 million has been \nrecognized as at December 31, 2022 with respect to an estimate of the cost reimbursement due to Gilead.

As disclosed in Note 19, the \njudgment was a post balance sheet adjusting event, and a provision of £3.0 million has been recognized as at December 31, 2022 with respect to an estimate \nof the cost reimbursement due to Gilead.\nIn 2018, the Company was granted a European patent from the EPO, EP 190, that covers the composition of matter of a genus of phosphoramidate \nnucleotide compounds that includes sofosbuvir, sold under the brand name Sovaldi®, a leading drug for the treatment of hepatitis C sold by Gilead \nSciences, Inc. Later in 2018, Gilead filed an Opposition to EP 190 at the EPO in an attempt to revoke it. In February 2021, the EPO Opposition Division \ndisagreed with Gilead and upheld amended patent claims that cover sofosbuvir. In June 2021, the decision by the EPO Opposition Division to uphold EP \n190 was appealed by Gilead to the EPO Technical Boards of Appeal. The Company also filed an appeal to the EPO Technical Boards of Appeal against the \ndecision by the EPO Opposition Division to only allow the patent in an amended form. On March 24, 2023, the EPO Technical Board of Appeal issued an \noral decision revoking EP 190. The decision is final and has retroactive effect. Following this decision, the Company has reassessed its estimate of the \noutcome and financial effect of the patent infringement proceedings in Germany and, as disclosed in Note 19, has recognized a provision of £1.1 million at \nDecember 31, 2022 with respect to an estimate of the cost reimbursement due to Gilead.\n \nF-38"
