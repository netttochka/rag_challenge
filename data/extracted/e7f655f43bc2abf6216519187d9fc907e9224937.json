Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” \n“believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “projects,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will \nlikely result,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and \nassumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from \nthose reflected in forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in our actual \nresults include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this 2022 Form 10-K, and in particular, the risks discussed \nunder the caption “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and those discussed in other documents we file with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place \nundue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update forward-looking \nstatements, except as required by law.\nMarket and Industry Data\nSome of the market and industry data contained in this 2022 Form 10-K is based on independent industry \npublications or other publicly available information. Although we believe that these independent sources are reliable, \nwe have not independently verified and cannot assure you as to the accuracy or completeness of this information. As \na result, you should be aware that the market and industry data contained herein, and our beliefs and estimates based \non such data, may not be reliable.\nOur Company\nRumbleOn is the nation’s first, largest, and only publicly-traded, technology-based platform in the powersports \nindustry. Headquartered in the Dallas Metroplex, RumbleOn is revolutionizing the customer experience for outdoor \nenthusiasts across the country and making powersport vehicles accessible to more people in more places than ever \nbefore. We are transforming the powersports customer experience by giving consumers what they want — a wide \nselection, great value and quality, transparency, and an easy, friction-free transaction. Every element of our business, \nfrom inventory procurement to fulfillment to overall ease of transactions, whether online or on-site at one of our \n55 retail locations, has been built for a singular purpose — to create a customer experience without peer in the \npowersports industry.\nAlthough our primary focus is on the customer experience and building market share in the powersports \nindustry, during 2022 we participated in the wholesale automotive industry through our wholly-owned distributors \nof used automotive inventory, Wholesale, Inc. (“Wholesale Inc”) and our exotics retailer AutoSport USA, Inc., \nwhich does business under the name Got Speed. In the third quarter of 2022, we announced we would be winding \ndown our wholesale automotive business, which we expect to complete during the first half of 2023. Our logistics \nservices company, Wholesale Express, LLC (“Wholesale Express”), provides freight brokerage services facilitating \ntransportation for dealers and consumers."

      "text": "2\nIncorporated in Nevada in 2013, we have been building the RumbleOn brand and vision since 2016. Led by \nour co-founder, chairman, and Chief Executive Officer Marshall Chesrown, we have achieved and built upon key \nmilestones:\n• \nApril 2017: launched RumbleOn.com.\n• \nOctober 2017: celebrated our initial listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n• \nOctober 2018: acquired Wholesale Inc and Wholesale Express.\n• \nAugust 2021: acquired the RideNow companies (the “RideNow Transaction”), a collection of 41 retail \npowersports locations with a geographic footprint spanning primarily the Sunbelt.\n• \nSeptember 2021: processed the first powersports vehicle through our Orlando Fulfillment Center.\n• \nFebruary 2022: completed the initial funding of our captive consumer finance facility, RumbleOn \nFinance.\n• \nFebruary 2022: acquired Freedom Powersports (the “Freedom Transaction”), adding ten retail locations \nin North Texas, one in Alabama, and two in Georgia.\n• \nFebruary 2022: unveiled the regional management structure, anchored by tenured team members of \nRideNow.\n• \nSeptember 2022: opened our Fulfillment Center in Concord, North Carolina.\n• \nNovember 2022: acquired Powersports Honda franchise in North Texas.\n• \nDecember 2022: acquired two full line Polaris franchises in North Texas.\n• \nJanuary 2023: opened our Fulfillment Center in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n• \nFebruary 2023: acquired Red Hills powersports, a single retail location representing 10 brands, in \nTallahassee, Florida.\n• \nMarch 2023: entered into an engagement letter with J.P. Morgan to review our balance sheet initiatives \nand options.\nThese key events well-position RumbleOn as the first mover in transforming the powersports industry through \nour customer experience focused, technology based, Omnichannel platform.\nOur Industry and Opportunity\nWe operate primarily in the powersports industry, offering significant scale and breadth of products and \nour platform from which we will provide our only of its kind powersports customer experience. From our view, \npowersports includes motorcycles, side-by-sides, ATV, UTV, snowmobile, and personal watercraft (“PWC”) along \nwith related parts and components. If you add in the largely unaccounted for but significant peer-to-peer market \nin used powersports, which RumbleOn believes represents up to 70% of used powersports transactions, the total \naddressable powersports market is likely in excess of $100 billion.\nThe powersports marketplace in the United States is highly fragmented. We face competition from traditional \nfranchised dealers who sell both new and used vehicles; independent used powersports dealers; online and mobile \nsales platforms; and private parties. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are delivering an \noutstanding consumer experience, competitive sourcing of quality inventory, breadth and depth of product selection, \nand value pricing.\nOur competitors vary in size and breadth of their product offerings. We believe that our principal competitive \nadvantages in powersports sales include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the buying \nexperience by virtue of our platform. We provide customers the opportunity to experience RumbleOn’s offerings \nonline, in-store, and through our mobile app, or any combination of those three options. Our ability to make a cash \noffer to purchase a vehicle with our customer-friendly purchase process, and our breadth of selection of the most \npopular makes and models available online and in-store provides competitive sourcing and sales."

      "text": "3\nRumbleOn’s Solution — Creating the Future of Powersports\nRumbleOn is creating a best-in-class experience in powersports for our customers. Doing so requires offering \nunmatched choice and selection and replicating an outstanding customer experience throughout the lifecycle of \npowersports ownership, one customer and one transaction at a time.\nCustomers come to RumbleOn’s 55 retail locations as well as our more than 60 websites to shop for new \nand highest-quality used powersports products as well as for parts, accessories and merchandise. We address the \nentire powersports market. We are reimagining and revolutionizing the customer experience on our technology-led, \ninternet-based platforms, and we are doing so for everyone — from the powersports enthusiast to the novice, and \neveryone in between — with a focus on four key initiatives:\nRumbleOn’s Platform to Revolutionize the Customer Experience\nRumbleOn’s platform offers the consumer the fastest, easiset and most transparent transaction online or in store\nPowersports Lifetime\nCustomer Experience\nBest Selection of\nHigh-Quality Inventory\nPremier Destination\nfor Powersports\n• \nCreating an end-to-end ownership experience means we are not focused solely on the initial \ntransaction with a customer. Rather, our customer experience enables building lifelong connectivity to \neach customer. With each customer interaction, we focus on key touch points that continue to keep our \ncustomers engaged throughout their powersports ownership experience. Quality assurance, clear and \nconsistent pricing, professional pickup and delivery, customization, after sales service, and guarantees \nare just a few of the ways we are building a reliable and consistent customer experience. Our offerings, \nand our entire customer experience, are designed to turn a single transaction into a lifetime relationship.\n• \nProviding the largest and best selection of highest-quality inventory enables us to provide many \nofferings to all powersports customers coast to coast. We are well-positioned to acquire high-quality \nused vehicles through the strength of our online Cash Offer Tool, a unique and important competitive \nadvantage for RumbleOn. Affording our customers the ability to visit a retail location and receive \ncash for their used powersports unit instantaneously gives them peace of mind, and provides us the \nopportunity to drive a meaningful amount of incremental used inventory onto our platform. We are also \nleveraging robust data from the Cash Offer Tool and from the information acquired from our acquisitions \nand now being gathered from our 55 RideNow Powersports retail locations to ensure that the right \nvehicle is in the right place at the right time — with the right price.\n• \nBuilding the premier destination for new and used powersports vehicles and introducing more \nused inventory to our showrooms as well as online attracts new customers to our platform and, most \nimportantly, new riders to the industry due to affordability. We are focused on both new and used, \nretail sales, however, the opportunity to dramatically increase the number of used powersports unit \nsales presents our greatest near-term opportunity, as new vehicle inventory supply normalizes. We can \nbetter control used inventory than new because used is not dependent on a manufacturer’s production, \nallocation, or distribution constraints. In fact, our broad access to used inventory is — and will continue \nto be — an important differentiator for RumbleOn in any market environment.\nOur Growth Strategies\nThe key metric to our powersports business is retail vehicle unit sales, both online and in-store. Unit sales \ndrives revenue and provides the opportunity to build additional revenue through financing, parts, merchandise, and \naccessories, each of which are higher margin revenue streams. As we scale our business, we will create additional \nopportunities to expand revenue streams. However, additional revenue opportunities begin with retail vehicle unit \nsales and, as a result, our growth strategy is focused on this metric.\nOur ability to increase vehicle unit sales is a function of our market penetration in existing markets, the \nnumber of markets we operate in, and our ability to build and maintain our brands by offering great value, \ntransparency, and an outstanding customer experience."

      "text": "4\nOptimize Our Inventory Selection and Centralization\nWe continue to optimize and broaden the selection of new and used powersports vehicles we make available to \nour customers. Expanding our inventory selection enhances the customer experience by ensuring each visitor, either \nonline or in-store, finds a vehicle that matches his or her preferences. Optimizing our new inventory significantly \ndepends on continuing our outstanding relationships with our manufacturers (“OEM”). As a result of these \nrelationships, during 2022, we added 60 new franchises to our retail locations, primarily organically, and including \nthree key tuck-in acquisitions in our North Texas market. Optimizing our used inventory selection depends on our \nability to source and acquire enough high-quality used vehicles, and our ability to use data to ensure each used \nvehicle is at the right place, at the right time, at the right price.\nWe continue implementing our fulfillment strategy with near real-time inventory replenishment to make \nthe right powersports units available in the right quantities at the right locations. This centralization of inventory \nwill launch company-wide virtual selling through access to all company-owned inventory rather than only those \nvehicles that might be available at an individual location. Fulfillment will increase the probability that our customers \ncan find their powersports unit of choice on our platform, thereby enhancing the customer experience while \neliminating geographic boundaries. With digital inventory integration and over 60 individual websites sharing \ncontent and increasing available data, RumbleOn will be top-of-mind for powersports searches. All of the technology \ninfrastructure required has been launched or is under development and will be implemented throughout 2023 and \nbeyond.\nContinue to Innovate and Extend Our Technology Leadership\nWe continue expanding our competitive dominance with leading-edge technology. From our founding, we have \nbeen laying the groundwork to offer a friction-free and fully integrated customer experience both online and in-store. \nWe are building the technology engine to enable this integration, while methodically expanding our retail footprint, \ndriving towards online selling without geographic boundaries. With this goal in mind, we intend to launch our \nnew corporate website under the RumbleOn brand during the first half of 2023 and our all new RideNow-branded \nwebsite later in the second quarter of 2023. Our RideNow website will have unmatched features for our customers, \nallowing them to see all inventory in one place and it will have the ability to push inventory to individual dealer \nwebsites, resulting in a better online presence and customer experience. The plan calls for the constant roll out of \nnew features, as our online presence improves and matures. In conjunction with our integrated CRM, we plan to \nlaunch online soft and hard credit pulls and lending pre-qualifications, just to name a few of the exciting features. \nLastly, in the first half of 2023, we intend to roll out a new internally developed reporting technology that will \nincrease visibility across our enterprise, improve sales reporting, and provide real time actionable data at the store \nlevel. Store managers will now see how they are performing versus expectations and how they compare in real time \nwith their peers across the country.\nFrom the start of RumbleOn, one key differentiator and a lynch pin to the competitive advantage we have built \nin powersports is our Cash Offer Tool, which supplies proprietary data for thousands of unique Vehicle Identification \nNumber (VIN) inputs. In addition to actual retail sales and transaction data from the acquired RideNow and Freedom \nPowersports’ databases. Marrying this data creates a data-driven “market maker” that does not exist in the industry \ntoday. Integrating real-time pricing and sales data from in-store transactions will also enable us to further optimize \noffers and pricing.\nWe will continue to make significant investments in improving and adding to our online customer offering, \nsubject to our performance and available operating cash flow as we intend to self-fund these initiatives. We believe \nthat the complexity of the traditional powersports retail transaction provides substantial opportunity for our planned \ntechnology investments and that our leadership and continued growth will enable us to invest responsibly in further \nenhancing the customer experience.\nEnhancing Our In-store Experience\nBeyond innovative technology and inventory integration, we use our retail locations to augment the \nonline experience- and vice versa — to offer a simple, friction-free customer experience. A key component to \ntransforming the customer experience to support our growth strategy is enhancing the in-store experience and we \nare strategically expanding our geographic retail footprint. In early 2022, we added 13 additional retail locations,"

In addition, during the first quarter of 2023, we acquired an important multi-line retail location in \nTallahassee, Florida, further expanding our dominance in North Florida.

We believe any great customer experience in powersports begins with great people \nproviding consumers the opportunity to fulfill their passion. From our executive team to our customer facing \nprofessionals to our back-office and corporate personnel, the RumbleOn team is singularly focused on transforming \nthe customer experience in powersports, both online and in-store. As we expand our physical presence, whether \nthrough new retail locations or as we build out our fulfillment centers, finding great people who believe in our \nmission is key.\nIdentifying Desired Locations. We believe desired geography means more than finding new markets; it also \nmeans making sure we can put the right powersports vehicle in the right place at the right price to maximize our \nreturn on the asset. This is a key goal of our fulfillment centers. And of course, we are always looking for strategic \nacquisition candidates, whether a large group such as Freedom Powersports or a key tuck-in opportunity to improve \nthe capabilities of an existing location.\nImplementing Appropriate Brand Mix. Powersports retail provides the opportunity to put many different new \nbrands under one roof along with the proper mix of used inventory. Of course, having that opportunity and taking \nadvantage of that opportunity correctly are two different things. Our outstanding relationships with our OEMs have \nprovided us the opportunity to organically add more than 60 new franchises to our existing retail locations. And we \ncontinue leveraging our used inventory sourcing advantage to keep our retail locations fully stocked with the right \nmix of preferred brands based on data and market share, and thereby further enhance the customer experience.\nA fourth consideration also plays a role as we enhance our in-store experience through organic and acquisitive \ngrowth: any such investments remain subject to a prudent use of our financial and other resources based on our \nperformance and our available cash from operations as we intend to self-fund our growth."

During 2022, we began rolling out the “RideNow Powersports” brand across all our retail locations \nand the foundation will be our technology, our infrastructure, and our corporate culture. We are in the early stages of \nthis rollout, and we are encouraged by the impact on performance and the excitement it has clearly created.\nRumbleOn Technology\nInnovative technology continues to underpin every endeavor at RumbleOn through our ongoing mission to \ndisrupt the powersports industry and our focus on the customer experience. We leverage technology and data to \ndrive change. At a high-level, we believe there are five main areas where leveraging these innovations provides \nus a competitive advantage and improves the customer experience: (1) our proprietary supply chain pricing and \ndistribution software; (2) our Omnichannel and mobile-first web application; (3) centralized CRM and Inventory; \n(4) Dealer network support channels; and (5) Data warehousing & reporting, enterprise wide.\n(1) \nRumbleOn’s proprietary supply chain and distribution software:\n• \nLooks at the overall supply chain and reconfigures inventory for the purpose of acquisition and \ndistribution.

Sales and traffic are typically slowest in the winter quarter but increase typically in the spring \nseason, coinciding with tax refunds and improved weather conditions. Given this seasonality, we expect our quarterly \nresults of operations, including our revenue, gross profit, net income (loss), and cash flow to vary accordingly. Over \ntime, we expect to normalize to seasonal trends, using data and logistics to move inventory to the right place, at the \nright time, at the right price.\nGovernment Regulation\nVarious aspects of our business are or may be subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal and state laws \nand regulations. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our \nability to do business in affected jurisdictions or the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, including \nfines or the award of significant damages against us and our dealers in class action or other civil litigation.\nVehicle Sales. Our sale and purchase of vehicles, both new and pre-owned, related products and services, \nand third-party finance products, are subject to the state and local dealer licensing requirements in the jurisdictions \nin which we have retail or wholesale locations. Regulators of jurisdictions where our customers reside, but in which \nwe do not have a dealer or financing license could require that we obtain a license or otherwise comply with various \nstate regulations. Despite our belief that we are not subject to the licensing requirements of those jurisdictions \nin which we do not have a physical presence, regulators may seek to impose punitive fines for operating without \na license or demand we seek a license in those jurisdictions, any of which may inhibit our ability to do business \nin those jurisdictions, increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of \noperations.\nConsumer Finance. The financing we offer customers is subject to federal and state laws regulating \nthe advertising and provision of consumer finance options, the collection of consumer credit and financial \ninformation, along with requirements related to online payments and electronic funds transfers, the regulations \nand state licenses applicable depend upon whether RumbleOn Finance or a third-party is the entity extending \ncredit to such customers. Most states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, \ncaps on certain fees, or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states require that finance companies \nfile a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate \ninstallment sales in that state.\nLogistics and Transportation. Our Wholesale Express logistics operations, which brokers and facilitates the \ntransportation of vehicles primarily between and among dealers, is subject to motor-carrier rules and regulations \npromulgated by the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the states through which their \ncustomers’ vehicles are transported. Additionally, the vendors whom Wholesale Express relies upon are subject to \nfederal and state regulation concerning transport vehicle dimensions, transport vehicle conditions, driver motor \nvehicle record history, driver alcohol and drug testing, and driver hours of service. More restrictive limitations on \nvehicle weight and size, condition, trailer length and configuration, methods of measurement, driver qualifications, \nor driver hours of service may increase the costs charged to Wholesale Express by its vendors, which may adversely \naffect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. If we fail to comply with the DOT regulations or \nif those regulations become more stringent, we could be subject to increased inspections, audits, or compliance \nburdens. Regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines, suspending, or shutting down \nour Wholesale Express operations.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental \nlaws and regulations that pertain to our operations. The regulations concern material storage, air quality, waste \nhandling, and water pollution control. The regulations also regulate our use and operation of gasoline storage tanks, \ngasoline dispensing equipment, oil tanks, and paint booths among other things. Our business involves the use, \nhandling, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, including motor oil, gasoline, solvents, lubricants, paints, \nand other substances. We manage our compliance through permitting and operational control."

Our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating \nto environmental protection and health and safety, and our employment practices are subject to various laws and \nregulations, including complex federal, state, and local wage and hour and anti-discrimination laws. We may also be \nliable for employee misconduct and violations of laws or regulations to which we are subject.\nFederal Advertising Regulations. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has authority to take actions \nto remedy or prevent advertising practices that it considers to be unfair or deceptive and that affect commerce in \nthe United States. If the FTC takes the position in the future that any aspect of our business constitutes an unfair \nor deceptive advertising practice, responding to such allegations could require us to pay significant damages, \nsettlements, and civil penalties, or could require us to make adjustments to our products and services, any or all of \nwhich could result in substantial adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, \nand decreased profitability.\nFederal Antitrust Laws. The antitrust laws prohibit, among other things, any joint conduct among \ncompetitors that would lessen competition in the marketplace. Some of the information that we may obtain \nfrom dealers may be sensitive and, if disclosed inappropriately, could impede competition or otherwise diminish \nindependent pricing activity. A governmental or private civil action alleging the improper exchange of information, \nor unlawful participation in price maintenance or other unlawful or anticompetitive activity, even if unfounded, could \nbe costly to defend and adversely impact our ability to maintain and grow our business.\nIn addition, governmental or private civil actions related to the antitrust laws could result in orders suspending \nor terminating our ability to do business or otherwise altering or limiting certain of our business practices, including \nthe manner in which we handle or disclose pricing information, or the imposition of significant civil or criminal \npenalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us in class action or other civil litigation.\nOther. In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business, we are also \nsubject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and the listing rules \nof The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”). The violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in \nadministrative, civil, or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist order against our business operations, any \nof which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of \noperations. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply \nwith these laws and regulations.\nThe foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, \nand the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to continuous change. The enactment of new \nlaws and regulations or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations in an unfavorable way may affect \nthe operation of our business, directly or indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance \ncosts, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, \nincreased expenses, and decreased profitability. Further, investigations by government agencies, including \nthe FTC, into allegedly anticompetitive, unfair, deceptive or other business practices by us, could cause us to \nincur additional expenses and, if adversely concluded, could result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and \nsignificant legal liability.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,717 full time and 84 part-time employees.\nAvailable Information\nOur Internet website is www.rumbleon.com.

You should carefully \nconsider the risks described below, together with the financial and other information contained in this 2022 \nForm 10-K and in our other public disclosures. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, \nresults of operations, cash flows, or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, our future \nresults could differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations \nfor future financial performance and the trading price of our Class B common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to \neffectively remediate this material weakness and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial \nreporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, investors \ncould lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business.\nWe are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”). Section 404 of SOX \nrequires public companies to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting (“ICOFR”). In particular, \nwe must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our ICOFR allowing management to report on the \neffectiveness of our ICOFR. In addition, we are required to have our independent registered public accounting \nfirm attest to the effectiveness of our ICOFR. The standard of effectiveness for ICOFR is that we have controls and \nprocedures in place that provide “reasonable assurance that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely \nbasis.” This process of implementation, evaluation, and attestation is costly and time-consuming. We have hired and \nmay need to continue to employ both internal and external resources with appropriate public company experience \nand technical accounting knowledge to maintain and evaluate our ICOFR.\nIn our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”), we \nidentified material weaknesses in our ICOFR relating to our legacy RumbleOn operations. As discussed in this 2022 \nForm 10-K, we have remediated and subsequently tested the impacted controls and have determined that the material \nweaknesses identified in the 2021 Form 10-K have been remediated as of December 31, 2022. In addition, as \ndiscussed in this 2022 Form 10-K, we identified a material weakness in our ICOFR for the year ended December 31, \n2022 relating to our control environment following the integration of the RideNow business and incorporation \nof the acquired business into the Company’s control environment. If we are unable to effectively remediate this \nmaterial weakness and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may fail to prevent or detect \nmaterial misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and \ncompleteness of our financial statements.\nWe have incurred significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect us, including our business flexibility, and \nwill increase our interest expense.\nIn connection with the RideNow Transaction and Freedom Transaction, we substantially increased \nindebtedness which has had and will continue to have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility \nto respond to changing business and economic conditions and substantially increasing our interest expense. The \nincreased levels of indebtedness, including the applicable interest payments, could also reduce funds available \nfor working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes, and may create competitive \ndisadvantages for us relative to competitors with lower debt levels. If our financial performance does not meet our \ncurrent expectations, then our ability to service the indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our floorplan payables, revolving credit facility, and our \nother debt instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur floorplan payables, revolving credit facility, and other debt instruments are subject to variable interest \nrates. Accordingly, our interest expense will fluctuate with changing market conditions and will increase if interest \nrates rise. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of our \nfinancial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit our access to capital markets and \nincrease our financing costs. In addition, our net new inventory carrying cost (new vehicle floorplan interest expense \nnet of floorplan assistance that we receive from powersports manufacturers) may increase due to changes in interest"

We cannot assure you that a significant increase in interest rates \nor decrease in manufacturer floorplan assistance would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe powersports industry is sensitive to unfavorable changes in general economic conditions and various other \nfactors that could affect demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, our ability to implement our strategy and our results of operations.\nOur future performance will be impacted by general economic conditions including among other things: \nchanges in employment levels; consumer demand, preferences and confidence levels; the availability and cost of \ncredit; fuel prices; levels of discretionary personal income; inflation; and interest rates. Recently, inflation has \nincreased throughout the U.S. economy. Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of labor, fuel and \nother costs as well as by reducing demand for powersports vehicles. In addition, rapid changes in fuel prices can \ncause shifts in consumer preferences which are difficult to accommodate given the long lead-time of inventory \nacquisition. Inflation is also often accompanied by higher interest rates, which could reduce the fair value of our \noutstanding debt obligations. Changes in interest rates can also significantly impact new and used vehicle sales and \nvehicle affordability due to the direct relationship between interest rates and monthly loan payments, a critical factor \nfor many powersports buyers, and the impact interest rates have on customers’ borrowing capacity and disposable \nincome. We have experienced, and continue to experience, increases in the prices of labor, fuel, and other costs of \nproviding service.\nPowersports consumers may not accept our transformative business model.\nAs described throughout this 2022 Form 10-K, we are transforming the traditional powersports customer \nexperience and building the first and only true Omnichannel experience in the industry. Also, in building this \nOmnichannel experience, we expect to incur significant expenses and face various other challenges, such as \nexpanding our customer experience team and building out a fulfillment and logistics network. If customers do \nnot accept our products, services, and offerings we may not benefit from the investments needed to build this \ntransformative customer experience to the extent anticipated or at all. Any of these risks, if realized, could materially \nand adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to acquire the number of vehicles to satisfy consumer demand or our expectations for the \nbusiness.\nA material part of our plan is predicated on being able to have sufficient inventory, both new and used, to \nsatisfy customer demand or meet our financial objectives. New inventory is ultimately controlled by our OEMs \nand their willingness to allocate inventory to us and their ability to manufacture and distribute a sufficient \nnumber of vehicles given the ongoing environment of manufacturing slowdowns, computer chip shortages, and \nlogistic/transportation challenges (collectively, the “Demand/Supply Imbalances”). Used inventory is acquired \ndirectly from consumers via our online Cash Offer Tool or consumer trade-in transactions. If the channels for new \nor used vehicle acquisition were disrupted, for example as a result of another COVID-like lockdown, technology \nchallenges, non-acceptance of online transactions, poor customer ratings, or other such events, the Company may not \nhave enough inventory to meet customer demand, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and \nresults of operations.\nWe may require additional financing or capital to pursue our growth challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If \nfinancing or capital is not available on terms acceptable to us or at all, we may not be able to develop and grow \nour business as anticipated and our business, operating results, and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe intend to continue making investments to support the development and growth of our business. Additional \nfinancing or capital may not be available when we need it, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nAlthough we intend to self-fund our growth initiatives, if we determine to raise additional capital through \nissuances of equity or debt, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities \nwe issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock.

We may not generate sufficient revenue and we may incur significant losses in the future for several reasons, \nincluding a lack of demand for our products and services, increasing competition, and weakness in the powersports \nindustry generally. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays, relating to the \ndevelopment and operation of our business, as well as our organic and acquisition growth strategies. Accordingly, we \nmay not be able to successfully develop, grow, and expand our business, generate revenue, or achieve and maintain \nprofitability.\nWe have and may continue to acquire strategic retail locations and other complementary businesses and \ntechnologies, which could divert management’s attention, and otherwise disrupt our operations and impact our \noperating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business in response to the demands of consumers, \nother constituents within the powersports industry, and competitive pressures. In the past, we have met these \ndemands in part by acquiring complementary businesses and technologies.\nThe identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult; time-consuming, and costly, and we may \nnot be able to successfully complete identified acquisition opportunities. The risks we face in connection with our \nacquisition strategy include:\n• \ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition \nintegration challenges;\n• \nintegration of the acquired company’s accounting, management information, human resources, and other \nadministrative systems;\n• \ncoordination of technology, research and development, and sales and marketing functions;\n• \nretention of employees from the acquired company;\n• \ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our \norganization;\n• \nthe need to implement or improve controls, procedures, and policies at a business that before the \nacquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures, and policies;\n• \npotential write-offs of intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse \neffect on our operating results in a given period; and\n• \nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition.\nOur failure to address these risks or other matters encountered in connection with future acquisitions and \ninvestments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause \nus to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. As discussed in the preceding risk factors \nelsewhere in this 2022 Form 10-K, we currently intend to self-fund our growth initiatives, and acquisition growth. \nNevertheless, some future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of \ndebt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or the impairment of goodwill, any of which could harm our \nfinancial condition."

We \nmay not be able to accomplish the integration process smoothly, successfully, or on a timely basis, which may \nresult in unforeseen expenses or the failure to recognize the anticipated benefits of acquired businesses. The \nnecessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems of controls, and facilities, in addition \nto addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures, and management philosophies \nmay increase the difficulties of integration. Companies operate numerous systems and controls, including those \ninvolving management information, accounting and finance, legal and regulatory compliance, inventory intake \nand control, sales, billing, employee benefits, and payroll. The integration of an acquired company’s operations \nrequires the dedication of significant internal and external resources, which may divert management’s attention from \nthe day-to-day business of the company and be costly. Employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration \nprocess may also disrupt the business of the Company. Any inability of management to successfully and timely \nintegrate an acquired company could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the \nCompany and result in not achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nTo the extent we acquire additional businesses, we may incur substantial costs.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring costs associated with our \nacquisitions. The substantial majority of these non-recurring costs will consist of transaction and regulatory costs \nrelated to acquisitions. We will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing \nintegration plans, including system consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the \nmagnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred from the acquisitions and integration. \nAlthough we anticipate that the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies and \nsynergies related to the integration should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may \nnot be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract, and integrate \nqualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our success will depend on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees, including \nMarshall Chesrown, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In addition, the loss of any senior management, \nregional operations directors, or other key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our \nbusiness plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all.

We believe that annual and \nquarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an \nindication of our future performance.\nThe failure to develop and maintain our brands could harm our reputation among current customers or adversely \nimpact our ability to attract new customers.\nDeveloping and maintaining the RideNow and RumbleOn brands will depend largely on the success of our \nefforts to maintain the trust of and deliver value to our users. If our current and potential users perceive that we are \nnot focused on providing them with a better pre-owned powersports experience, our reputation and the strength of \nour brand will be adversely affected.\nConsumers are increasingly shopping for new and used vehicles, vehicle repair and maintenance services, and \nother vehicle products and services online and through mobile applications, including through third-party online and \nmobile sales platforms, with which we compete. If we fail to preserve the value of our retail brands, maintain our \nreputation, or attract consumers to our Omnichannel offering, our business could be adversely impacted.\nComplaints or negative publicity about our business practices, our marketing and advertising campaigns, \nour compliance with applicable laws and regulations, data privacy and security issues, and other aspects of our \nbusiness, irrespective of their validity, could diminish users’ confidence in and the use of our products and services \nand adversely affect our brands. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop, maintain, or enhance our \nbrands, and failure to do so would harm our business growth prospects and operating results.\nThe success of our business relies heavily on our marketing and branding efforts, especially with respect to our \nRideNow brand at retail locations, the RideNow and RumbleOn websites, and our branded mobile applications, \nand these efforts may not be successful.\nWe believe that an important component of our development and growth will be the business derived from \nthe RideNow retail brand and the RumbleOn website and branded mobile applications. Because RideNow and \nRumbleOn are consumer brands, we rely heavily on marketing and advertising to increase the visibility of this brand \nwith potential users of our products and services.\nOur business model relies on our ability to scale rapidly and to decrease incremental user acquisition costs as \nwe grow. Some of our methods of marketing and advertising may not be profitable because they may not result in \nthe acquisition of sufficient users visiting our website and mobile applications such that we may recover these costs \nby attaining corresponding revenue growth. If we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through \nincreases in user traffic and in the number of transactions by users of our platform, it could have a material adverse \neffect on our growth, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on Internet search engines to drive traffic to our website, and if we fail to appear prominently in the \nsearch results, our traffic would decline, and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on Internet search engines and social media such as Google™, Bing™, and Facebook™ to \ndrive traffic to our website. For example, when a user searches the internet for a particular type of powersports or \nrecreational vehicle, we will rely on a high organic search ranking of our webpages in these search results to refer \nthe user to our website. However, our ability to obtain such high, non-paid search result rankings is not within our \ncontrol. Our competitors’ Internet search engine and social media efforts may result in their websites receiving a \nhigher search result page ranking than ours, or Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way \nthat would adversely affect our search result rankings. If Internet search engines or social media companies modify \ntheir search algorithms or display technologies in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ efforts are \nmore successful than ours, overall growth in our user base could slow or our user base could decline. Internet search \nengine providers could provide recreation vehicle dealer and pricing information directly in search results, align \nwith our competitors or choose to develop competing services. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our \nwebsite through Internet search engines could harm our business and operating results."

There may be some instances in which we use this information to collect a transaction fee from \nthose dealers and recognize revenue from the related transactions.\nFrom time to time, we may experience interruptions in one or more data feeds that we receive from third-party \ndata providers, in a manner that affects our ability to operate our business. These interruptions may occur for a \nnumber of reasons, including changes to the software used by these data feed providers and difficulties in renewing \nour agreements with third-party data feed providers. Additionally, when an interruption ceases, we may not always \nbe able to collect the appropriate fees and any such shortfall in revenue could be material to our operating results.\nOur ability to grow our complementary product offerings may be limited, which could negatively impact our \ndevelopment, growth, revenue, and financial performance.\nAs we introduce or expand additional offerings to our platform, such as recreation vehicle trade-ins, lead \nmanagement, transaction processing, financing, maintenance, and insurance, we may incur losses or otherwise fail \nto enter these markets successfully. Our expansion into these markets may place us in competitive and regulatory \nenvironments with which we are unfamiliar and involves various risks, including the need to invest significant \nresources and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved for several years, if at all. In \nattempting to establish such new product offerings, we may incur significant expenses and face various other \nchallenges, such as expanding our sales force and management personnel to cover these markets and complying with \ncomplicated regulations that apply to these markets.

Further, vehicle manufacturers \ncan and do take actions that influence the markets for new and pre-owned vehicles. For example, introduction of \nnew models with significantly different functionality, technology, or other customer satisfiers can result in increased \nsupply of pre-owned vehicles, and a corresponding decrease in price of pre-owned vehicles. Also, while historically \nmanufacturers have taken steps designed to balance production volumes for new vehicles with demand, those steps \nhave not always proven effective.

Some of these \ncompanies have significantly greater resources than we do and may be able to provide customers access to a greater \ninventory of vehicles at lower prices or purchase vehicles from consumers at higher prices while delivering a \ncompetitive overall experience.\nOur competitors may also impede our ability to reach consumers in certain jurisdictions. For example, our \ncompetitors may increase their search engine optimization efforts and outbid us for search terms on various search \nengines.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and \nother resources than we have, and the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and support \nof their products and services. Additionally, they may have more extensive industry relationships, longer operating \nhistories, and greater name recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond \nmore quickly with new technologies and to undertake more extensive marketing or promotional campaigns. If \nwe are unable to compete with these companies, the demand for our used vehicles, products, and services could \nsubstantially decline.\nIn addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the \nchange in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may \nalso establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future data providers, technology partners, \nor other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to develop, improve, and promote \nour solutions.

Because different types \nof recreation vehicles are designed for different seasons, our revenue may be cyclical. Historically, the powersports \nindustry has been seasonal, with traffic and sales strongest in the spring and summer quarters. Sales and traffic are \ntypically slowest in the fall quarter but increase in spring and summer, coinciding with tax refund season and the \ncoming warmer months. Our business will also be impacted by cyclical trends affecting the overall economy, as well \nas by actual or threatened severe weather events."

Popular vehicles may often be difficult to obtain from manufacturers for a \nnumber of reasons, including the fact that manufacturers generally allocate their vehicles based on sales history \nand associated capital expenditures. Further, if a manufacturer fails to produce desirable vehicles or develops a \nreputation for producing undesirable vehicles or produces vehicles that do not comply with applicable laws or \ngovernment regulations, our revenue could be adversely affected as consumers shift their vehicle purchases away \nfrom that brand."

We cannot provide assurance that manufacturers will approve future acquisitions timely, if at all, \nwhich could significantly impair the execution of our acquisition strategy.\nManufacturers can also establish new franchises or relocate existing franchises, subject to applicable state \nfranchise laws. The establishment or relocation of franchises in our current markets could have a material adverse \neffect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of our retail locations in the market in which the \naction is taken.\nIf vehicle manufacturers reduce or discontinue sales incentive, warranty, or other promotional programs, our \nfinancial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe benefit from sales incentive, warranty, and other promotional programs of vehicle manufacturers that are \nintended to promote and support their respective new vehicle sales. Key incentive programs include: (i) customer \nrebates on new vehicles; (ii) dealer incentives on new vehicles; (iii) special financing or leasing terms; (iv) warranties \non new and used vehicles; and (v) sponsorship of used vehicle sales by authorized new vehicle dealers.\nVehicle manufacturers often make changes to their incentive programs. Any reduction or discontinuation of \nmanufacturers’ incentive programs for any reason, including a supply and demand imbalance, may reduce our sales \nvolume which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows, and financial \ncondition.\nIf state laws that protect powersports retailers are repealed, or weakened, our retail locations may be more \nsusceptible to termination, non-renewal, or renegotiation of their dealer agreements, which could have a material \nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nApplicable state laws generally provide that a vehicle manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a \ndealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth “good cause” and stating \nthe grounds for termination or non-renewal. Some state laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or allow \nthem to attempt to comply with the manufacturer’s criteria within a notice period to avoid the termination or \nnon-renewal. Our agreements with certain manufacturers contain provisions that, among other things, attempt \nto limit the protections available to dealers under these laws, and, though unsuccessful to date, manufacturers’ \nongoing lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of these laws. If these laws are repealed in the states \nin which we operate, manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice, \nan opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause. Without the protection of these state laws, it may also be \nmore difficult for us to renew dealer agreements upon expiration. Changes in laws that provide manufacturers the \nability to terminate our dealer agreements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and \nresults of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and \nregulations. Failure to comply with current or new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on \nour business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.\nWe are subject to a wide range of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, such as those relating to motor \nvehicle, retail installment sales, leasing, finance and insurance, marketing, licensing, consumer protection, consumer \nprivacy, escheatment, anti-money laundering, environmental, vehicle emissions and fuel economy, and health \nand safety. The regulatory bodies that regulate our business include, at the federal level: the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, the FTC, the DOT, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the Department of \nJustice, and the Federal Communications Commission; at the state level: various state dealer licensing authorities, \nstate consumer protection agencies including state attorney general offices, and state financial and insurance \nregulatory agencies; and at the municipal level our business is regulated by various municipal authorities covering \nlicensing, zoning, occupancy, and tax obligations. We are subject to compliance audits of our operations by many of \nthese authorities."

Our sale and purchase of vehicles, both new and pre-owned, related products and services and \nthird-party finance products, are subject to the state and local dealer licensing requirements in the jurisdictions in \nwhich we have retail or wholesale locations. Regulators of jurisdictions where our customers reside, but in which \nwe do not have a dealer or financing license could require that we obtain a license or otherwise comply with various \nstate regulations. Despite our belief that we are not subject to the licensing requirements of those jurisdictions \nin which we do not have a physical presence, regulators may seek to impose punitive fines for operating without \na license or demand we seek a license in those jurisdictions, any of which may inhibit our ability to do business \nin those jurisdictions, increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of \noperations.\nConsumer Finance. The financing we offer customers is subject to federal and state laws regulating the \nadvertising and provision of consumer finance options, the collection of consumer credit and financial information, \nalong with requirements related to online payments and electronic funds transfers, of whether RumbleOn Finance or \na third-party is the entity extending credit to such customers. Most states regulate retail installment sales, including \nsetting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees, or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states \nrequire that finance companies file a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license \nin order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state.\nLogistics and Transportation. Our Wholesale Express logistics operations, which brokers and facilitates the \ntransportation of vehicles primarily between and among dealers, is subject to motor-carrier rules and regulations \npromulgated by the DOT and the states through which their customers’ vehicles are transported. Additionally, \nthe vendors whom Wholesale Express relies upon are subject to federal and state regulation concerning transport \nvehicle dimensions, transport vehicle conditions, driver motor vehicle record history, driver alcohol and drug testing, \nand driver hours of service. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, condition, trailer length and \nconfiguration, methods of measurement, driver qualifications, or driver hours of service may increase the costs \ncharged to Wholesale Express by its vendors, which may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, \nand cash flows. If we fail to comply with the DOT regulations or if those regulations become more stringent, we \ncould be subject to increased inspections, audits, or compliance burdens. Regulatory authorities could take remedial \naction including imposing fines, suspending, or shutting down our Wholesale Express operations.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental \nlaws and regulations that pertain to our operations. The regulations concern material storage, air quality, waste \nhandling, and water pollution control. The regulations also regulate our use and operation of gasoline storage tanks, \ngasoline dispensing equipment, oil tanks, and paint booths among other things. Our business involves the use, \nhandling, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, including motor oil, gasoline, solvents, lubricants, paints, \nand other substances. We manage our compliance through permitting and operational control.\nFacilities and Personnel. Our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating \nto environmental protection and health and safety, and our employment practices are subject to various laws and \nregulations, including complex federal, state, and local wage and hour and anti-discrimination laws. We may also be \nliable for employee misconduct and violations of laws or regulations to which we are subject.\nFederal Advertising Regulations. The FTC has authority to take actions to remedy or prevent advertising \npractices that it considers to be unfair or deceptive and that affect commerce in the United States. If the FTC takes \nthe position in the future that any aspect of our business constitutes an unfair or deceptive advertising practice, \nresponding to such allegations could require us to pay significant damages, settlements, and civil penalties, or could \nrequire us to make adjustments to our products and services, any or all of which could result in substantial adverse \npublicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability.\nFederal Antitrust Laws. The antitrust laws prohibit, among other things, any joint conduct among \ncompetitors that would lessen competition in the marketplace. Some of the information that we may obtain from \ndealers may be sensitive and, if disclosed inappropriately, could potentially be pre-owned by dealers to impede \ncompetition or otherwise diminish independent pricing activity. A governmental or private civil action alleging \nthe improper exchange of information, or unlawful participation in price maintenance or other unlawful or \nanticompetitive activity, even if unfounded, could be costly to defend and adversely impact our ability to maintain"

In addition, governmental or private civil actions related to the antitrust laws could \nresult in orders suspending or terminating our ability to do business or otherwise altering or limiting certain of our \nbusiness practices, including the manner in which we handle or disclose pricing information, or the imposition of \nsignificant civil or criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us in class action \nor other civil litigation.\nOther. In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business, we are also subject \nto laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and Nasdaq listing rules. The violation \nof any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist \norder against our business operations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect \non our business, sales and results of operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating \nexpenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations.\nThe foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and \nthe regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to evolving interpretations and continuous change. \nViolation of the laws or regulations to which we are subject could result in consumer class actions or other lawsuits, \ngovernment investigations, and administrative, civil, or criminal sanctions against us and, which may include \nsignificant fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and \nfuture prospects.\nWe are subject to risks associated with imported product restrictions or limitations, foreign trade and currency \nfluctuations.\nOur business involves the sale of vehicles, parts, or vehicles composed of parts that are manufactured \noutside the United States. As a result, its operations are subject to risks of doing business outside of the \nUnited States and importing merchandise, including import duties, exchange rates, trade restrictions, work \nstoppages, natural or man-made disasters, and general political and socio-economic conditions in other countries. \nThe United States or the countries from which our products are imported may, from time to time, impose new \nquotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or limitations, or adjust presently prevailing quotas, duties, or tariffs. \nThe imposition of new, or adjustments to prevailing, quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or limitations \ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \nRelative weakness of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in the future may result in an increase in costs \nto us and in the retail price of such vehicles or parts, which could discourage consumers from purchasing such \nvehicles and adversely impact its revenue and profitability.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class B Common Stock\nOur largest stockholders may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved \nby our stockholders.\nAt March 15, 2023, two of our stockholders beneficially owned approximately 32.5% of the Company’s voting \npower. As a result, these individuals may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or \napproved by our stockholders. Also, in the future, these stockholders may acquire or dispose of shares of our Class B \ncommon stock and thereby increase or decrease their ownership stake in us. Significant fluctuations in the levels of \nownership of our largest stockholders could impact the volume of trading, liquidity, and market price of our Class B \ncommon stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse \nor misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class B common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry \nor securities analysts publish about us or our business.

We currently do not intend to pay \ncash dividends in the foreseeable future on the shares of common stock. We intend to reinvest any earning in the \ndevelopment and expansion of our business. As a result, any return on your investment in our common stock will be \nlimited to the appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any.\nWe are currently subject to reduced reporting requirements so long as we are considered a “smaller reporting \ncompany” and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting \ncompanies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently subject to reduced reporting requirements so long as we are considered a “smaller reporting \ncompany.” We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we currently rely on \nthese exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active \ntrading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe are subject to risks associated with proxy contests and other actions of activist stockholders.\nPublicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating \nspecific corporate actions. On March 15, 2023, two former directors and current shareholders, William Coulter and \nMark Tkach, issued a press release regarding their announced intention to nominate five individuals for three seats \nthat they believe are up for election at our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Our Board of Directors welcomes \nopen communications with all of our stockholders. However, if the Company and Messrs. Coulter and Tkach \ncannot reach an agreement in connection with their proposed nominations, there may be a contested election at the \nCompany’s 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. A proxy contest or related activities on the part of any activist \nstockholders, could adversely affect our business for a number of reasons, including the following:\n• \nResponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and \ntime-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of our Board of Directors, \nmanagement, and our employees;\n• \nPerceived uncertainties as to the future direction of the Company may result in the loss of potential \nbusiness opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business \npartners, customers, and others important to our success, any of which could negatively affect our \nbusiness and our results of operations and financial condition;\n• \nA successful proxy contest could result in a change in control of our Board, and such an event could \nsubject us to certain contractual obligations under several material agreements; and\n• \nIf nominees advanced by activist stockholders are elected or appointed to our Board with a specific \nagenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plans or to \nrealize long-term value from our assets, and this could in turn have an adverse effect on our business and \non our results of operations and financial condition.\nAnti-takeover provisions may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could adversely impact our \nstock price.\nNevada law and our charter, bylaws, and other governing documents contain provisions that could discourage, \ndelay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders, which could \ncause our stock price to decline. In addition, these provisions could limit the price investors would be willing to pay \nin the future for shares of our common stock."

We sell both new and pre-owned vehicles \nthrough retail and wholesale channels. F&I and PSA revenue is almost exclusively earned through retail channels. \nAutomotive sales are almost exclusively via wholesale channels, and therefore, contribute to a very small portion \nof F&I revenue. These sales channels provide us the opportunity to maximize profitability through increased \nsales volume and lower average days to sale by selling through the channel where the opportunity is the greatest \nat any given time based on customer demand, market conditions or inventory availability. The number of vehicles \nsold to any given channel may vary from period to period these factors. Subject to the resulting Demand/Supply \nImbalances, as discussed elsewhere in this MD&A, we expect pre-owned vehicle sales to increase as we begin to \nutilize a combination of brand building and direct response channels to efficiently source and scale our addressable \nmarkets while expanding our suite of product offerings to consumers who may wish to trade-in or to sell us their \nvehicle independent of a retail sale. Factors primarily affecting pre-owned vehicle sales include the number of retail \npre-owned vehicles sold and the average selling price of these vehicles.\nGross Profit\nGross profit generated on vehicle sales reflects the difference between the vehicle selling price and the cost \nof revenue associated with acquiring the vehicle and preparing it for sale. Cost of revenue includes the vehicle \nacquisition cost, inbound transportation cost, and particularly for pre-owned vehicles, reconditioning costs \n(collectively, we refer to reconditioning and transportation costs as “Recon and Transport”). The aggregate gross \nprofit and gross profit per vehicle vary across vehicle type, make, model, etc. as well as through retail and wholesale \nchannels, and with regard to gross profit per vehicle, are not necessarily correlated with the sale price. Vehicles \nsold through retail channels generally have the highest dollar gross profit per vehicle given the vehicle is sold \ndirectly to the consumer. Pre-owned vehicles sold through wholesale channels, including directly to other dealers \nor through auction channels, including via our dealer-to-dealer auction market, generally have lower margins and \ndo not include other ancillary gross profit attributable to financing and accessory. Factors affecting gross profit \nfrom period to period include the mix of new versus used vehicles sold, the distribution channel through which they \nare sold, the sources from which we acquired such inventory, retail market prices, our average days to sale, and our \npricing strategy. We may opportunistically choose to shift our inventory mix to higher or lower cost vehicles, or to \nopportunistically raise or lower our prices relative to market to take advantage of Demand/Supply Imbalances in our \nsales channels, which could temporarily lead to gross profits increasing or decreasing in any given channel.\nVehicles Sold\nWe define vehicles sold as the number of vehicles sold through both wholesale and retail channels in each \nperiod, net of returns. Vehicles sold is the primary driver of our revenue and, indirectly, gross profit. Vehicles sold \nalso enables complementary revenue streams, such as financing. Vehicles sold increases our base of customers and \nimproves brand awareness and repeat sales. Vehicles sold also provides the opportunity to successfully scale our \nlogistics, fulfillment, and customer service operations.\nTotal Gross Profit per Unit (Powersports Segment)\nTotal gross profit per unit is the aggregate gross profit of the powersports segment in a given period, divided \nby retail powersports units sold in that period. The aggregate gross profit of the powersports segment includes gross \nprofit generated from the sale of new and used vehicles, income related to the origination of loans originated to \nfinance the vehicle, revenue earned from the sale of F&I products including extended service contracts, maintenance \nprograms, guaranteed auto protection, tire and wheel protection, and theft protection products, gross profit on the \nsale of PSA products, and gross profit generated from wholesale sales of vehicles."

The Acquisition Effect specific to new vehicles, F&I and PSA revenue accounted \nfor approximately $471,340, $94,443, and $180,593, respectively, of the increase; the Company did not sell new \nvehicles prior to the acquisitions of RideNow and Freedom Powersports. The total number of vehicles sold increased \nby 51,028 to 73,413 for the year ended December 31, 2022, driven primarily from the Acquisition Effect; new \nvehicle sales accounted for 31,094 of the increase, used units sold through retail channels increased by 22,552, \noffset by 2,618 fewer used units sold through wholesale channels. During the year ended December 31, 2022, \nthe Company earned, on average, $13,943 more in total revenue per vehicle from retail customers than wholesale \ncustomers. Overall, the average revenue per vehicle decreased by $1,953 from $21,778 to $19,825, much of which \nis attributable to price levels normalizing during the year ended December 31, 2022 as Demand/Supply Imbalances \nsoftened in the overall market.\nWe believe that average revenue per vehicle is a relatively high number given historical trends for these \nbusinesses and we attribute that to a combination of (i) product mix, with in demand vehicles like UTVs and \nside-by-sides commanding higher prices, supplemented by (ii) elevated pricing of both new and used vehicles given \nthe Demand/Supply Imbalance. We anticipate that unit purchasing levels and sales will continue to grow as we \nincrease penetration in existing markets, build out fulfillment centers and acquire new dealers.\nGross Profit\nPowersports vehicle gross profit increased by $312,099 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared \nto 2021. This increase in gross profit was primarily due to the Acquisition Effect; $92,550 was specific to new \nvehicles, $56,769 was due to used retail vehicle sales and F&I, and PSA collectively accounted for $176,380 of \nthe increase. The overall increases in gross profit were partially offset by a decrease of $(13,600) in gross profit \nfrom used wholesale vehicle sales, as the Company shifted towards selling vehicles through its more profitable \nretail channels where feasible. Gross profit per retail vehicle sold decreased $(1,135) per unit, from $7,294 in 2021 \nto $6,159 in 2022. Macroeconomic conditions were the primary driver of the decrease in gross profit per unit, \nas the Demand/Supply Imbalance and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic softened throughout the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, resulting in more competitive market pricing.\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to December 31, 2021\nAutomotive Metrics (dollars in thousands except per unit)\nYear Ended December 31,\nYoY \nChange\n2022\n2021\nRevenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ \n334,273\n$ \n460,888\n$ \n(126,615)\nGross Profit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ \n10,850\n$ \n30,746\n$ \n(19,896)\nVehicles sold . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n7,624\n12,381\n(4,757)\nRevenue per vehicle . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ \n43,845\n$ \n37,225\n$ \n6,620\nGross Profit per vehicle  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ \n1,423\n$ \n2,483\n$ \n(1,060)\nRevenue\nTotal automotive vehicle revenue decreased by $(126,615) to $334,273 for the year ended December 31, 2022 \ncompared to $460,888 for 2021 as a result of (4,757) fewer vehicles sold.

The increase in depreciation and amortization is a result of the cumulative investments \nmade in connection with the development of the business which included capitalized technology acquisition and \ndevelopment costs of $7,003 and $10,355 in additions to property and equipment for the year ended December 31, \n2022 as compared to $1,266 of capitalized technology acquisition and development costs and $2,707 in additions to \nproperty and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, amortization \nof capitalized technology development was $4,711 as compared to $1,710 for the same period of 2021.

Depreciation and amortization on vehicle, furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements \nwas $7,766 as compared to $210 for the same period of 2021.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $37,463 to $53,868 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $16,405 \nin 2021. Interest expense consists of interest on the: (i) term loan credit agreement (the “Oaktree Credit Facility”); \n(ii) various floorplan facilities, including the used powersports inventory financing credit facility with J.P. Morgan; \n(iii) private placement notes; and (iv) convertible senior notes. The increase in interest expense for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022 as compared to the same period of 2021 is primarily related to the acquisition of Freedom \nPowersports, as we borrowed $84,500 in new debt from the Oaktree Credit Facility to finance the Freedom \nTransaction. In addition, the Company assumed floorplan facilities as part of the Freedom Transaction, which were \nused throughout the year ended December 31, 2022 to finance the purchase of inventory. Overall higher interest \nrates on the Company’s borrowings throughout the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period \nof 2021 also contributed to higher interest expense. See Note 10-Notes Payable and Lines of Credit for additional \ndiscussion.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, both the powersports and automotive industries have been seasonal with traffic and sales strongest \nin the spring and summer quarters. Sales and traffic are typically slowest in the winter quarter but increase typically \nin the spring season, coinciding with tax refunds and improved weather conditions. Given this seasonality, we expect \nour quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, gross profit, profit/loss, and cash flow to vary accordingly. \nOver time, we expect to normalize to seasonal trends in both segments, using data and logistics to move inventory to \nthe right place, at the right time, at the right price.\nDerivative Liability\nIn connection with our various financings, we undertake an analysis of each financial instrument to \ndetermine the appropriate accounting treatment, including which, if any require bifurcation into liability and equity \ncomponents; we have determined that the following financings have such components:\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, a derivative liability was recorded at issuance \nwith an interest make whole provision of $21 based on a lattice model using a stock price of $14.60, and estimated \nvolatility of 55.0% and risk-free rates over the entire 10-year yield curve.\nThe change in value of the derivative liability for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was \napproximately $39 and $(8,799), respectively, and is included in change in derivative liability in the Consolidated \nStatement of Operations. The value of the derivative liability as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately \n$26 and $66, respectively."

The initial warrant liability \nand deferred financing charge recognized was $10,950. The warrant liability was subject to remeasurement at each \nbalance sheet date and any change in fair value was recognized as a component of change in derivative liability \nin the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of the Warrant was estimated using a Monte Carlo \nsimulation based on a combination of level 1 and level 2 inputs. Upon closing of the RideNow Transaction, the \nwarrants were considered equity linked contracts indexed to the Company’s stock and therefore met the equity \nclassification guidance. As a result, the $19,700 was reclassified to additional paid-in-capital. The $10,950 deferred \nfinancing charge was reclassified as part of the debt discount related to the Oaktree Credit Agreement. The \nrecognition of the warrant liability and deferred financing charge and the reclassification of the warrant liability \nto additional paid-in capital and the reclassification of the deferred financing charge to debt discount are non-cash \nitems.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn connection with the closing of the RideNow Transaction and the execution of the certain Executive \nEmployment Agreements, the Company accelerated the vesting of and waived certain market-based share price \nhurdles for all then outstanding restricted stock units (“RSUs”) for all participants, which resulted in excess of \n$23,943 of incremental stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to \noperating income (loss) or net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or cash flows or as a measure \nof liquidity. Non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily calculated the same way by different companies and \nshould not be considered a substitute for or superior to U.S. GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) adjusted to add back interest expense, depreciation and \namortization, changes in derivative liabilities and certain recoveries, income tax benefits, and other non-recurring \ncosts, as these charges and expenses are not considered a part of our core business operations and are not necessarily \nan indicator of ongoing, future company performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is one of the primary metrics used by management to evaluate the financial performance of \nour business. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other \ninterested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our \noperating results, because it excludes, among other things, certain results of decisions that are outside the control \nof management, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding \ncapital structure and capital investments.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, adjustments to calculating Adjusted EBITDA are primarily \ncomprised of:\n• \nNon-cash stock-based compensation expense recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations,\n• \nTransaction costs associated with the RideNow Transaction and Freedom Transaction, which primarily \ninclude professional fees and third-party costs,\n• \nPurchase accounting adjustments, which represent one-time expenses related to the Freedom Transaction \nand RideNow Transaction,\n• \nForgiveness of the PPP loan,\n• \nLease expense associated with favorable related party leases in excess of contractual lease payments,\n• \nCharges for the settlement of disputes and claims with former minority shareholders of RideNow,\n• \nExpenses attributable to a discontinued project in Fort Worth, Texas,"

Proceeds from the \nRumbleOn Finance line of credit were $25,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and are separately reflected \nas cash from financing activities. Due to the presentation differences between finance receivables and proceeds from \nthe RumbleOn Finance line of credit on the consolidated statements of cash flows, fluctuations in these amounts can \nhave a significant impact on our operating and financing cash flows without affecting our overall liquidity, working \ncapital or cash flows.\nInvesting Activities\nOur primary use of cash for investing activities is for technology development and acquisitions to expand \nour operations. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $82,204, a decrease of \n$296,627 compared to 2021.\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities results was primarily driven by a decrease of $301,730 in \ncash used in acquisitions.

Cash provided by financing activities was $107,696 for \nthe year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $459,466 for 2021.

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make \nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related \ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from \nthese estimates under different assumptions or conditions, impacting our reported results of operations and financial \ncondition.\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have \na material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the recognition of income and expenses. \nManagement considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions \nused by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under \nthe circumstances. The significant accounting policies and estimates which we believe are the most critical to aid in \nfully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are described below. Refer to Note 1 — Description \nof Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the consolidated financial statements included \nin Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this 2022 Form 10-K, for more detailed \ninformation regarding our critical accounting policies."

      "text": "42\nRevenue Recognition\nWe adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers on January 1, 2018 using the modified \nretrospective method. ASC 606 prescribes a five-step model that includes: (1) identify the contract; (2) identify the \nperformance obligations; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance \nobligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied. Based on the manner in \nwhich we historically recognized revenue, the adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the amount or \ntiming of our revenue recognition, and we recognized no cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption.\nFor vehicles sold at wholesale to dealers we satisfy our performance obligation for vehicles sales when the \nwholesale purchaser obtains control of the underlying vehicle, which is upon delivery when the transfer of title, risks \nand rewards of ownership and control pass to the dealer. We recognize revenue at the amount we expect to receive \nfor the pre-owned vehicle, which is the fixed price determined at the auction. The purchase price of the wholesale \nvehicle is typically due and collected within 30 days of delivery of the wholesale vehicle.\nFor vehicles sold to consumers the purchase price is set forth in the customer contracts at a stand-alone selling \nprice which is agreed upon prior to delivery. We satisfy our performance obligation for pre-owned vehicle sales upon \ndelivery when the transfer of title, risks and rewards of ownership and control pass to the customer. We recognize \nrevenue at the agreed upon purchase price stated in the contract, including any delivery charges, less an estimate for \nreturns. Our return policy allows customers to initiate a return during the first three days after delivery. Estimates \nfor returns are based on an analysis of historical experience, trends and sales data. Changes in these estimates are \nreflected as an adjustment to revenue in the period identified. The amount of consideration received for pre-owned \nvehicle sales to consumers includes noncash consideration representing the value of trade-in vehicles, if applicable, \nas stated in the contract. Prior to the delivery of the vehicle, the payment is received, or financing has been arranged. \nPayments from customers that finance their purchases with third parties are typically due and collected within \n30 days of delivery of the pre-owned vehicle. In future periods additional provisions may be necessary due to a \nvariety of factors, including changing customer return patterns due to the maturation of the online vehicle buying \nmarket, macro- and micro-economic factors that could influence customer return behavior and future pricing \nenvironments. If these factors result in adjustments to sales returns, they could significantly impact our future \noperating results. Revenue excludes any sales taxes, title and registration fees, and other government fees that are \ncollected from customers.\nVehicle logistics revenue is generated primarily by entering into freight brokerage agreements with dealers, \ndistributors, or private party individuals to transport vehicles from a point of origin to a designated destination. The \ntransaction price is based on the consideration specified in the customer’s contract. A performance obligation is \ncreated when the customer under a transportation contract submits a bill of lading for the transport of goods from \norigin to destination. These performance obligations are satisfied as the shipments move from origin to destination. \nThe freight brokerage agreements are fulfilled by independent third-party transporters. While the Company is \nprimarily responsible for fulfilling to customers, these transporters are obligated to meet our performance obligations \nand standards. Performance obligations are short-term, with transit days less than one week. Generally, customers are \nbilled either upon shipment of the vehicle or on a monthly basis, and remit payment according to approved payment \nterms, generally not to exceed 30 days. Revenue is recognized as risks and rewards of transportation of the vehicle is \ntransferred to the owner during delivery. Wholesale Express is considered the principal in the delivery transactions \nsince it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the service. As a result, revenue is recorded gross.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022 and as first announced on the Company’s third quarter earnings call which took \nplace on November 9, 2022, the Company disclosed its plan to explore strategic alternatives for its automotive \nsegment. The Company is now expecting to wind down its wholesale automotive business in the first half of 2023. \nThe Company’s 2023 revenue forecast only includes the sales of the remaining inventory at December 31, 2022, \nwhich represents a substantial reduction in revenues and earnings compared to historical periods. Management \nexpects operations of the automotive segment to cease in fiscal year 2023 and its cash flow forecast reflects such \nfacts and timelines.\nBusiness Combinations\nTotal consideration transferred for acquisitions is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired \nand liabilities assumed, if any, based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. This purchase price allocation \nprocess requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets"

      "text": "43\nand other fair value adjustments with respect to certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of \nidentifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions determined by \nmanagement. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired \nis allocated to goodwill. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and \nliabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates \nare inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up \nto one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the \ncorresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values \nof assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our \nconsolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nWe use the income approach to determine the fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets including \nfranchise rights. This approach determines fair value by estimating after-tax cash flows attributable to these assets \nover their respective useful lives and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our \nassumptions on estimates of future cash flows, expected growth rates, etc. We base the discount rates used to arrive \nat a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and certain industry-specific risk factors. \nWe believe the estimated purchased franchise rights and non-compete intangible asset amounts so determined \nrepresent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third-party would pay for the assets.\nRefer to Note 2. Acquisitions for further discussion of the Company’s business combinations.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of \nOctober 1st, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist.\nWe have three reportable segments, operating segments, and reporting units, as defined in GAAP for segment \nreporting and goodwill testing: (1) powersports, (2) automotive and (3) vehicle logistics, each of which is separately \nevaluated for purposes of goodwill testing. We first review qualitative factors to determine whether it is more \nlikely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount; if we determine that it is not \nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then our goodwill is not \nconsidered to be impaired. However, if based on the qualitative assessment we conclude that it is more likely than \nnot that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect to bypass the optional \nqualitative assessment as provided for under GAAP, we proceed with performing the quantitative impairment test.\nFair value estimates used in the quantitative impairment test are calculated using a combination of the income \nand market approaches. The income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting \nunit, while the market approach is based on certain multiples of selected guideline public companies or selected \nguideline transactions. The approaches incorporate a number of market participant assumptions including future \ngrowth rates, discount rates, income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit \nspecific. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we recognize an impairment charge for the \namount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. We recognize any impairment loss in \noperating income.\nThe fair value measurement associated with the quantitative goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets \ntest is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. \nSignificant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value goodwill and franchise rights could significantly \nincrease or decrease the fair value estimates used for impairment assessments.\nAs disclosed in Note 8, the Company performed its annual goodwill and franchise rights impairment test \non October 1, 2022 and subsequently updated its quantitative impairment test as of December 31, 2022 because a \ntriggering event was identified due to declines in the Company’s market capitalization and other factors occurring \nin the fourth quarter of 2022. Impairment amounts recognized in the Company’s 2022 annual financial statements \nrepresent aggregate impairment charges recognized from both the October 1 and December 31, 2022 quantitative \nimpairment tests."

The estimated fair value of the Company’s vehicle \nlogistics reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment was required. The Company also recognized \nnoncash franchise rights impairment charges of $105,630 to the Company’s powersports segment resulting from its \nfourth quarter 2022 impairment tests.\nNewly Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which amends the guidance on the \nimpairment of financial instruments by requiring measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for \nfinancial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, \nbeginning after December 15, 2019, and earlier adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. \nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), \nDerivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates (“ASU 2019-10”). The purpose of \nthis amendment is to create a two-tier rollout of major updates, staggering the effective dates between larger public \ncompanies and all other entities. This granted certain classes of companies, including Smaller Reporting Companies \n(“SRCs”), additional time to implement major FASB standards, including ASU 2016-13. Larger public companies \nwill still have an effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within \nthose fiscal years. All other entities are permitted to defer adoption of ASU 2016-13, and its related amendments, \nuntil the earlier of fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 for its \nfiscal year beginning January 1, 2023, and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial \nstatements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the \nEffects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” This ASU provides optional guidance for a limited time \nto ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new guidance provides optional expedients \nand exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by \nreference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts and hedging relationships \nthat reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued \ndue to reference rate reform. Additionally, entities can elect to continue applying hedge accounting for hedging \nrelationships affected by reference rate reform if certain conditions are met. In January 2021, the FASB issued \nASU 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope.” This ASU refines the scope of ASC 848 and clarifies \nsome of its guidance as part of the Board’s monitoring of global reference rate reform activities. The ASU permits \nentities to elect certain optional expedients and exceptions when accounting for derivative contracts and certain \nhedging relationships affected by changes in the interest rates used for discounting cash flows, for computing \nvariation margin settlements, and for calculating price alignment interest in connection with reference rate reform \nactivities. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the \nSunset Date of Topic 848.” This ASU defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, \n2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. These new standards were \neffective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications. While our senior secured \ndebt and many of our floorplan arrangements utilize LIBOR as a benchmark for calculating the applicable interest \nrate, some of our floorplan arrangements have already transitioned to utilizing an alternative benchmark rate. \nWe are continuing to evaluate the impact of the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates. We \ncannot predict the effect of the potential changes to or elimination of LIBOR, the establishment of alternative rates \nor benchmarks, and the corresponding effects on our cost of capital but do not expect a significant impact on our \nconsolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract \nAssets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2021-08 requires contract assets and contract \nliabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date \nin accordance with ASC 606 instead of being recorded at fair value. The Company will adopt ASU 2021-08 for its \nfiscal year beginning January 1, 2023, and does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company’s financial \nstatements."

Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive \nOfficer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures \nas of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and \nprocedures were not effective as of that date due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial \nreporting as described below.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management, including our CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate \ninternal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control \nover financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial \nreporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP in the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2022, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s \ninternal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in “Internal Control — Integrated \nFramework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on \nthis assessment, management has determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not \neffective as of December 31, 2022, because of an identified material weakness in our internal control over financial \nreporting described below.\nRemediation of Previously Identified Material Weaknesses & Other Remediation Activities\nAs previously disclosed in Part II Item 9A Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K \nfor the year ended December 31, 2021, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial \nreporting as follows:\n• \nInformation technology general controls particularly as such controls related to user access, program \nchange management, and ineffective complementary user-organization controls, which limited \nmanagement’s ability to rely on technology dependent controls relevant to the preparation of our \nfinancial statements.\n• \nControls over the period end close process, including the review and approval process of journal entries, \nbalance sheet account reconciliations, segregation of duties conflicts, and consolidation of intercompany \nentries."

However, as described below, we identified a material \nweakness as of December 31, 2022 related to the integration of the RideNow business and incorporation of the \nacquired business into the Company’s control environment.\nMaterial Weakness Following the Integration of the RideNow Business\nAs part of the Company’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, management identified the following material weakness:\n• \nThere was an insufficient number of accounting resources to facilitate an effective control environment \nfollowing the integration of the RideNow business and incorporation of the acquired business into the \nCompany’s control environment. Consequently, the Company did not effectively operate process-level \ncontrol activities related to elimination of intercompany transactions, review and approval of certain \nreconciliations, accounting estimates accounting for non-routine transactions, and management review \ncontrols.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial \nreporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial \nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based on the material weakness described above, we \nhave concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective."

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material \nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its \ncash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in \nthe United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \n(United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based \non criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring \nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated March 16, 2023 expressed an adverse \nopinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express \nan opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered \nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that \nwe plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks \nof material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures \nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts \nand disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and \nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. \nWe believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial \nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to \naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, \nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on \nthe financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing \nseparate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment of goodwill and franchise rights of Powersports Reporting Unit\nAs described further in note 8 to the financial statements, the Company performed impairment testing of goodwill \nand franchise rights of the Powersports reporting unit. As a result of performing the impairment tests, the Company \nrecorded $218.6 million of goodwill impairment expense and $105.6 million of impairment expense associated with \nthe Company’s franchise rights. The Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using a combination of \ndiscounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation methodologies. Management utilized a third-party valuation \nfirm to assist with determining the estimated fair values used in the aforementioned impairment tests.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that impairment of goodwill and franchise rights of \nthe Powersports reporting unit is a critical audit matter is the degree of auditor judgment required to assess the \nreasonableness of key inputs to valuation models used by management to estimate these fair values. Specifically, \nthe key inputs which we determined required especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments included:"

Performing audit procedures to evaluate management’s \nassumptions required the need to involve valuation specialists.\nOur audit procedures related to the impairment of goodwill and franchise rights of the Powersports reporting \nunit included the following, among others:\n• \nWe tested the design and operating effectiveness of relevant controls relating to management’s \npreparation and review of the forecasted cash flows and the discount rate applied, and review of the \nmethodologies applied by third-party valuation specialists engaged by the Company.\n• \nWe assessed the reasonableness of forecasted cash flows by comparing the forecasted cash flows with \nhistorical results and the Company’s budget.\n• \nWith the assistance of a valuation specialist:\n• \nWe evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate applied to forecasted cash flows.\n• \nWe evaluated the reasonableness of attribution of the Company’s forecasted cash flows to various \nasset classes necessary to compute the fair value of the Company’s franchise rights.\n• \nWe evaluated the reasonableness of the implied control premium by comparing to a range of \ncontrol premiums observed from similar transactions.\nValuation of Acquired Franchise Rights Intangible Assets\nAs described further in note 2 to the financial statements, the Company closed the acquisition of the Freedom \nPowersports business on February 18, 2022. Additionally, in 2022 the Company completed its business combination \naccounting related to the Company’s acquisition of the RideNow business, which closed on August 31, 2021. The \nvalue of acquired franchise rights was $39.7 million for Freedom Powersports and $296.5 million for RideNow. \nBusiness combination accounting requires management to estimate the acquisition date fair values of the consideration \nexchanged and to record acquired assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The \nCompany utilized a third-party valuation firm to assist management in estimating the fair value measurements.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that the valuation of the acquired franchise rights intangible \nassets is a critical audit matter is the degree of judgment necessary to determine if key inputs to valuation models used \nby management to estimate the fair values of the acquired franchise rights intangible assets were reasonable in the \ncircumstance. Specifically, those key inputs which we determined to require especially challenging, subjective or complex \njudgments included: 1) forecasted cash flows attributable to the acquired franchise rights for each acquisition, and 2) \nthe discount rate applied to those net cash flows to measure the estimated fair values of the acquired franchise rights. \nPerforming audit procedures to evaluate management’s assumptions required the need to involve valuation specialists.\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation of acquired franchise rights referenced above included the \nfollowing, among others:\n• \nWe tested the design and operating effectiveness of relevant controls relating to management’s \npreparation and review of the forecasted cash flows and the discount rate applied, and review of the \nmethodologies applied by third-party valuation specialists engaged by the Company.\n• \nWe assessed the reasonableness of the forecasted cash flows by comparing the forecasted cash flows \nwith historical results.\n• \nWith the assistance of a valuation specialist, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates \napplied to forecasted cash flows.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022.\nDallas, Texas\nMarch 16, 2023"

(a Nevada corporation) \nand subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal \nControl — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \nCommission (“COSO”). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described in the following \nparagraphs on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective \ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal \nControl — Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial \nreporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim \nfinancial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been \nidentified and included in management’s assessment.\nThe Company did not have a sufficient number of accounting resources with assigned responsibilities and \naccountability for the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting following the integration \nof the RideNow business and incorporation of the acquired business into the Company’s control environment. As \na consequence, the Company did not effectively operate process-level control activities related to elimination of \nintercompany transactions, review and approval of certain reconciliations, accounting estimates, accounting for \nnon-routine transactions and management review controls.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \n(United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022. The material weakness identified above was considered in determining the nature, timing, and \nextent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2022 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect \nour report dated March 16, 2023 which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting \nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on \nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered \nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan \nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting \nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over \nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating \neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered \nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nOur audit of, and opinion on, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not include the \ninternal control over financial reporting of Freedom Powersports, LLC and Freedom Powersports Real Estate, LLC \n(collectively, the “Freedom Entities”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect total assets and \nrevenues constituting approximately 12 and 11 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement \namounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. As indicated in Management’s Report, the Freedom \nEntities were acquired during 2022.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting \nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, \naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable \nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance \nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made \nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable \nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s \nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect \nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that \ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies \nor procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON\nDallas, Texas\nMarch 16, 2023"

      "text": "F-11\nRumbleOn, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nNOTE 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of Business\nRumbleOn is the nation’s first, largest, and only publicly-traded, technology-based platform in the powersports \nindustry. Headquartered in the Dallas Metroplex, RumbleOn is revolutionizing the customer experience for outdoor \nenthusiasts across the country and making powersport vehicles accessible to more people in more places than ever \nbefore. We are transforming the powersports customer experience by giving consumers what they want — a wide \nselection, great value and quality, transparency, and an easy, friction-free transaction. Every element of our business, \nfrom inventory procurement to fulfillment to overall ease of transactions, whether online or on-site at one of our \n55 retail locations, has been built for a singular purpose — to create a customer experience without peer in the \npowersports industry.\nAlthough our primary focus is on the customer experience and building market share in the powersports \nindustry, during 2022 we participated in the wholesale automotive industry through our wholly-owned distributors \nof used automotive inventory, Wholesale, Inc. (“Wholesale Inc”) and our exotics retailer AutoSport USA, Inc., \nwhich does business under the name Got Speed. In the third quarter of 2022, we announced we would be winding \ndown our wholesale automotive business, which we expect to complete during the first half of 2023. Our logistics \nservices company, Wholesale Express, LLC (“Wholesale Express”), provides freight brokerage services facilitating \ntransportation for dealers and consumers.\nOn August 31, 2021 (the “RideNow Closing Date”), RumbleOn, Inc. completed its business combination \nwith RideNow Powersports, the nation’s largest powersports retailer group (“RideNow”). On February 18, 2022 \n(the “Freedom Closing Date”), the Company completed its acquisition of Freedom Powersports, LLC (“Freedom \nPowersports”) and Freedom Powersports Real Estate, LLC (“Freedom Powersports — RE”) and together with \nFreedom Powersports, the “Freedom Entities”), a retailer group with 13 locations in Texas, Georgia, and Alabama \n(refer to Note 2 — Acquisitions).\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company disclosed its plan to explore strategic alternatives for its \nautomotive business. The Company is now expecting to wind down the wholesale automotive business during the \nfirst half of 2023.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. \nAll significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation \nof financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires \nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and \nexpenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. Amounts and \npercentages may not total due to rounding.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all cash accounts and all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with an \noriginal maturity of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the \nCompany did not have any investments with maturities less than three months. At times, the Company has cash \nbalances in domestic bank accounts that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. The Company has \nnot experienced any losses related to these cash concentrations. The Company only uses highly rated financial \ninstitutions to hold its cash deposits."

The allowance for doubtful accounts is \nestimated based on historical experience and trends. Accounts receivable, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, \nincludes certain amounts due from customers. The Company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts \nfor accounts receivable by considering a number of factors, including overall credit quality, age of outstanding \nbalances, historical write-off experience and specific account analysis that projects the ultimate collectability of the \noutstanding balances. Ultimately, actual results could differ from these assumptions.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and \namortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the asset’s estimated useful life or the \nlease term, if applicable.\nEstimated Useful Lives\nLife\nBuildings\n25 years\nLeasehold Improvements\n15 years\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment\n3 – 15 years\nProperty and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that \nthe carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Impairments are recognized when the sum \nof undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of \nthe asset. Costs of significant additions, renewals, and betterments, are capitalized and depreciated. Maintenance \nand repairs are charged to expense when incurred. See Note 6 — Property and Equipment, Net for additional \ninformation on property and equipment.\nTechnology Development Costs\nTechnology development costs are accounted for pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) \n350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other. Technology development costs include internally developed software and \nwebsite applications that are used by the Company for its own internal use and to provide services to its customers, \nwhich include consumers, dealer partners and ancillary service providers. Technology and content costs for design, \nmaintenance and post-implementation stages of internal-use software and general website development are expensed \nas incurred. For costs incurred to develop new website functionality as well as new software products and significant \nupgrades to existing internally used platforms or modules, capitalization begins during the application development \nstage and ends when the software is available for general use. Capitalized technology development is amortized on a \nstraight-line basis over periods ranging from three to five years. The Company will perform periodic assessment of \nthe useful lives assigned to capitalized software applications.\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nTotal consideration transferred for acquisitions is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired \nand liabilities assumed, if any, based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition.

The fair value of \nidentifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions determined by \nmanagement. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired \nis allocated to goodwill. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and \nliabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates \nare inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up \nto one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the \ncorresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values \nof assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our \nconsolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nWe use the income approach to determine the fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets including \nfranchise rights. This approach determines fair value by estimating after-tax cash flows attributable to these assets \nover their respective useful lives and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our \nassumptions on estimates of future cash flows, expected growth rates, etc. We base the discount rates used to arrive \nat a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and certain industry-specific risk factors. \nWe believe the estimated purchased franchise rights and non-compete intangible asset amounts so determined \nrepresent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third-party would pay for the assets.\nOn August 31, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of RideNow. The Company finalized its \naccounting for consideration transferred, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in the third quarter of 2022; all \nadjustments were recorded within the measurement period, that ended on August 31, 2022. Total goodwill acquired \nas part of the RideNow acquisition was $207,675.\nOn February 18, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of the Freedom Entities. Consideration \ntransferred for acquired assets and liabilities assumed has been recorded on a provisional basis as of December 31, \n2022. Total goodwill acquired as part of the Freedom Entities acquisition was $29,099.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Intangible assets are recognized and recorded at their \nacquisition date fair values. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of franchise rights, and definite-lived \nintangible assets consist primarily of non-compete agreements, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over \nthe relevant contractual terms. Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of October 1, \nor whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. We have three reportable \nsegments and reporting units as defined in generally accepted accounting principles for segment reporting and \ngoodwill testing: (1) powersports, (2) automotive and (3) vehicle logistics.\nManagement analyzes goodwill and intangible assets associated with these segments for potential impairment. \nThe Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a \nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount. However, if based on the qualitative assessment we conclude that \nit is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect to \nbypass the optional qualitative assessment as provided for under GAAP, we proceed with performing the quantitative \nimpairment test.\nFair value estimates used in the quantitative impairment test are calculated using a combination of the income \nand market approaches. The income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting \nunit, while the market approach is based on certain multiples of selected guideline public companies or selected \nguideline transactions. The approaches incorporate a number of market participant assumptions including future \ngrowth rates, discount rates, income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit"

If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we recognize an impairment charge for the \namount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. We recognize any impairment loss in \noperating income.\nThe fair value measurement associated with the quantitative goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets \ntest is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. \nSignificant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value goodwill and franchise rights could significantly \nincrease or decrease the fair value estimates used for impairment assessments.\nAs disclosed in Note 8, the Company performed its annual goodwill and franchise rights impairment test \non October 1, 2022 and subsequently updated its quantitative impairment test as of December 31, 2022 because a \ntriggering event was identified due to declines in the Company’s market capitalization and other factors occurring \nin the fourth quarter of 2022. Impairment amounts recognized in the Company’s 2022 annual financial statements \nrepresent aggregate impairment charges recognized from both the October 1 and December 31, 2022 quantitative \nimpairment tests.\nIn connection with its fourth quarter 2022 goodwill impairment test, the Company recognized noncash \ngoodwill impairment charges of $26,039 to the Company’s automotive reporting unit and $218,646 to the Company’s \npowersports reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2022. The estimated fair value of the Company’s vehicle \nlogistics reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment was required. The company also recognized \nnoncash franchise rights impairment charges of $105,630 to the Company’s powersports reporting unit resulting \nfrom its fourth quarter 2022 impairment tests.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception by evaluating if the asset is explicitly or \nimplicitly identified or distinct, if the Company will receive substantially all of the economic benefit or if the lessor \nhas an economic benefit and the ability to substitute the asset. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s \nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make \nlease payments arising from the lease. The Company assesses whether the lease is an operating or finance lease at \nits inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of the \nlease payments over the lease term. To calculate the present value, the Company uses the implicit rate in the lease \nwhen readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate is based on collateralized borrowings of similar assets \nwith terms that approximate the lease term when available and when collateralized rates are not available, it uses \nuncollateralized rates with similar terms adjusted for the fact that it is an unsecured rate. The operating lease ROU \nasset is the initial lease liability adjusted for any prepayments, initial indirect costs incurred by the Company, and \nlease incentives. The Company’s operating leases are included in right-of-use assets, current portion lease liabilities, \nand operating lease liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s finance leases are \nincluded in property and equipment and financing lease liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nOther Assets\nOther assets consist of various items, including long-term finance receivables, debt issuance costs associated \nwith lines of credit, lease deposits, and other long-term assets.\nAccrued Liabilities\nAccrued liabilities consist of various items payable within one year, including, among other items, accruals for \ncapital expenditures, sales tax, compensation and benefits, vehicle licenses and fees, interest expense, reserves for \nreturns and cancellations, and advertising expenses."

See Note 3 — Revenue for additional information on our significant accounting \npolicies related to revenue recognition.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of vehicle sales includes the cost to acquire vehicles and the reconditioning and transportation costs \nassociated with preparing the vehicles for resale. Reconditioning costs include parts, labor, overhead costs, and \nother vehicle repair expenses directly attributable to specific vehicles. Transportation costs consist of costs incurred \nto transport the vehicles from the point of acquisition. Cost of revenue also includes any necessary adjustments to \nreflect vehicle inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include costs and expenses for compensation and benefits, \nadvertising to consumers and dealers, development and operating our product procurement and distribution system, \nmanaging our logistics system, transportation cost associated with selling vehicles, establishing our dealer partner \narrangements, and other corporate overhead expenses, including expenses associated with technology development, \nlegal, accounting, finance, and business development.\nAdvertising and Marketing Expenses\nAdvertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and are included in Selling, general and \nadministrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Advertising and marketing \nexpenses were $31,327 and $14,425 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees and \nnon-employee directors. The Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date, based on the \nestimated fair value of the award, and recognizes the cost on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over \nthe grantee’s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. The Company estimates the \nfair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option valuation model while market-condition based awards are \nestimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as these awards are tied to a market condition. Key assumptions \nused in estimating the fair value of options are dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected \nterm.\nWe record deferred tax assets for awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the \namount of compensation expense recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive \na deduction. Differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual \ntax deduction reported on the income tax return are recorded in income tax expense. See Note 12 — Stockholders’ \nEquity for additional information on stock-based compensation.\nDefined Contribution Plan\nThe Company sponsors the RumbleOn, Inc. 401(k) Plan and RumbleOn 401(k) Plan (the “Retirement Savings \nPlans”), for eligible employees. Employees electing to participate in the Retirement Savings Plans may contribute \nup to 75% of their annual eligible compensation. The Company provides matching contributions for employee \ncontributions on a discretionary basis. Employer contributions to the plan, net of forfeitures, were approximately \n$192 and $722 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Employer contributions are included in selling, \ngeneral, and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations."

The respective carrying value of certain \non-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash, \nprepaid expenses and accounts payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and \npayables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are \npayable on demand.\nASC Topic 820-10-30-2, Fair Value Measurement establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in \nmeasuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by \nrequiring the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are from sources independent of \nthe Company, whereas unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs market participants \nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair \nvalue hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Other than quoted prices that are observable in the market for the asset or liability, either directly \nor indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or \nmodel-derived valuations or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for \nsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3: Inputs are unobservable and reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants \nwould use in pricing the asset or liability.\nEmbedded Conversion Features\nThe Company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815, Derivatives \nand Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (“ASC 815”) to determine whether the embedded conversion \nfeature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes \nin fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, \nthe instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (“ASC 470-20”). Under \nthe ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt \ninstruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s \neconomic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for our convertible debt instruments is that the \nequity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity on the \nconsolidated balance sheets and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes \nof accounting for the debt component of the notes. As a result, we are required to record non-cash interest expense \nas a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the convertible debt to their face amount over the \nterm of the convertible debt.\nFrom time to time, the Company has issued convertible notes that have conversion prices that create an \nembedded beneficial conversion feature pursuant to the guidelines established by the ASC 470-20. The Beneficial \nConversion Feature (“BCF”) of a convertible security is normally characterized as the convertible portion or feature \nof certain securities that provide a rate of conversion that is below market value or in-the-money when issued. The \nCompany records a BCF related to the issuance of a convertible security when issued and also records the estimated \nfair value of any conversion feature issued with those securities. Beneficial conversion features that are contingent \nupon the occurrence of a future event are recorded when the contingency is resolved. The debt discount is amortized \nto interest expense over the life of the note using the effective interest method. The Company calculates the fair value \nof the conversion feature embedded in any convertible security using an open-form binomial option pricing model \n(“lattice model”) that simulates, in a non-linear, risk-neutral framework, the stock price of the Company’s common \nstock."

Any warrants that (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) provide the \nCompany with a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share \nsettlement) provided that such warrants are indexed to the Company’s own stock is classified as equity. The \nCompany classifies as assets or liabilities any warrants that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement \nto net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the Company’s control), (ii) gives the \ncounterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement) or \n(iii) that contain reset provisions that do not qualify for the scope exception. The Company assesses classification \nof its common stock warrants at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between assets \nand liabilities is required. The Company’s freestanding derivatives financing satisfy the criteria for classification as \nequity instruments as these warrants do not contain cash settlement features or variable settlement provision that \ncause them to not be indexed to the Company’s own stock. There are 16,530 warrants to purchase common stock \noutstanding at December 31, 2022 consisting of: (i) 10,913 warrants issued to underwriters in connection with the \nOctober 23, 2017 public offering of Class B common stock; (ii) 5,617 warrants issued to a lender in connection \nwith the 2018 financings. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued warrants (the “Oaktree \nWarrants”) to purchase $40,000 of shares of Class B common stock to Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. and its \nlender affiliates connection with providing the debt financing for the RideNow transaction. In August 2021, the \nexercise price of the warrants was set at $33.00 per share and the aggregate number of shares of Class B common \nstock underlying the Oaktree Warrants was 1,212,121. During the third quarter of 2022, the exercise price of the \nwarrants were adjusted to $31.50 per share.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs are accounted for pursuant to FASB ASU 2015-3, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt \nIssuance Costs (“ASU 2015-3”). ASU 2015-3 requires that debt issuance costs be presented as a direct deduction \nfrom the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), for recording the provision for income \ntaxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement \nand income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset \nor liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes \nin the asset or liability each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or \nall of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets \nto the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in \nthe provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change. Deferred income taxes may arise from temporary \ndifferences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different \nperiods.\nThe Company applies a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties. ASC 740 only \nallows the recognition of those tax benefits that have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon \nexamination by the taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company reviewed its tax positions and \ndetermined there were no outstanding, or retroactive tax positions with less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained \nupon examination by the taxing authorities, therefore this standard has not had a material effect on the Company.\nThe Company does not anticipate any significant changes to its total unrecognized tax positions within the \nnext 12 months."

Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) \ncalculations are determined by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common \nstock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share calculations are determined by dividing \nnet income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents \noutstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in \nthe computation. Common share and dilutive common share equivalents include: (i) Class A common: (ii) Class B \ncommon; (iii) restricted stock units; (iv) stock options; (v) warrants to acquire Class B common stock; and \n(vi) shares issued in connection with convertible debt.\nRecent Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement \nof Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which amends the guidance on the impairment of financial \ninstruments by requiring measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 \nis effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, and \nearlier adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU \nNo. 2019-10, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases \n(Topic 842): Effective Dates (“ASU 2019-10”). The purpose of this amendment is to create a two-tier rollout of major \nupdates, staggering the effective dates between larger public companies and all other entities. This granted certain \nclasses of companies, including Smaller Reporting Companies (“SRCs”), additional time to implement major FASB \nstandards, including ASU 2016-13. Larger public companies had an effective date for fiscal years beginning after \nDecember 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. All other entities are permitted to defer adoption \nof ASU 2016-13, and its related amendments, until the earlier of fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2022. \nUnder the current SEC definitions, the Company meets the definition of an SRC as of the ASU 2019-10 issuance date \nand is adopting the deferral period for ASU 2016-13. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 for its fiscal year beginning \nJanuary 1, 2023, and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the \nEffects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” This ASU provides optional guidance for a limited time \nto ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new guidance provides optional expedients \nand exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by \nreference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts and hedging relationships \nthat reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued \ndue to reference rate reform. Additionally, entities can elect to continue applying hedge accounting for hedging \nrelationships affected by reference rate reform if certain conditions are met. In January 2021, the FASB issued \nASU 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope.” This ASU refines the scope of ASC 848 and clarifies \nsome of its guidance as part of the Board’s monitoring of global reference rate reform activities. The ASU permits \nentities to elect certain optional expedients and exceptions when accounting for derivative contracts and certain \nhedging relationships affected by changes in the interest rates used for discounting cash flows, for computing \nvariation margin settlements, and for calculating price alignment interest in connection with reference rate reform \nactivities. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the \nSunset Date of Topic 848.” This ASU defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, \n2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. These new standards were \neffective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications. While our senior secured \ndebt and many of our floorplan arrangements utilize LIBOR as a benchmark for calculating the applicable interest \nrate, some of our floorplan arrangements have already transitioned to utilizing an alternative benchmark rate. \nWe are continuing to evaluate the impact of the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates. We \ncannot predict the effect of the potential changes to or elimination of LIBOR, the establishment of alternative rates \nor benchmarks, and the corresponding effects on our cost of capital but do not expect a significant impact on our \nconsolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows."

Pursuant to the Plan of Merger and Equity Purchase Agreement, as amended (the “RideNow \nAgreement”), on the RideNow Closing Date, there were both mergers and transfers of ownership interests \ncomprising in aggregate the RideNow Transaction. For the mergers, five newly-created RumbleOn subsidiaries \nwere merged with and into five RideNow entities (“Merged RideNow Entities”) with the Merged RideNow Entities \ncontinuing as the surviving corporations and with the Company obtaining ownership of these entities through these \nmergers and the transfers noted below. Merged RideNow Entities owned powersports retail locations approximately \n30% of RideNow retail location. For the transfers of ownership interest, the Company acquired all the outstanding \nequity interests of 21 entities comprising the remaining 70% of the RideNow’s retail locations (“Acquired RideNow \nEntities”, and together with the Merged RideNow Entities, the “RideNow Entities”). As a result of the RideNow \nTransaction, the Company obtained 100% of the voting equity interests of the RideNow Entities.\nOn the RideNow Closing Date, RideNow equity holders received cash consideration of $400,400 and \n5,833,333 shares of RumbleOn’s Class B Common Stock, valued at $200,958 based on the close price of the \nCompany’s Class B Common Stock on the Closing Date. Additionally at closing, the Company paid $1,793 to \nsatisfy certain transaction expenses incurred by RideNow and effectively settled a $1,734 payable from RideNow \nto RumbleOn arising from vehicle sales from RumbleOn to RideNow in the ordinary course of business prior to the \nRideNow Closing Date. The Company also recorded a payable for amounts owed to RideNow equity holders. Cash \npaid, acquiree transaction expenses paid at closing, and elimination of the preexisting payable from RumbleOn all \napproximate their fair value due to short-term nature of these items.\nThe cash consideration for the RideNow Transaction was funded from (i) the Company’s underwritten public \noffering of 5,053,029 shares of Class B common stock, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $154,443 \n(the “August 2021 Offering”), and (ii) net proceeds of approximately $261,000 pursuant to the Oaktree Credit \nFacility entered into on the RideNow Closing Date (as further described in Note 10 - Notes Payable and Lines of \nCredit.

The preparation of the \nvaluation required the use of significant assumptions and estimates. Critical estimates included, but were not limited \nto, future expected cash flows, including projected revenues and expenses, and the applicable discount rates. These \nestimates were based on assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ \nfrom these estimates.\nThe Company uses the income approach to determine the fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets \nincluding franchise rights. This approach determines fair value by estimating after-tax cash flows attributable to \nthese assets over their respective useful lives and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. \nThe Company bases its assumptions on estimates of future cash flows, expected growth rates, retention factors, \netc. Discount rates used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition are based on the time value of \nmoney and certain industry-specific risk factors. The Company believes the estimated purchased franchise rights \nand non-compete agreements amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition, and do not \nexceed the amount a third-party would pay for such assets.\nThe following amounts represent the final determination of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired \nand liabilities assumed as a result of the RideNow Transaction.\nAssets acquired:\nCash . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ \n34,436\nContracts in transit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n10,878\nAccounts receivable  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n10,142\nInventory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n127,080\nPrepaid expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1,785\nRight-of-use assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n22,912\nRight-of-use assets – related parties . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n124,243\nProperty & equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n18,707\nFranchise rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n296,542\nOther intangible assets, net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n21,558\nOther assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n92\nTotal assets acquired . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n668,375\nLiabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n39,883\nNotes payable – floor plan  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n47,161\nLease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n22,912\nLease liabilities – related parties . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n106,966\nNotes payable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4,382\nNotes payable – related parties . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2,167\nDeferred tax liabilities  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n41,484\nOther long-term liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n6,210\nTotal liabilities assumed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n271,165\nTotal net assets acquired . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n397,210\nGoodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n207,675\nTotal consideration . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ \n604,885"

The transaction price for a powersports vehicle sale \nis determined with the customer at the time of sale. Customers often trade in their own powersports vehicle to apply \ntoward the purchase of a retail new or used powersports vehicle. The “trade-in” powersports vehicle is a type of \nnoncash consideration measured at fair value, based on external and internal market data for a specific powersports \nvehicle, and applied as payment of the contract price for the purchased powersports vehicle.\nWhen the Company sells a new or used powersports vehicle, transfer of control typically occurs at a point in \ntime upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer, which is generally at the time of sale, as the customer is able to \ndirect the use of and obtain substantially all benefits from the powersports vehicle at such time. Except for limited \ncircumstances, the Company does not directly finance its customer’s purchases or provide leasing. In many cases, the \nCompany arranges third- party financing for the retail sale or lease of powersports vehicles to customers in exchange \nfor a fee paid to the Company by a third-party financial institution. The Company receives payment directly from \nthe customer at the time of sale or from a third-party financial institution (referred to as contracts-in-transit) within a \nshort period of time following the sale. The Company establishes provisions, which are not significant, for estimated \nreturns and warranties on the basis of both historical information and current trends.\nParts and Service\nThe Company sells parts and vehicle services related to customer-paid repairs and maintenance, repairs and \nmaintenance under manufacturer warranties and extended service contracts, and collision-related repairs. The \nCompany also sells parts through wholesale and retail counter channels.\nEach repair and maintenance service is a single performance obligation that includes both the parts and labor \nassociated with the vehicle service. Payment for each vehicle service work is typically due upon completion of the \nservice, which is generally completed within a short period from contract inception. The transaction price for repair \nand maintenance services is based on the parts used, the number of labor hours applied, and standardized hourly \nlabor rates. The performance obligation for repair and maintenance service are satisfied over time and create an asset \nwith no alternative use and with an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Revenue is \nrecognized over time based on a direct measurement of labor hours, parts and accessories that are allocated to open \nservice and repair orders at the end of each reporting period. As a practical expedient, the time value of money is \nnot considered since repair and maintenance service contracts have a duration of one year or less. The transaction"

Payment is typically due at time of sale, or within a short period following the sale. \nThe Company establishes provisions, which are not significant, for estimated parts returns based on historical \ninformation and current trends. Delivery method of wholesale and retail counter parts vary.\nThe Company generally considers control of wholesale and retail counter parts to transfer when the products \nare shipped, which typically occurs the same day as or within a few days of sale. The Company also offers customer \nloyalty points for parts and services for select franchises. The Company satisfies its performance obligations \nand recognizes revenue when the loyalty points are redeemed. Amounts deferred related to the customer loyalty \nprograms are insignificant.\nFinance and Insurance\nThe Company sells and receives commissions on the following types of finance and insurance products: \nextended service contracts, maintenance programs, guaranteed auto protection, tire and wheel protection, and theft \nprotection products, among others. The Company offers products that are sold and administered by independent third \nparties, including the vehicle manufacturers’ captive finance subsidiaries.\nPursuant to the arrangements with these third-party providers, the Company sells the products on a commission \nbasis. For the majority of finance and insurance product sales, the Company’s performance obligation is to arrange \nfor the provision of goods and services by another party. The Company’s performance obligation is satisfied when this \narrangement is made, which is when the finance and insurance product is delivered to the end customer, generally \nat the time of the vehicle sale. As agent, the Company recognizes revenue in the amount of any fee or commission \nto which it expects to be entitled, which is the net amount of consideration that it retains after paying the third-party \nprovider the consideration received in exchange for the goods or services to be fulfilled by that party.\nThere are no significant judgements or estimates required in determining the satisfaction of the performance \nobligations or the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations. As revenue are recognized at a \npoint-in-time, costs to obtain the customer (i.e. commissions) do not require capitalization.\nVehicle Logistics\nVehicle logistics revenue is generated primarily by entering into freight brokerage agreements with dealers, \ndistributors, or private party individuals to transport vehicles from a point of origin to a designated destination. \nThe Company’s subsidiary, Wholesale Express, provides these services. The transaction price is based on the \nconsideration specified in the customer’s contract. A performance obligation is created when the customer under \na transportation contract submits a bill of lading for the transport of goods from origin to destination. These \nperformance obligations are satisfied as the shipments move from origin to destination. The freight brokerage \nagreements are fulfilled by independent third-party transporters. While the Company is primarily responsible \nfor fulfilling to customers, these transporters are obligated to meet our performance obligations and standards. \nPerformance obligations are short-term, with transit days less than one week. Generally, customers are billed either \nupon shipment of the vehicle or on a monthly basis, and remit payment according to approved payment terms, \ngenerally not to exceed 30 days. Revenue is recognized as risks and rewards of transportation of the vehicle are \ntransferred to the owner during delivery. Wholesale Express is considered the principal in the delivery transactions \nsince it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the service. As a result, revenue is recorded gross.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe significant majority of the Company’s revenue is from contracts with customers. In the following tables, \nrevenue is disaggregated by major lines of goods and services and timing of transfer of goods and services. We have \ndetermined that these categories depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash \nflows are affected by economic factors."

Floor plan notes payable-non-trade represents amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new \nand used vehicle inventories with non-trade lenders. Changes in vehicle floor plan notes payable-trade are reported \nas operating cash flows and changes in floor plan notes payable-non-trade are reported as financing cash flows in the \naccompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nNew inventory costs are generally reduced by manufacturer holdbacks, incentives, floor plan assistance, \nand non-reimbursement-based manufacturer advertising rebates, while the related vehicle floor plan payables are \nreflective of the gross cost of the vehicle. The vehicle floor plan payables, as shown in the above table, will generally \nalso be higher than the inventory cost due to the timing of the sale of a vehicle and payment of the related liability. \nVehicle floor plan facilities are due on demand, but in the case of new vehicle inventories, are generally paid within \nseveral business days after the related vehicles are sold. Vehicle floor plan facilities are primarily collateralized by \nvehicle inventories and related receivables.\nNew vehicle floor plan facilities generally utilize Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or Average \nDaily Balance (“ADB”)-based interest rates, which generally ranged between 7% and 16% as of December 31, 2022. \nUsed vehicle floor plan facilities generally utilize prime, SOFR or ADB-based interest rates, which ranged between \n6% and 16% as of December 31, 2022. The aggregate capacity to finance our inventory under the new and used \nvehicle floor plan facilities was $407,680 as of December 31, 2022. The Company cannot predict the effect of the \ndiscontinuance of LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks on interest expense as of \nDecember 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating alternative benchmarks, which may include the SOFR.\nInventory serves as collateral under floor plan notes payable borrowings. The inventory balance in its entirety \nalso serves as collateral under the Oaktree Credit Facility. Refer to Note 10 - Notes Payable and Lines of Credit for \nfurther detail."

For each lease agreement, the Company determines its lease term as the non-cancellable period of \nthe lease and includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that \noption. We use these options in determining our capitalized financing and right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. \nOur lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. To \ndetermine the discount rate to use in determining the present value of the lease payments, we use the rate implicit in \nthe lease if determinable, otherwise we use our incremental borrowing rate.\nThe following table reflects the balance sheet presentation of our lease assets and liabilities:\nLeases\nBalance Sheet Classification\n2022\n2021\nAssets:\nOperating . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

This voluntary change was made to better \nalign the timing of the assessment with the Company’s planning and forecasting process that now incorporates the \noperations of the Freedom Entities and RideNow that were acquired in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and to give \nthe Company additional time to complete the annual assessment in advance of year-end reporting. The Company \ncommenced its annual impairment process as of October 1, 2022. In addition, the Company updated its quantitative \nimpairment testing for goodwill and franchise rights, an indefinite-lived intangible asset as of December 31, 2022 \nbecause a triggering event was identified due to declines in the Company’s market capitalization and other factors \noccurring in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAs part of the impairment testing process, the Company considered a number of factors including, but not \nlimited to, current macroeconomic conditions such as inflation, economic growth, and interest rate movements, \nindustry and market considerations, stock price performance (including performance relative to peers), and financial \nperformance of the Company’s reporting units. The aggregate results of the Company’s fourth quarter assessments \nresulted in (i) noncash goodwill impairment charges of $26,039 to the Company’s automotive reporting unit and \n$218,646 to the Company’s powersports reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2022, and (ii) noncash \nfranchise rights impairment charges of $105,630 to the Company’s powersports reporting unit.\nOther definite-lived intangibles of $23,795 is primarily comprised of assets related to non-compete \nagreements as of December 31, 2022. The Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment at least annually, \nor when triggering events occur.

      "text": "F-32\nRumbleOn, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nNOTE 10 — NOTES PAYABLE AND LINES OF CREDIT (cont.)\nFloor plan notes payable-trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new and, to \na lesser extent, used vehicle inventory with corresponding manufacturers’ captive finance subsidiaries (“trade \nlenders”). Floor plan notes payable-non-trade represents amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new \nand used vehicle inventories with non-trade lenders. Changes in vehicle floor plan notes payable- trade are reported \nas operating cash flows and changes in floor plan notes payable-non-trade are reported as financing cash flows in the \naccompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nNew inventory costs are generally reduced by manufacturer holdbacks, incentives, floor plan assistance, \nand non-reimbursement-based manufacturer advertising rebates, while the related vehicle floor plan payables are \nreflective of the gross cost of the vehicle. The vehicle floor plan payables, as shown in the above table, will generally \nalso be higher than the inventory cost due to the timing of the sale of a vehicle and payment of the related liability. \nVehicle floor plan facilities are due on demand, but in the case of new vehicle inventories, are generally paid within \nseveral business days after the related vehicles are sold. Vehicle floor plan facilities are primarily collateralized by \nvehicle inventories and related receivables.\nNew vehicle floor plan facilities generally utilize LIBOR or ADB (Average Daily Balance)-based interest \nrates, which generally ranged between 7% and 16% as of December 31, 2022. Used vehicle floor plan facilities \ngenerally utilize prime, LIBOR or ADB-based interest rates, which ranged between 6% and 16% as of December 31, \n2022. The aggregate capacity to finance our inventory under the new and used vehicle floor plan facilities was \n$407,680 as of December 31, 2022.\nTerm Loan Credit Agreement\nOn the RideNow Closing Date, the Company entered into a new Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Oaktree \nCredit Agreement”) among the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, and Oaktree Fund Administration, \nLLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent (the “Administrative Agent”). The Oaktree Credit Agreement \nprovides for secured credit facilities in the form of a $280,000 principal amount of initial term loans (the “Initial \nTerm Loan Facility”) and a $120,000 in aggregate principal amount of delayed draw term loans (the “Delayed Draw \nTerm Loans Facility”). The proceeds from the Initial Term Loan Facility was used to consummate the RideNow \nTransaction and to provide for working capital. Loans under the Delayed Draw Term Loans Facility are subject \nto customary conditions precedent for facilities of this type including the need to meet certain financial tests and \nbecome available six (6) months after the RideNow Closing Date and are unavailable to be drawn after the eighteen \n(18) month anniversary of the RideNow Closing Date.\nOn February 18, 2022, in conjunction the Freedom Transaction, the Company drew down $84,500 against the \nOaktree Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Oaktree Credit Agreement provides for up to $120,000, \nof which $35,500 is available, in additional financing that may be used for acquisitions and up to an additional \n$100,000 in incremental financing that may be used for acquisitions or working capital purposes. During the fourth \nquarter of 2022, the Company made a voluntary principal repayment of $15,000 to the Oaktree Credit Facility.\nThe loan is reported on the balance sheet as senior secured debt net of debt discount and debt issuance costs \nof $24,927, including the fair value of stock warrant of $10,950. Borrowings under the Oaktree Credit Facility bear \ninterest at a rate per annum equal, at the Company’s option, to either (a) LIBOR (with a floor of 1.00%), plus an \napplicable margin of 8.25% or (b) a fluctuating adjusted base rate in effect from time to time, plus an applicable \nmargin of 7.25%. At the Company’s option, one percent (1.00%) of such interest may be payable in kind. The interest \nrate on December 31, 2022, was 11.92%. Interest expense for the year December 31, 2022 was $42,211, which \nincluded amortization of $6,411 related to the discount and debt issuance costs. While the Oaktree Credit Agreement \nnotes that SOFR may be selected as the alternative benchmark rate, this has not been determined as of December 31, \n2022. As such, the Company cannot predict the effect of the discontinuance of LIBOR or the establishment and use \nof alternative rates or benchmarks on interest expense as of December 31, 2022."

The Subsidiary Guarantors also guarantee the \nobligations of the Company under the Oaktree Credit Agreement.\nIn connection with providing the debt financing for the RideNow Transaction, and pursuant to the commitment \nletter executed on March 15, 2021, the Company issued a warrant to purchase $40,000 of shares at an exercise \nprice of $33.00 per share of Class B common stock to Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. and its lender affiliates \n(the “Warrant”). During the third quarter of 2022, the exercise price of the Warrant was adjusted to $31.50 and \nthe expiration date was extended to July 25, 2023. The initial warrant liability and deferred financing charge \nrecognized was $10,950. The warrant liability is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any change \nin fair value is recognized as a component of the change in derivative liability in the Consolidated Statements of \nOperations. The fair value of the Warrant was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation based on a combination of \nlevel 1 and level 2 inputs. Upon closing of the RideNow Transaction, the warrants were considered equity linked \ncontracts indexed to the Company’s stock and therefore met the equity classification guidance. As a result, the \n$19,700 was reclassified to additional paid-in-capital. The $10,950 deferred financing charge was reclassified \nas part of the debt discount related to the Oaktree Credit Agreement. The recognition of the warrant liability and \ndeferred financing charge and the reclassification of the warrant liability to additional paid-in capital and the \nreclassification of the deferred financing charge to debt discount are non-cash items.\nOaktree provided customary representations and covenants under the Oaktree Credit Agreement which include \nfinancial covenants and collateral performance covenants.\nRumbleOn Finance Line of Credit\nOn February 4, 2022, RumbleOn Finance and ROF SPV I, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of RumbleOn, entered \ninto a Consumer Finance Facility primarily to provide up to $25,000 for the underwriting of consumer loans \nunderwritten by ROF. Credit Suisse is the managing agent of the loan agreement, and RumbleOn Finance is the \nborrower. All loans under this agreement are secured by certain collateral including the consumer finance loans \npurchased by the ROF Consumer Finance Facility.\nCredit Suisse provided customary representations and covenants under the agreements which include financial \ncovenants and collateral performance covenants. Loans sold to or in the ROF Consumer Finance Facility are subject \nto certain eligibility criteria, concentration limits and reserves.\nFloor Plan Notes Payable\nThe Company relies on its floorplan vehicle financing credit lines (“Floorplan Lines”) to finance new and \nused vehicle inventory at its retail locations and for the wholesale segment. Floor plan notes payable — trade reflects \namounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new and, to a lesser extent, used vehicle inventory with \ncorresponding manufacturers’ captive finance subsidiaries (“trade lenders”). Floor plan notes payable-non-trade \nrepresents amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new and used vehicle inventories with non-trade \nlenders. Changes in vehicle floor plan notes payable- trade are reported as operating cash flows and changes in floor \nplan notes payable-non-trade are reported as financing cash flows in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of \nCash Flows.\nInventory serves as collateral under floor plan notes payable borrowings. The inventory balance in its entirety \nalso serves as collateral under the Oaktree Credit Agreement."

The conversion rate is \nsubject to adjustment in certain events as set forth in the New Indenture but will not be adjusted for any accrued \nand unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a “make-whole fundamental change” (as defined in the \nNew Indenture), the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional \nshares for a holder that elects to convert its New Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. \nBefore July 1, 2024, the New Notes will be convertible only under circumstances as described in the New Indenture. \nNo adjustment to the conversion rate as a result of conversion or a make-whole fundamental change adjustment will \nresult in a conversion rate greater than 62.0 shares per $1,000 in principal amount.\nThe New Indenture contains a “blocker provision” which provides that no holder (other than the depository \nwith respect to the notes) or beneficial owner of a New Note shall have the right to receive shares of the Class B \nCommon Stock upon conversion to the extent that, following receipt of such shares, such holder or beneficial owner \nwould be the beneficial owner of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of the Class B Common Stock.\nThe New Notes are subject to events of default typical for this type of instrument. If an event of default, \nother than an event of default in connection with certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of \nthe Company or any significant subsidiary, occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or \nthe holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding New Notes by notice to the Company and the \nTrustee, may declare 100.0% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the New Notes then \noutstanding to be due and payable. The New Notes also contain conversion features related to certain events, which \ninclude liquidation or dissolution, as well as fundamental changes to the structure or ownership of the Company.\nIn connection with the 2020 Note Offering, on January 14, 2020, the Company entered into a registration \nrights agreement with the Note Investors, pursuant to which the Company has agreed to file with the SEC a shelf \nregistration statement registering the sale, on a continuous or delayed basis, of all of the New Notes and to use its \ncommercially reasonable efforts to cause the shelf registration statement to become or be declared effective under \nthe Securities Act no later than May 29, 2020 (which date was adjusted for certain intervening events, including \nthe COVID-19 pandemic). The registration statement was filed on June 19, 2020 and declared effective on June 30, \n2020. In connection with the filing of the registration statement, the Company deregistered the Old Notes previously \nregistered for resale.\nThe Company accounted for the exchange of the Old Notes and the issuance of the New Notes in accordance \nwith the conversion guidance in ASC 470-20 “Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Option” (“ASC 470-20”) \nand determined that the exchange of the Old Notes for the New Notes required derecognition of the Old Notes \ngiven that the difference in the fair value of the embedded the conversion feature of the New Notes relative to the \nOld Notes was in excess of 10 percent of the Old Notes conversion feature fair value. In derecognizing the Old \nNotes, the Company recognized a gain of $188 equal to difference between the fair value of the Old Notes liability \nimmediately prior to extinguishment and the carry amount of the liability component of the Old Notes, including \nany all-unamortized debt issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2020. The remaining consideration of \n$2,593 was allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component and recognized as a reduction of stockholder’s \nequity during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe New Notes are not redeemable by the Company before January 14, 2023. The Company may redeem \nfor cash all or any portion of the Convertible Senior Notes, at its option, on or after January 14, 2023 if the last \nreported sale price of the Class B common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for"

In the case \nof time or service based RSU awards, the fair value based on the share price of the Class B Common Stock on \nthe date of the award.

The initial Warrant liability \nand deferred financing charge recognized was $10,950. The warrant liability was subject to remeasurement at each \nbalance sheet date and any change in fair value was recognized as a component of change in derivative liability \nin the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of the Warrant was estimated using a Monte Carlo \nsimulation based on a combination of level 1 and level 2 inputs. There was no gain or loss recorded related to the \nWarrant liability during the three-months ended March 31, 2021 as there was no significant changes in the fair \nvalue between March 12, 2021 and March 31, 2021.

On August 31, 2021, the fair value of the warrant liability \nwas increased $6,526 to $19,700. Upon closing of the RideNow transaction, the Oaktree warrants were considered \nequity linked contracts indexed to RumbleOn’s stock and therefore met the equity classification guidance under \nASC 815-40. As a result, the $19,700 was reclassified to additional paid-in-capital. The $10,950 deferred financing \ncharge was reclassified as part of the debt discount related to the Oaktree Credit Agreement. The recognition of the \nwarrant liability and deferred financing charge and the reclassification of the warrant liability to additional paid-in \ncapital and the reclassification of the deferred financing charge to debt discount are non-cash items.\nNOTE 13 — COMMON STOCK WARRANTS\nIn connection with the October 23, 2017 public offering of 145,500 shares of Class B common stock, the \nCompany issued to underwriters warrants to purchase 10,913 shares of Class B common stock, which was equal to \n7.5% of the aggregate number of shares of Class B common stock sold in the Offering. The Warrants are exercisable \nat a per share price of $126.50, which was equal to 115.0% of the Offering price per share of the shares sold in the \nOffering and expire on April 20, 2023.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is \ndependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences become \ndeductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of future deferred tax assets, projected future taxable \nincome, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In estimating future taxable income, the Company \nrelies upon assumptions and estimates about future activities, including the amount of future federal and state pretax \noperating income that the Company will generate; the reversal of temporary differences; and the implementation \nof feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. Based on this analysis, and as a result of the future taxable income \ngenerated by the RideNow acquisition, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that its deferred \ntax assets will be realized, and accordingly released its full valuation allowance of $23,742 during 2021.\nThe Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon its ability to realize the deferred \ntax assets. Management evaluated the realizability of the Company’s state net operating loss carryforwards and made \nthe decision to record a valuation allowance against certain state net operating losses as it is more likely than not \nthat the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the changes in the Company’s state footprint as a result of the \nplanned repositioning associated with the wholesale business. Accordingly, a valuation allowance of $708 has been \nestablished against these state net operating losses. Management reevaluates the positive and negative evidence at \neach reporting period.\nChanges in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and \n2021 related primarily to the increase in state net operating loss carryforwards in 2022, and release of the Company’s \nvaluation allowance in 2021 were as follows:\n2022\n2021\nValuation allowance as of beginning of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ \n—\n23,742\nIncreases recorded to income tax provision . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n708\n—\nDecreases recorded as a benefit to income tax provision . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n—\n(23,742)\nValuation allowance as of end of year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ \n708\n$ \n—\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of $73,213 \nand $91,246, all of which were generated in years ending after December 31, 2017 and can be carried forward \nindefinitely. The Company’s state net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2022 are $19,852, a \nportion of which begin to expire in 2029. As a result of various ownership changes, the Company’s federal and \nstate net operating losses are subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382. Pursuant \nto the Company’s Section 382 analysis, the net operating losses generated prior to 2017 were determined to be not \nrealizable as they arose from a different trade or business and were written off as part of the Company’s income tax"

Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of any legal actions, either \nindividually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, \nliquidity, and capital resources.\nFuture litigation may be necessary to defend the Company by determining the scope, enforceability and \nvalidity of third-party proprietary rights or to establish its own proprietary rights. The results of any current or future \nlitigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on \nthe Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nOn November 8, 2022, the Company reached a comprehensive global and binding settlement agreement \nwith former primary RideNow owners. The settlement agreement resolved all claims which were pending before \nthe Delaware Chancery Court, released certain potential and future claims between the parties, and resulted in no \nincremental consideration exchanging hands.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred $8,381 in charges for a settlement reached \nwith former minority shareholders of RideNow.

We intend to sell the loan portfolio held at RumbleOn Finance \nand pay off the outstanding balance during the next 60 days."
