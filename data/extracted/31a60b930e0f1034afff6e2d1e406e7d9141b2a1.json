Business: \nWeis Markets, Inc. is a Pennsylvania business founded by Harry and Sigmund Weis in 1912 and incorporated in 1924. \nThe Company is engaged principally in the retail sale of food in Pennsylvania and surrounding states. There was no \nmaterial change in the nature of the Company’s business during fiscal 2022. The Company’s stock has been traded on \nthe New York Stock Exchange since 1965 under the symbol “WMK.”  The Weis family currently owns approximately \n65% of the outstanding shares. Jonathan H. Weis serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief \nExecutive Officer. \nThe Company’s retail food stores sell groceries, dairy products, frozen foods, meats, seafood, fresh produce, floral, \npharmacy services, deli products, prepared foods, bakery products, beer and wine, fuel and general merchandise items, \nsuch as health and beauty care and household products. The store product selection includes national, local and private \nbrands including natural, gluten-free and organic varieties. The Company advertises its products and promotes its brand \nthrough digital and printed circulars; radio ads; e-mail blasts; and on-line via its web site, social media and mobile \napplications. The Company promotes competitive pricing by using Everyday Lower Price; Low Price Guarantee; Low, \nLow Price; 3 Day Sale; senior and military discounts; and Loyalty programs. The Loyalty program includes reward \npoints that may be redeemed for discounts on items in store, at the Company’s fuel stations or one of its third-party fuel \nstation partners. The Company currently owns and operates 197 retail food stores many of which have on-line order \ncustomer service. The Company’s operations are reported as a single reportable segment. The majority of the \nCompany’s revenues are generally not seasonal in nature. However, revenues tend to be higher during the major \nholidays throughout the year. Additionally, significant inclement weather systems, particularly winter storms, tend to \naffect sales trends. \nThe following table provides additional detail on the percentage of consolidated net sales contributed by product \ncategory for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively: \n    \n2022 \n    \n2021 \n    \n2020 \n    \nCenter Store (1)\n54.7 %  \n54.9 %  \n57.7 %\nFresh (2)\n30.0\n31.1\n30.5\nPharmacy Services\n9.4\n9.4\n8.7\nFuel\n5.6\n4.4\n2.9\nOther\n0.3\n0.2\n0.2\nConsolidated net sales\n100.0 %  \n100.0 %  \n100.0 %\n \n(1) Consists primarily of groceries, dairy products, frozen foods, beer and wine, and general merchandise items, such as health and \nbeauty care and household products. \n(2) Consists primarily of meats, seafood, fresh produce, floral, deli products, prepared foods and bakery products. \nAt the end of 2022, Weis Markets, Inc. operated 3 stores in Delaware, 49 stores in Maryland, 6 stores in New Jersey, 9 \nstores in New York, 118 stores in Pennsylvania, 9 stores in Virginia and 3 stores in West Virginia, for a total of 197 \nretail food stores operating under the Weis Markets trade name."

      "text": "WEIS MARKETS, INC. \n2 \nItem 1.   Business: (continued) \nAll retail food store locations operate as conventional supermarkets. The retail food stores range in size from 8,000 to \n71,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 49,000 square feet. The Company’s store fleet includes a \nvariety of sizes with a few locations in operation since the 1950’s; all stores are branded Weis Markets and provide the \nsame basic offerings scaled to the size of each store. The following summarizes the number of stores by size categories \nas of year-end: \n \n   \n2022 \n   \n2022 \n   \n2021 \n   \n2021 \nSquare feet \n Number of stores  % of Total  Number of stores  % of Total\nOver 55,000\n64\n32%\n62\n32%\n45,000 to 54,999\n70\n36%\n70\n35%\n35,000 to 44,999\n46\n23%\n47\n24%\n25,000 to 34,999\n12\n6%\n12\n6%\nUnder 25,000\n5\n3%\n5\n3%\nTotal\n197\n100%\n196\n100%\n \nThe Company believes that opening new stores and remodeling current stores are vital for future Company growth. The \nlocation and appearance of its stores are important components of attracting new and retaining current customers. On an \naverage basis, the Company has two to three new/relocated stores in the process of being developed and dedicates one \nthird of its capital expenditure budget to new stores annually, excluding acquisitions. Generally, another fifteen to \ntwenty percent of the capital expenditure budget is dedicated to store remodels while the remainder is attributable to \nsupply chain, technology, smaller in-store sales-driven projects, store maintenance and store support function \nexpenditures. See the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section included in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and \nAnalysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more details regarding the Company’s capital \nexpenditures. \nThe following schedule shows the changes in the number of retail food stores, total square footage and store \nadditions/remodels as of year-end: \n \n   \n2022 \n   \n2021 \n   \n2020 \n   \n2019 \n   \n2018 \nBeginning store count\n196\n196\n198\n202\n205\nNew/relocated stores\n2\n4\n2\n1\n2\nClosed/relocated stores\n(1)\n(4)\n(4)\n(5)\n(5)\nEnding store count\n197\n196\n196\n198\n202\nTotal square feet (000’s), at year-end\n9,710\n9,617\n9,568\n9,642\n9,800\nAdditions/major remodels\n9\n13\n13\n12\n3\n \nUtilizing its own strategically located distribution center and transportation fleet, Weis Markets self distributes \napproximately 63% of product supplied to stores with the remaining being supplied by direct store vendors and regional \nwholesalers. In addition, the Company has three manufacturing facilities which process milk, ice cream and fresh meat \nproducts. The corporate offices are located in Sunbury, Pennsylvania where the Company was founded in 1912."

      "text": "WEIS MARKETS, INC. \n3 \nItem 1.   Business: (continued) \nThe Company strives to be good stewards of the environment and makes this an important part of its overall mission. Its \nsustainability strategy operates under four key pillars: green design, natural resource conservation, food and agricultural \nimpact and social responsibility. The goal of the sustainability strategy is to reduce the Company’s overall carbon \nfootprint by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing the impact on climate change. The Company continues to \nbe a member of the EPA GreenChill program for advancing environmentally beneficial refrigerant management systems. \nThe Company currently has eighteen stores registered under this program and plans to expand this program to more \nstores. Since 2016, the Company has replaced 100% of its tractor fleet with more fuel-efficient and lower-emission \ntractors. The Company continues to emphasize recycling in all areas, most recently noting a decrease in store waste \nwhere the Company has diverted 45 thousand tons of waste from landfills. These statistics and more can be found in the \nCompany’s most recently published sustainability report, linked below in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and \nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \nThe Company operates in a highly competitive marketplace. The number and the variety of competitors vary by market. \nThe Company’s principal competition consists of international, national, regional and local food chains, as well as \nindependent food stores. The Company also faces substantial competition from convenience stores, membership \nwarehouse clubs, specialty retailers, supercenters and large-scale drug and pharmaceutical chains. This competition is \naugmented by the food retail industry’s expansion into the online market in recent years. The Company continues to \neffectively compete by offering a strong combination of value, quality and service.  The Company offers Weis 2 Go \ncurbside pickup and delivery, further enhancing service offerings and providing additional convenience to customers. \nHuman Capital. The Company believes that talent is a business differentiator and is committed to creating a sustainable \ncompetitive advantage through the selection, development and promotion of talented, highly motivated people. The \nCompany believes that establishing a learning culture supports its commitment to be an employer of choice and helps \ndrive customer engagement with its associates. Improvements in the Company’s talent management and development \nwill help drive business impact while providing internal career opportunities. The Company continues to grow leaders at \nevery level throughout the organization by creating a culture of mentoring, coaching and leveraging on-the-job \nassignments for continued development. The Company believes that a strong employment brand is necessary to attract \nand retain top talent and affects its ability to compete and execute strategic plans. The Company will continue to assess \nand upgrade underlying technologies to support human capital development as a strategic imperative for future growth. \nThe Company currently employs approximately 23,000 full-time and part-time associates. Approximately 97% of Weis \nMarkets associates are paid an hourly wage. \nTrade Names and Trademarks. The Company has invested significantly in the development and protection of “Weis \nMarkets” both as a trade name and a trademark and considers it to be an important asset. The Company is the exclusive \nlicensee of nearly 100 trademarks registered and/or pending in the United States Patent and Trademark Office from \nWMK Holdings, Inc., including trademarks for its product lines and promotions such as Weis, Weis 2 Go, Weis Great \nMeals Start Here, Weis Gas-n-Go and Weis Nutri-Facts. Each trademark registration is for an initial period of 10 years \nand may be renewed so long as it is in continued use in commerce. \nThe Company considers its trademarks to be of material importance to its business and actively defends and enforces its \nrights. \nThe Company maintains a corporate web site at www.weismarkets.com/investor-relations. The Company makes \navailable, free of charge, on the “Investor Relations” page of its web site, its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly \nreports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to \nSection 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such \nmaterial or furnishes it to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by clicking on the “SEC Information” \nlink."

      "text": "WEIS MARKETS, INC. \n4 \nItem 1.   Business: (continued) \nThe Company’s Corporate Governance materials can be found on the “Governance” page of its web site.  These \nmaterials include the Corporate Governance Guidelines; the Charters of the Audit, Compensation and Disclosure \nCommittees; and both the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the Code of Ethics for the CEO and CFO. A copy of \nthe foregoing corporate governance materials is available upon written request to the Company’s principal executive \noffices. \n \nItem 1a.   Risk Factors: \nCompetitive and Reputational Risks \nThe Company’s industry is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to compete effectively, the Company’s \nfinancial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. \nThe retail food industry is intensely price competitive, and the competition the Company encounters may have a \nnegative impact on product retail prices. The operating environment continues to be characterized by aggressive \nexpansion, entry of non-traditional competitors, market consolidation and increasing fragmentation of retail and online \nformats. The introduction of on-line food retail in recent years has augmented competition in industry. The financial \nresults may be adversely impacted by a competitive environment that could cause the Company to reduce retail prices \nwithout a reduction in its product cost to maintain market share; thus, reducing sales and gross profit margins. \nFood safety issues could result in the loss of consumer confidence in the Company. \nCustomers count on the Company to provide them with safe and wholesome food products. Concerns regarding the \nsafety of food products sold in its stores could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from the Company, \nor to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of the \nCompany’s control. A loss in confidence on the part of its customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As \nsuch, any issue regarding the safety of any food items sold by the Company, regardless of the cause, could have a \nsubstantial and adverse effect on operations. \nThe Company may be unable to retain key management personnel. \nThe Company’s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of senior management. The \nloss of any key member of management may prevent the Company from implementing its business plans in a timely \nmanner. In addition, employment conditions specifically may affect the Company’s ability to hire and train qualified \nassociates. \nFinancial, Investments and Infrastructure Risks \nThe failure to execute expansion plans could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and \nresults of its operations. \nCircumstances outside the Company’s control could negatively impact anticipated capital investments in store, \ndistribution and manufacturing projects, information technology and equipment. The Company cannot determine with \ncertainty whether its new or acquired stores will meet expected benefits including, among other things, operating \nefficiencies, procurement savings, innovation, sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for \nfuture growth. Achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, \nincluding, without limitation, the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential \nsynergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses and delays diverting management’s time and attention and \ncompetitive factors in the marketplace."

      "text": "WEIS MARKETS, INC. \n5 \nItem 1a.   Risk Factors: (continued) \nThe Company’s investment portfolio may suffer losses from changes in market interest rates and changes in \nmarket conditions which could adversely affect results of operations and liquidity. \nThe Company’s marketable securities consist of corporate and municipal bonds, commercial paper and equity securities. \nThese investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. As a result, the Company may \nexperience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity from investments, which may have a negative impact on the \nCompany’s financial condition and results of operations. \nUnexpected factors affecting self-insurance claims and reserve estimates could adversely affect the Company. \nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ \ncompensation, general liability, vehicle accident, property and associate medical benefit claims. Management estimates \nthe liabilities associated with the risks retained by the Company, in part, by considering historical claims experience, \ndemographic and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions which, by their nature, are subject to a high degree of \nvariability. Any projection of losses concerning workers’ compensation and general liability is subject to a high degree \nof variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, \nlitigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. \nInformation Security, Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Risks \nDisruptions or cybersecurity breaches in the Company’s information technology systems could adversely affect \nresults of operations. \nThe Company’s business is highly dependent on complex information technology systems that are vital to its continuing \noperations. If the Company was to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems, \nsignificant losses could be incurred due to disruptions in its operations. Additionally, these systems contain valuable \nproprietary data as well as receipt and storage of personal information about its associates and customers, in particular \nelectronic payment data and personal health information that, if breached, would have an adverse effect on the \nCompany. Such an occurrence could adversely affect the Company’s reputation with its customers, associates, and \nvendors, as well as the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity with potential litigation \nagainst the Company or the imposition of penalties. \nSupply Chain and Third-Party Risks \nThe Company is affected by certain operating costs which could increase or fluctuate considerably. \nAssociate expenses contribute to the majority of the Company’s operating costs. The Company’s financial performance \nis potentially affected by increasing wage and benefit costs, a competitive labor market, regulatory wage increases and \nthe risk of unionized labor disruptions of its non-union workforce. The Company’s profit is particularly sensitive to the \ncost of oil. Oil prices directly affect the Company’s product transportation costs, as well as its utility and petroleum-\nbased supply costs. It also affects the costs of its suppliers, which impacts its cost of goods. \nChanges in vendor promotions or allowances, including the way vendors target their promotional spending, and \nthe Company’s ability to effectively manage these programs could significantly impact margins and profitability. \nThe Company cooperatively engages in a variety of promotional programs with its vendors. As the parties assess the \nresults of specific promotions and plan for future promotions, the nature of these programs and the allocation of dollars \namong them changes over time. The Company manages these programs to maintain or improve margins while at the \nsame time increasing sales. A reduction in overall promotional spending or a shift by vendors in promotional spending \naway from certain types of promotions that the Company and its customers have historically utilized could have a \nsignificant impact on profitability."

      "text": "WEIS MARKETS, INC. \n6 \nItem 1a.   Risk Factors: (continued) \nLegal, Regulatory and Other External Risks \nThe trade area of the Company is located within a region and is subject to the economic, social and climate \nvariables of that region. \nThe majority of the Company’s stores are concentrated in central and northeast Pennsylvania, central Maryland, \nsuburban Washington, DC and Baltimore regions and New York’s Southern Tier. Changes in economic and social \nconditions in the Company’s operating regions, including fluctuations in the inflation rate along with changes in \npopulation and employment and job growth rates and changes in government benefits such as SNAP/EBT or child care \ncredits, affect customer shopping habits. Business disruptions due to weather and catastrophic events historically have \nbeen few. The Company’s geographic regions could receive an extreme variance in the amount of annual snowfall that \nmay materially affect sales and expense results. \nVarious aspects of the Company’s business are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. \nThe Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices that affect the \nCompany’s business. The Company must comply with numerous provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, \nfood labeling, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food, drugs and alcoholic \nbeverages. The Company’s compliance with these regulations may require additional capital expenditures and could \nadversely affect the Company’s ability to conduct the Company’s business as planned. Management cannot predict \neither the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or the effect either additional government \nregulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state, and local regulatory schemes \nwould have on the Company’s future business. They could, however, require the reformulation of certain products to \nmeet new standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record \nkeeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling and/or scientific \nsubstantiation. Any or all of such requirements could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, \nresults of operations and liquidity. \nChanges in tax laws may result in higher income tax. \nThe Company’s future effective tax rate may increase from current rates due to changes in laws and the status of pending \nitems with various taxing authorities. Currently, the Company benefits from a combination of its corporate structure and \ncertain state tax laws. \nThe Company is a controlled Company due to the common stock holdings of the Weis family. \nThe Weis family’s share ownership represents approximately 65% of the combined voting power of the Company’s \ncommon stock as of December 31, 2022. As a result, the Weis family has the power to elect a majority of the Company’s \ndirectors and approve any action requiring the approval of the shareholders of the Company, including adopting certain \namendments to the Company’s charter and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of the Company’s assets. \nCurrently, one of the Company’s five directors is a member of the Weis family."

Risk Factors: (continued) \nThe Company’s business and operations, and the operations of the Company’s suppliers, have been, and may in \nthe future be adversely affected by epidemics or pandemics such as the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic \noutbreak. \nThe Company may face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics or other outbreaks of communicable diseases. \nThe global spread of COVID-19 created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The Company’s \nbusiness was deemed essential during the novel coronavirus pandemic and the Company is committed to maintaining a \nsafe work and shopping environment. Management cannot assess the ultimate economic impact to the Company, which \nwill be determined by, among other things, the length of time that such circumstances occur, nor can the Company \npredict the effects of governmental and public responses to changing conditions. The risks and uncertainties surrounding \nthe coronavirus pandemic, as well as any future pandemics, are broad; however, below is a list of risks management is \nmonitoring which could have a material impact on the Company’s business: \n• \nEmployees – Reduced workforces due to the temporary inability to work caused by illness, quarantine, or \ngovernment mandates. \n• \nSupply Chain – Interruption in the Company’s supply chain due to the novel coronavirus. \n• \nLawsuits – Future litigation arising from issues concerning the novel coronavirus. \n• \nFuture government regulation – Future laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications \nthat may have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and liquidity. \n• \nCustomer trends – Changes in the methods in which customers procure the Company’s products. \n• \nCyber security – Increased cyber-attacks due to “work at home” requirements. \n \nItem 1b.   Unresolved Staff Comments: \nThere are no unresolved staff comments. \n \nItem 2.   Properties: \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company owned and operated 101 of its retail food stores and leased and operated 96 \nstores under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2036. The Company owns all trade fixtures and \nequipment in its stores and several parcels of vacant land, which are available as locations for possible future stores or \nother expansion. \nThe Company owns and operates one distribution center in Milton, Pennsylvania of approximately 1.3 million square \nfeet, and one in Northumberland, Pennsylvania totaling approximately 76 thousand square feet. The Company also owns \none warehouse complex in Sunbury, Pennsylvania totaling approximately 535 thousand square feet. The Company \nutilizes 258 thousand square feet of its Sunbury location to operate its three manufacturing facilities which process milk, \nice cream and fresh meat products. \n \nItem 3.   Legal Proceedings: \nNeither the Company nor any subsidiary is presently a party to, nor is any of their property subject to, any pending legal \nproceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to the business that would not have a material adverse effect on the \nfinancial results. The Company estimates any exposure to these legal proceedings and establishes accruals for the \nestimated liabilities, where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable. \n \nItem 4.

      "text": "WEIS MARKETS, INC. \n15 \nItem 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: (continued) \nResults of Operations (continued) \nNet Sales (continued) \nAccording to the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ report, the annual Seasonally Adjusted Food-at-Home Consumer \nPrice Index increased 11.4% in 2022, 3.5% in 2021 and 3.5% in 2020. Even though the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ \nindex rates may be reflective of a trend, it will not necessarily be indicative of the Company’s actual results. According \nto the U.S. Department of Energy, the 53-week average price of gasoline in the Central Atlantic States increased 31.4%, \nor $1.00 per gallon, in 2022 compared to the 52-week average in 2021. The 52-week average price of gasoline in the \nCentral Atlantic States, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, increased 31.2%, or $0.76 per gallon, in 2021 \ncompared to the 52-week average in 2020. \nComparable store sales increased for all years presented, in small part due to an additional selling week in 2022. On a \ncomparable store sales basis fresh, pharmacy services and fuel increased in sales. The Company’s 2022 sales were \nfavorably impacted as a result of increased pharmacy prescription volume, administering COVID-19 vaccines and higher \nfuel sales. Comparable store sales, adjusted for an additional week in 2022 increased 8.8% including fuel and 7.5% \nexcluding fuel for 2022 compared to 2021. The Company has provided additional product offerings and customer \nconveniences such as “Weis 2 Go Online,” currently offered at 188 store locations. “Weis 2 Go Online” allows the \ncustomer to order on-line and have their order delivered or picked up at an expedient store drive-thru. \nThe Company has experienced retail inflation and deflation in various commodities for the periods presented.  \nManagement cannot accurately measure the full impact of inflation or deflation on retail pricing due to changes in the \ntypes of merchandise sold between periods, shifts in customer buying patterns and the fluctuation of competitive factors.  \nIn addition, impacts of the novel coronavirus pandemic have caused uncertainty about future economic conditions and \nmay change future product mix. Management remains confident in its ability to generate long-term sales growth in a \nhighly competitive environment, but also understands some competitors have greater financial resources and could use \nthese resources to take measures which could adversely affect the Company’s competitive position.  \nCost of Sales and Gross Profit \nCost of sales consists of direct product costs (net of discounts and allowances), net advertising costs, warehousing costs, \ntransportation costs, as well as manufacturing facility costs. Increased sales volume resulted in an increase in cost of \nsales. Both direct product cost and distribution cost increase when sales volume increases. \nGross profit rate was 25.2% in 2022, 26.4% in 2021 and 26.8% in 2020. The decrease in gross profit rate is attributable \nto sales deleverage, primarily in fresh selling departments; increased pharmacy and fuel sales, which have a lower gross \nprofit margin than grocery sales; and higher product and supply chain costs.  \nThe Company experienced unfavorable non-cash LIFO inventory valuation adjustments, decreasing gross profit by \n$29.2 million and $4.0 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.  A favorable non-cash LIFO inventory valuation \nadjustment increased gross profit by $275 thousand in 2020. \nThe Company has experienced retail inflation and deflation in various commodities for the periods presented. \nManagement cannot accurately measure the full impact of inflation or deflation on retail pricing due to changes in the \ntypes of merchandise sold between periods, shifts in customer buying patterns and the fluctuation of competitive factors."

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: (continued) \nResults of Operations (continued) \nOperating, General and Administrative Expenses \nThe majority of the expenses were driven by increased sales volume. \nEmployee-related costs such as wages, employer paid taxes, health care benefits and retirement plans, comprise \napproximately 60.7% of the total “Operating, general and administrative expenses.”  As a percent of sales, direct store \nlabor decreased 0.5% in 2022 compared to 2021 and decreased 0.1% in 2021 compared to 2020. While direct store labor \nexpenses increased in 2022 compared to 2021, and 2021 compared to 2020, the sales increases have outpaced the labor \nexpense increase causing the rate to fall, primarily due to the fixed component of store labor. Management continues to \nmonitor store labor efficiencies and develop labor standards to reduce costs while maintaining the Company’s customer \nservice expectations. Currently, the Company is continuing a multi-year initiative to install or upgrade self-checkouts in \nits stores in response to customer preference and labor supply, including adding convertible dual-use checkout lanes. \nThe Company’s self-insured health care benefit expenses decreased by 0.2% in 2022 compared to 2021 and increased by \n0.2% in 2021 compared to 2020. \nDepreciation and amortization expense charged to “Operating, general and administrative expenses” was $94.6 million, \nor 2.0% of net sales, for 2022 compared to $93.8 million, or 2.2% of net sales, for 2021 and $90.2 million, or 2.2% of \nnet sales, for 2020.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: (continued) \nResults of Operations (continued) \nProvision for Income Taxes \nThe effective income tax rate was 22.1%, 26.6% and 27.3% in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective income \ntax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes as well as nondeductible employee \nexpenses. The Company reduced its provision for income taxes by $5.5 million in 2022 primarily due to the effects of \nPennsylvania House Bill 1342 which was enacted on July 8, 2022. The bill made significant changes to the \nCommonwealth’s corporate income tax laws which included lowering the tax rate gradually from 9.99% in 2022 to \n4.99% in 2031, updating market sourcing rules, and codifying the economic nexus standard. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nThe primary source of cash is cash flows generated from operations. In addition, the Company has access to a revolving \ncredit agreement entered into on September 1, 2016, and amended on September 29, 2021, with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. \n(the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement matures on September 1, 2024 and provides for an unsecured \nrevolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $30.0 million with an additional discretionary \namount available of $70.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, the availability under the revolving credit agreement was \n$25.5 million with $4.5 million of letters of credit outstanding. The letters of credit are maintained primarily to support \nperformance, payment, deposit or surety obligations of the Company. The Company has not had an obligation on the \nCredit Agreement since the second quarter of 2018. \nThe Company’s investment portfolio consists of high-grade bonds with maturity dates between one and 20 years and \nfour high yield, large capitalized public company equity securities. The portfolio totaled $186.4 million as of \nDecember 31, 2022. Management anticipates maintaining the investment portfolio but has the ability to liquidate if \nneeded. See “Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for more details regarding the \nCompany’s market risk. \nThe Company’s capital expenditure program includes the construction of new superstores, the expansion and remodeling \nof existing units, the acquisition of sites for future expansion, new technology purchases and the continued upgrade of \nthe Company’s distribution facilities and transportation fleet. Management currently plans to invest approximately $150 \nmillion in its capital expenditure program in 2023, including multiple carryover projects from 2022 that were delayed \ndue to labor and supply chain disruptions.  \nThe Board of Directors’ 2004 resolution authorizing the repurchase of up to one million shares of the Company’s \ncommon stock has a remaining balance of 752,468 shares. \nQuarterly Cash Dividends \nTotal cash dividend payments on common stock, on a per share basis, amounted to $1.30 in 2022, $1.25 in 2021 and \n$1.24 in 2020.  The Company increased its quarterly dividend from 32 cents per share to 34 cents per share in the fourth \nquarter of 2022.  The Company expects to continue paying regular cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, the \nBoard of Directors reconsiders the declaration of dividends quarterly. The Company pays these dividends at the \ndiscretion of the Board of Directors and the continuation of these payments and the amount of the dividends depends \nupon the financial condition of the Company, results of operations and other factors which the Board of Directors deems \nrelevant."

      "text": "WEIS MARKETS, INC. \n19 \nItem 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: (continued) \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nThe Company has chosen accounting policies that it believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report its operating \nresults and financial position, and the Company applies those accounting policies in a consistent manner. The Significant \nAccounting Policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States \nof America requires that the Company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, \nliabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to \nbe reasonable under the circumstances. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis \nand may retain outside consultants, lawyers and actuaries to assist in its evaluation. The Company believes the following \naccounting policies are the most critical because they involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in \npreparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. \nInventories \nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using both the retail inventory and average cost \nmethods. The retail inventory method is commonly used by retail companies to determine cost and calculate gross \nmargin based on applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each similar merchandise category’s ending retail value. The \nCompany’s center store and pharmacy inventories are valued using last in, first out (LIFO). The Company’s fresh \ninventories are valued using average cost. The Company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on \nactual physical counts in its facilities. Allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these \ncounts and to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date. \nVendor Allowances \nVendor allowances related to the Company’s buying and merchandising activities are recorded as a reduction of cost of \nsales as they are earned, in accordance with the underlying agreement. Off-invoice and bill-back allowances are used to \nreduce direct product costs upon the receipt of goods. Promotional rebates and credits are accounted for as a reduction in \nthe cost of inventory and recognized when the related inventory is sold. Volume incentive discounts are accounted for as \na reduction of cost of sales and realized using estimated amounts at the time it is deemed probable that the incentive \ntarget will be reached. Long-term contract incentives, which require an exclusive vendor relationship, are allocated over \nthe life of the contract. Promotional allowance funds for specific vendor-sponsored programs are recognized as a \nreduction of cost of sales as the program occurs and the funds are earned per the agreement. Cash discounts for prompt \npayment of invoices are realized in cost of sales as invoices are paid. Warehouse and back-haul allowances provided by \nsuppliers for distributing their product through the Company’s distribution system are recorded in cost of sales as the \nrequired performance is completed. Warehouse slotting allowances are recorded in cost of sales when new items are \ninitially set up in the Company’s distribution system, which is when the related expenses are incurred and performance \nunder the agreement is complete. Swell allowances for damaged goods are realized in cost of sales as provided by the \nsupplier, helping to offset product shrink losses also recorded in cost of sales. \nIncome Taxes \nIncome taxes are inherently complex and require management’s evaluation and estimates, specifically regarding current \nand deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions. The Company reviews the tax positions taken, or expected to be \ntaken, on tax returns to determine whether, and to what extent, a benefit can be recognized in its Consolidated Financial \nStatements. The assessment of the Company’s tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the more \nlikely than not merits associated with the Company’s various tax positions."

      "text": "WEIS MARKETS, INC. \n20 \nItem 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: (continued) \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) \nLeases \nThe Company leases approximately 49% of its open store facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates \nthrough 2036, with the remaining store facilities being owned. These leases generally provide for fixed annual rentals; \nhowever, several provide for minimum annual rentals plus variable lease costs related to real estate taxes and insurance \nas well as contingent rentals based on a percentage of annual sales or increases periodically based on inflation. These \nvariable lease costs are not included in the measurement of the operating lease right-to-use assets or lease liabilities and \nare charged to the related expense category included in “Operating, general and administrative expenses.”  Most of the \nleases contain multiple renewal options, under which the Company may extend the lease terms from 5 to 20 years. \nAdditionally, the Company has operating leases for certain transportation and other equipment. The Company leases or \nsubleases space to tenants in owned, vacated and open store facilities. Rental income is recorded when earned as a \ncomponent of “Operating, general and administrative expenses.” \nSelf-Insurance \nThe Company is self-insured for a majority of its workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle accident and \nassociate medical benefit claims. The self-insurance liability for most of the medical benefit claims is determined based \non historical data and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. The other self-insurance liabilities including \nworkers’ compensation are determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet \nreported. The Company is self-insured for certain healthcare claims and stop-loss coverage is maintained for individual \nannual claim occurrences exceeding a $500 thousand specific deductible. The Company is liable for workers’ \ncompensation claims ranging from $1.0 million to $2.0 million per claim. Property and casualty insurance coverage is \nmaintained with outside carriers at deductible or retention levels ranging from $250 thousand to $1.0 million. Significant \nassumptions used in the development of the actuarial estimates include reliance on the Company’s historical claims data \nincluding average monthly claims and average lag time between incurrence and reporting of the claim. \nForward-Looking Statements \nIn addition to historical information, this Annual Report may contain forward-looking statements, which are included \npursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any forward-looking \nstatements contained herein are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ \nmaterially from those projected. For example, risks and uncertainties can arise with changes in: general economic \nconditions, including their impact on capital expenditures; business conditions in the retail industry; the regulatory \nenvironment; rapidly changing technology and competitive factors, including increased competition with regional and \nnational retailers; and price pressures. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, \nwhich reflect management’s analysis only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly \nrevise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof. \nReaders should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents the Company files periodically with the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \n \nItem 7a.

The dividend yield realized on \nthese equity investments was 6.6% in 2022. By their nature, both the fixed interest rate securities and the equity \ninvestments inherently expose the holders to market risk. The extent of the Company’s interest rate and other market risk \nis not quantifiable or predictable with precision due to the variability of future interest rates and other changes in market \nconditions. However, the Company believes that its exposure in this area is not material. \nThe Company’s revolving credit agreement is exposed to interest rate fluctuations to the extent of changes in the SOFR \nrate. The Company believes this exposure is not material due to availability of liquid assets to eliminate the outstanding \ncredit facility."

The Company is engaged \nprincipally in the retail sale of food in Pennsylvania and surrounding states. The Company’s operations are reported as a single \nreportable segment. There was no material change in the nature of the Company’s business during fiscal 2022. \n(b)  Definition of Fiscal Year \nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2022 was comprised of 53 weeks, ending on December 31, \n2022. Fiscal 2021 was comprised of 52 weeks, ending on December 25, 2021. Fiscal 2020 was comprised of 52 weeks, ending on \nDecember 26, 2020. References to years in this Annual Report relate to fiscal years. \n(c)  Principles of Consolidation \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany \naccounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. \n(d)  Use of Estimates \nManagement of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and \nthe disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting \nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n(e)  Cash and Cash Equivalents \nThe Company maintains its cash balances in the form of core checking accounts and money market accounts. The Company maintains \ncash deposits with banks that at times exceed applicable insurance limits. The Company reduces its exposure to credit risk by \nmaintaining such deposits with high quality financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy. \nThe Company considers investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Investment amounts \nclassified as cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 totaled $80.5 million and $692 thousand, respectively. \nConsumer electronic payments accepted at the point of sale, including all credit card, debit card and electronic benefits transfer \ntransactions that process in three days or less are classified as cash equivalents.

      "text": "WEIS MARKETS, INC.\n28 \nNote 1    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) \n(f)  Marketable Securities \nMarketable securities consist of corporate and municipal bonds, commercial paper and equity securities. The Company invests \nprimarily in high-grade marketable debt securities. The Company classifies all of its marketable securities as available-for-sale. \nAvailable-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value as determined by quoted market price based on national markets.  To determine \nfair value the Company utilizes standard pricing procedures of its investment advisory firm(s), which include various third-party \npricing services. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, the Company evaluates general market conditions, credit quality of \ndebt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost.  Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related \ntax effect, on corporate and municipal bonds and commercial paper are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate \ncomponent of shareholders’ equity until realized. Unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities are recorded in investment \nincome (loss) and interest expense.  Dividend and interest income is recognized when earned. Realized gains and losses are included \nin earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities. \nInvestment amounts classified as marketable securities as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 totaled $186.4 million and \n$205.7 million, respectively. \nEquity securities are measured at fair value and the unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded in investment income (loss) and \ninterest expense. The Company recognized a $1.3 million loss in 2022 and a $900 thousand loss in 2021. \n(g)  Accounts Receivable \nAccounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts of $4.6 million and $3.4 million as of December 31, \n2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. The reserve balance relates to amounts due from pharmacy third party providers, retail \ncustomer returned checks, manufacturing customers, vendors and tenants. The Company maintains an allowance for the amount of \nreceivables deemed to be uncollectible and calculates this amount based upon historical collection activity adjusted for current \nconditions. \n(h)  Inventories \nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using both the retail inventory and average cost methods. The retail \ninventory method is commonly used by retail companies to determine cost and calculate gross margin based on applying a cost-to-\nretail ratio to each similar merchandise category’s ending retail value. The Company’s center store and pharmacy inventories are \nvalued using last in, first out (LIFO). The Company’s fresh inventories are valued using average cost. The Company evaluates \ninventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities. Allowances for inventory shortages are \nrecorded based on the results of these counts and to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial \nstatement date. \n(i)  Property and Equipment \nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided on the cost of buildings and improvements and equipment using \nthe straight-line method. \nLeasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the terms of the leases or the useful lives of the assets, \nwhichever is shorter. \nMaintenance and repairs are expensed and renewals and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, \nthe assets and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit or loss on the disposition is credited \nor charged to “Operating, general and administrative expenses.”"

      "text": "WEIS MARKETS, INC.\n29 \nNote 1    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) \n \n(j)  Leases \nThe Company leases approximately 49% of its open store facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2036, \nwith the remaining store facilities being owned. These leases generally provide for fixed annual rentals; however, several provide for \nminimum annual rentals plus variable lease costs related to real estate taxes and insurance as well as contingent rentals based on \na percentage of annual sales or increases periodically based on inflation. These variable lease costs are not included in the \nmeasurement of the operating lease right-to-use assets or lease liabilities and are charged to the related expense category included in \n“Operating, general and administrative expenses.”  Most of the leases contain multiple renewal options, under which the Company \nmay extend the lease terms from 5 to 20 years. Additionally, the Company has operating leases for certain transportation and other \nequipment. The Company leases or subleases space to tenants in owned, vacated and open store facilities. Rental income is recorded \nwhen earned as a component of “Operating, general and administrative expenses.” \n(k)  Goodwill and Intangible Assets \nGoodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when indicators of impairment are \nidentified. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized until their useful life is determined to be no longer \nindefinite and are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might \nbe impaired. \nThe Company’s intangible assets and related accumulated amortization at December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 consisted of the \nfollowing: \n \n \n December 31, 2022\nDecember 25, 2021\n \n \n \nAccumulated \nAccumulated\n(amounts in thousands)\n    \nGross \n    \nAmortization \n    \nNet \n   \nGross\n   \nAmortization\n   \nNet\nLiquor licenses\n $\n 15,899  $\n —  $\n 15,899\n$\n15,240\n$\n—\n$\n15,240\nAsset acquisitions and other\n  \n 2,566    \n 1,433   \n 1,133\n5,083\n3,788\n1,295\nTotal\n $\n 18,465  $\n 1,433  $\n 17,032\n$\n20,323\n$\n3,788\n$\n16,535\n \nIntangible assets with a definite useful life are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods up to 10 years for customer \nlists. Estimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years is approximately $326 thousand in 2023, $326 thousand in 2024, \n$163 thousand in 2025, $156 thousand in 2026 and $66 thousand in 2027. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s intangible assets \nwith indefinite lives consisted of goodwill and liquor licenses. \n(l)  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets \nThe Company periodically evaluates the period of depreciation or amortization for long-lived assets to determine whether current \ncircumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. The Company completes an impairment test annually. The Company also \nreviews its property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an \nasset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the net undiscounted cash flows \nexpected to be generated by the asset. An impairment loss would be recorded for the excess of net book value over the fair value of the \nasset impaired. The fair value is estimated based on current market values or expected discounted future cash flows. \nWith respect to owned property and equipment associated with closed stores, the value of the property and equipment would be \nadjusted to reflect recoverable values if current economic conditions and estimated fair values of the property was less than the net \nbook value. \nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, the Company believes that, based on \ncurrent conditions, materially different reported results are not likely to result from long-lived asset impairments."

      "text": "WEIS MARKETS, INC.\n30 \nNote 1    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) \n(l)  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (continued) \nThe results of impairment tests are subject to management’s estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows and operating results. \nThe Company believes that, based on current conditions, materially different reported results are not likely to result from long-lived \nasset impairments. However, a change in assumptions or market conditions could result in a change in estimated future cash flows and \nthe likelihood of materially different reported results. \n(m)  Self-Insurance \nThe Company is self-insured for a majority of its workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle accident and associate medical \nbenefit claims. The self-insurance liability for most of the medical benefit claims is determined based on historical data and an \nestimate of claims incurred but not reported. The other self-insurance liabilities including workers’ compensation are determined \nactuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The Company is self-insured for certain \nhealthcare claims and stop-loss coverage is maintained for individual annual claim occurrences exceeding a $500 thousand specific \ndeductible. The Company is liable for workers’ compensation claims ranging from $1.0 million to $2.0 million per claim. Property \nand casualty insurance coverage is maintained with outside carriers at deductible or retention levels ranging from $100 thousand to \n$1.0 million. Significant assumptions used in the development of the actuarial estimates include reliance on the Company’s historical \nclaims data including average monthly claims and average lag time between incurrence and reporting of the claim. \n(n)  Income Taxes \nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the \nfinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities \nare measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are \nexpected to be recovered or settled. The Company reviews the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine \nwhether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other disclosures related to uncertain tax positions. To the extent \ninterest and penalties would be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts are accrued and \nclassified as a component of income tax expense. \n(o)  Earnings Per Share \nEarnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. \n(p)  Revenue Recognition \nRevenue from the sale of products to the Company’s customers is recognized at the point of sale. Discounts provided to customers at \nthe point of sale through the Weis Club Preferred Shopper loyalty program are recognized as a reduction in sales as products are sold. \nPeriodically, the Company will run a point-based sales incentive program that rewards customers with future sales discounts. The \nCompany makes reasonable and reliable estimates of the amount of future discounts based upon historical experience and its customer \ndata tracking software. Sales are reduced rationally and systematically by these estimates over the life of the program. Discounts to \ncustomers at the point of sale provided by vendors, usually in the form of paper coupons, are not recognized as a reduction in sales \nprovided the discounts are redeemable at any retailer that accepts those discounts. The Company records “Deferred revenue” for the \nsale of gift cards and revenue is recognized in “Net sales” at the time of customer redemption for products. Gift card breakage income \nis recognized in “Operating, general and administrative expenses” based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the \nbalance of gift cards for which the Company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote. Sales tax is excluded \nfrom “Net sales.”  The Company charges sales tax on all taxable customer purchases and remits these taxes monthly to the appropriate \ntaxing jurisdiction. Merchandise return activity is immaterial to revenues due to products being returned quickly and the relatively low \nunit cost. \n (q)  Cost of Sales, Including Advertising, Warehousing and Distribution Expenses \n“Cost of sales, including advertising, warehousing and distribution expenses” consists of direct product costs (net of discounts and \nallowances), advertising (net of vendor paid cooperative advertising credits), distribution center and transportation costs, as well as \nmanufacturing facility operations. Advertising costs, net of vendor paid cooperative advertising credits, are expensed as incurred \nwhich are primarily funded by vendor cooperative advertising credits and occur in the same period as the product is sold."

      "text": "WEIS MARKETS, INC.\n31 \nNote 1    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) \n \n (r)  Vendor Allowances \nVendor allowances related to the Company’s buying and merchandising activities are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales as they \nare earned, in accordance with the underlying agreement. Off-invoice and bill-back allowances are used to reduce direct product costs \nupon the receipt of goods. Promotional rebates and credits are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and recognized \nwhen the related inventory is sold. Volume incentive discounts are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales and realized using \nestimated amounts at the time it is deemed probable that the incentive target will be reached. Long-term contract incentives, which \nrequire an exclusive vendor relationship, are allocated over the life of the contract. Promotional allowance funds for specific vendor-\nsponsored programs are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales as the program occurs and the funds are earned per the agreement. \nCash discounts for prompt payment of invoices are realized in cost of sales as invoices are paid. Warehouse and back-haul allowances \nprovided by suppliers for distributing their product through the Company’s distribution system are recorded in cost of sales offsetting \ncosts incurred. Warehouse slotting allowances are recorded in cost of sales when new items are initially set up in the Company’s \ndistribution system, which is when the related expenses are incurred and performance under the agreement is complete. Swell \nallowances for damaged goods are realized in cost of sales as provided by the supplier, helping to offset product shrink losses also \nrecorded in cost of sales. \nVendor allowances recorded as credits in cost of sales totaled $120.0 million in 2022, $100.1 million in 2021 and $133.5 million in \n2020. Vendor paid cooperative advertising credits totaled $2.9 million in 2022, $3.4 million in 2021 and $21.7 million in 2020. These \ncredits were netted against advertising costs within “Cost of Sales, including Advertising, Warehousing and Distribution expenses.”  \nThe Company had accounts receivable due from vendors of $617 thousand and $585 thousand for earned advertising credits and $3.5 \nmillion and $3.6 million for earned promotional discounts as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. The \nCompany had $3.3 million and $2.5 million in unearned income included in accrued liabilities for unearned vendor programs under \nlong-term contracts for display and shelf space allocation as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. \n(s)  Operating, General and Administrative Expenses \nBusiness operating costs including expenses generated from administration and purchasing functions, are recorded in “Operating, \ngeneral and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Business operating costs include items such as \nwages, benefits, utilities, repairs and maintenance, rent, insurance, depreciation, leasehold amortization and costs for outside provided \nservices. \n(t)  Advertising Costs \nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. The Company recorded advertising expense, before vendor paid cooperative \nadvertising credits, of $23.7 million in 2022, $24.9 million in 2021 and $24.5 million in 2020 in “Cost of Sales, including Advertising, \nWarehousing and Distribution Expenses.” \n(u)  Rental and Commission Income \nThe Company leases or subleases space to tenants in owned, vacated and open store facilities. Rental income is recorded when earned \nas a component of “Operating, general and administrative expenses.”  All leases are operating leases. Refer to Note 5 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements for further disclosure on operating leases and rental income. \nThe Company provides a variety of services to its customers, including but not limited to lottery, money orders, third-party gift cards, \nand third-party bill pay services. Commission income earned from these services are recorded when earned as a component of \n“Operating, general and administrative expenses.”  The Company recorded commission income of $18.0 million in 2022, $18.9 \nmillion in 2021 and $17.7 million in 2020. \n (v)  Current Relevant Accounting Standards \nThe Company regularly monitors recently issued accounting standards and assesses their applicability and impact. The Company \nbelieves that there are no accounting standard updates that have or will have a material or significant impact on the Company’s \naccounting policies."

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has established three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair \nvalue: \nLevel 1 \nObservable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; \nLevel 2 \nObservable inputs, other than Level 1 inputs in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and \nLevel 3 \nUnobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own \nassumptions. \nThe Company’s marketable securities valued using Level 1 inputs include four public company equity securities, for which quoted \nmarket prices are available. The Company’s bond and commercial paper portfolio is valued using Level 2 inputs. The Company’s \ncorporate and municipal bonds and commercial paper are valued using a combination of pricing for similar securities, recently \nexecuted transactions, cash flow models with yield curves and other pricing models utilizing observable inputs, which are considered \nLevel 2 inputs. \nFor Level 2 investment valuation, the Company utilizes standard pricing procedures of its investment advisory firm(s), which include \nvarious third-party pricing services. These procedures also require specific price monitoring practices as well as pricing review \nreports, valuation oversight and pricing challenge procedures to maintain the most accurate representation of investment fair market \nvalue. \nThe Company accrues interest on its bond and commercial paper portfolio throughout the life of each bond and commercial paper \nheld. Dividends from the equity securities are recognized as received. Both interest and dividends are recognized in “Investment \nincome and interest expense” on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recognized investment income of \n$3.8 million, $1.6 million and $536 thousand which included unrealized losses of $1.3 million, $900 thousand, and $1.8 million in the \nfiscal years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. \nMarketable securities, as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, consisted of: \nGross \n \nGross \n  \n(amounts in thousands)\nAmortized \nUnrealized  \nUnrealized  \nFair \nDecember 31, 2022\n   \nCost \n   Holding Gains    Holding Losses    \nValue \nAvailable-for-sale:\nLevel 1\nEquity securities\n$\n5,185\nLevel 2\nCorporate and municipal bonds\n$ 190,025\n$\n2,110\n$\n(10,901)\n181,234\nTotal\n$ 190,025\n$\n2,110\n$\n(10,901)\n$ 186,419\n \n \n \n  \n \nGross \n \nGross \n   \n(amounts in thousands)\nAmortized \nUnrealized  \nUnrealized  \nFair \nDecember 25, 2021\n   \nCost \n   Holding Gains    Holding Losses    \nValue \nAvailable-for-sale:\nLevel 1\nEquity securities\n$\n6,509\nLevel 2\nCorporate and municipal bonds\n$ 151,947\n$\n4,753\n$\n(2,384)\n154,315\nCommercial paper\n44,931\n2\n(13)\n44,920\nTotal\n$ 196,878\n$\n4,755\n$\n(2,397)\n$ 205,744"

Retirement Savings Plan, covering substantially all \nassociates. Employer contributions are made at the sole discretion of the Company. Prior to 2022, employer contributions consisted of \na noncontributory profit-sharing component to a limited number of associates and a contributory component equal to $0.25 for every \ndollar that all eligible associates contributed to the plan, up to 6% of their eligible pay. In 2022, the plan was adjusted to benefit more \nassociates by eliminating the noncontributory profit-sharing component and increasing the contributory component to $0.50 for every \ndollar that all eligible associates contributed to the plan, up to 6% of their eligible pay. \n \nThe Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for the payment of specific amounts of annual retirement benefits \nto certain officers or their beneficiaries over an actuarially computed normal life expectancy. Currently, there are no active officers in \nthe plan. The expected payments under the plan provisions were determined through actuarial calculations dependent on the age of the \nrecipient, using an assumed discount rate. The plan is unfunded and accounted for on an accrual basis. The recorded liability at \nDecember 31, 2022 is $3.6 million which is based on expected payments to be made over the remaining lives of the beneficiaries. This \namount is included in “Accrued expenses” and “Postretirement benefit obligations” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The expected \npayment amounts are approximately $1.0 million for 2023 and for the years thereafter dependent on the lives of the beneficiaries. \nThe Company also maintains a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan covering highly compensated associates. This \nplan is designed to provide retirement benefits and salary deferral opportunities because of limitations imposed by the Internal \nRevenue Code and the Regulations implemented by the Internal Revenue Service. This plan is unfunded and accounted for on an \naccrual basis. Plan participants are 100% vested in their accounts after three years of service with the Company. Benefits are \ndistributed among participants upon termination or retirement. Substantial risk of benefit forfeiture does exist for participants in this \nplan. The present value of accumulated benefits amounted to $22.7 million and $27.2 million at December 31, 2022 and December 25, \n2021, respectively, and is included in “Postretirement benefit obligations” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n \nNote 7    Revenue Recognition \nThe Chief Operating Officer, the Company’s chief operating decision maker, analyzed store operational revenues by geographical area \nbut each area offers customers similar product, has similar distribution methods, and supported by centralized management processes. \nThe Company’s operations are reported as a single reportable segment. \nThe following table represents net sales by product category for years ending December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and \nDecember 26, 2020. \n53 Weeks Ended  \n52 Weeks Ended \n(amounts in thousands)\n  December 31, 2022      \nDecember 25, 2021\nDecember 26, 2020\nGrocery\n$ 3,978,397    \n84.7 %  $ 3,633,023    \n86.1 %  $ 3,627,898\n88.2 %\nPharmacy\n \n 441,840  \n9.4  \n399,128\n9.4\n356,630\n8.7\nFuel\n \n 263,265  \n5.6  \n183,631\n4.3\n117,800\n2.9\nManufacturing\n \n 12,441  \n0.3  \n8,635\n0.2\n10,273\n0.2\nTotal net sales\n$ 4,695,943  \n100.0 % $ 4,224,417\n100.0 % $ 4,112,601\n100.0 %"

The Credit Agreement provides for an \nunsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $30.0 million with an additional discretionary \namount available of $70.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, the availability under the revolving credit agreement was $25.5 million \nwith $4.5 million of letters of credit outstanding.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the \nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to \nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits \nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. \nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to \nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence \nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used \nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe \nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n  \nCritical Audit Matters \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial \nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or \ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. \nThe communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and \nwe are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the \naccounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n \nIncome taxes \nAs described in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates 197 stores across seven states in the \nU.S. and a centralized distribution center in Pennsylvania. The Company’s provision for income taxes is impacted based on \ninterpretations of various state and local income tax laws. Management prepared the Company’s provision for state income taxes \nusing significant judgment when interpreting the provisions of state and local tax regulations and assessing the positions taken as a \nresult of these considerations as to whether or not the amount of benefit recorded would be more likely than not to be sustained upon \nexamination. \n \nWe identified the evaluation of the Company’s provision for state income taxes and its assessment of more likely than not surrounding \nstate tax positions as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management when assessing the complex \nprovisions of the tax laws and regulations. Auditing the matter required significant auditor judgment and increased audit effort, \nincluding the use of our state and local tax professionals, in evaluating the recorded results of management’s tax positions and their \nassessment of the sustainability of these tax positions."

      "text": "WEIS MARKETS, INC.\n40 \nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s provision for state income taxes and its assessment of more likely than not surrounding \nstate tax positions include the following, among others: \n• \nWe obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the determination of current and deferred taxes and the \nassessment of more likely than not surrounding state tax positions and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, \nincluding controls related to the interpretation and application of tax laws. \n• \nWe involved our state and local tax professionals to assist in evaluating the application of state and local tax regulations. Our \nprofessionals developed an independent assessment of interpretations of state and local tax positions requiring significant judgement \nand compared them to the Company’s recorded positions. \n• \nWe tested the accuracy and completeness of the data and inputs used to calculate the effective state tax rate, current provision \ncalculations, deferred tax assets/liabilities, more likely than not state tax positions assessment and income taxes receivable/payable \nrollforward. \n \nRetail inventory and related cost of sales \nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accounts for retail center store inventory under the retail \ninventory method (RIM) using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. RIM is commonly used by retail companies to determine cost and \ncalculate gross margin based on applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each similar merchandise category’s ending retail value. \nWe identified the auditing of RIM inventory as a critical audit matter due to the increased audit effort, including involvement of more \nexperienced audit team members and our information technology (IT) professionals. The RIM inventory computations utilize critical \ninputs dependent on multiple information systems that capture and process high volume transactions that elevates the importance of \ndata interfaces and reliability of information systems.  \n \nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s RIM inventory include the following, among others: \n \n• \nWe obtained an understanding of the relevant controls, including IT general controls, surrounding the retail inventory \nvaluation process and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including automated processes and transactional \ndata interfaces and managements review controls over these data inputs and the Company’s RIM calculation outputs.  \n• \nWe tested the accuracy and completeness of the key inputs into the RIM calculation, including purchases, sales, discounts, \nshrink and price changes (markdowns) by comparing the key inputs back to source information such as point of sale information via \nretail pricing and tender/cash receipts, third-party vendor invoices and third-party inventory count information, including testing of a \nrollforward from the inventory count date to year-end inventory valuation. \n• \nWe performed analytical procedures disaggregated by inventory category. Such disaggregated analytical procedures included \ntrend analysis of RIM inputs based on warehouse and direct store delivery purchases as percent of sales, cost of sales percentages \ncompared to historical periods and trends, and discounts and markdown analytics based on inquiries with various Company personnel \nto assess the level of retail price changes due to pricing and promotional strategies and inflation/deflation within a category. \nAdditional analytics include trends analyses on store count and shrink results, store square footage analytics related to ending store \nlevel inventory values and gross profit analytics by category. \n \n/s/ RSM US LLP \n \nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2016. \n \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania \nMarch 1, 2023"

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the \nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the \ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in \naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding \nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect \non the financial statements.  \n \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections \nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in \nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n/s/ RSM US LLP \n \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania \nMarch 1, 2023"

Controls and Procedures: \nManagement’s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures \nThe Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company (its principal executive officer and principal financial \nofficer, respectively) have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the close of the period covered by this Report, that the \nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the \nreports filed or submitted by it under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and \nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that \ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s \nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding \nrequired disclosure. \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as \ndefined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the \nCompany’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal \ncontrol over financial reporting based on the framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \nCommission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013 framework). The Company’s internal control system was \ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair \npresentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. \nTherefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement \npreparation and presentation. Based on the Company’s evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. \nRSM US LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their attestation report on the Company’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The report can be found in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, \nthat has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. \n \nItem 9b.   Other Information: \nThere was no information required on Form 8-K during this quarter that was not reported. \n \nItem 9c. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections: \n \nNone."
