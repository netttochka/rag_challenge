      "text": "ANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n5\nARCHTIS LIMITED\nDear fellow shareholders, \nI am pleased to present the 2022 Annual Report for \narchTIS Limited (ASX:AR9) (the Company) evidencing \nanother good year and continued successful  \nexecution of the Company’s strategic plans. \nAs background, the ongoing challenges and \ndisruptions posed by COVID-19 initially impacted \nour operations and growth across global markets. \nNotwithstanding this, the team worked hard and \nsharpened its focus, thereby enabling them to deliver \nyear-on-year growth in both licensing and annual \nrecurring revenues (up 126% and 70% respectively). \nTotal Revenue for FY22 was $4.64M. Gross Profit for \nthe year also grew to $3.2M. While neither of these \nwere as high as hoped due to the COVID-affected \nslow sales start to the FY, the quality of these \nearnings in terms of marquee clientele, repeatability \nand improved margins were particularly pleasing. \nFrom a shareholder perspective, such factors all \ncontribute to making the Company more predictable \nand valuable. \nIn terms of material activities, the Company \nsuccessfully completed its U.S. public market quoting \non the OTCQB as well as finalising the merger \nintegration of both Nucleus Cyber and the acquired \nCipherpoint technology assets, customers, staff \nand global operations. In November, the Company \nsuccessfully undertook a $6.9M capital raise and \nassociated share purchase plan to achieve these \nexpansion goals. These funds were used to establish \na stronger U.S. sales force, expanded Microsoft  \nco-sell capabilities, and better reseller relationships  in \nAsia. Pleasingly, archTIS also delivered new versions \nand feature sets across its entire software offering \nduring the year. \nFrom a sales perspective, Q4 FY22 saw the team \nsuccessfully enter into its largest ever deal (circa  \n$7.0M with the Australian Department of Defence), \nwhich strongly validates the Company’s products for \nsecuring sensitive information and enabling multi-party \nsharing across global networks. \nMoreover, this contract provides an important \nreference for further related sales opportunities \nwhich, as archTIS continues to expand, will amplify \nvia the “network growth” effect. Coupled with industry \ntailwinds and increased levels of spending on \ncybersecurity globally, I expect that the Company will \ncontinue to witness growing demand for its products. \nFurthermore, I also anticipate the strong close to FY22 \nwill lead to another record-breaking year in FY23 (the \nnew Defence deal alone is expected to provide $5.0M \nin recognisable revenue and $7.0M in cash proceeds). \nOn that basis, the Company provided guidance for \na minimum year-on-year revenue increase of 60%. \nFY23 cash receipts without incremental new sales \nare expected to be a minimum of $9.5M. Core gross \nmargins are expected to remain at the targeted 70% \nlevel, while the Company is targeting its monthly cash \nburn to halve during FY23 due to increased revenues, \ncash receipts and continued close monitoring of \noperating expenses. Importantly, this will support the \ntrend toward cash-flow neutrality. \nIn closing, and on behalf of the wider Board and \nExecutive team, I would like to thank the entire team \nfor their commitment and continued execution of \nour strategic initiatives. I would also like to thank our \nshareholders for their ongoing support as we strive to \nbecome a major cybersecurity company globally. \nYours sincerely, \nDr Miles Jakeman AM \nChairman of the Board\n24 AUGUST 2022 \nLETTER FROM \nTHE CHAIRMAN\nARCHTIS LIMITED\nDR MILES JAKEMAN AM \nFor personal use only"

      "text": "ANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n6\nLETTER FROM THE CEO \n& MANAGING DIRECTOR\nDANIEL LAI\nDear fellow shareholders, \nFY22 will go down as a year of important quiet \nachievements and execution for archTIS – a milestone \nperiod in terms of validating the Company’s longer-\nterm strategy of becoming the premier provider of \npolicy enforcement to Global Defence and adjacent \nDefence Industrial Base (DIB). \nThe quiet achievements have included the Australian \nDepartment of Defence providing an endorsed use \ncase for NC Protect and archTIS being named as \npart of the winning KPMG consortia to deliver the \nOne Defence Data Strategy. FY22 culminated with \nthe awarding of a $7.0M contract with Defence for \nthe expansion of Kojensi, the largest single deal in \narchTIS’ history. Collectively, these wins validate \nour strategy over the last 18 months, focusing on \nAustralian Defence as the foundation of revenue as \nwell as a referenceable lead as we seek to expand into \nour overseas Defence markets such as the US and \nEMEA. Additionally, beyond validating market demand \nand competitive advantage of our policy enforcement \nproducts, each of these opportunities will continue \nto grow revenue into FY23. Equally, this recognition \nwas also acknowledged by the industry with the NC \nProtect and Kojensi solutions winning 8 Gold Product \nAwards in the 2022 Cybersecurity Excellence Awards \nin February across a variety of categories. \nGrowing revenue is a key objective within our strategy. \nSpecifically, expansion of licensing revenues, focusing \non more predictable revenue streams, as well as \nenhancing Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and the \nmargin profile of the Company are current priorities. \nWhilst we achieved solid momentum across each of \nthese metrics during FY22, the outlook is for enhanced \ngrowth across these metrics for FY23. \nKojensi as a SaaS platform successfully delivered a \n100% growth over the period and demonstrated the \nnetwork growth effect that we have invested in, whilst \nmaintaining a low churn and high margin. This growth \nincludes the expansion of licences with existing global \nclients in addition to onboarding of new clients in the \nDefence Industrial Base as well as the Research and \nDevelopment sectors. Over FY22, we have made \nsignificant R&D investment to prepare Kojensi for \nlaunch within overseas markets. \nThis includes Kojensi V2.0 adding several new \nfeatures to address the global tightening of Defence \nExport Controls compliance requirements, including \nthe International Trade and Arms Regulations (ITAR). \nWe’re particularly excited to launch Kojensi into the \nU.S. in FY23. \nNC Protect global growth continues to be driven \nvia key strategic channel partner alliances across \nMicrosoft and Thales, which has led to a favourable \n‘network’ effect across our customer base, expanding \nour pipeline to an all-time high. Notably, the IP Co-\nsell partnership with Microsoft continues to drive \nsignificant levels of interest from ancillary defence \nand intelligence agencies as well as corporations \nlooking for enhanced data security across their \nprotected and top-secret cloud, hybrid and on-\npremises environments. Encouragingly, this is \nresulting in immediate sales opportunities for the team, \namplified by ongoing corporate investment in digital \ntransformation across supply chains, manufacturing, \ndefence, intelligence, government and industry on \na global scale. Together, this also provides a more \nsupportive backdrop for future opportunities for \narchTIS. \nLaying these foundations forms a critical element \nwithin our strategy of exporting archTIS’ products \nand platforms globally, building upon our success \ndomestically, within Australia. Throughout FY22 \nwe have continued to support and monitor our \nUS subsidiary (archTIS US, Inc.) in achieving this \nobjective. We continue to observe positive lead-\nindicators of sales growth in both U.S. and EMEA. \nI would like to also thank our fellow Directors and \nglobal staff for their support over a very busy 12 \nmonth period as we continued the Company’s growth. \nLikewise, thank you to our supportive shareholders \nfor your continued vote of confidence in the business \nand its team. We look forward to delivering on the \nopportunities for the business moving forward and \ngrowing shareholder value. \nYours sincerely, \n\nDaniel Lai\nCEO & Managing Director\n24 AUGUST 2022 \nFor personal use only"

This was highlighted by \n$2.6M in licensing revenue, up 126% on the prior \nyear with annual recurring revenues at year-end of \n$3.3M, up 66% from the prior year. Operating expense \ninvestments in the business were $10.3M (excluding \ncapitalisation for the year), consistent for the last 3 \nquarters. The Company ended 30 June 2022 in a \nstrong financial position with $6.6M of available cash. \nAdditional cash receipts of $2.0M were collected \nfrom customers post the end of financial year.

The sale continues archTlS' strong growth \nin the Defence and DIB market, while establishing \nKojensi and NC Protect for future user and licensing \ngrowth as Defence expands the platform across \nadditional sites. \nBeyond the deployment of Kojensi and NC Protect \ndirectly into Defence, general commercial application \ncontinually expands into practical use-cases across \nsectors, illustrating the “network growth” effect in \ndriving global customer acquisition. Adoption from \nglobal energy conglomerates, financial institutions, \nas well as multinational manufacturers and distributors \nis ongoing, resulting in additional contract wins during \nFY22 via new, expanded, and renewed solutions \nacross regions, including: \n•\nNorth America – U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services agency, leading Real\nEstate management company, Health\ninsurance providers and materials sciences;\n•\nEMEA – Middle-Eastern government\nagency, global European bank, global\nlogistics company; and\n•\nAPAC – Singapore government agency, several\nhigher-education institutions and large DIBs.\nKey Alliance Development \nMICROSOFT PARTNERSHIP AND IP CO-SELL \nThe Company continued to make significant inroads \nthrough the ever-expanding relationship with Microsoft. \nA number of co-sell deals were closed, as well as \nthe creation of $15M in pipeline; generally across the \nDefence and Intelligence vertical within Microsoft. \nGROWING LICENSING REVENUE AND ARR\n2019\n2021\n2020\nLicensing Revenue\nARR\n2022\n3,500,000\n2,500,000\n1,500,000\n500,000\n3,000,000\n2,000,000\n1,000,000\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022\nFor personal use only"

The feature \nwill be globally available, expanding the strategic \nmarket opportunity across defence and defence\nprime contractors. \nCorporate\nCAPITAL RAISE \nAs announced on 11 November 2021, archTIS \nsuccessfully completed placement and associated \nSPP, raising $6.9M. The proceeds enabled the \ncontinued global expansion of sales and marketing \ninvestments, continued development of strategic \nalliances with the likes of Microsoft, Thales and KPMG \nand assisted in the development and readiness of \nKojensi to enter international markets. In addition to \nAustralian investors, the raise also saw several \nUS-based institutions enter the Company’s register. \nCOMMENCED TRADING ON THE \nOTCQB MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES \narchTIS successfully commenced trading on the U.S.-\nbased OTCQB Market as announced on 2 November \n2021 under the stock ticker OTCQB: ARHLF. The \nCompany’s quotation on OTCQB broadens archTIS’ \ninternational profile and provides U.S. institutional and \nretail investors with the ability to trade the Company’s \nstock, aligning with global expansion efforts. The U.S. \nis an important growth market for the Company. Being \nquoted on the OTCQB helps to establish archTIS’ \npresence in the U.S. market with key corporate \nexecutives, along with federal agencies and defence \ncontractors. \nCIPHERPOINT TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION \nAs announced on 20 September 2021, archTIS \nacquired certain business technology assets, \ncustomers and employees connected with the software \ndivision of Cipherpoint Limited and its subsidiaries for \nacquisition price of $1.4M initial cash consideration \nand an additional consideration of $0.1M which \nwas settled 31 March 22. The acquisition included \nintellectual property of ‘cp.Protect’, an advanced \nSharePoint on-premises data encryption solution, \nas well as ‘cp.Discover’, a data discovery and \nclassification platform. The acquisition also delivered \nnew and compelling customers to the Company, \nincluding DHL, Bank of Finland, and Arthur J. \nGallagher, as well as important technology partners \nNTT Singapore and NTT DATA Deutschland. \nOutlook\narchTIS’ recent Australian Defence deal provides \n$5.0M of recognisable revenue in FY23, along with \n$7.0M of cash proceeds. The Company is providing \nrevenue outlook guidance for a minimum year-on-year \nincrease of 60% with current visibility for triple-digit \ngrowth in FY23. This includes committed revenue \nassociated with the Defence contract, existing short-\nterm deferred revenue on the balance sheet and \npreviously committed contractual engagements. \nCore gross margins are anticipated to remain at the \ntargeted 70% level. FY23 cash receipts (without further \nnew sales) are expected to be a minimum of $9.5M. \nThe Company also expects to see its monthly cash \nburn halved, during FY23, due to increased revenues, \ncash receipts and continued monitoring of operating \nexpenses. This will support the trend toward \ncash-ow neutrality. \nOVERVIEW OF FY22\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022\nFor personal use only"

The company’s Constitution provides that the maximum annual aggregate remuneration for \nnon-executive directors will be not more than a fixed sum determined by a general meeting. On 24 November \n2021, shareholders approved the maximum annual aggregate remuneration to $500,000 per annum.\nExecutive remuneration\nThe Group aims to reward executives based on their position and responsibility, with a level and mix of \nremuneration which has both fixed and variable components.\nThe executive remuneration and reward framework has four components:\n•\nbase pay and non-monetary benefits\n•\nshort-term performance incentives\n•\nshare-based payments\n•\nother remuneration such as superannuation and long service leave\nThe combination of these comprises the executive’s total remuneration.\nFor personal use only"

      "text": "ANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n33\nARCHTIS LIMITED\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the \nfinancial statements are set out below. These policies have been \nconsistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise \nstated. \n(a)\nGoing concern\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the going concern \nbasis, which contemplates continuity of normal business activities \nand the realisation of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal \ncourse of business. \nThe consolidated group incurred a loss after tax of $9,445,288 (2021 \n$2,991,402) and had net operating cash outflows of $10,569,520 \n(2021: $464,681). The entity has prepared a cash flow forecast which \nindicates that the entity has sufficient cash to meet its debts as and \nwhen they fall due and payable.   \nThe Directors believe that it is reasonably foreseeable that the \nconsolidated entity will continue as a going concern and that it is \nappropriate to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the \nfinancial report after consideration of the following factors:   \n•\nThe \nconsolidated \nentity \nis \ncurrently \nexploring \nsales \nopportunities with various potential customers across the\nGovernment and Private sectors;\n•\nFollowing a successful capital raising completed on 23\nDecember 2021 of $6.9 million, the Group has cash at bank as\nat 30 Jun ’22 of $6.5 million. A further $2 million cash has been\ncollected during July 22.\n•\nif necessary, the Company will consider additional capital\nraising activities through the issue of new share capital.\n(b)\nNew or amended Accounting Standards and\nInterpretations adopted\nThe Group has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting \nStandards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting \nStandards Board ('AASB') that are mandatory for the current \nreporting period. \nAny new or amended Accounting Standards or Interpretations, that \nare not yet mandatory, have not been early adopted. \n(c)\nBasis of preparation\nThese general-purpose financial statements have been prepared in \naccordance \nwith \nAustralian \nAccounting \nStandards \nand \nInterpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board \n('AASB') and the Corporations Act 2001, as appropriate for for-profit \noriented entities. These financial statements also comply with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the \nInternational Accounting Standards Board ('IASB'). \nHistorical cost convention \nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical \ncost convention, except for, where applicable, the revaluation of \navailable-for-sale financial assets, financial assets and liabilities at \nfair value through profit or loss, investment properties, certain \nclasses of property, plant and equipment and derivative financial \ninstruments. \nCritical accounting estimates \nThe preparation of the financial statements requires the use of \ncertain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to \nexercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's \naccounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of \njudgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates \nare significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 2. \n(d)\nParent company information\nIn accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, these financial \nstatements present the results of the Group only. Supplementary \ninformation about the parent entity is disclosed in note 28. \n(e)\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and \nliabilities of all subsidiaries of archTIS Limited ('company' or 'parent \nentity') as at 30 June 2022 and the results of all subsidiaries for the \nyear then ended. archTIS Limited and its subsidiaries together are \nreferred to in these financial statements as the 'Group'.  \nSubsidiaries are all those entities over which the Group has control. \nThe Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has \nrights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has \nthe ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the \nactivities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the \ndate on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-\nconsolidated from the date that control ceases. \nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on \ntransactions between entities in the Group are eliminated. Unrealised \nlosses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence \nof the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of \nsubsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure \nconsistency with the policies adopted by the Group. \nThe acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition \nmethod of accounting.  \nA change in ownership interest, without the loss of control, is \naccounted for as an equity transaction, where the difference between \nthe consideration transferred and the book value of the share of the \nnon-controlling interest acquired is recognised directly in equity \nattributable to the parent. \nNon-controlling interest in the results and equity of subsidiaries are \nshown separately in the statement of profit or loss and other \ncomprehensive income, statement of financial position and \nstatement of changes in equity of the Group. Losses incurred by the \nGroup are attributed to the non-controlling interest in full, even if that \nresults in a deficit balance. \nWhere the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the \nassets including goodwill, liabilities and non-controlling interest in the \nsubsidiary together with any cumulative translation differences \nrecognised in equity. The Group recognises the fair value of the \nconsideration received and the fair value of any investment retained \ntogether with any gain or loss in profit or loss. \n(f)\nForeign currency translation\nThe financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which \nis archTIS Limited's functional and presentation currency. \nForeign currency transactions \nForeign currency transactions are translated into Australian dollars \nusing the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. \nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of \nsuch  \nNOTES TO THE \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022\nNOTE 1.

The \nrevenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into \nAustralian dollars using the average exchange rates, which \napproximate the rates at the dates of the transactions, for the period. \nAll resulting foreign exchange differences are recognised in other \ncomprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in \nequity. \n \nThe foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss at \ndisposition of the foreign operation or net investment. \n(g)\nRevenue recognition\nThe Group earns revenues from consulting services, the sale of \nsolution services and software for secure information sharing and \ninter-organisational collaboration. It recognises revenue as follows: \nRevenue from contracts with customers \nRevenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration \nto which the Group is expected to be entitled in exchange for \ntransferring goods or services to a customer. For each contract with \na customer, the Group: identifies the contract with a customer; \nidentifies the performance obligations in the contract; determines the \ntransaction price which takes into account estimates of variable \nconsideration and the time value of money; allocates the transaction \nprice to the separate performance obligations on the basis of the \nrelative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service to \nbe delivered; and recognises revenue when or as each performance \nobligation is satisfied in a manner that depicts the transfer to the \ncustomer of the goods or services promised. \nVariable consideration within the transaction price, if any, reflects \nconcessions provided to the customer such as discounts, rebates \nand refunds, any potential bonuses receivable from the customer \nand any other contingent events. Such estimates are determined \nusing either the 'expected value' or 'most likely amount' method. The \nmeasurement of variable consideration is subject to a constraining \nprinciple whereby revenue will only be recognised to the extent that \nit is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of \ncumulative revenue recognised will not occur. The measurement \nconstraint continues until the uncertainty associated with the variable \nconsideration is subsequently resolved. Amounts received that are \nsubject to the constraining principle are recognised as a refund \nliability. \n \nRendering of services \nRevenue from a contract to provide services is recognised over time \nas the services are rendered based on either a fixed price or an \nhourly rate. \nInterest \nInterest revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective \ninterest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost \nof a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the \nrelevant period using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that \nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the \nexpected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the \nfinancial asset. \nOther revenue \nOther revenue is recognised when it is received or when the right to \nreceive payment is established. \n(h)\nIncome tax\nThe income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable \non that period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax \nrate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by the changes in deferred tax \nassets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences, unused \ntax losses and the adjustment recognised for prior periods, where \napplicable. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary \ndifferences at the tax rates expected to be applied when the assets \nare recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that \nare enacted or substantively enacted, except for: \n•\nWhen the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the\ninitial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a\ntransaction that is not a business combination and that, at the\ntime of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor\ntaxable profits; or\n•\nWhen the taxable temporary difference is associated with\ninterests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, and the\ntiming of the reversal can be controlled, and it is probable that\nthe temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable\nfuture.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary \ndifferences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future \ntaxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary \ndifferences and losses. \nThe carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax \nassets are reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax assets \nrecognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that \nfuture taxable profits will be available for the carrying amount to be \nrecovered. Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are \nrecognised to the extent that it is probable that there are future \ntaxable profits available to recover the asset. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a \nlegally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current \ntax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities; \nand they relate to the same taxable authority on either the same \ntaxable entity or different taxable entities which intend to settle \nsimultaneously. \narchTIS Limited (the 'head entity') and its wholly-owned Australian \nsubsidiaries have formed an income tax consolidated group under \nthe tax consolidation regime. The head entity and each subsidiary in \nthe tax consolidated group continue to account for their own current \nand deferred tax amounts. The tax consolidated group has applied \nthe 'separate taxpayer within group' approach in determining the \nappropriate amount of taxes to allocate to members of the tax \nconsolidated group.  \nIn addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the head \nentity also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the \ndeferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax \ncredits assumed from each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group. \nNOTES TO THE \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022\nNOTE 1.

All other assets are classified as non-current \nA liability is classified as current when: \n•\nit is either expected to be settled in the Group's normal\noperating cycle;\n•\nit is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n•\nit is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period;\nor\n•\nthere is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the\nliability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.\nAll other liabilities are classified as non-current. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-\ncurrent. \n(j)\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at \ncall with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid \ninvestments with original maturities of three months or less that are \nreadily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject \nto an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the statement of cash \nflows presentation purposes, cash and cash equivalents also \nincludes bank overdrafts, which are shown within borrowings in \ncurrent liabilities on the statement of financial position. \n(k)\nTrade and other receivables\nTrade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and \nsubsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest \nmethod, less any provision for expected credit losses. Trade \nreceivables are generally due for settlement within 30 days. \nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. \nDebts which are known to be uncollectable are written off by reducing \nthe carrying amount directly provision for impairment of trade \nreceivables is raised when there is objective evidence that the Group \nwill not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original \nterms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, \nprobability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial \nreorganisation and default or delinquency in payments (more than 60 \ndays overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable \nmay be impaired. The amount of the impairment allowance is the \ndifference between the asset's carrying amount and the present \nvalue of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original \neffective interest rate. Cash flows relating to short-term receivables \nare not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial. \nOther receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any \nprovision for impairment. \n(l)\nInvestments and other financial assets\nInvestments and other financial assets are initially measured at fair \nvalue. Transaction costs are included as part of the initial \nmeasurement, except for financial assets at fair value through profit \nor loss. They are subsequently measured at either amortised cost or \nfair value depending on their classification. Classification is \ndetermined based on the purpose of the acquisition and subsequent \nreclassification to other categories is restricted. \nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash \nflows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred \nand the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards \nof ownership. \nImpairment of financial assets \nThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether \nthere is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of \nfinancial assets is impaired. Objective evidence includes significant \nfinancial difficulty of the issuer or obligor; a breach of contract such \nas default or delinquency in payments; the lender granting to a \nborrower concession due to economic or legal reasons that the \nlender would not otherwise do; it becomes probable that the borrower \nwill enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; the \ndisappearance of an active market for the financial asset; or \nobservable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in \nestimated future cash flows. \nThe amount of the impairment allowance for financial assets carried \nat cost is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the \npresent value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the \ncurrent market rate of return for similar financial assets. \n(m) Property, plant and equipment\nEach class of plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less \naccumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes \nexpenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. \nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the net \ncost of each item of property, plant and equipment (excluding land) \nover their expected useful lives as follows: \nLeasehold improvements \nTerm of lease \nOffice furniture & equipment \n2-4 years\nComputer equipment \n2-4 years\nThe residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are \nreviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. \nLeasehold improvements and plant and equipment under lease are \ndepreciated over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated \nuseful life of the assets, whichever is shorter. \nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon \ndisposal or when there is no future economic benefit to the Group. \nGains and losses between the carrying amount and the disposal \nproceeds are taken to profit or loss. Any revaluation surplus reserve \nrelating to the item disposed of is transferred directly to retained \nprofits. \n(n)\nRight-of-use assets\nA right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of a \nlease. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which comprises \nthe initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any \nlease payments made at or before the commencement date net of \nany lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and, \nexcept where included in the cost of inventories, an estimate of costs \nexpected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying \nasset and restoring the site or asset. \nNOTES TO THE \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022\nNOTE 1.

      "text": "ANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n36\n(n)\nRight-of-use assets (continued)\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the \nunexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset, \nwhichever is the shorter. Where the consolidated entity expects to \nobtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, \nthe depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of use assets \nare subject to impairment or adjusted for any re-measurement of \nlease liabilities. \nThe consolidated entity has elected not to recognise a right-of-use \nasset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with \nterms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Lease \npayments on these assets are expensed to profit or loss as incurred. \n(o)\nLeases\nA lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. \nThe lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the \nlease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted \nusing the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be \nreadily determined, the consolidated entity's incremental borrowing \nrate. Lease payments comprise of fixed payments less any lease \nincentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an \nindex or a rate, amounts expected to be paid under residual value \nguarantees, exercise price of a purchase option when the exercise \nof the option is reasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated \ntermination penalties. The variable lease payments that do not \ndepend on an index or a rate are expensed in the period in which \nthey are incurred. \nLease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective \ninterest method. The carrying amounts are remeasured if there is a \nchange in the following: future lease payments arising from a change \nin an index or a rate used; residual guarantee; lease term; certainty \nof a purchase option and termination penalties. When a lease liability \nis remeasured, an adjustment is made to the corresponding right-of \nuse asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use \nasset is fully written down. \n(p)\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, other \nthan goodwill, are initially measured at their fair value at the date of \nthe acquisition. Intangible assets acquired separately are initially \nrecognised at cost. Indefinite life intangible assets are not amortised \nand are subsequently measured at cost less any impairment. Finite \nlife intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less \namortisation and any impairment. Gains or losses recognised in \nprofit or loss, arising from de-recognition of intangible assets, are \nmeasured as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the \ncarrying amount of the intangible asset. The method and useful lives \nof finite life intangible assets are reviewed annually. Changes in the \nexpected pattern of consumption or useful life are accounted for \nprospectively by changing the amortisation method or period. \nGoodwill \nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not \namortised. Instead, goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or \nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that \nit might be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated \nimpairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are taken to profit \nor loss and are not subsequently reversed. \nResearch and development \nResearch costs are expensed in the period in which they are \nincurred. Development costs are capitalised when it is probable that \nthe project will be a success considering its commercial and technical \nfeasibility; the Group is able to use or sell the asset; the Group has \nsufficient resources; and intent to complete the development and its \ncosts can be measured reliably. Capitalised development costs are \namortised on a systematic basis matched to the future economic \nbenefits over the useful life of the project. \nResearch and development tax incentive \nThe Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) is a 43.5% \nrefundable tax offset that is calculated as 43.5% of the eligible \nresearch and development expenditure that has been incurred by the \nGroup. The Directors consider any payment arising from the RDTI to \nbe a form of government assistance and are of the view that it is \nappropriate to recognise RDTI receipts as Government Grants in \naccordance with AASB120 Accounting for Government Grants and \nDisclosure of Government Assistance. \nAs such, RTDI refunds are recognised when there is a sufficient \ndegree of certainty that the Group will comply with the conditions \nattaching to RDTI and that the payment will be received. Such \nrefunds are recognised in the Statement of profit and loss and other \ncomprehensive income on a systematic basis over the periods in \nwhich the Group recognises as expenses the related costs for which \nthe assistance is intended to compensate. The proportion of the \nrefund that relates to capitalised development is deducted against \nthe carrying amount of the related non-current assets. Any remaining \nproportion that cannot be recognised on either of the preceding \nbases is recognised in the Statement of profit and loss and other \ncomprehensive income as \"\"Income from research and development \nclaim\"\". \nCustomer contracts \nCustomer contracts acquired in a business combination are \namortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected \nbenefit, being their finite life of between 3 to 5 years. \nSoftware \nSignificant costs associated with software are deferred and \namortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected \nbenefit, being their finite life of between 3 to 5 years. \nPatents and trademarks \nSignificant costs associated with patents and trademarks are \ndeferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of \ntheir expected benefit, being their finite life of 10 years. \n(q)\nImpairment of non-financial assets\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful \nlife are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for \nimpairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances \nindicate that they might be impaired. Other non-financial assets are \nreviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in \ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be \nrecoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by \nwhich the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. \nRecoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs \nof disposal and value-in-use. The value-in-use is the present value \nof the estimated future cash flows relating to the asset using a pre-\ntax discount rate specific to the asset or cash-generating unit to \nwhich the asset belongs. Assets that do not have independent cash \nflows are grouped together to form a cash-generating unit. \n(r)\nTrade and other payables\nThese amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided \nto the Group prior to the end of the financial year and which are \nunpaid. Due to their short-term nature they are measured at \namortised cost and are not discounted. The amounts are unsecured \nand are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. \nNOTES TO THE \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022\nNOTE 1.

They are \nsubsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest \nmethod. \n(t)\nFinance costs\nFinance costs attributable to qualifying assets are capitalised as part \nof the asset. All other finance costs are expensed in the period in \nwhich they are incurred. \n(u)\nProvisions\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present (legal or \nconstructive) obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable the \nGroup will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate \ncan be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised \nas a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to \nsettle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account \nthe risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. If the time \nvalue of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current \npre-tax rate specific to the liability. The increase in the provision \nresulting from the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. \n(v)\nEmployee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits\nLiabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, \nannual leave and long service leave expected to be settled wholly \nwithin 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the amounts \nexpected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. \nOther long-term employee benefits \nThe liability for annual leave and long service leave that is not \nexpected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date, are \nmeasured at the present value of expected future payments to be \nmade in respect of services provided by employees up to the \nreporting date using the projected unit credit method. Consideration \nis given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of \nemployee departures and periods of service. Expected future \npayments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date \non corporate bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, \nas closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. \nOther long-term employee benefits \nThe Group's obligations for long-term employee benefits are \npresented as non-current provisions in its statement of financial \nposition, except where the Group does not have an unconditional \nright to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the end of the \nreporting period, in which case the obligations are presented as \ncurrent provisions. \nDefined contribution superannuation expense \nContributions to defined contribution superannuation plans are \nexpensed in the period in which they are incurred.  \nShare-based payments \nEquity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation benefits \nare provided to employees. \nEquity-settled transactions are awards of shares or options over \nshares that are provided to employees in exchange for the rendering \nof services. Cash-settled transactions are awards of cash for the \nexchange of services, where the amount of cash is determined by \nreference to the share price. \nThe cost of equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value on \ngrant date. Fair value is independently determined using the \nBinomial option pricing model that takes into account the exercise \nprice, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at \ngrant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the \nexpected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of \nthe option, together with non-vesting conditions that do not determine \nwhether the Group receives the services that entitle the employees \nto receive payment. No account is taken of any other vesting \nconditions. \nThe cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense \nwith a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period. The \ncumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant \ndate fair value of the award, the best estimate of the number of \nawards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting \nperiod. The amount recognised in profit or loss for the period is the \ncumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts \nalready recognised in previous periods.  \nThe cost of cash-settled transactions is initially, and at each reporting \ndate until vested, determined by applying the Binomial option pricing \nmodel, taking into consideration the terms and conditions on which \nthe award was granted. \nThe cumulative charge to profit or loss until settlement of the liability \nis calculated as follows: \n•\nduring the vesting period, the liability at each reporting date is\nthe fair value of the award at that date multiplied by the expired\nportion of the vesting period.\n•\nfrom the end of the vesting period until settlement of the award,\nthe liability is the full fair value of the liability at the reporting\ndate.\nAll changes in the liability are recognised in profit or loss. The \nultimate cost of cash-settled transactions is the cash paid to settle \nthe liability. \nMarket conditions are taken into consideration in determining fair \nvalue therefore any awards subject to market conditions are \nconsidered to vest irrespective of whether or not that market \ncondition has been met, provided all other conditions are satisfied. \nIf equity-settled awards are modified, as a minimum an expense is \nrecognised as if the modification has not been made. An additional \nexpense is recognised, over the remaining vesting period, for any \nmodification that increases the total fair value of the share-based \ncompensation benefit as at the date of modification. \nIf the non-vesting condition is within the control of the Group or \nemployee, the failure to satisfy the condition is treated as a \ncancellation. If the condition is not within the control of the Group or \nemployee and is not satisfied during the vesting period, any \nremaining expense for the award is recognised over the remaining \nvesting period, unless the award is forfeited. \nIf equity-settled awards are cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested \non the date of cancellation, and any remaining expense is recognised \nimmediately. If a new replacement award is substituted for the \ncancelled award, the cancelled and new award is treated as if they \nwere a modification. \nNOTES TO THE \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022\nNOTE 1.

For non-financial assets, \nthe fair value measurement is based on its highest and best use. \nValuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and \nfor which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, are used, \nmaximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the \nuse of unobservable inputs. \nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified, into three \nlevels, using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the \ninputs used in making the measurements. Classifications are \nreviewed at each reporting date and transfers between levels are \ndetermined based on a reassessment of the lowest level of input that \nis significant to the fair value measurement. \nFor recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements, external \nvaluers may be used when internal expertise is either not available \nor when the valuation is deemed to be significant. External valuers \nare selected based on market knowledge and reputation. Where \nthere is a significant change in fair value of an asset or liability from \none period to another, an analysis is undertaken, which includes a \nverification of the major inputs applied in the latest valuation and a \ncomparison, where applicable, with external sources of data. \n(x)\nIssued capital\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity.\nIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or \noptions are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the \nproceeds. \n(y)\nDividends\nDividends are recognised when declared during the financial year \nand no longer at the discretion of the company. \n(z)\nBusiness combinations\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business \ncombinations regardless of whether equity instruments or other \nassets are acquired. \nThe consideration transferred is the sum of the acquisition-date fair \nvalues of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued or \nliabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree \nand the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For \neach business combination, the non-controlling interest in the \nacquiree is measured at either fair value or at the proportionate share \nof the acquiree's identifiable net assets. All acquisition costs are \nexpensed as incurred to profit or loss. \nOn the acquisition of a business, the consolidated entity assesses \nthe financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed for appropriate \nclassification and designation in accordance with the contractual \nterms, economic conditions, the consolidated entity's operating or \naccounting policies and other pertinent conditions in existence at the \nacquisition-date. \nWhere the business combination is achieved in stages, the \nconsolidated entity remeasures its previously held equity interest in \nthe acquiree at the acquisition-date fair value and the difference \nbetween the fair value and the previous carrying amount is \nrecognised in profit or loss. \nContingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is \nrecognised at the acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in \nthe fair value of the contingent consideration classified as an asset \nor liability is recognised in profit or loss. Contingent consideration \nclassified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement \nis accounted for within equity. \n(aa) Earnings per share \nBasic earnings per share \nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit \nattributable to the owners of archTIS Limited, excluding any costs of \nservicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average \nnumber of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, \nadjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the \nfinancial year. \nDiluted earnings per share \nDiluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the \ndetermination of basic earnings per share to take into account the \nafter income tax effect of interest and other financing costs \nassociated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted \naverage number of shares assumed to have been issued for no \nconsideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.  \n(bb) Goods and Services Tax ('GST') and other similar taxes \nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount \nof associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable from \nthe tax authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of \nthe acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. \nReceivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST \nreceivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or \npayable to, the tax authority is included in other receivables or other \npayables in the statement of financial position. \nCash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of \ncash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are \nrecoverable from, or payable to the tax authority, are presented as \noperating cash flows. \nCommitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of \nGST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority. \n(cc) New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet\nmandatory or early adopted\nNew Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or \nearly adopted \nAustralian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have \nrecently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, have \nnot been early adopted by the consolidated entity for the annual \nreporting period ended 30 June 2022.

      "text": "ANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n39\nARCHTIS LIMITED\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to \nmake judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the \nreported amounts in the financial statements. Management \ncontinually evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to \nassets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. \nManagement bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on \nhistorical experience and on other various factors, including \nexpectations of future events, management believes to be \nreasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting \njudgements and estimates will seldom equal the related actual \nresults. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a \nsignificant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying \namounts of assets and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within \nthe next financial year are discussed below. \nShare-based payment transactions \nThe Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with \nemployees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at \nthe date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by \nusing the Binomial model taking into account the terms and \nconditions upon which the instruments were granted. The accounting \nestimates and assumptions relating to equity-settled share-based \npayments would have no impact on the carrying amounts of assets \nand liabilities within the next annual reporting period but may impact \nprofit or loss and equity. \nFinite life intangible assets \nThe Group tests annually, or more frequently if events or changes in \ncircumstances indicate impairment, whether finite life intangible \nassets have suffered any impairment, in accordance with the \naccounting policy stated in note 1. The recoverable amounts of cash-\ngenerating units have been determined based on value-in-use \ncalculations. These calculations require the use of assumptions, \nincluding estimated discount rates based on the current cost of \ncapital and growth rates of the estimated future cash flows. \nGoodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets \nThe Group tests annually, or more frequently if events or changes in \ncircumstances indicate impairment, whether goodwill and other \nindefinite life intangible assets have suffered any impairment, in \naccordance with the accounting policy stated in note 1. The \nrecoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined \nbased on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the \nuse of assumptions, including estimated discount rates based on the \ncurrent cost of capital and growth rates of the estimated future cash \nflows. \nImpairment of non-financial assets other than goodwill and other \nindefinite life intangible assets \nThe Group assesses impairment of non-financial assets other than \ngoodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets at each reporting \ndate by evaluating conditions specific to the consolidated entity and \nto the particular asset that may lead to impairment. If an impairment \ntrigger exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. \nThis involves fair value less costs of disposal or value-in-use \ncalculations, which incorporate a number of key estimates and \nassumptions. \nIncome tax \nThe Group is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it \noperates. Significant judgement is required in determining the \nprovision for income tax. There are many transactions and \ncalculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for \nwhich the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group \nrecognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on the \nGroup's current understanding of the tax law. Where the final tax \noutcome of these matters is different from the carrying amounts, such \ndifferences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the \nperiod in which such determination is made. \nRecovery of deferred tax assets \nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary \ndifferences only if the Group considers it is probable that future \ntaxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary \ndifferences and losses. \nEmployee benefits provision \nAs discussed in note 1, the liability for employee benefits expected \nto be settled more than 12 months from the reporting date are \nrecognised and measured at the present value of the estimated \nfuture cash flows to be made in respect of all employees at the \nreporting date. In determining the present value of the liability, \nestimates of attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and \ninflation have been taken into account. \nLease make good provision \nA provision has been made for the anticipated costs for future \nrestoration of leased premises. The provision includes future cost \nestimates associated with closure of the premises. The calculation of \nthis provision requires assumptions such as application of closure \ndates and cost estimates. The provision recognised for each site is \nperiodically reviewed and updated based on the facts and \ncircumstances available at the time. Changes to the estimated future \ncosts for sites are recognised in the statement of financial position by \nadjusting the asset and the provision. Reductions in the provision \nthat exceed the carrying amount of the asset will be recognised in \nprofit or loss. \nCoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic \nJudgement has been exercised in considering the impacts that the \nCoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had, or may have, on the \nconsolidated entity based on known information. This consideration \nextends to the nature of the products and services offered, \ncustomers, supply chain, staffing and geographic regions in which \nthe consolidated entity operates. Other than as addressed in specific \nnotes, there does not currently appear to be either any significant \nimpact upon the financial statements or any significant uncertainties \nwith respect to events or conditions which may impact the \nconsolidated entity unfavourably as at the reporting date or \nsubsequently as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \nBusiness combinations \nAs discussed in note 1, business combinations are initially accounted \nfor on a provisional basis. The fair value of assets acquired, liabilities \nand contingent liabilities assumed are initially estimated by the \nconsolidated entity taking into consideration all available information \nat the reporting date. Fair value adjustments on the finalisation of the \nbusiness combination accounting is retrospective, where applicable, \nto the period the combination occurred and is subject to estimation \naround the valuation of intangibles which may have an impact on the \nassets and liabilities, depreciation and amortisation reported. \nNOTES TO THE \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022\nNOTE 2: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nFor personal use only"

Intangible assets \nThe proportion of product design and development expenses, less any tax incentive applicable, that create a benefit in \nfuture years, and meet certain requirements are capitalised as an intangible asset. These capitalised costs (intangibles) \nare then amortised to the Profit and Loss Statement over the estimated life of the asset created. The carrying value of \nintangibles is reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. \nIntangible assets recognised \nThe main intangible assets recognised during the financial period were for internally generated computer software and \ntechnology/ in-progress development, \nAs part of the acquisition of the software division of Cipherpoint Limited on 20 September 2021, computer software and \ncustomer contracts were recognised as detailed in note 35. \nInternally-generated software \nInternally-generated software development costs qualify for capitalisation when the Group can demonstrate all of the \nfollowing: \n•\nThe technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;\n•\nIts intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;\n•\nIts ability to use or sell the intangible asset;\n•\nThat the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;\n•\nThe availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell\nthe intangible asset; and\n•\nThe expenditure attributable to the intangible asset can be reliably measured during development.\nInternally-generated software development costs have a finite useful life and are amortised on a straight-line basis over \nits estimated useful life. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting \nperiod, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. \nThe software development asset has a useful life of five years and is amortised on a straight-line basis commencing from \nthe time the asset is held ready for use. The internally developed software asset, Kojensi.gov, was commercialised and \nlaunched in April 2019. Accordingly, this asset is amortised from this date. Costs which are incurred after the general \nrelease of internally generated software or costs which are incurred in order to enhance existing products are expensed \nin the period in which they are incurred and included within research and development expense in the financial \nstatements. \nDevelopment in progress \nResearch and development expenditure during the research phase of a project is recognised as an expense when \nincurred.  \nDevelopment costs are capitalised only when technical feasibility studies identify that the project is expected to deliver \nfuture economic benefits and these benefits can be measured reliably. The Group assesses the eligibility of development \ncosts for capitalisation on a project-by-project basis.  \nDevelopment costs capitalised are assessed annually for impairment. Costs capitalised to a project that is unlikely to \ndeliver future economic benefits are recognised as an expense at the date of impairment. \nFor personal use only"

The following assumptions were applied to arrive at the valuation: \n•\nChurn of 21%\n•\nAssumed price attrition over time of 5% per annum\n•\nFactored in costs of maintenance and support\n•\nDiscount rate of 18% used\n•\nContributory Asset Charge (CAC) for the software deducted from the Earnings after tax (on a post-tax basis)\nCustomer contracts are amortised over 3 years. \nSoftware \nSoftware acquired as part of the acquisition of the software division of Cipherpoint Limited was valued using the relief \nfrom royalty method.  The following input assumptions were adopted: \n•\nSales of cp.Protect and cp.Discover were taken from latest forecast model\n•\n5 years of data used\n•\nRoyalty rate of 18.8% sourced from peer companies using royalty range report from independent industry\nsource\n•\nDiscount rate applied to post tax amounts of 18%\nSoftware is amortised over the useful life of 3 years. \nGoodwill \nGoodwill on acquisition is derived as the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the fair \nvalue of the net assets acquired.

Share-based payments \nUnder the long-term incentive plan, performance rights are offered to participants which entitle the holder to ordinary shares \nin the company subject to meeting certain financial performance hurdles and the holder remaining in employment with the \ncompany until the nominated vesting date. \nThe performance hurdles in relation to performance rights granted in the 2022 financial year are subject to financial \nperformance conditions which measure growth in revenue, annual recurring revenue and containment of operating costs. \nThe performance hurdles are challenging but achievable and focus executives on sales growth consistent with shareholder \nwealth creation.  \nThe long-term incentive plan runs over a three year performance period and the rights will only vest if the performance hurdles \nare achieved. If the vesting conditions and performance hurdles are achieved, ordinary shares will be issued to the \nparticipants at no cost. If the performance hurdles are not met, then the rights lapse. \nFor performance rights granted to executives for the 2022 financial year, the vesting proportions based on the performance \nhurdles outlined in the Notice of Annual General Meeting announced 25 October 2021 (schedule 3) are outlined in the table \nbelow. \nRevenue for the financial period \nProportion of performance rights to vest \nif revenue hurdle is met \nLess than 75% of target \n0% \nBetween 75% - 100% of target \nStraight line vesting between 0% and 40% \nGreater than 100% of target \n40% \nAnnual recurring revenue for the financial \nperiod \nProportion of performance rights to vest if annual \nrecurring revenue hurdle is met \nLess than 75% of target \n0% \nBetween 75% - 100% of target \nStraight line vesting between 0% and 40% \nGreater than 100% of target \n40% \nOperating costs for the financial period \nProportion of performance rights to vest if \noperating costs hurdle is met \nGreater than 125% of target \n0% \nBetween 100% - 125% of target \nStraight line vesting between 0% and 20% \nLess than 100% of target \n20% \n* Subject to the holder remaining an ‘Eligible Participant’ under the Company’s Employee Incentive Plan as at:\na)\n15 December 2022, at which point 50% of performance rights that have previously met the relevant   performance milestone will vest; and\nb)\n15 June 2023, at which point the balance of the performance rights that have previously met the relevant   performance milestone will vest.\nThe Incentive Performance Rights expire on 24 November 2023. \nRecognition and measurement \nThe grant date fair value of performance rights granted to employees is recognised as an employee benefits expense, with \na corresponding increase in equity (share-based payment reserve), over the specified three year period that the performance \nrights vest.

The Group has a strict code of credit. The Group has adopted a lifetime expected loss allowance \nin estimating expected credit losses to trade receivables using fixed rates of credit loss provisioning. These \nprovisions are considered representative across all customers of the Group based on recent sales experience, \nhistorical collection rates and forward-looking information that is available. There are no guarantees against any \nreceivable but management closely monitors the receivable balance on a monthly basis and is in regular contact \nwith customers to mitigate risk. \nNOTES TO THE \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n30 JUNE 2022\nFor personal use only"

The purchase price must be \nallocated between the acquired assets and liabilities, \nat their respective fair values, with any difference \nrecognised as goodwill on consolidation. \nWe considered the transaction to be a key audit \nmatter because of: \n•\nthe judgments involved in the valuation of the\nintangible assets acquired;\n•\nthe complexity of the valuation of identified\nintangible assets as part of the acquisition; and\nthe treatment of inter-group trading operations in\nthe consolidation process.\nOur audit procedures included, among others: \n•\nObtaining the share purchase agreement and\nother associated documents, and understanding\nthe nature of the transaction to confirm that it met\nthe definition of Business Combinations under\nAASB 3 rather than being an asset acquisition;\n•\nReviewing the values for the equity consideration\n(including contingent consideration) to the signed\npurchase agreements and supporting\ncalculations;\n•\nAssessing the accuracy and completeness of the\nfair values of the identified assets and liabilities\nacquired;\n•\nReviewing the work performed by management\non the valuation of the tangible and intangible\nassets identified in the acquisition;\n•\nObtaining expert advice on the valuation\nmethodology and various inputs used by\nmanagement;\n•\nAssessing the accuracy and completeness of the\nelimination of inter-group transactions in the\nconsolidation process; and\n•\nWe evaluated the adequacy of the disclosure,\nincluded in Notes 1(aa), 2 and 34.\nFor personal use only"
