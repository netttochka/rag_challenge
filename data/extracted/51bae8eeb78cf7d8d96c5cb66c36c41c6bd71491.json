      "text": "Dear Stockholders,\nI am extremely pleased with our performance in 2022, especially in light of the macroeconomic impacts we faced \nthroughout the year, from a lingering pandemic and persistent supply chain challenges to rising inflation and a conflict in \nEurope. Despite these headwinds, we delivered above-market growth, gained market share, improved our balance sheet \nand continued to expand profitability for the third consecutive year. The result was a year of significant achievements:\n•\nDelivered strong financial performance — in 2022, we grew company revenue by 10%, and within our stated \nobjective of 8-12% growth, with product revenue growth of 15%. We set a record for revenue and increased \noperating margin by 230 basis points, positioning us well to achieve our long-term business model.\n•\nDrove substantial portfolio momentum and innovation — during the year, we ramped our flagship ICE6-based \nproducts to 28% of product revenue and ended the year with over 70 ICE6 customers, ranging from global service \nproviders to internet content providers. We continued to build on our metro portfolio momentum, growing revenue \nfor the flagship GX metro product by approximately 28% in the year. We also recently announced the availability of \nour ICE-X 100G and 400G-based pluggables and components, our next-generation 1.2 Terabit embedded optical \nengine, and the development of our 800G pluggable.\n•\nImproved customer experience — while aligning the organization to deliver increased value to our customers, we \nimproved upon key metrics that reflect our commitment to delivering a superior customer experience and unlocking \nthe value of true customer centricity.\nOur performance in 2022 demonstrates that we are making solid progress with our strategy and our portfolio is \nresonating with our global customers. Our vertical integration capabilities and differentiation have resulted in greater security \nand control over our supply chain, enabling us to deliver our solutions to our customers with what we believe are competitive \nlead times. \nOur accomplishments this past year further underscore the dedication and talent of an exceptional global team that I \nam honored to lead, and the power of a culture we continue to strengthen through our commitment to diversity, inclusion, \nsocial responsibility, innovation and execution excellence. Our people remain our greatest asset and the heart of our \nsuccess, and we continue to focus on their safety, well-being and career development and advancement as we drive the \nbusiness forward.\nWe leverage our U.S.-based semiconductor fabrication plant and in-house packaging capabilities to provide our \ncustomers with a critical and secure source of U.S.-produced optical semiconductors and to consistently pioneer critical \ntechnology advancements in critical infrastructure. This helps our customers around the world successfully realize \nunprecedented levels of network efficiency, scalability and automation that empower these and other critical end-user \napplications. With a strategy to drive stockholder value in the years ahead, our progress in 2022 represents a tangible proof \npoint that we are on the right trajectory to gain market share, continue to innovate to the delight of our customers and \nachieve our long-term business objectives.\nWe remain confident in our ability to create sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders, customers, partners, and \nemployees as we advance our mission of delivering industry-leading innovation in open optical systems and coherent optical \nsubsystems.\nYour voting support of the proposals described in the accompanying proxy statement would be deeply appreciated as \nwe work together to increase the value of your investment in Infinera.

      "text": "Board and Governance Highlights\nSeven out of nine of our directors, including our Chair, are independent in \naccordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing \nstandards of Nasdaq.\nBoard Independence\nThe Board consists of a diverse group of professionals who bring significant \nexperience, leadership and distinct qualities and skill sets to Infinera. Three \nout of nine of our directors are female (33%), one of whom was appointed as \nchair of our Compensation Committee during 2022 upon relinquishing her \nposition as chair of our Nominating and Governance Committee. One of our \ndirectors is an “underrepresented minority,” as such term is defined under \nNasdaq Rule 5605(f) (the “Nasdaq Board Diversity Rule”). While we believe \nthe current composition of the Board provides a diverse range of \nperspectives and experience to engage each other and management to \neffectively represent our stockholders, we will continue to consider gender, \ncultural and ethnic diversity when evaluating potential changes to our Board \nmembership.\nBoard Diversity\nWe have separated the positions of Chair and Chief Executive Officer \n(“CEO”).\nLeadership Structure\nThe Board and its committees assess their performance through an annual \nself-evaluation. \nBoard and Committee Evaluation\nThe average tenure of our current Board members is approximately five \nyears. We have refreshed our Board by appointing five new directors since \nthe beginning of fiscal 2020. \nBoard Tenure\nWe have three standing committees of the Board – Audit, Compensation, \nand Nominating and Governance. All committees are composed entirely of \nindependent directors. \nBoard Committees\nEach non-employee director is required to own shares of Infinera common \nstock having a value of at least four times the annual cash retainer for \nservice as a director. \nDirector Stock Ownership\nMembers of our senior management team are responsible for \nimplementation of our day-to-day risk management processes, while the \nBoard, as a whole and through its committees, has oversight of risk \nmanagement. \nRisk Oversight\nExecutive Compensation Program Highlights\nThe design of our executive compensation program for fiscal 2022 reflects our ongoing commitment to pay-for-\nperformance and the continued strong alignment of the interests of our named executive officers (“NEOs”) with those of our \nstockholders. At the beginning of fiscal 2022, when a majority of executive compensation decisions were made, the \nCompensation Committee considered the performance of our company as we exited fiscal 2021 and the goals of achieving \nprofitable revenue growth, achieving non-GAAP operating income growth despite a challenging supply chain environment, \nexpanding our gross margins and growing our total addressable market. The decisions made reflected a continuing effort to \nmaintain a strong pay-for-performance profile and supported accountability of our leadership team for our financial \nperformance.\n2"

      "text": "Fiscal 2022 Executive Compensation Highlights\nWe emphasize performance-based incentives for compensation of all of our \nNEOs, including, in particular, our CEO. Our compensation programs are \ndesigned to reward executives with realized compensation that exceeds \ntarget through a combination of strong stockholder returns and performance \nthat exceeds the targets approved for our short- and long-term incentive \nplans. In furtherance of our pay-for-performance goals, we continued to focus \non the Company’s financial performance in setting compensation programs. \nFor example, 60% of our CEO’s targeted equity awards in fiscal 2022 were \ngranted in the form of performance share awards.\nPay-for-Performance\nIn fiscal 2022, our Compensation Committee continued to focus on expense \nreduction and cash preservation in the face of continued challenges and \nuncertainty related to the challenging supply chain environment, while \nbalancing the need to effectively retain critical talent and incentivize \nachievement of key business objectives by our NEOs. The Compensation \nCommittee also approved the partial transition back to executive \ncompensation practices in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with our \nCEO and CFO participating in our annual corporate bonus plan instead of \nbeing granted additional retention equity awards. Our other NEOs were \neligible to participate in our annual corporate bonus plan at a level equal to \n50% of their target incentive compensation and were granted additional \nretention equity awards with a grant date value designed to approximate 50% \nof the target incentive compensation. \nExpense Reduction and Cash \nPreservation\nDuring fiscal 2022, we continued to make progress toward achievement of \nour longer-term strategic goals. Nevertheless, despite this progress, and \nconsistent with our compensation policy promoting strong pay and \nperformance alignment: \n– None of the performance shares granted to our NEOs in 2020, 2021 or \n2022 became eligible to vest based on performance during 2022, and it \nwas determined that the objectives underlying the performance shares \ngranted to our NEOs in 2020 (with a performance period ending in fiscal \n2022) would not be achieved; and \n– Realized compensation value for our CEO in fiscal 2022 was 52.5% of \nhis target compensation. \nLonger-Term Strategic Goals\nAs a complement to the executive compensation highlights referenced above, we continue to maintain sound \ncorporate governance policies and practices. During fiscal 2022, the following policies and practices continued to be in \neffect:\nCompensation At-Risk\nMajority Voting for the Election of Directors\nExecutive Clawback Policy\nStock Ownership Policy\nAnti-Hedging Policy\n“Double-Trigger” Change-of-Control Agreements\nNo Pledging of our Common Stock by NEOs\nAnnual Compensation Risk Assessment\nIndependent Compensation Consultant Reporting Directly \nto Compensation Committee\nFully Independent Audit, Compensation and Nominating and \nGovernance Committees\n3"

In \ndischarging its responsibilities to nominate candidates for election to the Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee \nendeavors to identify, recruit and nominate candidates who demonstrate character, sound judgment, independence, \nexpertise and diversity of experience. The Nominating and Governance Committee seeks to ensure that the Board is \ncomposed of individuals of diverse backgrounds who have a variety of complementary experience, training, attributes and \nrelationships relevant to our business. In nominating candidates to fill vacancies created by the expiration of the term of a \ndirector, the Nominating and Governance Committee determines whether the incumbent director is willing to stand for re-\nelection. The Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates each director’s performance to determine suitability for re-\nelection, taking into consideration, among other things, each director’s willingness to fully participate and contribute to the \nBoard and its committees, ability to work constructively with the rest of the members of the Board, personal and professional \nintegrity and familiarity with our business, operations and markets.\nEach of the nominees to fill positions as Class I directors has consented to serve if elected. However, if any of the \npersons nominated by the Board subsequently declines to accept election, or is otherwise unavailable for election prior to \nthe Annual Meeting, proxies solicited by the Board will be voted by the proxy holders for the election of any other person or \npersons as the Board may recommend, at its option, or may decide to further reduce the number of directors that constitute \nthe entire Board.\n9"

Our Class I directors, whose terms expire at the Annual Meeting, are Roop K. Lakkaraju, Amy H. Rice and \nGeorge A. Riedel.\nThe nomination of these directors to stand for election at the Annual Meeting has been recommended by the \nNominating and Governance Committee and has been approved by the Board. Each of the nominees for our Class I \ndirectors, if elected, will serve for a three-year term expiring at the 2026 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or until his or her \nsuccessor is duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal from the Board.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws (“Bylaws”) provide that, in an election of directors where the number of nominees \ndoes not exceed the number of directors to be elected, a nominee for director is elected if the votes cast for such nominee \nexceed the votes cast against such nominee. If a nominee for director fails to receive the required number of votes for re-\nelection, such director shall offer to properly tender his or her resignation (to the extent not already tendered) to the \nNominating and Governance Committee, which shall then make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or \nreject such director’s resignation or whether other action should be taken. Thereafter, the Board will act on the Nominating \nand Governance Committee’s recommendation. The Board will publicly disclose its decision and its rationale within 90 days \nof the certification of the election results. The director whose resignation is under consideration shall abstain from \nparticipating in any decision regarding that resignation.\nWe will also disclose the voting results from the Annual Meeting on a Current Report on Form 8-K that we will file with \nthe SEC within four business days after the meeting. If final voting results are not available to us in time to file a Form 8-K, \nwe will file a Form 8-K to publish preliminary results and will provide the final results in an amendment to the Form 8-K as \nsoon as they become available.\nDirector Diversity\nWe believe the current Board consists of a diverse group of professionals, including former CEOs, CFOs and industry \nleaders, who bring significant leadership and distinct qualities and skill sets to Infinera, including direct stockholder \nrepresentation by our second largest stockholder. This group provides a diverse range of perspectives and experience to \nengage each other and management to effectively represent our stockholders. In addition, the Board added its first female \ndirector in June 2019 and second and third female directors in 2020. In 2020, the Board appointed a female director as chair \nof our Nominating and Governance Committee; in 2022, she relinquished this role when she was appointed as chair of our \nCompensation Committee. In 2022, the Board also added a director who is an “underrepresented minority,” as such term is \ndefined under the Nasdaq Board Diversity Rule. These actions further highlight our commitment to diversity. Any search \nfirms retained to assist the Nominating and Governance Committee will be specifically advised to seek to include qualified, \ndiverse candidates from traditional and nontraditional environments, including members of underrepresented communities, \nas was done for the Board search process conducted in 2021.\nThe following table provides certain information regarding the diversity of our Board as of March 31, 2023. As shown \nbelow in the board diversity matrix, the Company is currently in compliance with the diversity requirements of the Nasdaq \nlisting rules (5605 and 5606) that mandate gender and other diversity disclosure on our Board and require us to disclose \ninformation on each director’s voluntary self-identified characteristics in a board diversity matrix.\nBoard Diversity Matrix (As of March 31, 2023)\nTotal number of directors\n9\nGender Identity\nFemale\nMale\nDid Not Disclose Gender\nDirectors\n3\n5\n1\nDemographic Background\nAsian\n0\n1\nWhite\n3\n4\nDid Not Disclose Demographic Background\n1\nDirectors Who Are Military Veterans\n1\nIndependence of the Board\nOn an annual basis, in accordance with the current listing standards of Nasdaq, the Board affirmatively determines the \nindependence of each director or nominee for election as a director.

Success in our sector in \nparticular depends on maintaining an ability to identify challenges early, maintaining the best possible security and \ngovernance practices, and fostering an ability to pivot quickly and continually.\nBoard Oversight of Risk\nRisk is inherent with every business and the Board is responsible for overseeing our risk management function, \nincluding a regular review of our strategic plans and business objectives. Members of our senior management team are \nresponsible for implementation of our day-to-day risk management processes, while the Board, as a whole and through its \ncommittees, has responsibility for the oversight of overall risk management. In addition, each of the committees of the Board \nconsiders any risks that may be within its area of responsibilities and Board members, or Board committee members, \nperiodically engage in discussions with members of our senior management team as appropriate. Specifically, the Audit \nCommittee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to risk management in the areas of \nfinancial reporting, internal controls, key accounting and reporting policies, and cybersecurity, as well as meeting with the \nVice President of Internal Audit and our external independent auditors. The Compensation Committee assists the Board in \nfulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks arising from our compensation policies and \nprograms. The Nominating and Governance Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with \nrespect to the management of risks associated with Board organization, membership and structure, succession planning for \nour directors and executive officers, and corporate governance.

The Code of \nBusiness Conduct and Ethics reflects our policy of dealing honestly and with integrity with everyone, including our \ncustomers, employees, investors and suppliers. We require all employees to complete training on our Code of Business \nConduct and Ethics.\nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is just one element of the many practices and procedures we utilize to try to \ncreate a diverse and inclusive culture that encourages helpful and honest communication both up and down reporting \nrelationship chains. Our executive leaders set the tone for this culture at the top and our ability to maintain a positive and \ncreative work environment depends on its success. Our annual Infinera Environmental, Social and Governance Report \ndescribes some of the additional programs and practices we maintain to protect our people and promote their productivity, \nhealth and well-being. \nA copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our website at investors.infinera.com/ by clicking \non “Governance Documents” under the “Governance” heading.

      "text": "HOW WE ARE ORGANIZED\nBoard Leadership Structure\nThe Board believes its current leadership structure best serves the objectives of the Board’s oversight of management, \nthe Board’s ability to carry out its roles and responsibilities on behalf of our stockholders, and our overall corporate \ngovernance. Separating the positions of Chair of the Board and CEO allows our CEO to focus on our day-to-day business, \nwhile allowing the Chair of the Board to lead the Board in its fundamental role of providing advice to and independent \noversight of management. While our Bylaws do not require that our Chair of the Board and CEO positions be separate, the \nBoard believes that having separate positions is the appropriate leadership structure for Infinera at this time and \ndemonstrates our commitment to good corporate governance practices. The Board has assigned the Chair of the Board \nresponsibility for presiding over meetings of the Board, developing meeting agendas, facilitating communication between \nmanagement and the independent directors, representing the views of the independent directors to management and \nimproving meeting effectiveness, among other things.\nThe Board also believes that the combination of an independent Chair of the Board, all three of our current standing \ncommittees being comprised entirely of independent directors and the regular use of executive sessions of the independent \ndirectors enables the Board to maintain independent oversight of our strategies and activities.\nAgreement with Oaktree Optical Holdings\nIn April 2020, we entered into a letter agreement with Oaktree Optical Holdings, L.P. (“Oaktree”) pursuant to which we \nagreed, among other things, to nominate and support Ms. Rice for election as a director at the 2020 Annual Meeting of \nStockholders. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the letter agreement, Oaktree and certain affiliates agreed to vote all \nof its shares at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in a manner consistent with the recommendation of our Board. \nOaktree also agreed to customary standstill restrictions. Our letter agreement with Oaktree also required that Infinera and \nOaktree reasonably cooperate to identify a director candidate (the “Independent Designee”) for consideration by our \nNominating and Governance Committee. In June 2020, Ms. Bucklin joined the Board as the Independent Designee. \nMs. Rice has been nominated for re-election as a Class I director at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nInformation Regarding the Board and its Committees\nMr. Lakkaraju joined our Board in February 2022. Thomas J. Fallon and Kambiz Y. Hooshmand resigned from our \nBoard in February 2022, and Marcel Gani and Mark Wegleitner’s service on our Board terminated in May 2022 upon the \nconclusion of our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nThe Board met nine times during fiscal 2022. The Board acted by written consent four times during fiscal 2022. During \nfiscal 2022, each director then in office attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Board. During fiscal 2022, each director \nthen in office attended 75% or more of the meetings of the committees on which he or she served during the period for \nwhich he or she was a committee chair or committee member, as applicable. Our independent directors meet in executive \nsessions, without management present, during most regular meetings of the Board. Directors are encouraged, but not \nrequired, to attend our annual meetings of stockholders. Eight of the then-serving members of the Board attended our 2022 \nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders.\n15"

The Nominating and Governance Committee acted by written consent one time during fiscal 2022. Each \nmember of the Nominating and Governance Committee satisfies the independence requirements under the applicable \nNasdaq listing standards.\nBoard Nominees and Diversity\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee reviews and reports to the Board on a periodic basis with regard to \nmatters of corporate governance, and reviews, assesses and makes recommendations on the effectiveness of our corporate \ngovernance policies. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the \nBoard regarding the size and composition of the Board and the appropriate skills and characteristics required of our \ndirectors in the context of the then-current composition of the Board. This includes an assessment of each candidate’s \nindependence, personal and professional integrity, financial literacy or other professional or business experience relevant to \nan understanding of our business, ability to think and act independently and with sound judgment, and ability to serve our \nstockholders’ long-term interests. The Board and the Nominating and Governance Committee follow a process in which we \nconsider governance best practices when reviewing the overall composition of the Board and considering the slate of \nnominees for annual election to the Board and the appointment of individual directors to the Board. The Board and \nNominating and Governance Committee evaluate the skill sets needed to provide the right level of guidance and oversight to \nthe management team. Within the context of evaluating the skills needed on the Board, the Nominating and Governance \nCommittee also considers diversity attributes, including gender, race, ethnicity, specialized expertise and a range of insight \ngathered from relevant industries. These factors, and others considered useful by the Nominating and Governance \nCommittee, are reviewed in the context of an assessment of the perceived needs of the Board at a particular point in time.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee leads the search for, selects and recommends candidates for election to \nthe Board. Consideration of new director candidates typically involves a series of committee discussions, review of \ninformation concerning candidates and interviews with selected candidates. From time to time, the Nominating and \nGovernance Committee may engage the services of a search firm to identify director candidates. Any search firms retained \nto assist the Nominating and Governance Committee will be specifically advised to seek to include qualified, diverse \ncandidates from traditional and nontraditional environments, including members of underrepresented communities, as was \ndone for the Board search process conducted in 2021. The Nominating and Governance Committee will also consider \ncandidates proposed in writing by stockholders, provided such proposal meets the eligibility requirements for submitting \nstockholder proposals for inclusion in our next proxy statement and is accompanied by the required information about the \ncandidate specified in Section 2.4 of our Bylaws. Candidates proposed by stockholders are evaluated by the Nominating \nand Governance Committee using the same criteria as for all other candidates.\nIf a stockholder wishes to recommend a director candidate for consideration by the Nominating and Governance \nCommittee, pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the stockholder must have held at least 1,000 shares of our \ncommon stock for at least six months and must notify the Nominating and Governance Committee by writing to our \nCorporate Secretary at our principal executive offices, and must include the following information:\n•\nTo the extent reasonably available, information relating to such director candidate that would be required to be \ndisclosed in a proxy statement pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, in which such individual \nwould be a nominee for election to the Board;\n•\nThe director candidate’s written consent to (a) if selected, be named in our proxy statement and proxy, and (b) if \nelected, to serve on the Board;\n•\nThe other information set forth in the applicable sections of Section 2.4 of our Bylaws; and\n•\nAny other information that such stockholder believes is relevant in considering the director candidate.\nNon-Executive Equity Award Subcommittee\nThe guidelines for the size of new hire, promotional and annual retention equity awards for Section 16 Officers are \nperiodically reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has delegated to the \nNon-Executive Equity Award Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”) the authority to formally approve new hire, promotional \nand retention equity awards to certain employees and consultants pursuant to guidelines pre-approved from time to time by \nthe Compensation Committee. The delegation to the Subcommittee does not include the authority to grant equity awards to \nnew employees who are or are reasonably expected to become Section 16 Officers or to current Section 16 Officers. The \ndelegation of authority to the Subcommittee is not exclusive and the Board and Compensation Committee have retained the \nright to approve any equity awards at their discretion. The Subcommittee acted by written consent thirteen times during \nfiscal 2022. This Subcommittee is currently comprised solely of our CEO (who is also a Board member).\n18"

      "text": "Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation \nDuring fiscal 2022 at different times, Messrs. Dougherty, Gani, Milbury and Riedel and Ms. Holt served on the \nCompensation Committee. None of these individuals was an executive officer or employee of Infinera at any time during \nfiscal 2022, or at any other time. No member of the Compensation Committee had any relationship with Infinera during fiscal \n2022 requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. None of our executive officers has \never served as a member of the board or compensation committee of any other entity that has or has had one or more \nexecutive officers serving as a member of the Board or Compensation Committee.\nHOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH US\nThe Board actively seeks input from stockholders, stakeholders, thought leaders and many others to perform its \nfunctions optimally. As stockholders bring wide and relevant experiences and have a financial stake in the wisdom of their \ninput, the Board values maintaining a number of avenues to receive that input. These include: \n•\nStockholder attendance or participation at our annual stockholders meetings \n•\nInput from proxy voting \n•\nUse of the company’s various reporting mechanisms such as its “hot lines” and reports to the internal audit \nfunction \n•\nParticipation in our numerous investor relations programs and conferences \nWrite to the Board as a whole, or to individual directors, at the following address: \nBoard of Directors c/o Corporate Secretary \nInfinera Corporation\n6373 San Ignacio Avenue\nSan Jose, California 95119\nCommunications are distributed to the Board or to any individual director, as appropriate, depending on the facts and \ncircumstances outlined in the communication. At the direction of the Board, all mail received may be opened and screened \nfor security purposes. Communications that are unduly hostile, threatening, illegal or similarly unsuitable will be excluded \nwith the provision that any communication that is filtered out will be made available to any independent or non-employee \ndirector upon request.\nHOW WE ARE PAID\nOur compensation program for our non-employee directors is designed to attract and retain highly qualified, \nindependent directors to represent stockholders on the Board and to act in their best interests. Non-employee directors \nreceive a mix of cash compensation and equity awards under this program. Directors who are also employees of Infinera do \nnot participate in our director compensation program, nor do they receive any additional compensation for their service as \ndirectors. The Compensation Committee, which consists solely of independent directors, has the primary responsibility for \nreviewing and recommending any changes to our director compensation program, with compensation changes approved or \nratified by the full Board. \nAs part of its review of our director compensation program, the Compensation Committee engaged Compensia, Inc. \n(“Compensia”), an independent compensation consultant, to provide relevant market data in December 2021 regarding \ndirector compensation derived from the same peer group used at the time for evaluating our executive compensation. After \nconsidering the market data provided by Compensia, the Compensation Committee resolved to recommend that the Board \napprove certain changes to our director compensation program to align more closely with market practice, including an \nincrease in cash compensation for the Chair of the Board, an increase in the annual equity grant value, the elimination of the \ninitial equity grant for new non-employee directors, and the revision of the annual equity grant to provide for a full pro rata \nprovision based on when a director joins the Board. Accordingly, in February 2022, our Board approved these compensation \nchanges, which are discussed below in “How We Are Paid—Director Fees” and “How We Are Paid—Director Equity \nAwards.” During late fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee again engaged Compensia to review market data on director \ncompensation provided by Compensia using the peer group approved in September 2022 for use in evaluating our \nexecutive compensation for fiscal 2023. This approved peer group was updated from the peer group that had been \napproved for use in evaluating our executive compensation for fiscal 2022 which is discussed below in “Compensation \nDiscussion and Analysis.” The Compensation Committee concluded that in light of our director compensation program \ngenerally aligning with market competitive levels, no change in director compensation would be recommended at that time.\n19"

      "text": "OUR PAY \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThis Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides information related to the fiscal 2022 compensation program and \nrelated decisions for our NEOs identified below. \nOur Named Executive Officers \nFor fiscal 2022, our NEOs were the following: \n•\nDavid W. Heard, our CEO; \n•\nNancy L. Erba, our CFO; \n•\nDavid L. Teichmann, our Chief Legal Officer (“CLO”) and Corporate Secretary; and \n•\nNicholas R. Walden, our Senior Vice President, Worldwide Sales. \nExecutive Summary\nFiscal 2022 Business Results \nFiscal 2022 was a year in which we continued to strengthen our product portfolio, accelerate growth and expand \nmargins. We continued to make strong progress toward our overall financial and strategic goals while navigating an ongoing \nglobal pandemic and the increased impact of supply chain disruptions. Below are five key accomplishments in fiscal 2022.\nFirst\nWe delivered against our major financial milestones; we grew revenue 10% on a year-over-year \nbasis; we set a record for booking and backlog, and exited the year with remaining performance \nobligations of approximately $983 million, up approximately $220 million year-over-year; and \nimproved operating margin by 230 basis points year-over-year. We also strengthened our balance \nsheet by refinancing a portion of our debt and therefore reducing our 2024 convertible debt to \napproximately $100 million (down from approximately $400 million) and put in place a new asset-\nbacked lending facility with expanded capacity and better terms. \nSecond\nWe drove commercial success across our customer footprint as we secured new service provider \nand internet content provider (“ICP”) design wins. In fiscal 2022, we had record bookings and \nrevenue with ICPs; we have grown our ICP revenue at a 40% compound annual growth rate since \n2019. And in subsea, a market characterized by stringent capacity and reach requirements, we grew \noverall revenue by over 40% in 2022. \nThird \nWe expanded our product portfolio, securing design wins and gaining market share with our \ncompact modular platforms, line systems, and metro products. At the end of fiscal 2022, we had \ngrown revenue from our 800G ICE6 GX product to 28% as a percentage of product revenue. In \naddition, our metro portfolio revenue grew in the high-single percentage range in the year led by \ngrowth of approximately 28% for the flagship GX metro product. \nFourth\nWe also validated our ZR+ pluggables with a Tier 1 operator in the field and recently announced the \navailability of our ICE-X 100G and 400G-based subsystems and pluggables. The commercialization \nof our subsystems products will expand our addressable market, drive additional revenue growth, \nand enable an increase in margins from higher levels of vertical integration in our metro portfolio. \nThe Open XR Forum which we launched in June 2021 also now has 30 members, including service \nproviders and network equipment manufacturers, demonstrating momentum within our industry for \nthis new technology as well as our commitment to open networks in the industry. \nFifth\nOur 8+x4x1 strategy is winning and our refreshed portfolio is resonating with our customers. During \nfiscal 2022, revenue from our 800G ICE6 product exceeded our stated objective of 20-25% of \nproduct revenue for growth. We are also developing an 800G pluggable. At 400G, our metro \nplatforms are winning, and we are launching our pluggables, which are now commercially available. \nAt 100G, we are developing our pluggables for commercial deployment and excited about the \npotential for our point-to-multipoint architectures to revolutionize access networks.\n24"

      "text": "Pay-for-Performance with Respect to Fiscal 2022 CEO Compensation \nWe emphasize performance-based incentives for compensation for all of our NEOs, including in particular our CEO, as \nevidenced in the chart below, which illustrates the target total direct compensation (i.e., base salary, target cash incentive \nopportunity, and equity awards) of our CEO versus our CEO’s actual realized compensation during the most recent three \nfiscal years, as well as our stock price during that time period. Mr. Heard served as our CEO during fiscal 2021 and 2022, as \nwell as part of fiscal 2020 beginning November 23, 2020. Thomas J. Fallon served as our CEO during most of fiscal 2020. \nMr. Fallon’s compensation is reflected for fiscal 2020 in the chart below. Target total direct compensation is defined as the \nsum of the base salary rate approved for each fiscal year, the target cash incentive for the year, and the grant date target \nvalue of equity awards. The target value of equity awards reflects the grant date share price of performance share awards, \nwhich differs from the value reported in the Summary Compensation Table further below. Actual realized compensation \nincludes the base salary and any cash annual incentive earned during the year plus the sum of any RSUs and performance \nshares that vested during the year, valued using the share price on the vesting date, which differs from the values shown in \nthe Pay Versus Performance table further below given the specific requirements with respect to “compensation actually paid” \nunder such table.\nAs described above, our CEO target total direct compensation emphasizes compensation that aligns with investor \ninterests, including an at-risk annual incentive (in fiscal 2020) and long-term vesting equity awards. When the Company’s \nperformance is strong, our compensation programs are designed to reward executives with realized compensation that \nexceeds target through a combination of strong stockholder returns and performance that exceeds the targets approved for \nour short- and long-term incentive plans. Realized compensation for fiscal 2022 for our CEO was 52.5% of target. This \nreflected in part the depreciation in the value of equity awards granted in prior years but that vested during fiscal 2022, as \nthe closing share price of our common stock decreased from $7.94 on December 31, 2019 (the start of the 3-year period \ndetailed in the chart above) to a closing price of $6.74 on December 30, 2022 (which was the last trading day of our fiscal \n2022). The forfeiture of the performance share awards granted in fiscal 2020 with a performance period ending in fiscal 2022 \nalso contributed to the decline in the realized compensation for fiscal 2022 (see the section below titled “Performance Share \nAwards” for more information regarding these performance share awards). As a result of our emphasis on pay-for-\nperformance, the realized compensation of our then CEO fell significantly below his target total direct compensation in fiscal \n2020 and fiscal 2022 but was slightly above target in fiscal 2021. In furtherance of our pay-for-performance goals, 60% of \nMr. Heard’s targeted equity awards in fiscal 2022 were also granted in the form of performance share awards.\n27"

To \nachieve this mission, we take a “pay-for-performance” approach that forms the foundation for the design of our executive \ncompensation program. The Compensation Committee also designs the various components of our executive compensation \nprogram to support our company culture and performance (i.e., increasing levels of accountability through the use of “at risk” \npay for more senior level employees), current business priorities and strategy and product development cycles, and takes \ninto consideration in its design the current market practices of our peer group. Further, certain elements of our compensation \nprogram measure progress on similar metrics in the short and long term and contain rewards for our executives that are \nearned when certain strategically important financial milestones are met and sustained. We believe this program is in the \nbest interests of and aligned with our stockholders and maximizes the incentive for our employees and executive team to \ndeliver stockholder value.\n28"

Our stockholders overwhelmingly approved this say-on-pay \nproposal, with more than 98% of votes cast voting in favor of our executive compensation program. Noting the results of this \nvote, the Compensation Committee considered this stockholder approval when making compensation decisions for fiscal \n2022 as well as fiscal 2023.\nIn light of the 2022 say-on-pay vote, the Compensation Committee has maintained a consistent general approach to \nour executive officer compensation program in 2023. This included a continued emphasis on pay-for-performance through \nthe use of performance shares that reward executive officers only if they deliver value for our stockholders.\nThe Compensation Committee will continue to consider input from our stockholders as reflected in the outcome of our \nannual say-on-pay vote when making executive compensation program decisions.\nCompensation-Setting Process\nRole and Authority of Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is responsible for our executive \ncompensation program and all related policies and practices. The Compensation Committee has the responsibility to \nestablish and approve the compensation of each of our executive officers, including our NEOs. In addition, the \nCompensation Committee reviews and administers our equity and employee benefit plans and programs, which are \ngenerally available to our employees, including our NEOs. The Compensation Committee also has the authority to engage \nits own advisors to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities, and the reasonable compensation for such advisor services is \npaid by Infinera.\nRole of Compensation Consultant. During fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee engaged the services of \nCompensia, a national compensation consulting firm, as its independent compensation consultant to provide advice on \nmatters relating to the compensation of our executives and non-employee directors. Compensia attended several of the \nCompensation Committee’s meetings during fiscal 2022 and provided the Compensation Committee with an analysis of \nindustry-sector competitive market data regarding NEO compensation, information on compensation trends, peer group and \ngeneral market data, as well as assistance with the parameters used to determine the peer group, base salary, incentive \nplan design, equity compensation and the structure of our executive compensation program. During fiscal 2022, Compensia \nalso provided general observations about our compensation programs and reviewed and provided input on this \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis section.\nCompensia reports directly to the Compensation Committee. During fiscal 2022, Compensia interacted with \nmanagement at the direction of the Compensation Committee but did not provide any other services for Infinera or its \nmanagement team. Compensia’s fees in fiscal year 2022 were paid by Infinera. The Compensation Committee annually \nreviews the independence of its compensation consultant and during fiscal 2022 determined that there were no conflicts of \ninterest in connection with Compensia’s work.\nDetermination of CEO Compensation. Compensia provides market data and considerations for the Compensation \nCommittee regarding the amount and form of our CEO’s compensation. As part of this process, the Compensation \nCommittee considers input from the Board and feedback from the Chair of the Board, in particular with respect to the \nperformance of our CEO. After considering the feedback and recommendations received, all decisions regarding our CEO’s \ncompensation are made by the Compensation Committee, based on its own judgment and after considering the interests of \nour stockholders, in executive sessions excluding our CEO.\nDetermination of Non-CEO NEO Compensation. As a result of his close working relationship with each of the other \nNEOs, our CEO is asked to provide his assessment of their performance to the Compensation Committee, including \nconsiderations regarding retention and importance of their contributions to Infinera. Our CEO is assisted by our Chief \nHuman Resources Officer in making these assessments. Our CEO then presents his performance assessment of the other \nNEOs and makes formal recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding adjustments to base salary, annual \ncash incentive award opportunities, and equity awards for our NEOs (other than himself). While the Compensation \nCommittee considers the recommendations of our CEO in determining compensation for our other NEOs, ultimately its \ndecisions are based on its own judgment and the interests of our stockholders. None of our NEOs makes any \nrecommendations regarding his or her own compensation and none of our NEOs are present at meetings at the time their \ncompensation is determined.\n29"

We believe each is \nnecessary to attract, retain and motivate our executive officers, on whom our success largely depends.\nPay Element\nType\nForm/Purpose\nBase Salary\nFixed\nWe pay base salaries to attract, retain and motivate our executive \nofficers for their day-to-day contributions. \nAnnual Incentive \nCompensation\nVariable\nWe provide annual incentive cash compensation to link payments to \nthe achievement of our annual financial and/or operational objectives. \nWe had cancelled this program in response to impacts from the \nCOVID-19 pandemic for the second half of fiscal 2020 and all of fiscal \n2021, but reinstated an annual incentive cash compensation program \nfor our CEO and CFO in fiscal 2022. For our other NEOs, the annual \nincentive compensation program was reinstated in fiscal 2022 with \n50% of the target value in retention RSUs and 50% of the target value \nin cash. Our SVP, Worldwide Sales participated in this annual incentive \ncompensation program (including the 50%/50% ratio between cash \nand retention equity) as to 25% of his target value and also participated \nin a separate incentive compensation program as to 75% of his target \nvalue that was tied to achievement of new financial targets for bookings \nand gross profit, measured on a non-GAAP basis. \nLong-Term Incentive \nCompensation\nVariable\nWe provide long-term incentive compensation delivered in the form of \ntime-based and performance-based equity awards to more closely \nalign the interests of our executive officers with those of our \nstockholders and provide significant motivational and retention value to \nour executive officers.\nIn addition, we also provide employee benefits that are generally available to all our employees including our NEOs, \nand certain severance and “double-trigger” change of control payments and benefits as part of our executive compensation \nprogram, as described further below.\nAllocation of Compensation Across Pay Elements\nIn determining how to allocate an NEO’s target total direct compensation opportunity among these various elements, \nthe Compensation Committee considers market-competitive practices for companies of a similar size and with a comparable \nbusiness focus. Individual retention considerations specific to the individual are also factored in the Compensation \nCommittee’s final determination of target total direct compensation. Equity awards, which for fiscal 2022 consisted of awards \nof time-based RSUs and performance shares, represented the largest component of our NEOs’ target total direct \ncompensation opportunity. This approach was designed to encourage sustained, long-term performance and to ensure \ncloser alignment of the interests of our NEOs with those of our stockholders. Consistent with our “pay-for-performance” \nphilosophy, a significant portion of our NEOs’ fiscal 2022 target total direct compensation opportunity was completely “at \nrisk,” including 59% of Mr. Heard’s target total direct compensation opportunity. We define “at risk” compensation as \nopportunities for which vesting eligibility is contingent upon achievement of specified performance conditions. In fiscal 2022, \nthis included annual target incentive compensation under the 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan and performance share awards, \nwhere the value of performance shares is included in the charts below based on the grant date target value of shares \nawarded.\n30"

The target selection criteria for the peer group identified in \nSeptember 2021 and used for fiscal 2022 compensation planning were:\n•\nIndustry: companies in the communications equipment sector and Infinera’s direct competitors, as well as other \ncompanies in broader technology sectors, with a focus on companies that overlap with key elements of Infinera’s \nbusiness; \n•\nAnnual Revenue: $625 million to $2.5 billion;\n•\nMarket Capitalization: $222 million to $3.6 billion; and\n•\nLocation: U.S.-based companies, with a preference for Bay Area-headquartered companies.\nOur peer group for fiscal 2022 compensation planning consisted of the following companies (two members of the peer \ngroup as noted in the table below were acquired in the second half of fiscal 2022):\nCalix, Inc.

The Compensation Committee reviewed \ndata from the Radford Global Technology survey in the aggregate and did not review data of any specific companies \ncomprising such survey. In this discussion, where we refer to “market” levels of pay and the “market data,” we are referring \nto the combined compensation peer group and survey data described above that were then in effect and applicable to our \nNEOs.\n31"

      "text": "Use of Market Data\nFor its fiscal 2022 compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee continued to maintain a holistic and flexible \napproach in its use of market data. The Compensation Committee’s goal is generally to set all elements of compensation to \nbe competitive, using a balanced approach that does not use rigid percentiles to target pay levels for each compensation \nelement, but instead makes its compensation decisions based on a variety of relevant factors, including those listed below. \nWhile the Compensation Committee continues to review and reference market data, the data generally is used to inform the \nCompensation Committee of market practices to ensure that our executive compensation program remains generally \ncompetitive with our peers. In addition to the market data, several other factors are taken into account in setting the amount \nof each NEO’s target total direct compensation opportunity. These factors include:\nThe Compensation Committee reviews existing NEO compensation and \nretention levels relative to estimated replacement cost with respect to the \nscope, responsibilities and skills required of the particular position. \nRecruitment, retention and \nhistorical factors\nCompensation data for some of our key positions are often not explicitly \nreported by companies in our compensation peer group or survey data. This \nresults in limited sample sizes and/or inconclusive data that can be \nmisleading if targeting a specific percentile for market positioning.\nLack of directly comparable data for \nsome of our key roles\nCertain elements of compensation reported from one source can be \nconsistently higher or lower than the data collected from another, given \ndifferences in methods and samples used by each source to collect market \ndata. Given this variability and volatility within the market data, the \nCompensation Committee has determined that targeting pay levels at \nspecific percentiles of this data could result in outcomes that do not align with \nthe internal value and strategic importance of various roles at Infinera. \nMarket positioning may be distorted \nby the source of the data\nAs discussed below, the Compensation Committee also considers several \nqualitative factors. \nDesire to account for other factors \nnot captured in the market data\nRelevant Qualitative Factors\nIn addition to our uses of competitive market data as described above, the Compensation Committee considers a \nrange of subjective and qualitative factors when making compensation decisions for our NEOs, including:\n•\nThe role the executive officer plays and the importance of such individual’s contributions to our ability to execute \non our business strategy and to achieve our strategic objectives;\n•\nEach executive officer’s tenure, skills and experience;\n•\nThe responsibilities and particular nature of the functions performed or managed by the executive officer;\n•\nOur CEO’s recommendations and his assessment of each executive officer’s performance (other than his own \nperformance), and with respect to the CEO’s performance, assessment and input by the Board including \nfeedback from the Chair of the Board;\n•\nThe value of unvested equity awards held by each executive officer and in comparison to other members of our \nexecutive management team and senior employees;\n•\nInternal pay equity across the executive management team;\n•\nThe impact of our compensation decisions on key financial and other measures such as our equity award “burn \nrate” and, in 2022, our utilization of cash versus equity for certain NEOs;\n•\nOur overall performance as compared to internal plans and external benchmarks;\n•\nThe potential impact on stockholder dilution of our compensation decisions relative to peers and historical \npractices; and\n•\nCompetitive labor market pressures and the likely cost, difficulty and impact on our business and strategic \nobjectives that would be encountered in recruiting a replacement for the role filled by each of our NEOs.\n32"

      "text": "The Compensation Committee does not assign relative weights or rankings to any of these factors and does not solely \nuse any quantitative formula, target percentile or multiple for establishing compensation among the executive officers or in \nrelation to the market data. Instead, the Compensation Committee relies upon its members’ knowledge and judgment in \nassessing the various qualitative and quantitative inputs it receives regarding each individual and makes compensation \ndecisions accordingly.\nFiscal 2022 Compensation\nBase Salaries\nFor fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee reviewed the base salaries in March 2022 for each of our NEOs. The \nCompensation Committee did not change our CEO’s base salary, which had been set in December 2020 in connection with \nhis promotion to CEO. After considering peer market data provided by Compensia, noting the temporary salary reductions \nimplemented in 2020 and taking into account their respective individual performance during this period, the Compensation \nCommittee approved increases to the base salaries for the other NEOs as shown in the table below. The Compensation \nCommittee did not consider these increases to be material changes to such NEOs’ base salaries.\nThe following table shows the annual base salary for each of our NEOs for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.\nName\nFiscal 2021\nAnnual Base \nSalary\n($) \nFiscal 2022\nAnnual Base \nSalary\n($) \nDavid W.

In considering the \nincreased target bonus opportunities for our NEOs (other than our CEO), the Compensation Committee considered the \ncompetitive market data provided by Compensia and its desire to provide appropriate competitive compensation to these \nNEOs in their critical leadership roles.\nThe following table shows the annual target bonus opportunities for each of our NEOs for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.\nIn response to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Compensation Committee did not establish an annual cash \nincentive program for our NEOs in fiscal 2021, cancelled such program for the second half of fiscal 2020, and granted \nretention equity awards to our NEOs other than our CEO in fiscal 2021. These retention equity awards were intended to \nprovide an award value at the time of grant approximately equivalent to 75% of the 2021 target bonus opportunity for each \nNEO granted such an award other than Mr. Walden. In the case of Mr. Walden, the retention equity award was intended to \nprovide an award value at the time of grant approximately equivalent to 18.75% of his 2021 target bonus opportunity, which \nincluded the 25% discount noted above for the other NEOs.

      "text": "2022 Bonus Plan Design. In March 2022, the Compensation Committee approved a 2022 corporate bonus plan (the \n“2022 Corporate Bonus Plan”) that was applicable to our NEOs who were then employed with us. The financial performance \nobjective underpinning the 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan, the Company’s non-GAAP operating income target, was used to \ndetermine the plan’s funding level. The Compensation Committee determined that this financial performance objective \nsupported the Company’s objectives for profitable growth. If the Company achieved the target level of non-GAAP Operating \nIncome of $82.5 million for fiscal 2022, the 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan would be funded at 100%. If the Company achieved \nthe threshold level of non-GAAP Operating Income of $66 million for fiscal 2022, the 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan would be \nfunded at 80%. Although the Compensation Committee did not set a maximum level of non-GAAP Operating Income under \nthe 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan, it retains authority to increase, reduce or eliminate any bonus award, and to increase, \nreduce or eliminate any amount allocated to the bonus pool.\nFor fiscal 2022, each of our NEOs participated in the 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan. Mr. Walden’s participation in the \n2022 Corporate Bonus Plan was limited to 25% of his total target bonus opportunity. With respect to the remaining 75% of \nhis total target bonus opportunity, Mr. Walden participated in a separate variable compensation program, as discussed below \nunder the “Walden 2022 Variable Compensation Program.”\n2022 Bonus Plan Results. In February 2023, the Compensation Committee considered the Company’s actual \nachievement level of non-GAAP Operating Income of approximately $69 million at the 84th percentile for fiscal 2022, which \nhad been certified by the Audit Committee, in combination with the Company’s non-GAAP gross margin of 37.3%, which fell \nshort of the Company’s internal non-GAAP gross margin planning target that had been set at the beginning of the fiscal year. \nBased on the Company’s performance against these financial metrics, the Compensation Committee resolved to approve \nfunding of the 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan at the 80th percentile instead of at the 84th percentile funding level achieved \nbased on the Company’s actual achievement level of non-GAAP Operating Income. The following table sets forth the \npayouts received by our NEOs in March 2023 under the 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan.\nName\nBonus \nAmount \nEarned \n($)\nNumber of \nShares \nSubject to \nRSUs Granted \n(#)(1)\nDavid W. Heard\n700,000\n―\nNancy L. Erba\n342,000\n―\nDavid L. Teichmann\n124,500\n17,300\nNicholas R. Walden\n37,800\n5,250\n_________________\n(1)\nThese RSUs were granted on March 21, 2022 pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan as further discussed below.  \nThe Compensation Committee also determined that (a) 100% of annual incentive compensation for our CEO and CFO \nunder the 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan would be payable in cash based on achievement of the target goal, and (b) annual \nincentive compensation for our other NEOs under the 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan would be payable (i) 50% in time-based \nRSUs granted under the 2016 Plan in March 2022 and vesting in two equal annual installments on April 5, 2023, and \nOctober 5, 2023, subject to the NEO’s continued service to the Company through each applicable vesting date, and (ii) 50% \nin cash based on achievement of target goals. For Mr. Walden, as discussed above, the Compensation Committee \ndetermined that a target value equal to 25% of his target bonus opportunity of 90% of base salary would be based on \nparticipation in the 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan.\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company had paid earned annual incentive compensation for its NEOs in cash. \nDuring fiscal 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Compensation Committee temporarily transitioned to \ngranting retention equity awards in the form of time-based RSUs for our NEOs, other than our CEO, in lieu of annual \nincentive cash compensation in order to conserve cash and promote retention. In light of the world beginning to normalize \nfollowing the COVID-19 pandemic, the Compensation Committee desired to begin returning to a more customary executive \ncompensation framework. The Compensation Committee decided it was appropriate that the annual incentive compensation \nfor our CEO and CFO with respect to fiscal 2022 would be fully at risk and payable in cash based on achievement of the \ntarget goal given their ability to drive the Company’s financial performance. The Compensation Committee also decided it \nwas appropriate to begin the transition of the annual incentive compensation for our other NEOs from the retention equity \nstructure used for fiscal 2021 by making their annual incentive compensation for fiscal 2022 payable (i) 50% in time-based \nRSUs and (ii) 50% in cash based on achievement of the target goal. This shift balanced the goals of transitioning the other \nNEOs to a more customary executive compensation framework, conserving cash and promoting retention of such other \nNEOs. The Compensation Committee believed that granting a component of the other NEOs’ annual incentive \ncompensation in the form of time-based RSUs would also continue to emphasize closer alignment between the interests of \nsuch NEOs and those of our stockholders.\n34"

      "text": "Walden 2022 Variable Compensation Program. In March 2022, the Compensation Committee approved a fiscal \n2022 variable compensation program for Mr. Walden (the “2022 Walden Variable Plan”). Under the 2022 Walden Variable \nPlan, 75% of Mr. Walden’s total target bonus opportunity for fiscal 2022 is tied to achievement of financial targets for \nbookings and gross profit, measured on a non-GAAP basis (the “Walden Financial Goals”). With respect to the Walden \nFinancial Goals under the 2022 Walden Variable Plan, achievement of the bookings objective is weighted at 60% and \nachievement of the gross profit objective number is weighted at 40%. The Compensation Committee believed that these \ngoals, as well as Mr. Walden’s participation in the 2022 Walden Variable Plan in addition to the 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan,  \nwould be appropriate given Mr. Walden’s critical role leading the Company’s efforts in driving revenue, and for focusing \nefforts on our profitable revenue growth by emphasizing bookings, which are closely correlated with revenue balancing, and \ngross profit, which is an important measure of the Company’s business success.\nBookings \nMinimum\nThreshold \nBookings\nTarget \nBookings \nMaximum\nGross Profit\nThreshold \nGross Profit\nTarget \nGross Profit \nMaximum\nAmount\n$1.5 billion\n$1.7 billion\n$1.9 billion\n$626.6 million\n$650.5 million\n$695.4 million\nFunding % of Target\n35%\n100%\n200%\n70%\n100%\n200%\nActual Results\n$1.75 billion\n$587.3 million\nAchievement between the minimum threshold and the target level would be determined based generally on linear \ninterpolation. The maximum payout potential with respect to each of the bookings and gross profit objectives was set at \n200%, with achievement between the target level and the maximum payout potential determined based generally on linear \ninterpolation.\nWe exceeded the bookings target with bookings of $1.75 billion (which resulted in a payout percentage of 125% with \nrespect to this part of the Walden Financial Goals), but did not achieve the gross profit threshold (which was achieved at \n$587.3 million and resulted in a payout percentage of 0% with respect to this part of the Walden Financial Goals). Based on \nsuch financial performance, Mr. Walden received a payout with respect to the Walden Financial Goals of $212,625, which is \nequal to 75% of his target bonus opportunity allocated to the 2022 Walden Variable Plan.\nFiscal 2023 Bonus Plan. In March 2023, the Compensation Committee approved a fiscal 2023 Bonus Plan (the “2023 \nCorporate Bonus Plan”), which will be payable in cash. The Compensation Committee determined that it was appropriate at \nthis time to make annual incentive compensation for each NEO at risk and payable in cash for fiscal 2023 as part of the \ntransition to a more customary executive compensation program as the world normalized following the COVID-19 pandemic. \nMr. Walden will participate in the 2023 Corporate Bonus Plan as to 25% of his target incentive opportunity and will also \nparticipate in a separate incentive compensation program as to 75% of his target value that is tied to achievement of new \nfinancial targets for bookings and standard margin, measured on a non-GAAP basis.\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation\nOur long-term incentive compensation opportunities are delivered in the form of equity awards. Under the 2016 Plan, \nthe Compensation Committee grants equity awards to eligible employees, including our NEOs. All awards to our NEOs were \nmade pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Annual equity awards for NEOs are generally approved by the Compensation Committee \nduring the first open trading window of each new calendar year. The Compensation Committee actively monitors our annual \naggregate equity utilization as measured by our burn rate.\nEquity Compensation Design. The Compensation Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company \nand our stockholders to grant a combination of time-based and performance-based equity awards to senior level employees, \nincluding our NEOs. It also believes that our performance-based equity awards foster a “pay-for-performance” culture and \nmulti-year vesting schedules create longer-term incentives that maintain alignment of the interests of our NEOs with those of \nour stockholders. Our NEOs benefit from these equity awards based on our sustained performance over time and the ability \nof our NEOs to create the results that drive stockholder value.\n35"

      "text": "In determining the appropriate mix of such equity awards, the Compensation Committee considered how each equity \nvehicle supports our compensation strategy as follows: \nType of Award\nDescription\nWhy It Is Used\nPerformance Share Award\n•\nProvides the opportunity to earn shares \nof Infinera common stock upon the \nachievement of pre-established \nperformance objectives.\n•\nIf the threshold performance level is not \nachieved, the entire portion of the award \ntied to such performance objective is \nforfeited.\n•\nSupports pay-for-performance \nphilosophy and retention efforts.\n•\nLinks compensation directly to Infinera’s \nstock performance in areas identified as \nimportant by the Compensation \nCommittee.\n•\nIncreases alignment with interests of \nstockholders.\n•\nSupports retention and succession \nplanning.\n•\nProvides a direct incentive for future \nperformance.\n•\nUseful in recruiting new executives.\nRSU Award\n•\nProvides the opportunity to earn a \nspecified number of shares of Infinera \ncommon stock subject to the \nparticipant’s continued employment for a \nspecified period.\n•\nTypically has a three-year or four-year \nvesting period to encourage a long-term \nperspective and to encourage key \nemployees to remain at Infinera.\nTarget Award Size. In determining the size of these annual equity awards, the Compensation Committee considered \nthe factors described above in the sections entitled “Use of Market Data” and “Relevant Qualitative Factors,” with particular \nattention to market data, internal equity considerations, the potential dilutive impact of the equity awards, and the amount \nand value of unvested equity awards held by each of our NEOs. For our CEO, the Compensation Committee also \nconsidered his tenure and performance in the role in determining the size of his annual equity awards. The Compensation \nCommittee believed a combination of time-based and performance-based equity awards promote close alignment of the \ninterests of our NEOs with those of our stockholders.\nFor fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee first determined the target value of long-term incentive compensation for \neach executive. The number of RSUs and performance shares granted to each executive was then determined based on an \nassumed stock price of $9.00 per share and assuming a 60% allocation of target value into performance shares for \nMr. Heard, our CEO, and a 50% allocation of target value into performance shares for our other NEOs. Due to Mr. Heard’s \nsignificant responsibilities in leading the Company and executing on our business strategy, the Compensation Committee \nbelieved it appropriate for the mix of Mr. Heard’s equity awards to be more heavily weighted toward performance shares as \ncompared to the other NEOs. The Compensation Committee determined to utilize a $9.00 per share reference price in order \nto facilitate the equity planning process, which was set after considering recent stock price history and volatility at a price per \nshare that was projected to be higher than the stock price per share at the date of grant. The actual grant date value for \nthese equity awards was below $9.00 per share, and as a result, the target value approved by the Compensation Committee \ndiffers from the value of equity reported in the Summary Compensation Table set forth on page 43 below. The following table \nsets forth the fair market value of each award granted to our NEOs in March 2022 on the basis of the $9.00 per share \nreference price used by the Compensation Committee and the actual grant date per share value.\nGrant Date\nPSUs \nGranted\n(#)\nValue Based \non $9.00 Per \nShare \nReference \nPrice\n($)\nGrant Date \nFair Value of \nPSUs\n($)(1)\nRSUs \nGranted\n(#)\nValue Based \non $9.00 Per \nShare \nReference \nPrice\n($)\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nof RSUs\n($)(1)\nDavid W.

In determining the performance criteria for the 2022 performance share awards for \nour NEOs, the Compensation Committee considered the importance of achieving profitability, growing the total addressable \nmarket for our products and growing our margins. The Compensation Committee also considered that the performance \nshare awards should be designed to work in concert with grants made in previous years that will have overlapping \nperformance cycles with the awards granted in 2022. Fiscal 2020 awards were structured to drive executive focus on \nincreasing our gross margin. Fiscal 2021 awards were structured to encourage executives to accelerate our profitable \nrevenue growth combined with non-GAAP operating income growth.\nPerformance Criteria. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee decided the fiscal 2022 performance share awards \nwould be subject to two performance goals, each covering one-half of the fiscal 2022 performance share awards (the “2022 \nPSA”). The portion of the 2022 PSAs subject to the first performance goal, referred to as the “2022 Tranche A PSA,” can be \nearned during fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2024 (the “2022 Tranche A Performance Period”) by achieving a GAAP net income \ngoal at a specified level (the “Tranche A Goal”) during the 2022 Tranche A Performance Period. Upon achievement of the \nTranche A Goal, 50% of the shares subject to the 2022 PSA will become eligible to vest. If the Tranche A Goal is not \nachieved at such specified level, then none of the shares subject to the 2022 PSA will become eligible to vest. The second \nportion of the 2022 PSAs, referred to as the “2022 Tranche B PSA,” can be earned by achieving a specified level of gross \nprofit dollars determined in accordance with GAAP generated by revenue from external sales of our pluggables and by cost \nsavings resulting from use of our pluggables in our products (the “Tranche B Goal”) during fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024 \n(the “2022 Tranche B Performance Period”). If the total amount from these gross profit dollars meets a threshold level during \nthe 2022 Tranche B Performance Period, then 12.5% of the shares subject to the 2022 PSA will become eligible to vest. If \nthe gross profit dollars meets a stretch level or greater during the 2022 Tranche B Performance Period, then 50% of the \nshares subject to the 2022 PSA will become eligible to vest. We estimate that the achievement of the Tranche A Goal and \nthe Tranche B Goal will be challenging but possible based on effective execution of and focus on our long-term business \nmodel during the respective performance periods.\nFor purposes of the 2022 PSA, net income will be determined in accordance with GAAP. Under the terms of the 2022 \nPSA, the Compensation Committee may modify the calculation of net income to reflect one or more of the following \nextraordinary items occurring during the 2022 PSA Performance Period: (a) items related to acquisitions, (b) items related to \nthe disposal of a business or segment of a business, or (c) net income (or loss on a GAAP basis) generated by any \nacquisitions.\nIn establishing the performance goals for our NEOs under the 2022 PSA, the Compensation Committee reflected that \nthe prior awards included goals targeted at specific financial objectives that ultimately tie to stockholder value, and that the \n2022 awards should as well. The Compensation Committee believes the overlapping, multiyear performance period design \nprovides our NEOs with significant incentives to achieve various objectives that are important for our long-term success.\nAchievement and Vesting. If any shares subject to the Tranche A Goal become eligible shares in fiscal 2023, then 70% \nof the eligible shares will vest upon determination of such achievement and the remaining eligible shares will be scheduled \nto vest on the last day of the 2022 Tranche A Performance Period, in each case subject to the NEO remaining a service \n37"

In the event of our change of control that would have occurred during the 2019 Profitability PSA \nPerformance Period, the unvested portion of the 2019 Profitability PSA would have vested at the target level.\n(2)\nWe achieved the Profitability Goal for the 2019 Profitability PSAs, as we had positive non-GAAP operating income for four consecutive \nfiscal quarters, from Q3 fiscal 2020 through Q2 fiscal 2021. As a result, 100% of the target number of shares of our common stock \nbecame eligible to vest during fiscal 2021. In accordance with the time-based vesting provisions of the 2019 Profitability PSA, \napproximately 89% of the eligible shares vested in October 2021, with the remainder vesting in January 2022.\n(3)\nIn fiscal 2020, the Compensation Committee granted to the NEOs in the table above a performance share award (the “2020 Gross \nMargin PSA”) that can be earned during fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022 (the “2020 PSA Performance Period”) based on our \nachievement of a stretch gross margin goal, measured on a non-GAAP basis (the “Gross Margin Goal”), either (a) for a full fiscal year \nor (b) on an average basis, for any four consecutive fiscal quarters. In the event of our change of control that occurs during the 2020 \nPSA Performance Period, the 2020 Gross Margin PSA would vest at the target level.\n(4)\nWe did not achieve the Gross Margin Goal for the 2020 Gross Margin PSAs. As a result, as of the end of fiscal 2022, the target number \nof shares subject to the 2020 Gross Margin PSAs granted to each NEO were forfeited.\n38"

      "text": "(5)\nIn fiscal 2021, the Compensation Committee granted to the NEOs in the table above a performance share award (the “2021 PSA”) that \ncan be earned during fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2023 (the “2021 PSA Performance Period”): (1) with respect to 50 percent of the 2021 \nPSA, by our achievement of a threshold non-GAAP operating income amount and a stretch revenue goal in a fiscal year within the \n2021 PSA Performance Period; and (2) with respect to 50 percent of the 2021 PSA, by our achievement of a stretch non-GAAP \noperating income goal in a fiscal year within the 2021 PSA Performance Period.\n(6)\nWe did not achieve the performance objectives for the 2021 PSA during fiscal 2022.  As a result, as of the end of fiscal 2022, the target \nnumber of shares subject to the 2021 PSA remain eligible to be earned and vest during the 2021 PSA Performance Period through the \nend of fiscal 2023.\nEmployee Benefits and Perquisites\nGenerally, our NEOs are only eligible to receive the same benefits as our U.S. salaried employees. Infinera and the \nCompensation Committee believe this approach is reasonable and consistent with the overall compensation objectives to \nattract and retain employees. These benefits include medical, dental, vision and disability benefits, a Section 401(k) plan, \nand other plans and programs, including the 2007 ESPP, made available to other eligible employees in the applicable \ncountry of residence. We provide a matching contribution of up to $2,500 under the Section 401(k) plan that is applicable to \nall eligible participants, including our NEOs. Employee benefits and perquisites are reviewed periodically to ensure that \nbenefit levels remain competitive, but are not included in the Compensation Committee’s annual determination of the total \ncompensation for each of our NEOs.\nAll exempt U.S. employees, at any U.S. work location, participate in our “As Needed” FTO Program providing flexible \ntime off. Under this program, these employees may schedule FTO as they see fit and as business necessity allows, although \nthey must continue to meet all job expectations and remain responsible for ensuring appropriate coverage for the time they \nwill be out of the office. Under this program, FTO does not accrue for these employees.\nFrom time to time, Infinera may provide other benefits based on the particular circumstances and any business needs \n(for example, in order to recruit an individual to join the Company).\nAdditional Information Regarding Our Compensation Practices\nThe estimated payments and benefits that would be received by each NEO in connection with a qualifying termination \nof employment, as described immediately below, are presented in the section entitled “Estimated Payments and Benefits \nupon Termination, Change of Control or Death/Disability” below.\nChange of Control Payments and Benefits\nThe Compensation Committee considers maintaining a stable and effective management team to be essential to \nprotecting the best interests of Infinera and its stockholders. Accordingly, Infinera has entered into Change of Control \nAgreements (the “COC Agreements”) with each of our NEOs to encourage their continued attention, dedication and \ncontinuity with respect to their roles and responsibilities without the distraction that may arise from the possibility or \noccurrence of a change of control of Infinera. The current terms of these COC Agreements are included below.\nAn NEO will receive payments and benefits under the COC Agreement only if his or her employment is terminated \nwithout “cause,” or by him or her as a result of a “constructive termination” (as more fully described in the section entitled \n“Estimated Payments and Benefits upon Termination, Change of Control or Death/Disability” below), beginning on the date \nthree months prior to the first change of control to occur following the effective date of the COC Agreement and ending on \nthe date 18 months following a change of control of Infinera. The Compensation Committee believes that this “double-\ntrigger” structure provides an appropriate balance between the corporate objectives described above and the potential \ncompensation payable to each NEO upon a change of control. The Compensation Committee also believes that should \nInfinera engage in any discussions or negotiations relating to a change of control that the Board believes is in the best \ninterests of our stockholders, these COC Agreements will help to ensure that our NEOs remain focused on the \nconsummation of such potential transaction, without significant distraction or concern regarding their personal \ncircumstances, such as continued employment.\nThe following terms apply with respect to each of the NEOs if Infinera undergoes a change of control and the NEO’s \nemployment is terminated without cause or as a result of a constructive termination during the Change of Control Period \n(that is, the period beginning three months prior to, and ending eighteen months after, a change of control), subject to such \nindividual entering into and not revoking a release of claims in our favor within 60 days of the termination date:\n•\n100% of all outstanding equity awards will vest (awards based on the achievement of performance criteria will \nvest as to 100% of the amount of the award assuming the performance criteria have been achieved at target \nlevels, unless otherwise provided in the agreement relating to such performance-based award);\n•\nOur CEO will be paid a lump sum severance payment (less applicable tax withholdings) equal to two times his \nannual base salary and our other NEOs will be paid a lump sum severance payment (less applicable tax \nwithholdings) equal to one and one-half times their annual base salary;\n39"

      "text": "•\nOur CEO will be paid a lump sum severance payment (less applicable tax withholdings) equal to two times his \nannual target incentive bonus amount and our other NEOs will be paid a lump sum severance payment (less \napplicable tax withholdings) equal to one and one-half times their annual target incentive bonus amount; and\n•\nOur CEO will be reimbursed for premiums under COBRA for a period of up to 24 months and our other NEOs will \nbe reimbursed for premiums under COBRA for a period of up to 18 months.\nEach COC Agreement will have an initial term of three years commencing on the effective date of such COC \nAgreement. On the third anniversary of the effective date, such COC Agreement will renew automatically for an additional, \none-year term unless either party provides the other party with written notice of non-renewal at least one year prior to the \ndate of automatic renewal.\nIn addition, the award agreements of certain performance share awards granted to our NEOs specify additional terms \nthat apply to such awards in the event of our change in control, as described further above in the section titled “Long-Term \nIncentive Compensation.”\nExecutive Severance Policy \nIn addition to the change of control-related payments and benefits discussed above, the Compensation Committee has \ntaken appropriate steps to provide competitive post-employment compensation arrangements that promote the continued \nattention, dedication and continuity of the members of our senior management team, including our NEOs, and enable us to \ncontinue to recruit talented senior executive officers. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee has adopted an executive \nseverance policy, under which the following severance payments and benefits will become payable if the employment of one \nof our NEOs is terminated by us without “cause” (as defined in the policy) subject to such individual entering into and not \nrevoking a release of claims in our favor:\n•\nOur CEO will be paid a lump sum severance payment equal to one and one-half times his annual base salary, \nand our other NEOs will be paid a lump sum severance payment equal to their annual base salary; and\n•\nOur CEO will be reimbursed for premiums under COBRA for a period of 18 months, and our other NEOs will be \nreimbursed for premiums under COBRA for a period of 12 months.\nIf an NEO’s employment with Infinera is less than one year, the amount of severance payable to such individual will be \nequal to the lesser of (x) the base salary paid to such individual during his or her period of employment, or (y) the severance \namount set forth above.\nAcceleration of Equity Awards upon Death or Disability\nIn addition, all awards granted under our equity incentive plans permit accelerated vesting in the event of termination \nof service due to an employee’s death or terminal illness (with exceptions in certain circumstances). Because we do not \nhave any policy with respect to severance payments or benefits in the event of an employee’s death or disability other than \ncertain disability and life insurance benefits generally available to our employees, the Compensation Committee believes \nthat in the event of an employee’s death or terminal illness, it would be appropriate to provide the accelerated vesting of his \nor her RSU awards and performance share awards at target.\nEquity Grant Policy\nUnder our Equity Grant Policy, the Compensation Committee has delegated to a subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”) \nthe authority to grant new hire, promotional and retention equity awards to non-executive employees pursuant to certain pre-\napproved guidelines. At this time, the sole member of the Subcommittee is our CEO.\nThe Subcommittee approves the award by written consent on the second Monday of each month to approve new hire, \npromotional and retention equity awards. Annual focal equity awards are approved by the Compensation Committee. The \ndelegation to the Subcommittee does not include the authority to grant equity awards to new employees who are or are \nreasonably expected to become Section 16 Officers or to current Section 16 Officers.\n40"

      "text": "Executive Clawback Policy\nWe maintain an Executive Clawback Policy that applies to our Section 16 Officers (which includes each of our NEOs) \nand directors. Pursuant to this policy, the Compensation Committee has the authority to seek:\n•\nRepayment of any cash incentive payment;\n•\nCancellation of unvested, unexercised or unreleased equity awards; and\n•\nRepayment of any compensation earned on previously exercised or released equity awards,\nwhere such payments, equity awards and/or compensation earned on previously exercised or released cash incentive \npayments and equity awards was predicated on financial results that were augmented by fraud, embezzlement, gross \nnegligence or deliberate disregard of applicable rules resulting in significant monetary loss, damage or injury to Infinera (the \n“Excess Compensation”), whether or not such activity resulted in a financial restatement. The Compensation Committee \nshall have sole discretion under this policy, consistent with any applicable statutory requirements, to seek reimbursement for \nany Excess Compensation paid or received by a Section 16 Officer or director for up to a 12-month period prior to the date \nof the Compensation Committee action to require reimbursement of the Excess Compensation. Further, following a \nrestatement of our financial statements, we will recover any compensation received by our CEO and CFO that is required to \nbe recovered by Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nFor purposes of this policy, Excess Compensation will be measured as the positive difference, if any, between the \ncompensation earned by a Section 16 Officer or director and the compensation that would have been earned by a \nSection 16 Officer or director had the fraud, embezzlement, gross negligence or deliberate disregard of applicable rules \nresulting in significant monetary loss, damage or injury to Infinera not occurred.\nWe will update our Executive Clawback Policy for compliance with final Nasdaq listing standards and will comply \nwith SEC rules and Nasdaq listing standards related to clawbacks.\nStock Ownership Policy\nThe Board believes that it is important to link the interests of our NEOs to those of our stockholders. Our Stock \nOwnership Policy requires our Section 16 Officers (which includes each of our NEOs) and directors to accumulate and hold \na minimum number of shares of Infinera common stock within three years of the later of (i) the effective date of the policy or \n(ii) the date of appointment of the director or appointment/promotion of the Section 16 Officer. As of the Record Date, each \nof our Section 16 Officers and directors has either satisfied these ownership guidelines or had time remaining to do so. Our \nstock ownership requirements for our Section 16 Officers and directors are as follows:\nCEO\n4x annual base salary\nCFO\n2x annual base salary\nOther Section 16 Officers and employee directors\n1x annual base salary\nNon-employee directors\n4x annual cash retainer for annual Board service\nShares of Infinera common stock that count towards satisfaction of this policy include: (i) shares owned outright by the \nSection 16 Officer or director or his or her immediate family members residing in the same household and (ii) shares held in \ntrust for the benefit of the Section 16 Officer or director or his or her family. The value of a share of Infinera common stock is \nmeasured on the last trading day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter as the greater of (i) the closing price on the \ndate of calculation or (ii) the purchase price actually paid by the person for such share of Infinera common stock. For the \navoidance of doubt, the purchase price for shares of Infinera common stock subject to RSU awards, performance share \nawards and other similar full value awards is zero.\nAnti-Hedging Policy\nUnder our Insider Trading Policy, we prohibit our employees, including our NEOs, and Board members from hedging \nthe risk associated with ownership of shares of Infinera common stock and other securities.\nAnti-Pledging Policy\nUnder our Insider Trading Policy, we prohibit our NEOs and directors from pledging any Infinera securities as collateral \nfor a loan.\n41"

      "text": "Tax and Accounting Treatment of Compensation\nPrior to 2018, Section 162(m) of the Code generally limited the tax deductibility of compensation paid to the CEO and \neach of the next three most highly compensated executive officers (excluding the CFO) that exceeded $1 million in any \ntaxable year unless the compensation over $1 million qualified as “performance-based” within the meaning of \nSection 162(m).\nThe ability to rely on the “performance-based” compensation exception under Section 162(m) was eliminated in 2017 \nand the $1 million limitation on deductibility generally was expanded to include any individuals serving as the CEO or CFO \nduring the tax year, the next three most highly compensated executive officers during the tax year and any other individual \nwho was considered a covered employee for any prior tax year beginning after 2016. Thus, we generally will not be able to \ntake a deduction for any compensation paid to our NEOs in excess of $1 million unless the compensation qualifies for \ntransition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place on November 2, 2017. We cannot guarantee that any \ncompensation payable to our NEOs will qualify for the transition relief or that the compensation will ultimately be deductible. \nHistorically, the Compensation Committee had not adopted a formal policy regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid \nto our CEO and other senior executive officers. Nonetheless, the Compensation Committee intends to maintain an approach \nto executive compensation that strongly links pay to performance.\nWe account for the equity compensation awarded to our executive officers and other employees under ASC 718, \nwhich requires us to estimate and record an expense for each award of equity compensation over the service period of the \naward. Accounting rules also require us to record cash compensation as an expense at the time the obligation is incurred.\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with \nmanagement.

The pay ratio included in this \ninformation is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.\nFor 2022:\n•\nOur median employee’s annual total compensation (not including our CEO) was $138,775.\n•\nOur CEO’s annual total compensation, as reported on page 43 in the Summary Compensation Table, was \n$6,260,700.\n•\nBased on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total \ncompensation of our median employee is 45 to 1.\nPay Ratio Methodology. SEC rules allow us to select a methodology for identifying our median employee in a manner \nthat is most appropriate based on our size, organizational structure and compensation plans, policies and procedures.\nWe selected December 1, 2022, as the date on which to determine our median employee, which is a date within the \nlast three months of our 2022 fiscal year. As of that date, we had 3,264 employees, with 1,250 employees based in the \nUnited States and 2,014 employees located outside of the United States. The pay ratio disclosure rules provide an \nexemption for companies to exclude non-U.S. employees from the median employee calculation if non-U.S. employees in a \nparticular jurisdiction account for five percent (5%) or less of the company's total number of employees. We applied this de \nminimis exemption when identifying the median employee by excluding 23 countries: 13 employees in Taiwan, 12 \nemployees in Netherlands, 12 employees in France, 11 employees in Japan, 10 employees in United Arab Emirates, 10 \nemployees in Spain, 9 employees in Kazakhstan, 8 employees in Saudi Arabia, 8 employees in Colombia, 7 employees in \nThailand, 7 employees in Poland, 6 employees in Indonesia, 6 employees in Vietnam, 6 employee in Republic of Korea, 5 \nemployees in Ireland, 5 employees in Egypt, 4 employees in Hungary, 4 employees in Belgium, 3 employees in Denmark, 2 \nemployees in Greece, 2 employees in Serbia, 1 employee in Norway and 1 employee in Israel.\nAfter taking into account the de minimis exemption, 1,250 employees based in the United States and 1,862 employees \nlocated outside of the United States were considered for identifying the median employee.\nFor purposes of identifying the median employee from our employee population base, we considered total cash \ncompensation (base salary, including overtime, annual bonus and the sum of other bonuses, which included retention \nbonuses), as compiled from our payroll records. We selected total cash compensation as this information is readily available \nin each country. In addition, we measured compensation for purposes of determining the median employee using the year-\nto-date period ended December 31, 2022, and annualized for employees (other than any temporary or seasonal employees) \nwho were employed on December 1, 2022, but did not work for us for all of 2022. Compensation paid in foreign currencies \nwas converted to U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect on December 1, 2022.\nThe CEO pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate, calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules, based \non the methodologies and assumptions described above. SEC rules for identifying the median employee and determining \nthe CEO pay ratio permit companies to employ a wide range of methodologies, estimates, and assumptions. As a result, the \nCEO pay ratios reported by other companies, which may have employed other permitted methodologies or assumptions, \nand which may have a significantly different workforce structure from ours, might not be comparable to our CEO pay ratio.\n48"

The \nexecutive officer will not resign as the result of a Constructive Termination without first \nproviding Infinera with written notice of the acts or omissions constituting the grounds for \n“Constructive Termination” within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of the grounds for \n“Constructive Termination” and a cure period of thirty (30) days following the date of such \nnotice.\nCause \n(i) The executive officer’s willful failure to substantially perform his or her duties and \nresponsibilities to Infinera or deliberate violation of a company policy; (ii) the executive \nofficer’s commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement, dishonesty or any other willful \nmisconduct that has caused or is reasonably expected to result in material injury to Infinera; \n(iii) unauthorized use or disclosure by the executive officer of any proprietary information or \ntrade secrets of Infinera or any other party to whom the executive officer owes an obligation \nof nondisclosure as a result of his or her relationship with Infinera; or (iv) the executive \nofficer’s willful breach of any of his or her obligations under any written agreement or \ncovenant with Infinera. The determination as to whether the executive officer is being \nterminated for Cause will be made in good faith by Infinera and will be final and binding on \nthe executive officer.\nAdditionally, we granted performance share awards in 2022 to our NEOs, as described further above in the section \ntitled “Long-Term Incentive Compensation” (referred to as the 2022 PSAs), as well as performance share awards in 2020 \n(referred to as the 2020 Gross Margin PSAs) and 2021 (referred to as the 2021 PSAs) to each of our NEOs. The \nperformance period for the 2020 Gross Margin PSAs continued through the end of fiscal 2022 and these PSAs were \nforfeited as the Gross Margin Goal was not achieved. The performance period for the 2021 PSAs continues through the end \nof fiscal 2023. The performance period for the 2022 PSAs continues through the end of fiscal 2024. These performance \nshare awards provide that, in the event of our change in control (as defined in the 2016 Plan, pursuant to which each of such \nawards were granted) that occurs during the performance period applicable to the performance share award, such award \nwill vest at the target level. Under our 2016 Plan, change in control generally means (i) a person (or more than one person \nacting as a group) acquires ownership of our shares resulting in their holding more than 50% of the total voting power of our \nshares (with certain exceptions where a person or group of persons that already holds more than 50% of the total voting \npower of our shares acquires additional shares, or where our stockholders after such transaction retain beneficial ownership \nof 50% or more of the voting power of our shares in substantially the same proportions); (ii) a change in our effective control \nthat occurs when a majority of our Board members are replaced in a 12-month period by directors whose appointment or \nelection is not endorsed by a majority of our Board members before the date of appointment or election; or (iii) a change in \n53"

This assessment covered topics including: our \ncompensation policies and practices; a review of each of the compensation vehicles that we employ; the identification of any \ncompensation design features that could encourage excessive risk taking; and the controls, policies and plan features that \nmitigate our compensation risk.\nAlthough all compensation programs were considered, particular attention was paid to incentive-based plans and \narrangements involving variable payouts, where an employee might be able to influence payout factors and compensation \nplans and arrangements involving our executive team. The review found that, because our incentive programs are based \nprimarily on financial objectives important to Infinera, we avoid an over-emphasis on shorter-term financial goals. In addition, \nthe financial objectives used to determine the performance measures for our incentive-based compensation plans and \narrangements were found to be substantially derived from our annual operating plan, which is approved by the Board.\nIn addition, the assessment considered our controls and other mitigating factors that serve to offset elements of our \ncompensation policies and practices that may introduce or encourage risk-taking. Those elements include the \nCompensation Committee’s ability to use discretion to adjust payouts on most awards; strong stock ownership requirements \nand a clawback policy for our Section 16 Officers; the existence of, and training related to, corporate standards of business \nconduct and ethics; effective internal controls over financial reporting; and the participation by Mr. Walden in his variable \ncompensation program, which enables a level of independence in establishing the sales commission plan design and quotas \nfor our global sales team.\nThis risk assessment was presented to and reviewed by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee \nagreed with the result of the review, which concluded that the risks associated with our compensation policies and practices \nwere being effectively managed. We have determined that the risks associated with our compensation policies and practices \nare not reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on Infinera.\n55"

      "text": "PROPOSAL 2—APPROVAL OF THE INFINERA CORPORATION\n2016 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED\nThe Board believes that our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees and that the \nability to grant equity awards is a necessary and powerful recruiting and retention tool for Infinera. The Board believes that \nequity awards motivate high levels of performance, more closely align the interests of employees and stockholders by giving \nemployees an opportunity to hold an ownership stake in Infinera, and provide an effective means of recognizing employee \ncontributions to the success of Infinera. At the Annual Meeting, we are requesting that stockholders approve our 2016 Plan, \nas amended, which increases the number of shares of our common stock (the “Shares”) authorized for issuance thereunder \nby 8,100,000 Shares and which also has been amended to reflect certain minor technical revisions and improvements.\nThe 2016 Plan has not been amended in any material way, other than to increase the number of shares of our \ncommon stock authorized for issuance under the 2016 Plan. The 2016 Plan, as amended, also includes certain other \nrevisions to reflect minor legal updates and other minor technical improvements, none of which constitute material changes \nto the 2016 Plan. Upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved amendments to the 2016 \nPlan on March 27, 2023, subject to the approval of our stockholders at the Annual Meeting.\nAs of March 27, 2023, there were 2,015,862 Shares available for issuance pursuant to awards that may be granted \nunder the 2016 Plan. If the proposed amendment to the 2016 Plan is not approved by our stockholders, the 2016 Plan will \nremain in effect without the amendment and awards will continue to be made under the 2016 Plan to the extent Shares \nremain available. However, in this event, we may not be able to continue our equity incentive program in the future. This \ncould preclude us from successfully attracting and/or retaining highly skilled employees. The Board and the Compensation \nCommittee believe that the additional Shares under the increased Share reserve will enable us to continue to use the 2016 \nPlan to achieve our recruiting, retention and incentive goals and will be essential to our future success.\nIf our stockholders approve the 2016 Plan amendment, we currently anticipate that the Shares will be sufficient to meet \nour expected needs through the date of our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (“2024 Annual Meeting”). In determining \nthe number of Shares to be reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan, the Compensation Committee and the Board \nconsidered the following:\n•\nHistorical Grant Practices. The Compensation Committee and the Board considered the historical amounts of \nequity awards that we granted in the past three years. In fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022, we granted equity \nawards covering 8.691 million, 8.037 million, and 9.796 million Shares, respectively, or a total of approximately \n26.525 million Shares over the three-year period.\n•\nForecasted Grants. In determining the projected Share utilization, the Compensation Committee and the Board \nconsidered a forecast that included the following factors: (i) the Shares that would be available for grant under \nthe 2016 Plan, if our stockholders approve this amendment to the 2016 Plan, is 10,115,862 Shares (consisting of \n2,015,862 Shares available for issuance under the 2016 Plan as of March 27, 2023, plus the 8,100,000 \nadditional Shares pursuant to this amendment to the 2016 Plan); and (ii) forecasted future grants, which are \n“value-based,” meaning that Share amounts granted will be determined based on a dollar value of the award to \nbe granted to the participant and the stock price of Infinera common stock. Due to our value-based grant \nprogram, any significant changes in our stock price as compared to the stock price we assumed for forecasting \npurposes could cause our actual Share usage to deviate significantly from our anticipated Share usage.\n•\nProxy Advisory Firm Guidelines. Given our significant institutional stockholder base, the Compensation \nCommittee and the Board considered proxy advisory firm guidelines.\nOutstanding Awards\nThe following table sets forth information regarding all outstanding stock options, RSUs and performance shares under \nall of our equity plans (other than our 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2007 ESPP”)) as of March 27, 2023. We do \nnot currently have any outstanding stock options under the 2016 Plan. The last sales price of our common stock as reported \non The Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 27, 2023 was $7.50 per share.\nOutstanding Options\nWeighted Average\nExercise Price\nWeighted Average\nRemaining\nContractual Term\n(in years)\nUnvested\nPerformance Shares/\nRSUs Outstanding(1)\nNumber of Shares\nAvailable for\nGrant(2)\n0\nN/A\nN/A\n19,277,445\n2,302,460\n_________________\n(1)\nThis amount includes outstanding unvested performance share awards assuming either target or maximum achievement under such \nawards. \n56"

The 2016 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board, which is comprised \nentirely of independent non-employee directors.\n•\nStockholder Approval is Required for Additional Shares. The 2016 Plan does not contain an annual “evergreen” \nprovision but instead reserves a fixed maximum number of Shares for issuance. Stockholder approval is required \nto increase that number.\n•\nShare Counting Provisions. Under the 2016 Plan, if an option or stock appreciation right expires or becomes \nunexercisable without having been exercised in full, or if Shares subject to other types of awards are forfeited to \nor repurchased by us due to failure to vest, those Shares will become available for issuance again under the \n2016 Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise or purchase price of an award will not become available for future \ngrant or sale under the 2016 Plan. Shares used to satisfy the tax withholding obligations for awards other than \noptions and stock appreciation rights will become available for future grant under the 2016 Plan. With respect to \nstock appreciation rights settled in Shares, the gross number of Shares exercised under the stock appreciation \nright award will cease to be available under the 2016 Plan. In addition, to the extent that we pay out an award in \ncash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not reduce the number of Shares available for issuance under \nthe 2016 Plan. No Shares purchased by us with proceeds received from the exercise of an option will become \navailable for issuance under the 2016 Plan.\n•\nMinimum Vesting Requirements. Any awards granted under the 2016 Plan will vest no earlier than one year from \nthe date of grant unless the vesting of such awards is accelerated due to the participant’s death, disability, or \nretirement or a termination of the participant’s service that occurs in connection with our change in control, or \nwith respect to awards that result in the issuance in the aggregate of not more than 5% of the total number of \nShares that are or have been reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan upon and after the 2016 Plan’s \neffectiveness in 2016.\n•\nLimited Vesting Acceleration Upon a Change in Control. Except (x) as permitted under the minimum vesting \nrequirements and (y) for any awards made to non-employee directors, the administrator shall not be permitted to \naccelerate the vesting of an award upon a change in control other than in the event an award is not assumed or \nsubstituted for as described in this proposal below in the section entitled “Description of the 2016 Plan—Merger \nor Change in Control.”\n•\nRepricing Prohibition. The 2016 Plan prohibits any program providing participants the opportunity to transfer \noutstanding awards to a financial institution or other person or entity selected by the administrator, exchange \nawards for awards of the same type, awards of a different type, and/or cash, or have the exercise price of awards \nrepriced (i.e., increased or reduced).\n•\nNon-Employee Director Award Limits. Under the 2016 Plan, in any fiscal year, a non-employee director may be \ngranted equity awards (with an aggregate grant date fair value) and any other compensation (including cash \nretainers or fees) of no more than an aggregate of $750,000, increased to $1,000,000 in our fiscal year of his or \nher initial service as a non-employee director. Any equity awards or other compensation provided to the director \nfor his or her services as an employee or consultant (other than as a non-employee director) will be excluded for \npurposes of these limits.\n•\nParticipant Award Limits. The 2016 Plan limits the number of Shares subject to each type of award permitted to \nbe granted under the 2016 Plan during a fiscal year to a participant, including to any of our executive officers.\n•\nNo Dividends on Options and Stock Appreciation Rights Until Shares are Issued or on Other Equity Awards \nWhile Unvested. Under the 2016 Plan, no participant will have any rights to dividends or any other stockholder \nrights with respect to any Shares subject to options or stock appreciation rights until such Shares are issued \nfollowing award exercise, and any dividends that the administrator may determine will be payable on any other \nequity awards will be subject to the same vesting criteria, forfeitability, and/or transferability restrictions as apply \nto the Shares subject to the awards on which such dividends would be paid.\nOur executive officers and directors have an interest in the approval of the 2016 Plan by our stockholders because \nthey would be eligible to receive awards under the 2016 Plan.\n57"

A copy of the 2016 Plan, as amended, is provided as Appendix B to this Proxy Statement.\nPurposes. The purposes of the 2016 Plan are to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of \nsubstantial responsibility; to provide additional incentive to employees, directors, and consultants; and to promote the \nsuccess of our business. These incentives will be provided through the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, \nrestricted stock, RSUs, performance units, and performance shares as the administrator of the 2016 Plan may determine.\nAuthorized Shares. Subject to the adjustment provisions contained in the 2016 Plan, and prior to the increase for \nwhich we are seeking approval, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to awards under the 2016 \nPlan is equal to the sum of (1) 43,650,000 Shares plus (2) Shares subject to awards granted under the Infinera Corporation \n2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”) that after May 12, 2016 expire, are forfeited or otherwise terminate without \nbeing exercised in full (to the extent they were exercisable), or are forfeited to or repurchased by us due to failure to vest \n(provided that the maximum number of Shares that may be added to the 2016 Plan with respect to awards granted under \nthe 2007 Plan pursuant to this clause (2) above is 7,700,000 Shares). No awards granted under the 2007 Plan remained \noutstanding as of March 26, 2022. Our stockholders are being asked to approve an increase of 8,100,000 Shares in the \nmaximum number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to awards under the 2016 Plan. Thus, if our stockholders approve \nthis increase, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to awards under the 2016 Plan will be increased \nto 51,750,000 Shares, plus the number of Shares described in clause (2) above.\nShares may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired Shares. If an option or stock appreciation right expires or \nbecomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full, the unexercised Shares under such award will become \navailable for issuance again under the 2016 Plan. If Shares subject to other types of awards are forfeited to or repurchased \nby us due to failure to vest, those forfeited or repurchased Shares will become available for issuance again under the 2016 \nPlan. Shares used to pay the exercise or purchase price of an award will cease to be available for future grant or sale under \nthe 2016 Plan. Shares used to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an award, except with respect to options and \nstock appreciation rights, will become available for future grant under the 2016 Plan. With respect to stock appreciation \nrights settled in Shares, the gross number of Shares exercised under the stock appreciation right award will cease to be \navailable under the 2016 Plan. In addition, to the extent that we pay out an award in cash rather than Shares, such cash \npayment will not reduce the number of Shares available for issuance under the 2016 Plan. No Shares purchased by us with \nproceeds received from the exercise of an option will become available for issuance under the 2016 Plan. Except for the \nrepurchased Shares described above in this paragraph, Shares that actually have been issued under the 2016 Plan under \nany award granted under the 2016 Plan will not be returned to the 2016 Plan and will not become available for issuance \nagain under the 2016 Plan.\nPlan Administration. The Compensation Committee (or other committee appointed by the Board) administers the 2016 \nPlan, provided that the Compensation Committee does not grant awards to non-employee directors under the 2016 Plan. \nThe Board or any committee of directors or other individuals satisfying applicable laws appointed by the Board or a duly \nauthorized committee of the Board may administer the 2016 Plan. To the extent desirable to exempt transactions under the \n2016 Plan pursuant to Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act (“Rule 16b-3”), the transactions will be structured to satisfy such \napplicable requirements for exemption under Rule 16b-3.\nSubject to the provisions of the 2016 Plan, the administrator will have the power to determine the award recipients and \nthe terms of the awards not inconsistent with the 2016 Plan, including the exercise price, the number of Shares subject to \neach such award, the exercisability of the awards, and the form of consideration, if any, payable by an option holder upon \nexercise. The administrator also will have the authority to amend existing awards, to determine fair market value of Shares, \nto construe and interpret the 2016 Plan and awards granted under the 2016 Plan, to establish rules and regulations, \nincluding sub-plans to facilitate compliance with applicable non-U.S. laws, ease the administration of the 2016 Plan or \nqualify for favorable tax treatment under, applicable laws in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., as necessary or desirable, to \ntemporarily suspend the exercisability of awards if the administrator determines such suspension to be necessary or \nappropriate for administrative purposes or comply with applicable laws, and to make all other determinations necessary or \nadvisable for administering the 2016 Plan. The administrator determines the methods by which participants may satisfy tax \nwithholding obligations of awards granted under the 2016 Plan, which may include, in whole or in part: cash, having us \nwithhold otherwise deliverable cash or shares having a fair market value equal to the minimum statutory amount required to \nbe withheld, delivering to us already owned Shares having a fair market value equal to the minimum statutory amount \nrequired to be withheld, selling a sufficient number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the participant through means that the \nadministrator may determine equal to the amount required to be withheld. The administrator’s decisions and interpretations \nwill be final and binding on all participants and any other holders of awards and will be given the maximum deference \npermitted by law.\n58"

      "text": "No Repricing. The 2016 Plan prohibits any program providing participants the opportunity to transfer outstanding \nawards to a financial institution or other person or entity selected by the administrator, exchange awards for awards of the \nsame type, awards of a different type, and/or cash, or have the exercise price of awards repriced (i.e., increased or \nreduced).\nVesting Requirements. Awards granted under the 2016 Plan are required to vest no earlier than the one-year \nanniversary of the awards’ grant date, except that (a) without regard to such limitation, vesting of awards can be accelerated \ndue to a participant’s death, disability or retirement, or service termination in connection with our change in control, and \n(b) awards that result in the issuance of up to an aggregate of 5% of the total number of Shares that are or have been \nreserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan upon and after the 2016 Plan initially became effective in 2016 may be granted \nunder the 2016 Plan, or outstanding awards granted under the 2016 Plan modified, without regard to such limitation. The \nadministrator may provide for the acceleration of an award granted under the 2016 Plan in connection with the termination of \na participant’s service upon or in connection with our change in control. Except for any awards granted to non-employee \ndirectors or as described above in this paragraph, the administrator will not be permitted to accelerate the vesting of awards \nupon our change in control other than if the awards are not assumed or substituted for in our change in control.\nEligibility. We will be able to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, performance units \nand performance shares under the 2016 Plan to our employees, consultants and non-employee directors, and employees \nand consultants of our parent or subsidiary corporations. We will be able to grant incentive stock options under the 2016 \nPlan only to individuals who, as of the time of grant, are employees of ours or of any parent or subsidiary corporation of \nours. As of March 27, 2023, we had seven non-employee directors, and 3,353 employees (including four NEOs) and 76 \nindependent consultants.\nNon-Employee Director Award Limits. The 2016 Plan provides that all non-employee directors will be eligible to receive \nall types of awards (except for incentive stock options) under the 2016 Plan. However, in any fiscal year, a non-employee \ndirector may be granted equity awards (with an aggregate grant date fair value) and any other compensation (including cash \nretainers or fees) of no more than an aggregate of $750,000, increased to $1,000,000 in our fiscal year of his or her initial \nservice as a non-employee director. Any equity awards or other compensation provided to the director for his or her services \nas an employee or consultant (other than as a non-employee director) will be excluded for purposes of these limits.\nCertain Other Limits. In any fiscal year, subject to any adjustment provisions contained in the 2016 Plan, the maximum \naggregate number of Shares covering equity awards that a participant is permitted to receive under the 2016 Plan is:\n•\nWith respect to stock options, 1,500,000 Shares, plus an additional 1,500,000 Shares in connection with his or \nher initial service as an employee;\n•\nWith respect to stock appreciation rights, 1,500,000 Shares, plus an additional 1,500,000 Shares in connection \nwith his or her initial service as an employee;\n•\nWith respect to restricted stock, 1,500,000 Shares, plus an additional 1,500,000 Shares in connection with his or \nher initial service as an employee;\n•\nWith respect to RSUs, 1,500,000 Shares, plus an additional 1,500,000 Shares in connection with his or her initial \nservice as an employee; and\n•\nWith respect to performance shares, 1,500,000 Shares, plus an additional 1,500,000 Shares in connection with \nhis or her initial service as an employee.\nThe 2016 Plan also provides that during any fiscal year, the maximum aggregate initial value (based on the fair market \nvalue of the Shares underlying the award on the award’s grant date) of performance units that a participant is permitted to \nreceive under the 2016 Plan is $7,500,000.\nDividends. Until Shares are issued under a stock option or stock appreciation right granted under the 2016 Plan, the \nholder of such awards will have no right to receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder with respect to the Shares \nsubject to the award and no adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date occurs before the \ndate the related Shares are issued under the stock option or stock appreciation right award (other than subject to the \nadjustment provisions contained in the 2016 Plan, as discussed under “Certain Adjustments” further below). The 2016 Plan \nprovides that whether payable in Shares or otherwise, any dividends or distributions payable with respect to Shares subject \nto a restricted stock award granted under the 2016 Plan will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and/or \nforfeitability as the Shares subject to such award. The Administrator also may determine, in its discretion, that such restricted \nstock awards will not be eligible to receive any dividends or other distributions during the period of restriction applicable to \nthe award. The 2016 Plan provides further that holders of any restricted stock units, performance shares and performance \nunits granted thereunder will have no right to receive dividends or other distributions as a stockholder with respect to the \nShares subject to such awards unless the Administrator determines otherwise, in which case any such dividends or \ndistributions will be subject to the same vesting criteria and forfeitability provisions as the Shares subject to such award on \nwhich they are paid. For clarity, the Shares reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan will not be reduced by dividends or \n59"

We are able to grant stock options under the 2016 Plan. Each option will be evidenced by an award \nagreement that specifies the exercise price, the number of Shares subject to the option, the maximum term of the option, \nforms of consideration for exercise, and such other terms and conditions as the administrator determines, subject to the \nterms of the 2016 Plan. The per share exercise price of options granted under the 2016 Plan must be at least equal to the \nfair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant, except in special, limited circumstances relating to \ncertain transactions, as set forth in the 2016 Plan. The maximum term of a stock option must not exceed 10 years. However, \nwith respect to any participant who owns more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of outstanding stock of ours or of \nany parent or subsidiary of ours, the maximum term of an incentive stock option granted to such participant must not exceed \nfive years and such option’s per share exercise price must equal at least 110% of the fair market value of a Share on the \ngrant date. Generally, the fair market value of a Share is the closing sales price of a Share on the relevant date as quoted on \nNasdaq. Options will be exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the administrator and as set \nforth in the applicable award agreement. The administrator will determine and specify in each award agreement, and solely \nin its discretion, the period of post-termination exercise applicable to each option. In the absence of such a determination by \nthe administrator, the participant generally will be able to exercise the vested portion of the option for three months following \nhis or her service termination for reasons other than death or disability, and for 12 months following his or her service \ntermination due to disability or death while holding the option (to the extent vested on the date of disability or death). \nHowever, in no event can an option be exercised after the expiration of the term of the option. The administrator also \ndetermines the form of consideration for exercising an option, which may consist of cash, check, promissory note (if \npermitted by applicable laws), certain other Shares, payment through a cashless exercise program established by us for the \n2016 Plan, net exercise, other consideration or method permitted by applicable laws, or any combination of the above.\nStock Appreciation Rights. We are able to grant stock appreciation rights under the 2016 Plan. Stock appreciation \nrights allow the recipient to receive the appreciation in the fair market value of the underlying Shares between the exercise \ndate and the date of grant. Each stock appreciation right will be evidenced by an award agreement that specifies the \nexercise price, the term of the stock appreciation right, and other terms and conditions as determined by the administrator, \nsubject to the terms of the 2016 Plan. The per Share exercise price of a stock appreciation right will be no less than 100% of \nthe fair market value per Share on the date of grant.\nStock appreciation rights will be exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the \nadministrator and set forth in the applicable award agreement. The maximum term of a stock appreciation right must not \nexceed 10 years. The administrator will determine and specify in each award agreement, and solely in its discretion, the \nperiod of post-termination exercise applicable to each stock appreciation right. In the absence of such a determination by the \nadministrator, the participant generally will be able to exercise the vested portion of the stock appreciation right for three \nmonths following his or her service termination for reasons other than death or disability, and for 12 months following his or \nher service termination due to disability or death while holding the stock appreciation right (to the extent vested on the date \nof disability or death). However, in no event can a stock appreciation right be exercised after the expiration of the term of the \noption. At the discretion of the administrator, the payment upon exercise of a stock appreciation right may be paid in cash, \nShares, or a combination of both.\nRestricted Stock. We are able to grant restricted stock under the 2016 Plan. Restricted stock awards are grants of \nShares that may be subject to various restrictions, which may include restrictions on transferability and forfeiture provisions. \nEach restricted stock award granted will be evidenced by an award agreement specifying the number of Shares subject to \nthe award, any period of restriction, and other terms and conditions of the award, as determined by the administrator, subject \nto the terms of the 2016 Plan.\nRestricted stock awards may (but are not required to) be subject to vesting conditions, as the administrator specifies \n(subject to the minimum vesting requirements under the 2016 Plan), and the Shares acquired may not be transferred by the \nparticipant until the vesting conditions (if any) are satisfied. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time \nat which any restrictions will lapse or be removed (subject to minimum vesting requirements under the 2016 Plan). \nRecipients of restricted stock awards generally will have full voting rights with respect to such Shares upon grant without \nregard to vesting, unless the administrator provides otherwise. Unless otherwise determined by the administrator, a \nparticipant generally will forfeit any Shares of restricted stock as to which the restrictions have not lapsed as of a date \nspecified in the award agreement (such as termination of the participant’s service).\nRestricted Stock Units. We are able to grant RSUs under the 2016 Plan. Each RSU granted is a bookkeeping entry \nrepresenting an amount equal to the fair market value of one Share. Each RSU award will be evidenced by an award \nagreement that specifies the number of RSUs subject to the award, any vesting criteria (which may include accomplishing \nspecified performance criteria or continued service to us), form of payout, and other terms and conditions of the award, as \ndetermined by the administrator, subject to the terms of the 2016 Plan. RSUs result in a payment to a participant if the \nperformance goals or other vesting criteria are achieved or the awards otherwise vest. The administrator, in its sole \ndiscretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed (subject to the minimum vesting \n60"

On a date set forth in the award agreement (such as termination of the participant’s \nservice), any unearned RSUs subject to such award agreement will be forfeited to us.\nPerformance Units and Performance Shares. We are able to grant performance units and performance shares under \nthe 2016 Plan. Performance units and performance shares are awards that will result in a payment to a participant only if \nperformance goals or other vesting criteria, if any, established by the administrator are achieved or the awards otherwise \nvest. Each award of performance units or performance shares will be evidenced by an award agreement specifying the \nperformance period and other terms and conditions of the award, as determined by the administrator, subject to the terms \nand conditions of the 2016 Plan. On or before the date of grant, the administrator will establish an initial dollar value for each \nperformance unit. Each performance share will have an initial value equal to the fair market value of a Share on the date of \ngrant. The administrator in its discretion will establish performance goals or other vesting criteria (which may include \ncontinued service), which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the value or number of \nperformance units or performance shares to be paid out. After the grant of performance units or performance shares, the \nadministrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such \nperformance units or performance shares (subject to the minimum vesting requirements). The administrator, in its sole \ndiscretion, may pay earned performance units or performance shares in the form of cash, Shares, or in some combination of \nboth. On a date set forth in the award agreement (such as termination of the participant’s service), any unearned or \nunvested performance units or performance shares subject to such award agreement will be forfeited to us.\nNon-Transferability of Awards. Unless the administrator provides otherwise, the 2016 Plan generally will not allow for \nthe transfer of awards, and only the recipient of an award may exercise an award during his or her lifetime.\nCertain Adjustments. In the event of any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other \nsecurities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, reincorporation, reclassification, \nmerger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or our other securities, or other \nchange in our corporate structure affecting Shares (other than any ordinary dividends or other ordinary distributions), then in \norder to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the \n2016 Plan, the administrator will adjust the number and class of shares that may be delivered under the 2016 Plan and/or \nthe number, class and price of shares covered by each outstanding award, and the numerical share limits set forth in the \n2016 Plan.\nMerger or Change in Control. The 2016 Plan provides that in the event of our merger with or into another corporation \nor entity or our change in control, as defined in the 2016 Plan, each outstanding award will be treated as the administrator \ndetermines (subject to the following paragraph) without a participant’s consent, in accordance with the following: (i) the \nassumption of the award or substitution of the award with an equivalent option or right by the acquirer or successor \ncorporation or its parent or subsidiary (with appropriate adjustments made to such awards), (ii) termination of the award \nupon or immediately prior to the consummation of the merger or change in control following written notice and subject to the \nnext paragraph, (iii) subject to the next paragraph, (A) termination of the award in exchange for an amount of cash and/or \nproperty in an amount that would have been attained upon exercise or realization of the award as of the date of the merger \nor change in control, or (B) replacement of the award with other rights or property, or (iv) any combination of the above. The \nadministrator will not be required to treat all awards, all awards held by a participant, all awards of the same type, or all \nportions of awards, similarly.\nIf outstanding awards (or portion of the awards) are not assumed or substituted for as provided in the 2016 Plan, then \nthe awards (or portions thereof) not assumed or substituted for will fully vest and become exercisable and all restrictions will \nlapse under such awards (or the portions thereof) not assumed or substituted for, except that with respect to awards subject \nto performance-based vesting (or portions thereof) not assumed or substituted for, performance criteria will be deemed \nachieved based on actual performance measured through the last date that the awards remain outstanding (or such earlier \ndate that the administrator may determine), with any performance period shortened proportionately and applicable \nperformance goals or other vesting criteria adjusted proportionately to reflect the adjusted performance period (or to the \nextent applicable, the value of the consideration to be received by our stockholders in connection with the merger or change \nin control). In addition, if an option or stock appreciation right (or portion thereof) is not assumed or substituted in the event \nof a merger or change in control as provided in the 2016 Plan, the administrator will notify the participant that such award (or \nits applicable portion) not assumed or substituted for will be exercisable for a specified period prior to the transaction, and \nsuch award (or its applicable portion) will terminate upon the expiration of such period.\nDissolution or Liquidation. In the event of our dissolution or liquidation, the administrator will notify each participant as \nsoon as practicable before the effective date of the proposed transaction. To the extent not previously exercised (as \napplicable), an award granted under the 2016 Plan will terminate immediately before the consummation of such proposed \ntransaction.\n61"

The administrator has the authority to amend, alter, suspend, or terminate the 2016 \nPlan at any time, provided such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant unless mutually agreed in writing. \nThe 2016 Plan will terminate automatically in 2026, unless we terminate it sooner.\nForfeiture of Awards. The 2016 Plan grants the administrator authority to specify in an award agreement that a \nparticipant’s rights, payments and benefits with respect to an award granted under the 2016 Plan will be subject to reduction, \ncancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. The 2016 Plan also provides that \nawards granted under the 2016 Plan will be subject to any Infinera clawback policy as may be established or amended from \ntime to time. The administrator may require a participant to forfeit, return or reimburse to Infinera all or a portion of an award \nand any amounts paid under the award pursuant to the terms of Infinera’s clawback policy or in order to comply with \napplicable laws. Any such recovery of compensation will not constitute an event that triggers or contributes to any participant \nresigning for good reason or constructive termination (or similar term) under any agreement with us or any of our parent, \nsubsidiaries or affiliates, unless this provision under the 2016 Plan relating to compensation recovery specifically is waived.\nNumber of Awards Granted to Employees and Directors\nOur executive officers and non-employee directors have an interest in this proposal because they are eligible to \nreceive awards under the 2016 Plan, including that non-employee directors are eligible to receive certain annual equity \nawards as described above in the section titled “Our Board of Directors—How We Are Paid.”\nAs of the date of our 2023 Annual Meeting, each individual continuing as a non-employee director after such date will \nautomatically be granted an annual equity award of RSUs under the 2016 Plan. These RSU awards will be scheduled to \nvest as to 100% of the underlying shares on the earlier of the date of our next annual meeting of stockholders or the one-\nyear anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the non-employee director’s continued service through the applicable \nvesting date. The following table sets forth the dollar value of such RSU awards expected to be granted to our non-\nemployee directors under the 2016 Plan on the date of our 2023 Annual Meeting, assuming election of the nominees for \nClass I director who are standing for election at the 2023 Annual Meeting.

Tax consequences for any particular individual may be different.\nIncentive Stock Options. A participant generally recognizes no taxable income as the result of the grant or exercise of \nan incentive stock option qualifying under Section 422 of the Code (unless the participant is subject to the alternative \nminimum tax). If the participant exercises the option and then later sells or otherwise disposes of the Shares acquired \nthrough the exercise of the option after both the two-year anniversary of the grant date and the one-year anniversary of the \nexercise date, the difference between the sale price and the exercise price will be taxed as capital gain or loss. If the \nparticipant exercises the option and then later sells or otherwise disposes of the Shares on or before the two- or one-year \nanniversaries described above (a “disqualifying disposition”), the participant generally will have ordinary income at the time \nof the sale equal to the fair market value of the Shares on the exercise date (or the sale price, if less) minus the exercise \nprice of the option.\nNonstatutory Stock Options. A participant generally recognizes no taxable income on the date of grant of a \nnonstatutory stock option with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. \nUpon the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option, the participant generally will recognize ordinary income equal to the \nexcess of the fair market value of the Shares on the exercise date over the exercise price of the option. If the participant is \nan employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Upon the sale of \nShares acquired through the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option, any subsequent gain or loss (generally based on the \ndifference between the sale price and the fair market value on the exercise date) will be treated as long-term or short-term \ncapital gain or loss, depending on how long the Shares were held by the participant.\nStock Appreciation Rights. A participant generally recognizes no taxable income on the date of grant of a stock \nappreciation right with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Upon \nexercise of the stock appreciation right, the participant generally will be required to include as ordinary income an amount \nequal to the sum of the amount of any cash received and the fair market value of any Shares received upon the exercise. If \nthe participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. \nUpon the sale of Shares acquired by an exercise of the stock appreciation right, any gain or loss (generally based on the \ndifference between the sale price and the fair market value on the exercise date) will be treated as long-term or short-term \ncapital gain or loss, depending on how long the Shares were held by the participant.\n63"

      "text": "Restricted Stock. A participant generally will not have taxable income at the time an award of restricted stock is \ngranted. Instead, the participant generally will recognize ordinary income in the first taxable year in which the participant’s \ninterest in the Shares underlying the award becomes either (i) freely transferable, or (ii) no longer subject to substantial risk \nof forfeiture. If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and \nemployment taxes. However, the recipient of a restricted stock award may elect to recognize income at the time the recipient \nreceives the award in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Shares underlying the award (less any cash paid for \nthe Shares) on the date the award is granted. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of any shares \nreceived would be capital gain or loss.\nRestricted Stock Units, Performance Units and Performance Shares. . A participant generally will not have taxable \nincome at the time an award of RSUs, performance shares, or performance units is granted. Instead, the participant \ngenerally will be required to recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of shares issued to the \nparticipant at the end of the applicable vesting period or, if later, the settlement date of the award. If the participant is an \nemployee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Any additional gain or \nloss recognized upon any later disposition of any shares received would be capital gain or loss.\nSection 409A. Section 409A of the Code (“Section 409A”) provides certain requirements for non-qualified deferred \ncompensation arrangements with respect to an individual’s deferral and distribution elections and permissible distribution \nevents. Awards granted under the 2016 Plan with a deferral feature will be subject to the requirements of Section 409A. If an \naward is subject to and fails to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, the recipient of that award may recognize ordinary \nincome on the amounts deferred under the award, to the extent vested, which may be prior to when the compensation is \nactually or constructively received. Also, if an award that is subject to Section 409A fails to comply with Section 409A’s \nprovisions, Section 409A imposes an additional 20% tax on compensation recognized as ordinary income, as well as \ninterest on such deferred compensation.\nMedicare Surtax. In addition, a participant’s annual “net investment income,” as defined in Section 1411 of the Code, \nmay be subject to a 3.8% federal surtax. Net investment income may include capital gain and/or loss arising from the \ndisposition of Shares issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2016 Plan. Whether a participant’s net investment \nincome will be subject to this surtax will depend on the participant’s level of annual income and other factors.\nTax Effect for Infinera. We generally will be entitled to a tax deduction in connection with an award under the 2016 \nPlan in an amount equal to the ordinary income realized by a participant and at the time the participant recognizes such \nincome (for example, the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option). However, special rules limit the deductibility of \ncompensation paid to our CEO and other “covered employees” as determined under Section 162(m) and applicable \nguidance. Under Section 162(m), the annual compensation paid to any of these specified individuals will be deductible only \nto the extent that it does not exceed $1,000,000. However, under Section 162(m) as it was in effect during fiscal year 2018, \nwe could preserve the deductibility of certain compensation in excess of $1,000,000 if the conditions of Section 162(m) were \nmet. These conditions included (among others) stockholder approval of the 2016 Plan and its material terms, setting certain \nlimits on the number of Shares subject to awards and, for awards other than options and stock appreciation rights, \nestablishing performance criteria that must be met before the award actually was vested or paid. As a result of the Tax Cuts \nand Jobs Act of 2017, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and except for certain grandfathered \narrangements, under Section 162(m), any compensation over $1,000,000 paid to the covered employees is not deductible to \nInfinera.\nTHE FOREGOING IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF THE TAX EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION UPON \nPARTICIPANTS AND INFINERA WITH RESPECT TO THE GRANT AND VESTING OR EXERCISE OF AWARDS UNDER \nTHE 2016 PLAN. IT DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE COMPLETE AND DOES NOT DISCUSS THE TAX CONSEQUENCES \nOF A SERVICE PROVIDER’S DEATH OR THE PROVISIONS OF THE INCOME TAX LAWS OF ANY MUNICIPALITY, \nSTATE, OR NON-U.S. COUNTRY TO WHICH THE SERVICE PROVIDER MAY BE SUBJECT.\nSummary\nThe Board believes that it is in the best interests of our company and our stockholders to continue to provide \nemployees, consultants and directors with the opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in Infinera through the grant of \nequity awards under the 2016 Plan and thereby encourage them to remain in our service and more closely align their \ninterests with those of our stockholders. \n64"

This procedure reduces duplicate mailings and saves printing costs and postage fees, as well \nas natural resources. Stockholders who participate in “householding” will continue to have access to and utilize separate \nproxy voting instructions.\nOnce you have received notice from your broker that they will be “householding” communications to your address, \n“householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer \nwish to participate in “householding” and would prefer to receive a separate set of proxy materials or if you would like an \nadditional copy of any of the proxy materials, please notify your broker or direct your written request to Infinera Corporation, \n6373 San Ignacio Avenue, San Jose, California 95119, Attention: Corporate Secretary, or call (408) 572-5200.

You may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST,” or “ABSTAIN.” If a nominee for director fails to receive the required \nnumber of votes for re-election, such director shall offer to properly tender his or her resignation (to the extent not \nalready tendered) to the Nominating and Governance Committee, which shall then make a recommendation to the \nBoard as to whether to accept or reject such director’s resignation or whether other action should be taken. \nThereafter, the Board will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee’s recommendation.

The Board \nunanimously recommends that you vote your shares “FOR” the nominees listed in Proposal 1.\nProposal 2—The approval of the 2016 Plan, as amended, which increases the number of shares authorized for \nissuance thereunder by 8,100,000 shares, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present and \nentitled to vote on this proposal.

      "text": "Stock Ownership\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA: Stockholders of Record—If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, \nInc., you are the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and the Notice has been sent directly to you.\nBeneficial Owners—If your shares are held through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, rather than directly in \ntheir own name, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares held in “street name.” The Notice has been \nforwarded to you by your broker, trustee or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, the \nstockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee \non how to vote your shares. For directions on how to vote shares beneficially held in street name, please refer to the \nvoting instruction card provided by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee. Because a beneficial owner is not the \nstockholder of record, you may not vote these shares virtually at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy \nissued in your name from the broker, bank, trustee or other nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to \nvote your shares at the Annual Meeting.\nQuorum and Voting\nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?\nA: Stockholders of record of our common stock at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to receive notice \nof and to vote their shares at the Annual Meeting. Such stockholders are entitled to cast one vote for each share of \ncommon stock held as of the Record Date. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 224,825,462 \nshares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Shares held as of the Record Date \ninclude shares that are held directly in your name as the stockholder of record and those shares held for you as a \nbeneficial owner through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee.\nQ:\nHow many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at the Annual Meeting?\nA: The presence virtually of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the Annual \nMeeting is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Such stockholders are counted as present at the \nmeeting if they (i) are present virtually at the Annual Meeting or (ii) have properly submitted a proxy.\nUnder the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended, abstentions and broker non-votes are \ncounted as present and entitled to vote and are included for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at \nthe Annual Meeting.\nQ:\nWhat is a broker non-vote and how are they counted at the Annual Meeting?\nA: A broker non-vote occurs when the broker holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a non-routine \nproposal because the broker does not have discretionary voting power with respect to such proposal. Broker non-\nvotes will be counted towards the presence of a quorum, but will not be counted towards the vote total for any \nproposal.\nQ:\nWhich proposals are considered “routine” or “non-routine?”\nA: The election of directors (Proposal 1), the amendment of the 2016 Plan (Proposal 2), the non-binding advisory vote \non Infinera’s NEO compensation (Proposal 3) and the non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of stockholder \nvotes on Infinera’s NEO compensation (Proposal 4) are “non-routine” matters for which discretionary voting power \ndoes not exist under applicable rules. A broker, bank, trustee or other nominee cannot vote without instructions on \nnon-routine matters, and therefore, broker non-votes may exist in connection with Proposals 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, if \nyou hold your shares beneficially in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee \nhow to vote with respect to Proposals 1, 2, 3 and 4, no votes will be cast on your behalf.\nThe ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 5) is considered \na “routine” matter for which discretionary voting power exists under applicable rules. A broker, bank, trustee or other \nnominee may generally vote on routine matters without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares being \nvoted, and therefore no broker non-votes are expected to exist in connection with Proposal 5.\nQ:\nHow can I vote my shares virtually at the Annual Meeting?\nA: Stockholders of Record—Shares held in your name as the stockholder of record may be voted virtually at the Annual \nMeeting, even if previously voted by another method. You will need the 16-digit control number on your proxy card or \nvoting instructions to vote at the Annual Meeting.\n77"

If you are a beneficial \nowner of shares and your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee does not receive instructions from you about how \nyour shares are to be voted, the shares represented by that proxy will not be voted with respect to Proposals 1, 2, 3 \nor 4 and will be counted as broker non-votes with respect to these proposals. With respect to Proposal 5, your broker, \nbank, trustee or other nominee will have the discretion to vote your shares.\nQ:\nCan I change or revoke my vote?\nA: Subject to any rules your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee may have, you may change your proxy instructions \nat any time before your proxy is voted at the Annual Meeting.\nStockholders of Record—If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote by (1) filing with our Corporate \nSecretary, prior to your shares being voted at the Annual Meeting, a written notice of revocation or a duly executed \nproxy card, in either case dated later than the prior proxy relating to the same shares, or (2) virtually attending the \nAnnual Meeting and voting (although virtual attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy). Any \nwritten notice of revocation or subsequent proxy card must be received by our Corporate Secretary prior to the taking \nof the vote at the Annual Meeting. Such written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy card should be hand \ndelivered to our Corporate Secretary or should be sent to our principal executive offices, Attn: Corporate Secretary. A \nstockholder of record who has voted via the Internet or by telephone may also change his or her vote by making a \ntimely and valid Internet or telephone vote at a later time but prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on the day prior to the \nAnnual Meeting.\nBeneficial Owners—If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you may change your vote by \n(1) submitting new voting instructions by any of the applicable voting methods allowed through your broker, trustee or \nother nominee, or (2) virtually attending the Annual Meeting and voting if you have obtained a proxy voting form from \nthe broker, trustee or other nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares.\nQ:\nWho will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting?\nA: We will bear all expenses of soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting.

Except (x) as permitted under \nSection 5(c)(i) and (y) for any Awards made to Outside Directors, the Administrator shall not be permitted to accelerate the \nvesting of an Award upon a Change in Control other than in the event an Award is not assumed or substituted for as \nprovided for in Section 14(c). For purposes of clarification, the Administrator will be permitted to provide for the acceleration \nof an Award in connection with a termination of service upon or in connection with a Change in Control.\n(d)\nIncentive Stock Options.\n(i)\n$100,000 Limitation. Notwithstanding any designation of an Option as an Incentive Stock Option, \nto the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are \nexercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or \nSubsidiary) exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), the portion of the Options falling within such limit will be \nIncentive Stock Options and the excess Options will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For these purposes, \nIncentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The fair market value of the \nShares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted, and calculation will be performed \nin accordance with Code Section 422.\n(ii)\nMaximum Option Term. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term of an Option will be ten \n(10) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided by the Administrator and set forth in the Award \nAgreement. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock \nOption is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of \nstock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five (5) years from the date \nof grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.\n(iii) Option Exercise Price. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who, at \nthe time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of \nall classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price will be no less than one \nhundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. With respect to an Incentive Stock \nOption granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in the immediately preceding sentence, the per Share \nexercise price will be no less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection (iii), Incentive Stock Options may be granted with a per Share \nexercise price of less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to \na transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, Section 424(a) of the Code.\n(e)\nNo Exchange Program or Repricing. The Administrator may not implement an Exchange Program.\n(f)\nDividends. With respect to any Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, until the Shares are issued (as \nevidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) \nthereunder, no right to receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Shares subject to \nsuch Award, including without limitation notwithstanding any exercise of such Award. Further, no adjustment will be made for \na dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued under an Option or Stock \nAppreciation Right, except as provided in Section 14 of the Plan. During any applicable Period of Restriction, Service \nProviders holding Shares of Restricted Stock will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect \nto such Shares, unless the Administrator provides otherwise; provided, however, that any such dividends or distributions \npayable with respect to such Shares will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and/or forfeitability as the \nShares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid. With respect to Awards of Restricted Stock Units, \nPerformance Units and Performance Shares, until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the \nbooks of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to receive dividends or any other rights \nas a stockholder will exist with respect to the Shares subject to such Award, unless determined otherwise by the \nAdministrator; provided, however, that any such dividends or distributions that the Administrator determines will be payable \nwith respect to such Shares will be subject to the same vesting criteria and forfeitability provisions as the Shares subject to \nsuch Award with respect to which they were paid. For the avoidance of doubt, the number of Shares available for issuance \nunder the Plan will not be reduced to reflect any dividends or other distributions that are reinvested into additional Shares or \ncredited as additional Shares subject to or paid with respect to an Award.\n6. Eligibility. Nonstatutory Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, \nPerformance Shares and Performance Units may be granted to Service Providers. Incentive Stock Options may be granted \nonly to Employees.\n7. Stock Options.\n(a)\nGrant of Options. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, an Option may be granted to Service \nProviders at any time and from time to time as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion.

The per share exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to exercise of \nan Option will be determined by the Administrator, but shall in no event be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair \nMarket Value per Share on the date of grant, subject to Section 5.

At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator will fix the \nperiod within which the Option may be exercised and will determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the Option \nmay be exercised.\n(iii) Form of Consideration. The Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration for \nexercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator will \ndetermine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Such consideration may consist entirely of: (1) cash; \n(2) check; (3) promissory note, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, (4) other Shares, provided that such Shares have \na Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which such Option \nwill be exercised and provided that accepting such Shares will not result in any adverse accounting consequences to the \nCompany, as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion; (5) consideration received by the Company under a broker-\nassisted (or other) cashless exercise program (whether through a broker or otherwise) implemented by the Company in \nconnection with the Plan; (6) by net exercise; (7) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of \nShares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws; or (8) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.\n(e)\nExercise of Option.\n(i)\nProcedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder. Any Option granted hereunder will be \nexercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the \nAdministrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.\nAn Option will be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) a notice of exercise (in such \nform as the Administrator may specify from time to time) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment \nfor the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised (together with applicable withholding taxes). Full payment may \nconsist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement \nand the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the \nParticipant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such \nShares promptly after the Option is exercised.\nExercising an Option in any manner will decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for \npurposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.\n(ii)\nTermination of Relationship as a Service Provider. If a Participant ceases to be a Service \nProvider, other than as the result of the Participant’s death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within \nsuch period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination \nof Participant’s status as a Service Provider (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth \nin the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for \nthree (3) months following the termination of Participant’s status as a Service Provider, but in no event later than the \nexpiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if \non the date of termination of Participant’s status as a Service Provider, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire \nOption, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan.

Our comprehensive \nportfolio of networking solutions also enables our customers to scale their transport networks as end-user \nservices and applications continue to drive growth in demand for network bandwidth. These end-user services \nand applications include, but are not limited to, high-speed internet access, 4G/5G mobile broadband, cloud-\nbased services, high-definition video streaming services, virtual and augmented reality, the Internet of Things \n(“IoT”), business Ethernet services and data center interconnect (\"DCI\").\nAs an optical semiconductor manufacturer, we specialize in the manufacturing of optical compound \nsemiconductors using indium phosphide (\"InP\"). This technology is used in telecommunications networks to \ntransmit massive amounts of data and power critical communications services like 5G, enhanced broadband, \nand high-capacity data center connectivity. Infinera has made significant investments in our unique research, \ndevelopment, fabrication, and packaging facilities, including our optical compound semiconductor fab in Silicon \nValley. We optimize the manufacturing process by using InP to build our PICs, which enables the integration of \nhundreds of optical functions onto a single, monolithic optical semiconductor chip. The unique capabilities of our \noptical semiconductor fab, which has provided our customers with a critical and secure source of U.S.-produced \noptical semiconductors and strengthened the supply chain, have enabled us to consistently pioneer critical \ntechnology advancements. For example, our latest generation of technology has made it possible to transmit \ninformation at a rate of 800 gigabits per second (“Gb/s”) using a single laser. \nWe support U.S. government efforts to advance and increase the domestic manufacturing base for \nsemiconductors as a matter of economic and national security. Compound semiconductors – including those \nbased in InP – are an important part of the domestic semiconductor industry and will enable the next-generation \nof leading-edge technologies. Domestic manufacturing is critical in order to reduce our reliance on foreign \nsources of compound semiconductor materials and components, which is essential to economic growth and to \nthe security of our domestic communications infrastructure.\nThe large-scale integration of our PICs and advanced digital signal processors (“DSPs”) enables us to \ndevelop and manufacture high-performance optical engines that are used in our coherent optical networking \nsystem and subsystem solutions. These solutions include features that customers care about the most, including \nreduced cost per bit, lower footprint and power consumption, and improved performance, reliability and security. \nCoherent optical solutions are becoming increasingly important across the network as our customers transition to \n800 Gb/s per wavelength transmission speeds and beyond in the core, 400 Gb/s in the metro, and 100 Gb/s in \nthe access market segment. We believe our vertical integration strategy provides a competitive advantage by \nenabling leading optical performance at higher optical speeds with increased spectral efficiency, greater control \nover our supply chain, and a lower cost structure.\nWe have grown our solutions portfolio through internal development as well as acquisitions, including \nthe acquisition of Telecom Holding Parent LLC (“Coriant”), a privately held global supplier of open network \nsolutions for the largest global network operators (the “Acquisition”). These developments positioned us to be \none of the leading providers of vertically integrated optical networking solutions in the world with the ability to \nserve a global customer base with accelerated delivery of the innovative solutions our customers demand. In \n2021, we announced an expansion of our portfolio with the introduction of a suite of coherent optical pluggables \n1"

      "text": "designed to seamlessly address the rapidly growing market for point-to-point solutions as well as create a new \ncategory of point-to-multipoint solutions that can enable a dramatically more cost-efficient network architecture. \nBased on our vertically integrated optical semiconductor technology and supporting a range of high-speed \ntransport rates that include 800 Gb/s, 400 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s, this suite of coherent optical pluggables builds on \nour history of delivering innovative, highly differentiated, and vertically integrated coherent optical engines.\nOur products are designed to be managed by a suite of software solutions that enable simplified \nnetwork management and automated operations. We also provide software-enabled programmability that offers \ndifferentiated capabilities such as Instant Bandwidth. Combined with our differentiated hardware solutions, \nInstant Bandwidth enables our customers to purchase and activate bandwidth as needed through our unique \nsoftware licensing feature set. This, in turn, allows our customers to accomplish two key objectives: (1) limit their \ninitial network startup costs and investments; and (2) instantly activate new bandwidth as their customers’ and \ntheir own network capacity needs evolve.\nWe believe our systems and subsystems portfolios benefit our customers by providing a unique \ncombination of highly scalable capacity and features that address access to core transport network applications \nand ultimately simplify and automate network operations. Our high-performance optical transport solutions \nleverage the industry shift to open optical network architectures and enable our customers to efficiently and cost-\neffectively meet bandwidth demand, which continues to grow 30% or more year-over-year.\nWe were incorporated in December 2000 and originally operated under the name “Zepton Networks.” \nWe are incorporated in the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 6373 San Ignacio \nAvenue, San Jose, CA 95119. Our telephone number is (408) 572-5200. “Infinera,” “FlexCoherent,” and the \nInfinera logo, are trademarks or service marks of Infinera Corporation in the United States, certain other \ncountries and/or the European Union. Any other trademarks or trade names mentioned are the property of their \nrespective owners.\nIndustry Background\nOptical transport networking equipment carries digital information using light waves over fiber optic \ncables. With the advent of dense wavelength division multiplexing (“DWDM”) systems, data is transmitted by \nusing multiple wavelengths of light using different frequencies or colors over a single optical fiber. Customers \ndeploy DWDM systems to carry information between continents, across countries, between cities and within \nmetropolitan areas, and in some cases all the way to the end-user. Fiber optic networks are generally capable of \ncarrying most types of communications traffic. Coherent optical technology is the latest innovation in DWDM \ntransmission solutions, dramatically increasing the amount of information a single laser can transmit.\nWe believe that a number of trends in the communications industry are driving demand for large \namounts of network bandwidth and ultimately will increase demand for advanced optical transport networking \nsolutions. These trends include:\n•\ngrowth of cloud services; \n•\ngrowth of over-the-top services and high-definition video streaming;\n•\ngrowth of mobile broadband services, including 4G and emerging 5G services;\n•\ngrowth of edge computing resources closer to end-users;\n•\nincreasing use of connected virtual and augmented reality devices; and\n•\nthe IoT, which continues to drive massive growth in the number of network-connected devices.\nAs network traffic grows, network operators will need to continue to add transmission capacity to \nexisting optical networks or deploy new systems and/or subsystems to address bandwidth demand and offer new \nend-user services. \nWe believe we are in the midst of an important shift in transport network architectures that impact the \nmarkets we serve. The shift to open and disaggregated networks is increasingly being embraced by the \ncommunications industry. Examples of this trend include separation of compute, storage, and networking in data \ncenters, the separation of hardware, operating system and applications in smart phones, hardware/software \nseparation in network function virtualization and hardware and software routing stack routers, and open radio \naccess network initiatives for 5G. Industry evolution is now enabling optical networking to leverage these same \nprinciples of openness and disaggregation. \n2"

These technologies allow network operators to move from a traditional vendor locked-in model to a more \nflexible model where they can choose from a collection of modular, best-of-breed solutions from different \nsuppliers for each network function. Open and standards-based interfaces ease the integration into a unified \nnetwork architecture. \nThe shift to open optical networking provides network operators with key benefits that include:\n•\nAccelerated innovation cycles: By leveraging the full innovation capabilities of the optical \necosystem, network operators are able to select best-in-class technologies and vendors \nindependently throughout the network lifecycle. Solution providers can also develop innovative \ntechnologies for specific network functions without having to supply end-to-end networking \nsolutions, significantly broadening the innovation ecosystem. \n•\nOptimized network architectures: By selecting the ideal products and technologies for each layer \nand domain of the network independently, network operators are able to optimize their optical \nnetwork for specific applications and services and avoid the constraints of a single-vendor for one-\nsize-fits-all solutions.\n•\nImproved network economics: Open optical networks enable cost-per-bit reducing innovations to be \nquickly deployed throughout the network lifecycle, with customized multi-vendor network designs \nproviding additional scope for cost-optimization as capacity and service demands evolve.\nA second shift is happening at the edge of the network, where capacity is growing beyond the ability of \ntraditional, non-coherent optical solutions to address.

We utilize a mix of internal resources and \nsupplement our staffing with development personnel provided by third parties on a contract basis. We have \ninvested significant time and financial resources into the enhancement of existing products and the development \nof new products. We will continue to expand our product offerings and the capabilities of existing products in the \nfuture and plan to dedicate significant resources to these continued research and development efforts. We are \ncontinually increasing the scalability and software features of our current platforms. We are investing in \nleveraging our vertical integration capabilities across a broader portion of our platforms. We are also working to \ndevelop new generations of optical engines at a faster cadence than we have historically in order to bring new \nproducts to market more rapidly and meet evolving customer demands. We believe these efforts will enhance our \n9"

Employee health and safety are also cornerstones \nof our human capital management. Our goal is to continuously improve employee engagement as we strive to \nbuild and maintain a culture of human connection, individual responsibility and mutual integrity. As of \nDecember 31, 2022, we had 3,267 employees, with 2,018 of those employees located outside of the United \nStates. None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Employees in certain \nforeign jurisdictions are represented by local workers’ councils or collective bargaining agreements, as required \nby local laws or customs. We have not experienced any work stoppages to date. We consider the relationships \nwith our employees to be positive.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nAt Infinera, we strive to create an inclusive culture, as reflected in the way we treat each other, the way \nwe respect our differences across our global workforce, and how we conduct business with our customers and \npartners around the world. We believe that our culture of inclusion and belonging enables us to leverage the \nstrengths of our people to exceed customer expectations and growth objectives. Our global diversity, equity, and \ninclusion (“DEI”) engagement committee drives our key DEI initiatives, which include training and development, \nemployee resource groups (“ERGs”), and recruiting and retention strategies. \nIn 2020, we launched Infinera ALL-In, an employee-led, executive-sponsored, company-wide effort to \npromote, facilitate and support sustainable DEI efforts. ALL-In is sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer \n(\"CEO\"), Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), and Chief Human Resources Officer (\"CHRO\"), and led by other \nexecutives and employee leaders from each region in which we have employees and do business. ALL-In has \ncontributed to our inclusive culture, raised awareness and fostered meaningful dialogue, and helped guide the \noverall development of our DEI initiatives. \nIn 2021, we expanded our DEI global team with the addition of local DEI representatives at our major \nsites who are helping to develop, support, and scale our DEI initiatives and employee engagement activities at \nthe local level. In 2022, we invested in fostering a more inclusive work environment. In the U.S., we have \ncommenced partnerships with non-profits and historically black colleges and universities to increase our pipeline \nof diverse talent. In our larger sites globally, we provide training on inclusive hiring and are posting roles on \nplatforms and job boards targeted at diverse talent pools enabling greater access to diverse talent.\nEmployee engagement is critical to building a unified and global culture that values local needs and \nperspectives. To foster inclusion and promote these efforts, we support several ERGs, including African Descent/\nBlack at Infinera, Latin America, and Women at Infinera (\"WIN\").\nWIN works to provide our female employees with access to conferences, networking events and other \nprominent engagements in the technology industry, as well as to support greater opportunities for career growth, \ninternships, and leadership. In 2022, we continued to expand WIN activities and participation, including the \nintroduction of our mentoring program, the formation of subcommittees, and a speakers’ program addressing \ntopics including development, recruitment and retention of women. In various locations, employees have also \npartnered with local nonprofits and schools to encourage female students to pursue STEM careers.\nIn 2022, we continued to provide DEI training for our global employee base. Training topics are focused \non global diversity, employees' roles in workplace diversity and related matters. Recruiters and managers \nparticipate in training on topics such as ensuring a diverse applicant pool and overcoming unconscious bias in \nthe workplace and in interviews. \nIn addition, we launched a global employee survey in 2022 which included questions on DEI matters. \nThe positive results and constructive feedback from this survey will enable us to accelerate program \ndevelopment to advance DEI progress at Infinera. \nAs of December 31, 2022, women represented 19% of our global employees and minorities represented \napproximately 37% of our U.S. workforce.\n10"

      "text": "Compensation, Benefits and Well-being\nOur goal is to incentivize our talented employees with a total compensation package that is market-\ncompetitive as validated through independent data sources. Our total compensation for eligible employees \nincludes base salary, bonuses and equity awards. We intend to maintain ongoing competitiveness for attracting \nand retaining talent. We continuously improve our human resources information systems for workforce data \ncollection, monitoring, and reporting, and expect that this will allow us to improve our understanding of \ncompensation equity around the globe to ensure fair pay. We also seek to provide market-competitive benefits as \npart of our total reward structure for all employees around the globe and their dependents. In 2022, we \nconducted a global gender-based pay equity assessment and a race-based pay equity assessment in the U.S. to \nsupport consistency and equity in our pay practices.\nWe have also invested in creating physically safe work environments for our essential on-site workforce, \nwhich is important given our status as a critical infrastructure business with manufacturing facilities in the U.S. \nand research and development sites in several countries. To advance these efforts, we have a global leadership \nteam comprised of local site leaders that meets regularly to support compliance with all local and international \nguidelines and establishes best practices at every site. We are committed to providing employees with a healthy \nand safe work environment by striving to prevent accidents and improve workplace conditions, and continuously \nworking to improve our processes and performance. Our health and safety programs emphasize personal \naccountability, professional conduct, and regulatory compliance, while our culture fosters a sense of proactivity, \ncaution, empathy and communication.\nIn the U.S., we have also continued to support COVID-19 testing for essential on-site employees at no \ncost to employees. We also provide paid leave to employees who contract COVID-19, which in many cases is \nbeyond what is required by local laws. \nWe have also continued to emphasize employee well-being. For example, in the U.S., the Employee \nAssistance Program benefit includes mental health counseling for help with personal issues, childcare and \neldercare referrals, financial coaching, legal consultation and wellness tools. Employees are provided medical, \ndental, vision, long-term and short-term disability, and life insurance, and employees covered under our health \ninsurance have access to various wellness programs. Employees are provided paid parental leave as new \nparents (birth or adoption). Eligible employees are also qualified to receive unlimited flexible time off. We also \nprovide training on matters such as working effectively with teams in a remote environment and making meetings \nmore effective.\nGrowth and Development\nWe believe that transparency and integrity help foster a culture of professional growth. We continuously \nevolve our approach to employee communication, from a company-wide perspective to functional communication \nto smaller team meetings, all the way to one-on-one discussions. With that in mind, we encourage our \nemployees to share candid feedback about working for our company through feedback channels, including \nemployee surveys and on public forums such as Glassdoor.com. Our management utilizes this feedback as we \nwork to consistently improve our employee experience.\nWe have also expanded our WIN mentorship program to become a global mentorship program to \nempower all employees within Infinera to advance their careers and realize their full potential. By facilitating \nmentor-mentee relationships, this program provides a unique opportunity for reflection, self-examination, and the \ndevelopment of practical skills for mentees while simultaneously providing mentors with fresh perspectives, \ninsights, opinions and an opportunity to have a direct hand in the development of future leaders.\nExperiential learning is powerful in career development, which is why we provide global job-based \nlearning opportunities including cross-functional transfers and expanded roles. Education also enables the \nadvancement of our DEI initiatives, which is one of our core values and a continued area of focus for us. In 2022, \nwe also significantly expanded our learning and development initiatives, including the rollout of a scalable, multi-\nlanguage e-learning platform that enables the proliferation of global, diverse and professional education.\n11"

This includes significant investments in personnel, equipment and the \nfacilities needed to manufacture and package our products in California and Pennsylvania. We also have \ninvested in automating our manufacturing process and in training and maintaining the quality of our \nmanufacturing workforce. As a leader in the development of photonic integration, our manufacturing processes \nhave been developed over many years and are protected through a combination of patents, trade secrets and \ncontractual protections. We believe that the investments we have made towards the manufacturing and \npackaging of our products provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We also believe that our current \nmanufacturing facilities, including our fabrication facility for our PICs in California and our module manufacturing \nfacility in Pennsylvania, can accommodate an increase in production capacity as our business continues to grow.\nWe also use contract manufacturers to assemble portions of our products. Each contract manufacturer \nprocures components necessary to assemble products according to our specifications and bills of material. For \nelements of our business where we outsource, we perform rigorous in-house quality control testing to ensure the \nreliability of our products. Our supply chain risk mitigation strategies are continuous and institutionalized in our \nsupply chain design for external manufacturing and for procurement of components. We currently use three \ncontract manufacturers in several different countries, including Thailand, Malaysia, China, Mexico and Hungary, \nand we maintain the capability to transfer select manufacturing activities to U.S. qualified factories of three \nelectronic manufacturing services partners.\nWe expect all suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which addresses the rights of \nworkers to safe and healthy working conditions, environmental responsibility, and compliance with applicable \nlaws.\nBacklog\nOur backlog represents purchase orders received from customers for future product shipments and \nservices to be provided in future periods. Our backlog is subject to future events that could cause the amount or \ntiming of the related revenue to change, and, in certain cases, purchase orders may be canceled without penalty. \nOrders in backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following order receipt and may relate to multi-year support \nservice obligations. As a result, we believe that backlog should not be viewed as an accurate indicator of future \noperating results for any particular period. A backlogged purchase order may not result in revenue in a particular \nperiod, and the actual revenue may not be equal to our backlog amounts. Our presentation of backlog may not \nbe comparable with that of other companies in our industry.\nIntellectual Property\nOur innovative software and optical engine technologies, including our PIC, DSP, module and related \ntechnologies, are foundational to our products and we believe they are highly valued by our customers and \nprovide us with a competitive advantage. \nWe believe our success depends upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual \nproperty. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade \nsecrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections. However, there can be no \nassurances that these protections will be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage or that others have \nnot or will not reverse engineer our designs or discover, develop or disclose the same or similar designs and \nmanufacturing processes.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we held 1,054 U.S. patents and 497 international patents expiring between \n2023 and 2042, and held 177 U.S. and 116 foreign pending patent applications. We do not know whether any of \nour pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will \nrequire us to narrow our claims.\nWe may not receive any competitive advantages from the rights granted under our patents and other \nintellectual property. Any patents granted to us may be contested, circumvented or invalidated over the course of \nour business, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing these patents. Therefore, the impact \nof these patents cannot be predicted with certainty.\nWe believe that the frequency of assertions of patent infringement is increasing as patent holders, \nincluding entities that are not in our industry and who purchase patents as an investment or to monetize such \nrights by obtaining royalties, use such actions as a competitive tactic as well as a source of additional revenue. \n12"

      "text": "For example, we are currently involved in litigation for alleged patent infringement. See the information set forth \nunder the heading “Legal Matters” in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, in Part II, Item 8 for additional \ninformation regarding such litigation. Any claim of infringement from a third party, even those without merit, could \ncause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claims, and could distract our management from \nrunning our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that \nrequires us to pay substantial damages or could include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us \nfrom offering our products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual \nproperty, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be \nrequired to develop non-infringing technology, which would require significant effort and expense and may \nultimately not be successful.\nIn addition to trade secret and patent protections, we generally control access to and the use of our \nproprietary software and other confidential information. This protection is accomplished through a combination of \ninternal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and \npartners, and through a combination of U.S. and international copyright laws.\nWe license some of our software pursuant to agreements that impose restrictions on our customers’ \nability to use such software, such as prohibiting reverse engineering and limiting the use of copies. We also seek \nto avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by relying on non-disclosure and assignment of intellectual \nproperty agreements with our employees and consultants that acknowledge our exclusive ownership of all \nintellectual property developed by the individual within the scope of and during the course of his or her work with \nus. The agreements also require that each person maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary information \ndisclosed to them. Other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us, and we may not be \nable to enforce our rights adequately against these parties. We also rely on contractual rights to establish and \nprotect our proprietary rights in our products.\nWe incorporate free and open source licensed software into our products. Although we monitor our use \nof such open source software closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. \ncourts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated \nconditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In addition, non-compliance with open \nsource software license terms and conditions could subject us to potential liability, including intellectual property \ninfringement and/or contractual claims. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in \norder to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in \nthe event re-engineering cannot be accomplished in a timely manner, any of which could adversely affect our \nbusiness, operating results and financial condition.\nGovernmental Regulations\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations. We are committed to maintaining compliance with all \nenvironmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, products and services. Our business and \noperations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that have been adopted \nwith respect to the environment, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (\"WEEE\"), \nDirective on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment \n(\"RoHS\"), and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (\"REACH\") regulations \nadopted by the European Union. Environmental regulation is increasing and we expect that our operations will be \nsubject to additional environmental compliance requirements, which may expose us to additional costs. We are \nalso subject to disclosure requirements related to the presence of “conflict minerals” in our products. To date, our \ncompliance costs relating to environmental regulations have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, results of operations or financial condition.\nOther Laws and Regulations. We are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations across the \njurisdictions in which we operate. In addition to the environmental laws and regulations discussed above, we are \nsubject to laws and regulations addressing the telecommunications industry, cybersecurity, privacy and data \nprotection, export and import control, trade sanctions, and anti-bribery and anti-corruption. To date, our \ncompliance costs relating to these laws and regulations have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, operating results or financial condition. \nFor further discussion of risks associated with these governmental laws and regulations, see Part I, Item \n1A, “Risk Factors – Legal and Regulatory Risk Factors.”\n13"

      "text": "Business and Operational Risk Factors\nOur quarterly results may vary significantly from period to period, which could make our future results \ndifficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investor, analyst or our \nexpectations.\nOur quarterly results and, in particular, our revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, operating \nmargins and net income (loss), have historically varied significantly from period to period and may continue to do \nso in the future. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. \nOur budgeted expense levels are based, in large part, on our expectations of future revenue and the \ndevelopment efforts associated with that future revenue. Consequently, if our revenue does not meet projected \nlevels in the short term, our inventory levels, cost of goods sold and operating expenses would be high relative to \nrevenue, resulting in potential operating losses. If our revenue or operating results do not meet the expectations \nof investors or securities analysts or fall below any guidance we provide to the market, the price of our common \nstock may decline substantially.\nFactors that may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly results, many of which are outside our control \nand may be difficult to predict, include:\n•\nfluctuations in demand, sales cycles and prices for products and services, including discounts given \nin response to competitive pricing pressures or to secure long-term customer relationships, as well \nas the timing of purchases by our key customers;\n•\nthe price, quality, timing of delivery and availability of key components from suppliers, including any \nprice or shipping cost increases or delays in the supply of components that may result from supply \ndisruptions as well as impacts due to consolidations amongst our suppliers;\n•\nchanges in customers’ budgets for optical transport network purchases and changes or variability in \ntheir purchasing cycles;\n•\nfluctuations in our customer, product or geographic mix, including the impact of new customer \ndeployments, which typically carry lower gross margins, customer consolidation, which may affect \nour ability to grow revenue, and products powered by our next-generation technologies, which \ninitially tend to be lower margin due to higher per unit production costs and greater variability in \nproduction yields;\n•\nthe timing, market acceptance and rate of adoption of our new product releases and our \ncompetitors' new product releases;\n•\nour ability to manage manufacturing costs, maintain or improve quality, and increase volumes and \nyields on products manufactured in our internal manufacturing facilities;\n•\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and the costs and availability of \ncomponents and materials we purchase for our products;\n•\nour ability to successfully restructure or transform our operations within our anticipated time frame \nand realize our anticipated savings;\n•\norder cancellations, reductions or delays in delivery schedules by our customers;\n•\nany significant changes in the competitive dynamics of the markets we serve, including any new \nentrants, new technologies, or customer or competitor consolidation, as well as aggressive pricing \ntactics by our competitors;\n•\nour ability to manage inventory while timely meeting customer demand and avoiding charges for \nexcess or obsolete inventory;\n•\nreadiness of customers for installation of our products as well as the availability of third-party \nservice partners to provide contract engineering and installation services for us, each of which has \nbeen impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; \n18"

These factors include the growth of mobile, video and cloud-based services, increased broadband \nconnectivity and the continuing adoption of high-capacity, revenue-generating services. If demand for such \nbandwidth does not continue, or slows down, the market for optical transport networking equipment may not \ncontinue to grow and our product sales would be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, demand for our products depends on the level and timing of capital spending in optical \nnetworks by service providers as they construct, expand and upgrade the capacity of their optical networks. \nCapital spending is cyclical in our industry and spending by customers can change on short notice. Any future \ndecisions by our customers to reduce capital spending, whether caused by lower customer demand, weakening \neconomic conditions, rising borrowing costs, inflation, customer-specific supply chain issues, changes in \ngovernment regulations relating to telecommunications and data networks, or other reasons, could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny delays in the development, introduction or acceptance of our new products or in releasing \nenhancements to our existing products may harm our business.\nOur products are based on complex technologies, including, in many cases, the development of next-\ngeneration PICs, DSPs and specialized ASICs, each of which are key components of our optical engines. In \naddition, we may also depend on technologies from outside suppliers, all of which may cause us to experience \nunanticipated delays in developing, improving, manufacturing or deploying our products. The development \nprocess for our optical engines is lengthy, and any modifications entail significant development cost and risks.\nAt any given time, various new product introductions and enhancements to our existing products are in \nthe development phase and are not yet ready for commercial manufacturing or deployment. We rely on third \nparties, some of which are relatively early-stage companies, to develop, manufacture and deliver components for \nour next-generation products, which can often require custom development. The development process from \nlaboratory prototype to customer trials, and subsequently to general availability, involves a significant number of \nsimultaneous efforts. These efforts often must be completed in a timely and coordinated manner so that they may \nbe incorporated into the product development cycle for our systems, and include:\n•\ncompletion of product development, including the development and completion of our next-\ngeneration optical engines, and the completion of associated module development;\n•\nthe qualification and multiple sourcing of critical components;\n•\nvalidation of manufacturing methods and processes;\n19"

New generations of \nour optical engines as well as intensive software testing are important to the timely introduction of new products \nand enhancements to our existing products, which are subject to these development risks. In addition, \nunexpected intellectual property disputes, inability to obtain licenses to utilize third party development tools or \nother intellectual property on commercially acceptable terms, failure of critical design elements, limited or \nconstrained engineering resources, and a host of other development execution risks may delay, or even prevent, \nthe introduction of new products or enhancements to our existing products. If we do not develop and successfully \nintroduce or enhance products in a timely manner, including the successful development of our next generation \noptical engine, our competitive position will suffer.\nAs we transition customers to new products, we face significant risk that our new products may not be \naccepted by our current or new customers. To the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products \nthat are adopted by customers, we could fail to obtain an adequate return on these investments and could lose \nmarket share to our competitors, which could be difficult or impossible to regain. Similarly, we may face \ndecreased revenue, gross margins and profitability due to a rapid decline in sales of current products as \ncustomers hold spending to focus purchases on new product platforms. In addition, the sale of new products may \nresult in the cannibalization of sales for existing products, which may harm our results of operations. We could \nalso incur significant costs in completing the transition, including costs of inventory write-downs of the current \nproduct as customers transition to new product platforms. In addition, products or technologies developed by \nothers may render our products noncompetitive or obsolete and result in significant reduction in orders from our \ncustomers and the loss of existing and prospective customers. Any delays in the introduction of new components \nthat we are developing for use in our other products as part of our vertical integration strategy may also prevent \nus from realizing the anticipated cost savings of such development. This may negatively impact our gross \nmargins and harm our business and operating results.\nSupply chain and logistics issues, including delays, shortages, components that have been discontinued \nand increased costs, and our dependency on sole source, limited source or high-cost suppliers, could \nharm our business and operating results.\nWe are reliant on our global supply chain for the production of components for our products. The global \nsupply chain has experienced disruptions that began in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to \ndelays, shortages, components that have been discontinued and increased costs. These supply disruptions have \nnegatively impacted our revenue and our results of operations. For example, shortages of certain key \ncomponents have adversely affected our ability to deliver products to customers in a timely manner. Additionally, \nprice increases within our supply chain have continued to negatively affect our gross margin. The global supply \nchain for components for our products, especially for semiconductor components, continues to experience \nshortages, longer lead times and increased costs. These shortages, delays and increased costs are expected to \ncontinue throughout 2023. We cannot predict with certainty the scope, magnitude or duration of the impact that \nthese supply chain disruptions will have on our business and results of operations. Any efforts that we make to \nmitigate supply chain issues, such as by making additional or long-term purchase commitments with our \nsuppliers or by holding higher levels of inventory, could negatively impact our financial results if we do not \naccurately forecast customer demand or if our customers change their purchasing patterns in response to the \nevolving supply chain environment. Further, the lead times required for these mitigation efforts may not allow us \nto meet increased customer demand in a timely manner. \nWe currently purchase several key components for our products from sole or limited sources. In \nparticular, we rely on our own production of certain components of our products, such as PICs, and on third \nparties, including sole source and limited source suppliers, for certain of the components of our products, \nincluding ASICs, field-programmable gate arrays, processors, and other semiconductor and optical components. \nWe have increased our reliance on third parties to develop and manufacture components for certain products, \nsome of which require custom development.

In addition, these same suppliers may decide to no \nlonger manufacture or support specific components necessary for some of our legacy products, which could lead \nto our inability to fulfill demand without increased engineering and material costs necessary to replace such \ncomponents or cause us to transition such products to end-of-life status sooner than planned. Further, our \nsuppliers could enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, refuse to sell their products or \ncomponents to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all, go out of business or discontinue their \nrelationships with us. We may be unable to develop alternative sources for these components within a suitable \ntime frame to be able to operate our business, or at all.\nThe loss of a source of supply, or lack of sufficient availability of key components, could require us to \nredesign products that use such components, which could result in lost revenue, additional product and \nengineering costs and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships. Due to cross \ndependencies, any supply chain disruptions could negatively impact the demand for our products in the short \nterm. In addition, if our contract manufacturers do not receive critical components in a timely manner to build our \nproducts, then we would not be able to ship certain products in a timely manner and would, therefore, be unable \nto meet our prospective customers’ product delivery requirements. In the past, we have experienced delivery \ndelays because of lack of availability of components or reliability issues with components that we were \npurchasing. In addition, some of our suppliers have gone out of business, merged with another supplier, or \nlimited their supply of components to us, which may cause us to experience longer than normal lead times, \nsupply delays and increased prices. We may in the future experience a shortage of certain components as a \nresult of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, \ncapacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers, strong demand in the industry for \nsuch components, or other disruptions in our supply chain. For example, during 2022, several of our materials \nsuppliers with manufacturing facilities near Shanghai, China were affected by COVID-19-related quarantines, \nwhich have since been lifted. At certain times, these quarantines led to delayed shipments to certain of our \ncontract manufacturers, which subsequently constrained the ability of these contract manufacturers to supply \ncertain components to us on a timely basis. In addition, disruptions to global macroeconomic conditions may \nmake it more difficult for us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and manufacturing \ncapacity. These supplier disruptions may continue to occur in the future, which could limit our ability to produce \nour products and cause us to fail to meet a customer’s delivery requirements. Any failure to meet our customers’ \nproduct delivery requirements could harm our reputation and our customer relationships, either of which would \nharm our business and operating results.\nAggressive business tactics by our competitors and new entrants may harm our business.\nThe markets that we compete in are extremely competitive, which often results in aggressive business \ntactics by our competitors and new entrants, including:\n•\naggressively pricing their optical transport products and other portfolio products, including offering \nsignificant one-time discounts and guaranteed future price decreases;\n•\noffering optical products at a substantial discount or for free when bundled together with broader \ntechnology purchases, such as router or wireless equipment purchases;\n•\nproviding financing, marketing and advertising assistance to customers; and\n•\ninfluencing customer requirements to emphasize different product capabilities, which better suit \ntheir products.\n21"

Complex hardware and \nsoftware systems that are built with and include increasingly sophisticated technology, such as our products, can \noften contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released. In addition, errors \nassociated with components we purchase from third parties, including customized components, may be difficult \nto resolve. We have experienced issues in the past in connection with our products, including failures due to the \nreceipt of components from our suppliers that are either faulty or do not meet our product specifications, and \nperformance issues related to software updates. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components \nor provide software remedies or other remediation in response to errors or bugs, and we may have to do so \nagain in the future. In addition, performance issues can be heightened during periods where we are developing \nand introducing multiple new products to the market, as any performance issues we encounter in one technology \nor product could impact the performance or timing of delivery of other products.

For example, the imposition of shelter-in-place or similarly restrictive work-from-home orders during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic has in the past impacted, and could again impact, many of our offices and employees, \nand many of our employees continue to work remotely or in hybrid work environments. As a result of the public \nhealth and safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, we at times temporarily closed or substantially \nlimited the presence of personnel in some of our offices, implemented travel restrictions and modified our \nparticipation in various industry events. Our flexible approach to work arrangements and related policies \ncontinues to evolve.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also at times contributed to delays in certain operational processes and it \nmay again impact our operational processes. We have experienced disruption and delays in our global supply \nchain and manufacturing operations, logistics operations and customer support operations, including shipping \ndelays, higher transport costs, and certain limitations on our ability to access customer fulfillment and service \nsites. We are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components, and we have \nexperienced capacity issues, longer lead times, increased costs and shortages with certain component suppliers, \nincluding for semiconductors, impacting our operational processes and results of operations. Some of these \ndisruptions negatively impacted our revenue and our results of operations. \nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other future public health concerns on our business and \nresults of operations in the future remains uncertain and is dependent in part on infection, morbidity and disability \nrates, the emergence of new viruses, the continued effectiveness and availability of vaccinations, and broader \nglobal macroeconomic developments. We may face further disruptions or restrictions on our ability to source, \nmanufacture or distribute our products due to existing or additional governmental restrictions in multiple countries \non business operations and movement of people and products.

For example, senior members of our \nengineering team have unique technical experience that would be difficult to replace. Because our products are \ncomplex, we must also hire and retain highly trained customer service and support personnel to ensure that the \ndeployment of our products does not result in network disruption for our customers. We believe our future \nsuccess will depend in large part upon our ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled personnel, and \ncompetition for these individuals is intense in our industry, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we \nare headquartered and, increasingly, in certain cities and regions where we have operations outside the United \nStates as well. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to identify, attract or retain \nqualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel, particularly engineers and sales \npersonnel, could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives, such as timely product \nintroductions. These risks may be exacerbated due to a strong labor market with a competitive wage \nenvironment and attrition.

We rely upon these partners for certain installation, maintenance, logistics and support \nfunctions. In addition, as our customers increasingly seek to rely on vendors to perform additional services \nrelating to the design, construction and operation of their networks, the scope of work performed by our service \npartners is likely to increase and may include areas where we have less experience providing or managing such \nservices. We must successfully identify, assess, train and certify qualified service partners in order to ensure the \nproper installation, deployment and maintenance of our products. The vetting and certification of these partners \ncan be costly and time-consuming, and certain partners may not have the same operational history, financial \nresources and scale as we have. Additionally, certain service partners may provide similar services for other \ncompanies, including our competitors.

We continually invest in research and \ndevelopment to sustain or enhance our existing products, but the introduction of new communications \ntechnologies and the emergence of new industry standards or requirements could render our products obsolete. \nFurther, in developing our products, we have made, and will continue to make, assumptions with respect to which \nstandards or requirements will be adopted by our customers and competitors. If the standards or requirements \nadopted by our prospective customers are different from those on which we have focused our efforts, market \nacceptance of our products would be reduced or delayed, and our business would be harmed. We are continuing \nto invest a significant portion of our research and development efforts in the development of our next-generation \nproducts. We expect our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their existing products and \nintroduce new products and technologies and to influence customers’ buying criteria so as to emphasize product \ncapabilities that we do not, or may not, possess. To be competitive, we must anticipate future customer \nrequirements and continue to invest significant resources in research and development, sales and marketing, \nand customer support, and the investment demands may increase as the technology becomes more complex. If \nwe do not anticipate these future customer requirements and invest in the technologies necessary to enable us \nto have and to sell the appropriate solutions, it may limit our competitive position and future sales, which would \nhave an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

      "text": "If we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements or customer demand, we could incur \nadditional costs, including inventory write-downs or equipment write-offs, which would adversely affect \nour business and results of operations.\nWe generate forecasts of future demand for our products several months prior to the scheduled delivery \nto our prospective customers. This requires us to make significant investments before we know if corresponding \nrevenue will be recognized. Lead times vary significantly for materials and components, including ASICs, that we \nneed to order for the manufacture of our products and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract \nterms and demand for each component at a given time. In the past, we have experienced lengthened lead times \nfor certain components, and we continue to see long lead times for certain components due to industry-wide \nsupply chain challenges, which makes forecasting more challenging. We may be required to purchase increased \nlevels of such components to satisfy our delivery commitments to our customers as a result of longer lead times \nfor components. In addition, we must manage our inventory to ensure we continue to meet our commitments as \nwe introduce new products or make enhancements to our existing products.\nIf we overestimate market demand for our products and, as a result, increase our inventory in \nanticipation of customer orders that do not materialize, we will have excess inventory, which could result in \nincreased risk of obsolescence and significant inventory write-downs. Furthermore, this will result in reduced \nproduction volumes and our fixed costs will be spread across fewer units, increasing our per unit costs. If we \nunderestimate demand for our products, we will have inadequate inventory, which could slow down or interrupt \nthe manufacturing of our products, cause delays in shipments and our ability to recognize revenue, and result in \npotential loss of customers to competitors. In addition, we may be unable to meet our supply commitments to \ncustomers, which could result in a loss of certain customer opportunities or a breach of our customer \nagreements.\nOur large customers have substantial negotiating leverage, which may cause us to agree to terms and \nconditions that result in lower average selling prices and potentially increased cost of sales leading to \nlower gross margin, each of which would harm our results of operations.\nMany of our customers are large service providers and ICPs that have substantial purchasing power \nand leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us. In addition, customer consolidation in the past few \nyears has created combined companies that are even larger and have greater negotiating leverage. Our \ncustomers have sought and may continue to seek advantageous pricing, payment and other commercial terms. \nThis may further impact our profitability if we are unable to recover through price increases passed along to these \ncustomers additional costs we have incurred from inflationary pressures to the supply chain or shipping and \nfreight. We have also occasionally agreed and may continue to agree to unfavorable commercial terms with \nthese customers, including the potential of reducing the average selling price of our products, increasing cost of \nsales or agreeing to extended payment terms in response to these commercial requirements or competitive \npricing pressures. Continued inflation could decrease the profitability of customer contracts, particularly those \nwith extended payment terms, that are not indexed to inflation. If we are compelled to agree to disadvantageous \nterms and conditions, unable to comply with such terms and conditions, or adapt our business model and \noperations to such terms and conditions, then our operating results will be negatively impacted.\nOur sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, which could result in an unexpected revenue shortfall in \nany given quarter.\nOur products can have a lengthy sales cycle, which can extend from six to twelve months and may take \neven longer for larger prospective customers. Our prospective customers conduct significant evaluation, testing, \nimplementation and acceptance procedures before they purchase our products. We incur substantial sales and \nmarketing expenses and expend significant management effort during this time, regardless of whether we make \na sale. Supply chain disruptions have also at times lengthened, and may in the future lengthen, our sales cycle \ndue to delays in the customer certification process for our products.\nBecause our sales cycle is long, we are likely to recognize higher inflation-related costs before \nrecognizing the benefits of any price increases that we implement for our products. Moreover, the costs \nassociated with our sales cycle may increase faster than our ability to increase prices. In addition, changes in \nregulatory requirements or uncertainty associated with the regulatory environment could delay or impede \n28"

As a result, it is difficult for us to \naccurately predict the timing of future purchases by our customers. In addition, product purchases are often \nsubject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays, \nincluding the need for the customer to obtain external financing. If sales expected from customers for a particular \nquarter are not realized in that quarter or at all, our revenue will be negatively impacted.\nAny acquisitions or strategic transactions that we undertake could disrupt our business and harm our \nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe have made strategic acquisitions of businesses, technologies and other assets in the past, including \nmost recently the Acquisition. We may engage in acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions in the \nfuture. In order to undertake certain of these transactions, we may use cash, issue equity that could dilute our \ncurrent stockholders, or incur debt or assume indebtedness. If we are unable to achieve the anticipated \nefficiencies and strategic benefits of such transactions, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition \nand results of operations. In addition, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected if \ninvestors and securities analysts react unfavorably to a strategic transaction or if the integration or the anticipated \nfinancial and strategic benefits of such transactions are not realized as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by \ninvestors and securities analysts.\nAcquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions can also result in adverse tax consequences, \nwarranty or product liability exposure related to acquired assets, additional stock-based compensation expense, \nand write-up of acquired inventory to fair value. Divestitures can also result in contractual, employment or \nintellectual property liability related to divested assets. In addition, we may record goodwill and other purchased \nintangible assets in connection with an acquisition and incur impairment charges in the future. If our actual \nresults, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are less favorable than the original \nestimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges.\nAcquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions also involve numerous risks that could disrupt \nour ongoing business and distract our management team, including:\n•\nproblems integrating the acquired operations, technologies or products with our own;\n•\nchallenges in divesting assets and intellectual property without negatively affecting our retained \nbusiness;\n•\ndiversion of management’s attention from our core business;\n•\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n•\nrisks associated with entering new markets or exiting existing markets; and\n•\nloss of key employees. \nOur failure to adequately manage the risks associated with an acquisition, divestment or strategic \ntransaction could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActions that we are taking or may in the future take to restructure our business to cut costs and align our \noperating structure with current or future opportunities may not be as effective as anticipated and may \nhave negative consequences.\nWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, substantial costs in connection with restructuring plans. \nAlthough these restructuring initiatives may be taken to improve our operating efficiency and to reallocate \nresources to align more closely with our evolving business model and current and future opportunities, they may \nnot result in the benefits we anticipate. We incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans, and our \nrestructuring activities may subject us to reputational and litigation risks.

In addition, restructuring plans may have other consequences, such as attrition beyond any \nplanned reductions in workforce, a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract \nhighly skilled employees. Restructuring presents other significant potential risks such as the actual or perceived \ndisruption of service or reduction in service standards to customers, loss of sales, the failure to preserve supplier \nrelationships and diversion of management attention. In addition, as a result of these restructuring actions, our \nability to execute on product development, address key market opportunities or meet customer demand could be \nmaterially and adversely affected. Further, any anticipated benefits from these restructuring initiatives may be \nrealized later than expected or not at all, and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures may be greater \nthan anticipated. As a result, current or future restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating \nresults.\nFinancial and Macroeconomic Risk Factors\nWe may be unable to generate the cash flow necessary to make anticipated capital expenditures, service \nour debt or grow our business.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make anticipated capital \nexpenditures, service our debt or grow our business. Our ability to pay our expenses, service our debt and fund \nplanned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by general economic, \ncompetitive, legislative, political, regulatory, public health issues and other factors beyond our control, and our \nability to continue to realize synergies and anticipated cost savings. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash \nflow from operations to service our debt or to make anticipated capital expenditures, we may be required to sell \nassets, reduce capital expenditures, borrow additional funds or evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our \ncapital expenditures and ongoing operations, including the issuance of equity, equity-linked and debt securities.\nInflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price \nincreases.\nInflation, which has continued in the U.S. and globally, can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of \nlabor, supplies and other costs of doing business, and price increases within our supply chain have negatively \naffected our gross margin. In an inflationary environment, our ability to raise prices or add additional cost-\nrecovery surcharges of a magnitude sufficient to match the rate of inflation, on a timely basis, may be \nconstrained by customer resistance and competitive concerns, as well as industry-specific and other economic \nconditions, which would reduce our profit margins. Moreover, even if we seek to implement price increases in \nresponse to inflationary pressures, because of our long sales cycle, we may recognize increased costs as a \nresult of inflation before we are able to recognize the benefits of any such price increases. We have experienced \nincreases in the prices of labor, supplies and other costs of doing business and continued inflationary pressures \ncould continue to adversely impact our profitability.\nUnfavorable macroeconomic and market conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and \nfinancial results.\nIn the past, unfavorable macroeconomic and market conditions have resulted in sustained periods of \ndecreased demand for optical communications products and slowdowns in the telecommunications industry in \nwhich we operate. Such slowdowns may result in:\n•\nreduced demand for our products as a result of constraints on capital spending by our customers;\n•\nincreased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors, but also as a result of \nthe utilization of inventoried or underutilized products by our customers or potential customers, \nwhich could put additional downward pressure on our near-term gross profits;\n•\nrisk of excess or obsolete inventories;\n•\nour customers facing financial difficulties, including bankruptcy;\n•\nexcess manufacturing capacity and higher associated overhead costs as a percentage of revenue; \nand\n•\nmore limited ability to accurately forecast our business and future financial performance.\n30"

High inflation, along with other signs of economic disruption, has also contributed to \nadverse global macroeconomic conditions. These conditions may also result in the tightening of credit markets, \nwhich could limit or delay our customers’ ability to obtain necessary financing for their purchases of our products. \nOur customers may delay or cancel their purchases or increase the time they take to pay or default on \ntheir payment obligations due to a lack of liquidity in the capital markets, the continued uncertainty in the global \neconomic environment or inflationary concerns, which could result in a higher level of bad debt expense and \nwould negatively affect our business and operating results. In addition, currency fluctuations could negatively \naffect our international customers’ ability or desire to purchase our products.\nA lack of liquidity and economic uncertainty may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on \nwhich we purchase products from these suppliers. These impacts could limit our ability to obtain components for \nour products from these suppliers and could adversely impact our supply chain or the delivery schedule to our \ncustomers. Suppliers could also require us to purchase more expensive components, or re-design our products, \nwhich could cause increases in the cost of our products and delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our \nproducts. Such events could harm our gross margin and harm our reputation and our customer relationships, \neither of which could harm our business and operating results.\nIf we need additional capital in the future, it may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\nOur business requires significant capital. We have historically relied on outside debt or equity financing \nas well as cash flow from operations to fund our operations, capital expenditures and expansion. For example, in \nSeptember 2018, we issued convertible senior notes due September 1, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) to pay the cost \nof the Capped Calls, as discussed below, to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Acquisition, and \nfor general corporate purposes. In August 2019 and as amended thereafter, we entered into the Prior Credit \nAgreement to provide additional working capital flexibility to manage our business. In addition, in March 2020, we \nissued convertible senior notes due March 1, 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) to raise additional funds for general \ncorporate purposes, including working capital to fund growth and potential strategic projects. On August 12, \n2020, we entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement with Jefferies LLC (\"Jefferies\") under which we issued \nand sold through Jefferies, acting as agent or principal, shares of our common stock having an aggregate \noffering price of $96.3 million, to raise funds for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital \nexpenditures. In June 2022, we terminated the Prior Credit Agreement and entered into the Loan Agreement to \nrepay existing debt (including amounts outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement) and for working capital and \ngeneral corporate purposes, including to fund growth. In August 2022, we issued convertible senior notes due \nAugust 1, 2028 (the “2028 Notes” and, together with the 2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes, the “convertible senior \nnotes”) to repurchase a portion of the 2024 Notes, for general corporate purposes, including working capital and \nto fund growth and potential strategic projects. We may require additional capital from equity or equity-linked \nfinancing, debt financing or other financings in the future to fund our operations, respond to competitive \npressures or strategic opportunities or to refinance our existing debt obligations. In the event that we require \nadditional capital, we may not be able to secure timely additional financing, or restructure existing debt, on \nfavorable terms, or at all, and may be affected by the impacts on capital markets of global economic uncertainty \nand inflationary pressures. The terms of any additional financings or restructurings may place limits on our \nfinancial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt \nsecurities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their \npercentage ownership of our company, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and \nprivileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or \nfinancing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to \nrespond to business challenges could be limited and our business will be harmed.\nOur Loan Agreement and any other credit or similar agreements into which we may enter in the future \nmay restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions \nregarding our business.\nOur Loan Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that may impose operating and \nfinancial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term interest, including \nrestrictions on our ability to incur debt, create liens and encumbrances, engage in certain fundamental changes, \ndispose of assets, prepay certain indebtedness, make restricted payments, make investments, and engage in \n31"

Upon an event of default, the lenders may, subject to customary cure rights, \nrequire the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding and foreclose on collateral, which could force us into \nbankruptcy or liquidation. In the event that our lenders accelerated the repayment of the borrowings, we may not \nhave sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.

This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, \nfinancial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that may be beyond our control. \nThere can be no assurance that our business will generate positive cash flow from operations, or that additional \ncapital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to \nfund other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we \nmay need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise \nadditional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our \ndebt payment obligations. As a result, we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand \ncompetitive pressures and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions.\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that may harm our operating results.\nSales of our products into international markets continue to be an important part of our business.

This provision may materially increase our effective tax rate and reduce our operating cash flows \nover time as we continue to utilize available net operating losses and tax credits. \nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with conversions of the 2024 Notes, \nthe 2027 Notes or the 2028 Notes, and thereby dilute our existing stockholders and potentially adversely \naffect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the event that some or all of each series of convertible senior notes are converted and we elect to \ndeliver shares of common stock to the extent permitted, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be \ndiluted, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion \ncould adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of \nany series of convertible senior notes we have issued could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe fundamental change provisions of the 2024 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the 2028 Notes may delay or \nprevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nIf a fundamental change, such as an acquisition of our company, occurs prior to the maturity of the 2024 \nNotes, the 2027 Notes or the 2028 Notes, holders of the applicable series of convertible senior notes will have \nthe right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible senior notes of such \nseries. In addition, if such fundamental change also constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, the \nconversion rate for the applicable series of convertible senior notes may be increased upon conversion of the \nsuch series of convertible senior notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Any increase in \nthe conversion rate will be determined based on the date on which the make-whole fundamental change occurs \nor becomes effective and the price paid (or deemed paid) per share of our common stock in such transaction. \nAny such increase will be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Our obligation to repurchase any series of \nconvertible senior notes or increase the conversion rate upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental \nchange may, in certain circumstances, delay or prevent a takeover of us that might otherwise be beneficial to our \nstockholders.\nThe Capped Calls may affect the value of the 2024 Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the \n\"Capped Calls\") with certain financial institutions who are the option counterparties. The Capped Calls are \nexpected generally to reduce or offset the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2024 Notes or offset any cash \npayments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2024 Notes, as the case may \nbe, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap.\nFrom time to time, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge \npositions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock or purchasing or \nselling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the \n2024 Notes. This activity could also cause an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Capped Calls.\nThe option counterparties to the Capped Calls are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk \nthat any or all of them might default under the Capped Calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the counterparties \nwill not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived \nfailure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to \ninsolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our \n35"

Our exposure will depend on many \nfactors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the \nvolatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax \nconsequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide \nno assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk Factors\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, or we \ncould incur significant expense to enforce our rights.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of methods to \nprotect our intellectual property, including limiting access to certain information, and utilizing trade secret, patent, \ncopyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer \nonly limited protection. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate to preclude \nmisappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual \nproperty rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation, unauthorized disclosure or infringement is \nuncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States. This is likely to become an increasingly important \nissue if we expand our operations and product development into countries that provide a lower level of \nintellectual property protection. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the \nissuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and even if patents \nare issued, they may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued \npatents may not provide us with a competitive advantage, and, as with any technology, competitors may be able \nto develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our products, trademarks and other proprietary rights is \nexpensive, difficult, time consuming and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to \nenforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope \nof the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of management \nresources, either of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, \nmany of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to \nenforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to \nprevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nClaims by others that we infringe on their intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and \nrelated litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, many leading companies in \nthe optical transport networking industry, including our competitors, have extensive patent portfolios with respect \nto optical transport networking technology. In addition, non-practicing patent holding companies seek to monetize \npatents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. We expect that infringement claims may increase as the \nnumber of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps in technology implementation occur. \nFrom time to time, third parties may assert exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property \nrights to technologies and related standards that are important to our business or seek to invalidate the \nproprietary rights that we hold. Competitors or other third parties have asserted, and may continue to assert, \nclaims or initiate litigation or other proceedings against us or our manufacturers, suppliers or customers alleging \ninfringement of their proprietary rights, or seeking to invalidate our proprietary rights, with respect to our products \nand technology. In addition, in the past we have had certain patent licenses with third parties that have not been \nrenewed, and if we cannot successfully renew these licenses, we could face claims of infringement. In the event \nthat we are unsuccessful in defending against any such claims, or any resulting lawsuits or proceedings, we \ncould incur liability for damages or have valuable proprietary rights invalidated. For additional information \nregarding certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Part II, Item 8, Note 13 under the \nheading “Legal Matters.”\nAny claim of infringement from a third party, even one without merit, could cause us to incur substantial \ncosts defending against the claim, and could distract our management from running our business. Furthermore, a \nparty making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or \ncould include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products. In addition, we \nmight be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on \n36"

Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, \nwhich would require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events \ncould harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nCompetitors and other third parties have and may continue to assert infringement claims against our \ncustomers and sales partners. Any of these claims may require us to initiate or defend potentially protracted and \ncostly litigation on their behalf, regardless of the merits of these claims, because we generally indemnify our \ncustomers and sales partners from claims of infringement of proprietary rights of third parties. If any of these \nclaims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or sales partners, which could \nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also incorporate free and open source licensed software into our products. Although we monitor our \nuse of such open source software closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by \nU.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose \nunanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In addition, non-compliance \nwith open source software license terms and conditions could subject us to potential liability, including intellectual \nproperty infringement or contract claims. In such events, we may be required to seek licenses from third parties \nin order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in \nthe event re-engineering cannot be accomplished in a timely manner, any of which could adversely affect our \nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity incidents, such as data breaches and cyber-attacks, could compromise our intellectual property \nand proprietary or confidential information and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks and systems, \nincluding data related to our intellectual property and data related to our business, customers and business \npartners, which may be considered proprietary or confidential information. This sensitive data includes certain \npersonal information and other data relating to our employees and others. We also utilize third-party service \nproviders to host, transmit, or otherwise process data in connection with our business activities, including our \nsupply chain processes, operations, and communications. Companies, especially in the technology industry, \nhave been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks, malicious activity, including \nransomware, malware and viruses, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access and disrupt systems and the \nconfidentiality, security, and integrity of information, and we and our third-party service providers and suppliers \nhave faced and may continue to face security threats and attacks from a variety of sources. In accordance with \nour flexible approach to work arrangements, many of our employees are working from home and accessing our \ncorporate network via remote devices, which may be less secure than those used in our offices and thus could \nincrease the potential for such events to occur.\nWhile the secure maintenance of this information and the security of the systems used in our business \nare critical to our business and reputation, our network and storage applications, and those systems and other \nbusiness applications maintained by our third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers \nor breached or otherwise compromised due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It may be \ndifficult to anticipate or immediately detect such security incidents or breaches and to prevent or mitigate damage \ncaused as a result. Accordingly, a data breach, security incident, cyber-attack, attack using ransomware or other \nmalware, or any other unauthorized access to systems used in our business or unauthorized acquisition, \ndisclosure, or other processing of our information or other information that we or our third-party vendors maintain \nor otherwise process could compromise our intellectual property, disrupt our operations, or result in loss of or \nunauthorized access to or acquisition, disclosure, modification, misuse, corruption, unavailability, or destruction \nof proprietary or confidential information. While we work to safeguard our internal networks and systems and \nvalidate the security of our third-party suppliers and providers to mitigate these potential risks, including through \ninformation security policies and employee awareness and training, there is no assurance that such actions will \nbe sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches or incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our \nsystems and networks or our third-party service providers’ systems and networks have not been breached or that \nthey or any components of our supply chain do not contain exploitable defects or bugs, including defects or bugs \nthat could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third \nparties that support our operations. We and third-party service providers also may face difficulties or delays in \nidentifying or responding to security breaches and other security-related incidents. We have been subjected in \nthe past to a range of incidents including phishing, emails purporting to come from an executive or vendor \nseeking payment requests, malware and communications from look-alike corporate domains.

While they have not had a material \neffect on our business or our network security to date, security breaches or incidents involving access to or \nimproper use of our systems, networks or products, or those of third-party service providers, could compromise \nconfidential or otherwise protected information, result in unauthorized acquisition, disclosure, modification, \nmisuse, corruption, unavailability, or destruction of data, cause payments to be diverted to fraudulent accounts, \nor otherwise disrupt our operations. Security breaches or incidents, or any reports or perceptions that they have \noccurred, could cause us to incur significant costs and expenses to remediate and otherwise respond to any \nactual or suspected breach or incident, subject us to regulatory actions and investigations, disrupt key business \noperations, result in claims, demands, and liability, and divert attention of management and key information \ntechnology resources, any of which could cause significant harm to our business and reputation. Even the \nperception of inadequate security may damage our reputation and negatively impact our business. Further, we \ncould be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address any security incident or breach \nand to attempt to prevent future security incidents and breaches.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain liabilities in connection with some \nsecurity breaches and other security incidents, we cannot be certain our insurance coverage will be adequate for \nliabilities actually incurred, including any consequential damages that may arise from such security incidents, that \ninsurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms (if at all) or that any insurer will \nnot deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that \nexceed available insurance coverage, the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium \nincreases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, or denials of coverage could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. \nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and \ntiming of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX\"). The provisions \nof SOX require, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and \ndisclosure controls and procedures. Preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes, \nmany of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review. These processes \ninclude, but are not limited to, calculating revenue, deferred revenue and inventory costs. While we continue to \nautomate our processes and put in place controls to reduce the likelihood for errors, we expect that for the \nforeseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error. If we \nare unable to implement effective key operational controls around financial processes and successfully manage \nand monitor manual processes, we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial \nstatements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial \nreports and the market price of our securities may decline.\nWe are subject to various governmental export control, trade sanctions, and import laws and regulations \nthat could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate \nthese controls. \nIn some cases, our products are subject to U.S. and foreign export control laws and regulations that \nmay limit where and to whom we are permitted to sell our products, including the Export Administration \nRegulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and our activities may be subject to trade and \neconomic sanctions, including those administered by the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of \nForeign Assets Control (collectively, “Trade Controls”). As such, a license may be required to export or re-export \nour products, or provide related services, to certain countries and end-users, and for certain end-uses. Further, \nour products incorporating encryption functionality may be subject to special controls applying to encryption items \nor certain reporting requirements. \nWe have procedures in place designed to ensure our compliance with Trade Controls, with which failure \nto comply could subject us to both civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration \nof responsible individuals for willful violations, possible loss of our export or import privileges, or reputational \nharm. Further, the process for obtaining necessary licenses may be time-consuming or unsuccessful, potentially \ncausing delays in sales or losses of sales opportunities. Trade Controls are complex and dynamic regimes, and \nmonitoring and ensuring compliance can be challenging, particularly given that our products are widely \ndistributed throughout the world. Although we have no knowledge that our activities have resulted in material \nviolations of Trade Controls, any failure by us or our partners to comply with applicable laws and regulations \n38"

      "text": "would have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations, and \npenalties.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technologies and have enacted laws that \ncould limit our ability to distribute our products and certain product features or could limit our customers’ ability to \nimplement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in U.S. and foreign import and \nexport regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our \ncustomers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some \ncases, prevent the import and export of our products to certain countries altogether. For example, the United \nStates has imposed tariffs on a large variety of products originating from China, including some on components \nthat are supplied to us from China. Depending upon the duration and implementation of these and future tariffs, \nas well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these tariffs could materially affect our business, including in the \nform of increased cost of goods sold, increased pricing for customers, and reduced sales. Additionally, the U.S. \ngovernment has levied controls affecting the ability to send certain products and technology related to \nsemiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing and supercomputing to China without an export license and \nadding additional entities to restricted party lists. It remains unclear what additional actions, if any, will be taken \nby the governments of the United States or China with respect to such trade and tariff matters. Any change in \nimport and export regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing \nregulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies impacted by such regulations, could result in \ndecreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential \ncustomers with international operations. Failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis, or at all, \nor any limitation on our ability to develop, export or sell our products would adversely affect our business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations that could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to complex U.S. and foreign environmental rules and regulations or other social \ninitiatives that impact how and where we manufacture our products. In particular, our manufacturing operations \nuse substances that are regulated by various federal, state, local, foreign and international laws and regulations \ngoverning health, safety and the environment, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations and \nWEEE, RoHS and REACH regulations adopted by the E.U. From time to time, the E.U. restricts or considers \nrestricting certain substances under these directives. For example, InP has been considered for restriction under \nRoHS. Any restriction of InP or any other substance integral to our systems could materially adversely affect our \nbusiness, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if we experience a problem complying with these \nlaws and regulations, it could cause an interruption or delay in our manufacturing operations or it could cause us \nto incur liabilities or costs related to health, safety or environmental remediation or compliance. We could also be \nsubject to liability if we do not handle these substances in compliance with safety standards for handling, storage \nand transportation and applicable laws and regulations. If we experience a problem or fail to comply with such \nsafety standards or laws and regulations, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nRegulations relating to environmental, social and governance matters, as well as customer and investor \ndemands, may add operational complexity for us and may adversely affect our relationships with our \ncustomers, suppliers and investors. \nThere has been an increased focus on environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") matters that \naffect companies globally, including by the SEC. A number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, \nprocurement policies that include environmental or social responsibility provisions or requirements that their \nsuppliers should comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement \nterms and conditions. An increasing number of investors are also requiring companies to disclose corporate ESG \npolicies, practices and metrics. In addition, various jurisdictions are developing climate change-based laws or \nregulations that could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as indirect costs resulting \nfrom our customers, suppliers, or both, incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These \nlegal and regulatory requirements, as well as investor expectations, on corporate ESG responsibility practices \nand disclosure, are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply \nwith, given the complexity of our supply chain. If we are unable to comply with, or are unable to cause our \nsuppliers or contract manufacturers to comply with such policies or provisions, or meet the requirements of our \ncustomers and investors, a customer may stop purchasing products from us or an investor may sell their shares, \nand may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations.\n39"

For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in effect in the E.U., and similar \nregulatory standards in effect in the United Kingdom, the Personal Information Protection Law (\"PIPL\") in China, \nthe California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), other enacted or \nproposed legislation in the United States, and enacted or proposed legislation in other jurisdictions have created \nnew compliance obligations with respect to data processing, privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity.\nThe laws, rules, regulations, standards and other actual and asserted obligations relating to privacy, \ndata protection and cybersecurity to which we may be subject, or that otherwise apply to our business, are \nconstantly evolving, and we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry \nstandards concerning these matters in the United States, the E.U. and other jurisdictions. We cannot fully predict \nthe impact of the GDPR, the PIPL, the CCPA, the CPRA or other laws or regulations, including those that may be \nmodified or enacted in the future, or new or evolving industry standards or actual or asserted obligations, relating \nto cybersecurity, privacy, or data protection or processing on our business or operations. These laws, regulations, \nand standards have required us to modify our practices and policies relating to privacy, data protection, \ncybersecurity, and data processing, and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply, and we \nexpect to continue to incur such costs and expenses in the future and may find it necessary or appropriate to \nfurther modify our relevant practices and policies. Any actual or perceived failure by us or our customers, \npartners or vendors to comply with laws, regulations, or other actual or asserted obligations to which we are or \nare alleged to be subject relating to cybersecurity, privacy or data protection could result in claims, litigation, and \nregulatory investigations and other proceedings, as well as damage to our reputation. These could result in \nsubstantial costs, diversion of resources, fines, penalties, and other damages, and harm to our customer \nrelationships, our market position, and our ability to attract new customers. Any of these could harm our \nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of \nuncertainties, challenges, and risks. \nWe currently sell many of our solutions to various government entities, and we may in the future \nincrease sales to government entities. Sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks, including \nrisks related to a highly competitive, expensive, and time consuming sales process, which often requires \nsignificant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will complete a sale. If we are successfully \nawarded a government contract, such award may be subject to appeals, disputes, or litigation, including, but not \nlimited to, bid protests by unsuccessful bidders. Government demand and payment for our solutions may be \nimpacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays \nadversely affecting public sector demand for our solutions. Government entities may also have statutory, \ncontractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts for convenience or due to a default. For purchases by the \nU.S. federal government, the government may require certain products to be made in, or be products of, the \nUnited States or other high-cost manufacturing locations, and all of our products may not be made in or products \nof jurisdictions that meet government requirements, and as a result, our business and results of operations may \nsuffer. Contracts with government entities may also include preferential pricing terms, including, but not limited to, \n“most favored customer” pricing. \nAdditionally, we may be required to obtain special certifications to sell some or all of our solutions to \ngovernment or quasi-government entities. Such certification requirements for our solutions may change, thereby \nrestricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification. If \nour products and subscriptions are late in achieving or fail to achieve compliance with these certifications and \nstandards, or our competitors achieve compliance with these certifications and standards before us, we may be \ndisqualified from selling our products to such governmental entities, or be at a competitive disadvantage, which \nwould harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. There are no assurances that we will find \nthe terms for obtaining such certifications to be acceptable or that we will be successful in obtaining or \nmaintaining the certifications.\n40"

As \na result of actual or perceived noncompliance with government contracting laws, regulations, or contractual \nprovisions, we may be subject to non-ordinary course audits and internal investigations which may prove costly \nto our business financially, divert management time, or limit our ability to continue selling our products and \nservices to our government customers. These laws and regulations may impose other added costs on our \nbusiness, and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements, including non-\ncompliance in the past, could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners, downward contract price \nadjustments or refund obligations, civil or criminal penalties, termination of contracts or suspension or debarment \nfrom government contracting for a period of time with government agencies. Any such damages, penalties, \ndisruption, or limitation in our ability to do business with a government would adversely impact, and could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on, our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and growth \nprospects. \nOur business could be adversely affected if our employees cannot obtain and maintain required security \nclearances or we cannot maintain a required facility security clearance, or we do not comply with legal \nand regulatory obligations regarding the safeguarding of classified information. \nOur U.S. government contract revenue includes income derived from contracts that require our \nemployees to maintain various levels of security clearances and may require us to maintain a facility security \nclearance, to comply with Department of Defense (“DoD”) requirements. The DoD has strict security clearance \nrequirements for personnel who perform work in support of classified programs. In general, access to classified \ninformation, technology, facilities, or programs are subject to additional contract oversight and potential liability. In \nthe event of a security incident involving classified information, technology, facilities, programs, or personnel \nholding clearances, we may be subject to legal, financial, operational, and reputational harm. We are limited in \nour ability to provide specific information about these classified programs, their risks, or any disputes or claims \nrelating to such programs. As a result, investors have less insight into our classified programs than our other \nbusinesses and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business or our business \noverall. Obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees involves a lengthy process, and it is difficult \nto identify, recruit, and retain employees who already hold security clearances. If our employees are unable to \nobtain security clearances in a timely manner, or at all, or if our employees who hold security clearances are \nunable to maintain their clearances or terminate employment with us, then a customer requiring classified work \ncould terminate an existing contract or decide not to renew the contract upon its expiration. To the extent we are \nnot able to obtain or maintain a facility security clearance, we may not be able to bid on or win new classified \ncontracts, and existing contracts requiring a facility security clearance could be terminated.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering laws, and similar laws, could \nsubject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. \nTravel Act, the UK Bribery Act, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the United \nStates and in countries outside of the United States in which we conduct our activities. Anti-corruption and anti-\nbribery laws have been enforced aggressively and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their \nemployees, agents, representatives, business partners, and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, \nor providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector.\nWe sometimes leverage third parties to sell our products and conduct our business abroad. We or our \nemployees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect \ninteractions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be \nheld liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these employees, agents, representatives, business partners \nor third-party intermediaries even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We cannot assure you that all of \nour employees and agents will refrain from taking actions in violation of applicable law for which we may be \nultimately held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may \nincrease.\nThese laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and \ncompliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions.

Our networking solutions enable our customers to deliver high-bandwidth \nbusiness and consumer communications services. Our comprehensive portfolio of networking solutions also \nenables our customers to scale their transport networks as end-user services and applications continue to drive \ngrowth in demand for network bandwidth. These end-user services and applications include, but are not limited \nto, high-speed internet access, business ethernet services, 4G/5G mobile broadband, cloud-based services, \nhigh-definition video streaming services, virtual and augmented reality, IoT, business Ethernet services and DCI.\nAs an optical semiconductor manufacturer, we specialize in the manufacturing of optical compound \nsemiconductors using InP. This technology is used in telecommunications networks to transmit massive amounts \nof data and power, critical communications services like 5G, enhanced broadband, and high-capacity data center \nconnectivity. We have made significant investments in our unique research, development, fabrication, and \npackaging facilities, including our optical compound semiconductor fab in Silicon Valley. We optimize the \nmanufacturing process by using InP to build our PICs, which enables the integration of hundreds of optical \nfunctions onto a onto a single, monolithic optical semiconductor chip. The unique capabilities of our optical \nsemiconductor fab, which has provided our customers with a critical and secure source of U.S.-produced optical \nsemiconductors and strengthened the supply chain, have enabled us to consistently pioneer critical technology \nadvancements. For example, our latest generation of technology has made it possible to transmit information at a \nrate of 800 Gb/s using a single laser.\nWe support U.S. government efforts to advance and increase the domestic manufacturing base for \nsemiconductors as a matter of economic and national security. Compound semiconductors – including those \nbased in InP – are an important part of the domestic semiconductor industry and will enable the next-generation \nof leading-edge technologies. Domestic manufacturing is critical in order to reduce our reliance on foreign \nsources of compound semiconductor materials and components, which is essential to economic growth and to \nthe security of our domestic communications infrastructure. \nThe large-scale integration of our PICs and advanced DSPs enables us to develop and manufacture \nhigh-performance optical engines that are used in our coherent optical networking system and subsystem \nsolutions. These solutions include features that customers care about the most, including reduced cost per bit, \nlower footprint and power consumption, and improved performance, reliability and security. Coherent optical \nsolutions are becoming increasingly important across the network as our customers transition to 800 Gb/s per \nwavelength transmission speeds and beyond in the core, 400 Gb/s in the metro, and 100 Gb/s in the access \nmarket segment. We believe our vertical integration strategy provides a competitive advantage by enabling \nleading optical performance at higher optical speeds with increased spectral efficiency, greater control over our \nsupply chain, and a lower cost structure.\nWe have grown our solutions portfolio through internal development as well as acquisitions, including \nthe acquisition of Coriant, a privately held global supplier of open network solutions for the largest global network \noperators. These developments positioned us to be one of the leading providers of vertically integrated optical \nnetworking solutions in the world with the ability to serve a global customer base with accelerated delivery of the \ninnovative solutions our customers demand. In 2021, we announced an expansion of our portfolio with the \nintroduction of a suite of coherent optical pluggables designed to seamlessly address the rapidly growing market \nfor point-to-point solutions as well as create a new category of point-to-multipoint solutions that can enable a \ndramatically more cost-efficient network architecture. Based on our vertically integrated optical semiconductor \ntechnology and supporting a range of high-speed transport rates that include 800 Gb/s, 400 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s, \nthis suite of coherent optical pluggables builds on our history of delivering innovative, highly differentiated, and \nvertically integrated coherent optical engines.\nOur products are designed to be managed by a suite of software solutions that enable simplified \nnetwork management and automated operations. We also provide software-enabled programmability that offers \ndifferentiated capabilities such as Instant Bandwidth. Combined with our differentiated hardware solutions, \nInstant Bandwidth enables our customers to purchase and activate bandwidth as needed through our unique \nsoftware licensing feature set. This, in turn, allows our customers to accomplish two key objectives: (1) limit their \ninitial network startup costs and investments; and (2) instantly activate new bandwidth as their customers’ and \ntheir own network needs evolve.\n49"

Our high-performance optical transport solutions \nleverage the industry shift to open optical network architectures and enable our customers to efficiently and cost-\neffectively meet bandwidth demand, which continues to grow 30% or more year-over-year. \nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nWe continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and actively assess potential implications to our \nbusiness, supply chain, customer fulfillment sites, support operations and customer demand. We are also \ncontinuing to take appropriate measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and to create and \nmaintain a safe working environment. While the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been decreasing, if the \nCOVID-19 pandemic or its adverse effects become more severe or prevalent in the future or are prolonged in the \nlocations where we, our customers, suppliers or contract manufacturers conduct business, or we experience \nmore pronounced disruptions in our operations, or in economic activity and demand generally, our business and \nresults of operations in future periods could be materially adversely affected.\nFinancial and Business Highlights\n \nTotal revenue was $1,573.2 million in 2022 as compared to $1,425.2 million in 2021, representing a \n10% increase. The year-over-year increase in revenue was driven by the ramp of new products, particularly \nICE6, and revenue growth in our ICP vertical in the United States and our other service provider vertical in the \nUnited States and APAC. This growth was partially offset by lower revenue from certain Tier 1 customers and \neach of our other service provider and ICP verticals in EMEA and in our cable vertical in the United States. In \n2023, we anticipate benefiting from a diversified customer base and see several prospective opportunities to \ngrow revenue by driving adoption of new and existing solutions. Our results will depend on overall market \nconditions and, as is typical, quarter-over-quarter revenue could be volatile, affected by, among other factors, \ncustomer buying patterns, supply chain disruptions and the timing of customer network deployments.\nGross margin decreased to 34% in 2022 from 35% in 2021. The year-over-year decrease in gross \nmargin was primarily driven by higher costs related to component price increases, higher logistics and freight \ncosts, and supply constrained manufacturing volumes, partially offset by quality initiatives and ongoing cost \nimprovements. In this period, our margins benefited from improved product mix including increased revenue from \nvertically integrated products. In 2023, we intend to continue to expand our vertical integration capabilities across \nmore of our product portfolio utilizing our ICE6 optical engine and expect to benefit from the partial relief of \nelevated supply chain costs, both of which should help drive continued gross margin improvement over time.\nOperating expenses increased to $595.9 million in 2022 from $585.5 million in 2021, representing a 2% \nincrease. This increase was primarily attributable to higher employee-related costs, costs related to bringing our \nnew technologies to market and investments in future technologies. These increases were partially offset by \nlower restructuring costs and amortization of our acquired intangibles. In 2023, we intend to continue to balance \nprudent cost management with investments in technology innovation and our go-to-market efforts globally to \nexpand our customer reach and drive additional market share gains in the long term.\nOne customer accounted for approximately 11% of our revenue in 2022. No customer accounted for \nover 10% of our revenue in 2021.\nWe primarily sell our products through our direct sales force, with the remainder sold indirectly through \nchannel partners. We derived 76% and 77% of our revenue from direct sales to customers in 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively. In the future, we expect to continue generating a majority of our revenue from direct sales.\nWe are headquartered in San Jose, California, with employees located throughout North America, \nLATAM, EMEA and APAC.\n50"

The gain includes and was reduced by the write-off of related \ndeferred issuance costs of $3.5 million.\nThe change in other gain (loss), net, 2022 compared to 2021, was $36.9 million primarily due to an \nincrease in unrealized foreign exchange gains driven by foreign currency exchange rate changes.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recognized an income tax expense of $20.5 million on a loss before income taxes of $55.5 million, \n$12.0 million on a loss before income taxes of $158.8 million, and $6.0 million on a loss before income taxes of \n$200.7 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The resulting effective tax rates were (37.1)%, (7.5)% and \n(3.0)% for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 2022 and 2021 effective tax rates differ from the expected \nstatutory rate of 21% based on our ability to benefit from our U.S. loss carryforwards, offset by state income \ntaxes, non-deductible stock-based compensation expenses and foreign taxes provided on foreign subsidiary \nearnings. The increase in 2022 income tax provision compared to 2021 is mainly driven by an increase in income \ntaxes and withholding taxes in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions where our local subsidiaries do not have \ncarryforward losses to offset income.\nDuring 2022, we implemented a realignment of our internal supply chain and customer facing entities. \nThe new structure aligned and consolidated our intellectual property and the associated commercial risk and \nreward among the customer-facing entities in their internal supply chain and improved operational efficiency. The \nimpact of this internal realignment is reflected in our tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nBecause of our U.S. operating loss in 2022, significant loss carryforward position, and corresponding \nvaluation allowance in all years, other than separate filing state taxes, a few combined states and minimum \ntaxes, we have not been subject to federal or state tax on our U.S. income because of the availability of loss \ncarryforwards. If these losses and other tax attributes become fully utilized, our taxes will increase significantly to \na more normalized, expected rate on U.S. earnings. The release of transfer pricing reserves in the future may \nhave a beneficial impact to tax expense, but the timing of the impact depends on factors such as expiration of the \nstatute of limitations or settlements with tax authorities.

See Note 13, \n\"Commitments and Contingencies\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n(2)\nWe have service agreements with certain production suppliers under which we are committed to purchase certain parts. \nThe increase in purchase obligations compared with the end of fiscal 2021 was primarily due to increased lead-time \ncommitments required to secure supply and pricing for certain product components as well as investments to support the \nrelease of new products.\n(3)\nFor additional information regarding our asset-based revolving credit facility and 2028, 2027 and 2024 Notes, see Note 12, \n“Debt” to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(4)\nCertain commitments and contingencies are not included in the table because we cannot reliably estimate the timing and \namount of future payments, if any. For example, tax liabilities of $9.6 million related to uncertain tax positions and \nexpected future payments to our pension and post-employment plans are excluded from the contractual obligation table \nbecause they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on various factors. See Note 18, \n\"Employee Benefit and Pension Plans\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information relating to \nour pension and post-retirement benefit plans.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting \nprinciples require us to make certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that can affect the reported amounts \nof assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated \nfinancial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. \nSee Note 2, “Significant Accounting Policies” to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is \nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, \nwhich describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of our consolidated financial \nstatements. Management believes that the estimates, assumptions and judgments upon which they rely are \nreasonable based upon information available to them at the time that these estimates and judgments are made. \nTo the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated \nfinancial statements will be affected. \nWe believe our critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, \naccounting for income taxes, and inventory valuation. Management considers these policies critical because they \nare both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and they require \nmanagement to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, \nin an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. \nWe determine revenue recognition by applying the following five-step approach: \n•\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n•\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n59"

      "text": "•\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n•\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n•\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nMany of our product sales are sold in combination with installation and deployment services along with \ninitial hardware and software support. Our product sales are also sold at times with spares management, on-site \nhardware replacement services, network operations management, software subscription services, extended \nhardware warranty and training. Initial software and hardware support services are generally delivered over a \none-year period in connection with the initial purchase. Software warranty provides customers with maintenance \nreleases during the warranty support period and hardware warranty provides replacement or repair of equipment \nthat fails to perform in line with specifications. Software subscription services include software warranty and \nadditionally provides customers with rights to receive unspecified software product upgrades released during the \nsupport period.\nSpares management and on-site hardware replacement services include the replacement of defective \nunits at customer sites in accordance with specified service level agreements. Network operations management \nincludes the day-to-day operation of a customer's network. These services are generally delivered on an annual \nbasis. We evaluate each promised good and service in a contract to determine whether it represents a distinct \nperformance obligation or should be accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\nServices revenue includes software subscription services, installation and deployment services, spares \nmanagement, on-site hardware replacement services, network operations management, extended hardware \nwarranty and training. Revenue from software subscription services, spares management, on-site hardware \nreplacement services, network operations management and extended hardware warranty contracts is deferred \nand is recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one year, as services are \nprovided over the course of the entire period. Revenue related to training and installation and deployment \nservices is recognized upon completion of the services.\nContracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an \narrangement. In addition, shipping documents and customer acceptances, when applicable, are used to verify \ndelivery and transfer of title. We typically satisfy our performance obligations upon shipment or delivery of \nproduct depending on the contractual terms. Payment terms to customers generally range from net 30 to 120 \ndays from invoice, which are considered to be standard payment terms. We assess our ability to collect from our \ncustomers based primarily on the creditworthiness and past payment history of the customer.\nCustomer product returns are generally approved on a case by case basis. Specific reserve provisions \nare made based upon a specific review of all the approved product returns where the customer has yet to return \nthe products to generate the related sales return credit at the end of a period. Estimated sales returns are \nrecorded as a reduction to revenue. \nFor sales to resellers, the same revenue recognition criteria apply. It is our practice to identify an end-\nuser prior to shipment to a reseller. We do not offer rights of return or price protection to our resellers.\nWe report revenue net of any required taxes collected from customers and remitted to government \nauthorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government \nauthority.\nCustomer Purchase Commitments\nWe sell software licenses that provide customers the ability to purchase incremental bandwidth capacity \non an already-deployed piece of hardware. Instant Bandwidth-enabled systems generally include a specific initial \ncapacity and incremental capacity can be added by the purchase of Instant Bandwidth licenses. Instant \nBandwidth licenses are considered distinct performance obligations because customers can provision additional \ntransmission capacity on demand without the deployment of any incremental equipment.\n60"

      "text": "Some contracts commit the customer to purchase incremental Instant Bandwidth licenses within a \nspecified time frame from the initial shipment of the Instant Bandwidth-enabled hardware. The time frame varies \nby customer and generally ranges between 12 to 24 months. If the customer does not purchase the additional \ncapacity within the time frame as stated in the contract, we have the right to deliver and invoice such Instant \nBandwidth licenses to the customer. Future committed licenses are considered to be additional performance \nobligations when a minimum purchase obligation is present, as evidenced by enforceable rights and obligations. \nAs such, we are required to estimate the variable consideration for future Instant Bandwidth licenses as part of \ndetermining the contract transaction price.\nContract Termination Rights\nThe contract term is determined on the basis of the period over which the parties to the contract have \npresent enforceable rights and obligations. Certain customer contracts include a termination for convenience \nclause that allows the customer to terminate services without penalty, upon advance notification. For such \ncontracts, the service duration is limited to the non-cancelable portion of the contract.\nVariable Consideration\nThe consideration associated with customer contracts is generally fixed. Variable consideration includes \ndiscounts, rebates, refunds, credits, incentives, penalties, or other similar items. The amount of consideration \nthat can vary is not a substantial portion of total consideration.\nVariable consideration estimates are re-assessed at each reporting period until a final outcome is \ndetermined. The changes to the original transaction price due to a change in estimated variable consideration will \nbe applied on a retrospective basis, with the adjustment recorded in the period in which the change occurs.\nStand-alone Selling Price\nStand-alone selling price is the price at which an entity would sell a good or service on a stand-alone (or \nseparate) basis at contract inception. Under this model, the observable price of a good or service sold separately \nprovides the best evidence of stand-alone selling price. However, in certain situations, stand-alone selling prices \nwill not be readily observable and the entity must estimate the stand-alone selling price.\nWhen allocating on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, any discount provided in the contract is \ngenerally allocated proportionately to all of the performance obligations in the contract.\n The majority of products and services offered by us have readily observable selling prices. For products \nand services that do not, we generally estimate stand-alone selling price using the market assessment approach \nbased on expected selling price and adjust those prices as necessary to reflect our costs and margins. As part of \nour stand-alone selling price policy, we review product pricing on a periodic basis to identify any significant \nchanges and revise our expected stand-alone selling price assumptions as appropriate.\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligation\nOur remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to performance \nobligations that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied, as of period end, consisting of deferred revenue and backlog. \nOur backlog represents purchase orders received from customers for future product shipments and services that \nare unsatisfied or partially satisfied as of period end. Our backlog is subject to future events that could cause the \namount or timing of the related revenue to change, and, in certain cases, may be canceled without penalty. \nOrders in backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following receipt or may relate to multi-year support service \nobligations. \nAccounting for Income Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate \nour taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate actual current tax expense together with \nassessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items, such as accruals and allowances not \ncurrently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are \nincluded in our consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be \nreceived when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become \ndeductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss, or credit carryforwards are utilized. Accordingly, \nrealization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions \nagainst which these deductions, losses and credits can be utilized within the applicable future periods.\n61"

      "text": "We must assess the likelihood that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will be recovered from \nfuture taxable income within the respective jurisdictions. To the extent the Company believes that recovery does \nnot meet the “more-likely-than-not” standard, it must establish a valuation allowance. The ultimate realization of \ndeferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those \ntemporary differences become deductible. Management judgment is required in determining its provision for \nincome taxes, its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net \ndeferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for a full or partial valuation allowance, all positive and negative \nevidence must be considered, including the Company's forecast of taxable income over the applicable \ncarryforward periods, its current financial performance, its market environment, and other factors. Based on the \navailable objective evidence, at December 31, 2022, management believes it is not more likely than not that the \ndomestic net deferred tax assets will be realizable in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the domestic net \ndeferred tax assets are subject to a full valuation allowance. To the extent that the Company determines that \ndeferred tax assets are realizable on a more likely than not basis, and an adjustment is needed, that adjustment \nwill be recorded in the period that the determination is made.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods and are stated at standard cost \nadjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or net realizable value. Costs are recognized utilizing the first-in, \nfirst-out method. Net realizable value is based upon an estimated selling price reduced by the estimated cost of \ndisposal. The determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimated average selling \nprices based upon recent sales volumes, industry trends, existing customer orders, current contract price, future \ndemand and pricing and technological obsolescence of our products.\nInventory that is obsolete or in excess of our forecasted demand or is anticipated to be sold at a loss is \nwritten down to its estimated net realizable value based on historical usage and expected demand. In valuing our \ninventory costs and deferred inventory costs, we considered whether the net realizable value of inventory \ndelivered or expected to be delivered at less than cost, primarily comprised of common equipment, had declined. \nWe concluded that, in the instances where the net realizable value of inventory delivered or expected to be \ndelivered was less than cost, it was appropriate to value the inventory costs and deferred inventory costs at cost \nor net realizable value, whichever is lower, thereby recognizing the cost of the reduction in net realizable value of \ninventory in the period in which the reduction occurred or can be reasonably estimated. We have, therefore, \nrecognized inventory write-downs as necessary in each period in order to reflect inventory at the lower of actual \ncost or net realizable value. \nWe consider whether we should accrue losses on firm purchase commitments related to inventory \nitems. Given that the net realizable value of common equipment is below contractual purchase price, we have \nalso recorded losses on these firm purchase commitments in the period in which the commitment is made. When \nthe inventory parts related to these firm purchase commitments are received, that inventory is recorded at the \npurchase price less the accrual for the loss on the purchase commitment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, “Significant Accounting Policies” to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a \nfull description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoptions and \neffects on us.\n62"

      "text": "ITEM 7A. \nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe operate in international markets, which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency \nexchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which \nis the euro. The majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, with the most significant \nexception being in Europe, where we invoice primarily in euros and SEK. Additionally, a portion of our expenses, \nprimarily the cost of personnel for research and development and sales and sales support to deliver technical \nsupport on our products and professional services and the cost to manufacture, are denominated in foreign \ncurrencies, primarily the Indian rupee, the euro, the SEK and the British pound. Revenue resulting from selling in \nlocal currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations \nthat can affect our operating income. As exchange rates vary, operating income may differ from expectations.\nWe may enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the impact of currency \nexchange rate movements on certain transactions from time to time, but do not cover all foreign-denominated \ntransactions and therefore do not entirely eliminate the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates that could \nnegatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. We also may enter into foreign currency \nexchange forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain non-functional \ncurrency denominated account balances primarily in euros and British pounds from time to time. As a result, we \ndo not expect a significant impact to our results from a change in exchange rates on foreign denominated non-\nfunctional account balances in the near-term. Gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset the \nimpact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the underlying foreign currency denominated non-functional \ncurrency account balances. Accordingly, the effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange \nrates on these transactions during 2022 would not be material to our results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $189.2 million and $202.5 million as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. The unrestricted cash is held for working capital \npurposes. We do not enter into investments for speculative purposes. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse \nchange in interest rates would not be material to our results of operations.\nIn September 2018, March 2020 and August 2022 we issued the 2024 Notes, 2027 Notes and the 2028 \nNotes, respectively. The 2024, 2027 and 2028 Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 2.125%, 2.50% and \n3.75%, respectively, and, therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the convertible senior \nnotes. However, the fair values of the convertible senior notes are subject to interest rate risk, credit risk and \nother factors due to the convertible feature. The fair value of the convertible senior notes will generally increase \nas interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the convertible senior notes \nwill generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock \nprice declines in value. The fair value of the convertible senior notes will generally increase as our credit \nworthiness improves and decrease when our creditworthiness weakens. The interest and market value changes \naffect the fair value of the convertible senior notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows or results \nof operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation. Additionally, we do not carry the convertible senior \nnotes at fair value. We present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only. As of December 31, 2022, the \nfair value of the 2024, 2027 and 2028 Notes was $101.0 million, $221.4 million and $462.9 million, respectively. \nThe fair value was determined based on the estimated fair value or quoted bid price as applicable of the 2024, \n2027 and 2028 Notes in an over-the-counter market on December 30, 2022. The convertible senior notes are \nclassified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nHolders may convert the convertible senior notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain \ncircumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock \nor a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election (provided, however, that with respect \nto the 2028 Notes, we would be required to repay the principal amount in cash and the conversion premium in \nany combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our election). If our common stock price is above \nthe initial conversion price of $9.87, $7.66 and $6.80 for the 2024, 2027 and 2028 Notes, respectively, upon \nconversion or at maturity, the amount of cash or shares of common stock required to pay the conversion \npremium is not fixed and would increase if our common stock price increases.\nSee Note 12, “Debt” to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n63"

A company’s internal control over financial reporting \nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, \naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide \nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements \nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company \nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) \nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect \nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that \ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the \npolicies or procedures may deteriorate. \n/s/    Ernst & Young LLP\n \nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 27, 2023\n67"

      "text": "INFINERA CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nOrganization and Basis of Presentation\nInfinera Corporation (“Infinera” or the “Company”), headquartered in San Jose, California, was founded \nin December 2000 and incorporated in the State of Delaware. Infinera is a global supplier of networking solutions \ncomprised of networking equipment, optical semiconductors, software and services. Infinera’s portfolio of \nsolutions includes optical transport platforms, converged packet-optical transport platforms, optical line systems, \ndisaggregated router platforms, and a suite of networking and automation software offerings, and support and \nprofessional services. Infinera leverages its U.S.-based compound semiconductor fab and in-house packaging \ncapabilities to design, develop, and manufacture industry-leading indium phosphide-based photonic integrated \ncircuits for use in its high-capacity optical communications products.\nThe Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the \nlast Saturday of December in each year. Accordingly, fiscal year 2022 was a 53-week year that ended on \nDecember 31, 2022. Fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were 52-week years that ended on December 25, 2021 and \nDecember 26, 2020, respectively. The next 53-week year will end on December 30, 2028.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. \ngenerally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The consolidated financial statements include all adjustments \nnecessary for a fair presentation of the Company's annual results. All adjustments are of a normal recurring \nnature.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts for the Company and its subsidiaries and \naffiliates in the Company which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. All \ninter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Company reclassified certain amounts \nreported in previous periods to conform to the current presentation.\n2.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires \nmanagement to make certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of \nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial \nstatements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates, \nassumptions and judgements made by management include inventory valuation, revenue recognition, accounting \nfor income taxes, stock-based compensation, employee benefit and pension plans, manufacturing partner and \nsupplier liabilities, allowances for sales returns, allowances for credit losses, useful life of intangibles and \nproperty, plant and equipment, impairment loss related to lease abandonment, accrued warranty, operating and \nfinance lease liabilities, restructuring and other related costs and loss contingencies. The Company bases its \nassumptions on historical experience and also on assumptions that it believes are reasonable. Actual results \ncould differ materially from those estimates. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional \ninformation emerges, and such changes are recognized or disclosed in the Company's consolidated financial \nstatements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to its \ncustomers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for \nthose goods or services. \nThe Company determines revenue recognition by applying the following five-step approach: \n•\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n•\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n•\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n•\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n•\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\n74"

      "text": "Many of the Company's product sales are sold in combination with installation and deployment services \nalong with initial hardware and software support. The Company's product sales are also sold at times with spares \nmanagement, on-site hardware replacement services, network operations management, software subscription \nservices, extended hardware warranty and training. Initial software and hardware support services are generally \ndelivered over a one-year period in connection with the initial purchase. Software warranty provides customers \nwith maintenance releases during the warranty support period and hardware warranty provides replacement or \nrepair of equipment that fails to perform in line with specifications. Software subscription services include \nsoftware warranty and additionally provides customers with rights to receive unspecified software product \nupgrades released during the support period.\nSpares management and on-site hardware replacement services include the replacement of defective \nunits at customer sites in accordance with specified service level agreements. Network operations management \nincludes the day-to-day operation of a customer's network. These services are generally delivered on an annual \nbasis. The Company evaluates each promised good and service in a contract to determine whether it represents \na distinct performance obligation or should be accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\nServices revenue includes software subscription services, installation and deployment services, spares \nmanagement, on-site hardware replacement services, network operations management, extended hardware \nwarranty and training. Revenue from software subscription services, spares management, on-site hardware \nreplacement services, network operations management and extended hardware warranty contracts is deferred \nand is recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one year, as services are \nprovided over the course of the entire period. Revenue related to training and installation and deployment \nservices is recognized upon completion of the services.\nContracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an \narrangement. In addition, shipping documents and customer acceptances, when applicable, are used to verify \ndelivery and transfer of title. The Company typically satisfies its performance obligations upon shipment or \ndelivery of product depending on the contractual terms. Payment terms to customers generally range from net 30 \nto 120 days from invoice, which are considered to be standard payment terms. The Company assesses its ability \nto collect from its customers based primarily on the creditworthiness and past payment history of the customer.\nFor sales to resellers, the same revenue recognition criteria apply. It is the Company’s practice to \nidentify an end-user prior to shipment to a reseller. The Company does not offer rights of return or price \nprotection to its resellers.\nThe Company reports revenue net of any required taxes collected from customers and remitted to \ngovernment authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant \ngovernment authority.\nCustomer Purchase Commitments\nThe Company sells software licenses that provide customers the ability to purchase incremental \nbandwidth capacity on an already-deployed piece of hardware. Infinera Instant Bandwidth-enabled systems \ngenerally include a specific initial capacity and incremental capacity can be added by the purchase of Instant \nBandwidth licenses. Instant Bandwidth licenses are considered distinct performance obligations because \ncustomers can provision additional transmission capacity on demand without the deployment of any incremental \nequipment. \nSome contracts commit the customer to purchase incremental Instant Bandwidth licenses within a \nspecified time frame from the initial shipment of the Instant Bandwidth-enabled hardware. The time frame varies \nby customer and generally ranges between 12 to 24 months. If the customer does not purchase the additional \ncapacity within the time frame as stated in the contract, the Company has the right to deliver and invoice such \nInstant Bandwidth licenses to the customer. Future committed licenses are considered to be additional \nperformance obligations when a minimum purchase obligation is present, as evidenced by enforceable rights and \nobligations. As such, the Company is required to estimate the variable consideration for future Instant Bandwidth \nlicenses as part of determining the contract transaction price.\nContract Termination Rights\nThe contract term is determined on the basis of the period over which the parties to the contract have \npresent enforceable rights and obligations. Certain customer contracts include a termination for convenience \nclause that allows the customer to terminate services without penalty, upon advance notification. For such \ncontracts, the service duration is limited to the non-cancelable portion of the contract.\nINFINERA CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n75"

      "text": "Variable Consideration\nThe consideration associated with customer contracts is generally fixed. Variable consideration includes \ndiscounts, rebates, refunds, credits, incentives, penalties, or other similar items. The amount of consideration \nthat can vary is not a substantial portion of total consideration.\nVariable consideration estimates are re-assessed at each reporting period until a final outcome is \ndetermined. The changes to the original transaction price due to a change in estimated variable consideration will \nbe applied on a retrospective basis, with the adjustment recorded in the period in which the change occurs.\nStand-alone Selling Price\nStand-alone selling price is the price at which an entity would sell a good or service on a stand-alone (or \nseparate) basis at contract inception. Under this model, the observable price of a good or service sold separately \nprovides the best evidence of stand-alone selling price. However, in certain situations, stand-alone selling prices \nwill not be readily observable and the entity must estimate the stand-alone selling price.\nWhen allocating on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, any discount provided in the contract is \ngenerally allocated proportionately to all of the performance obligations in the contract. \nThe majority of products and services offered by the Company have readily observable selling prices. \nFor products and services that do not, the Company generally estimates stand-alone selling price using the \nmarket assessment approach based on expected selling price and adjust those prices as necessary to reflect the \nCompany’s costs and margins. As part of its stand-alone selling price policy, the Company reviews product \npricing on a periodic basis to identify any significant changes and revise its expected stand-alone selling price \nassumptions as appropriate.\nShipping and Handling\nThe Company treats shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill the Company's promise to transfer \nproducts. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as a reduction to cost of product.\nCapitalization of Costs to Obtain a Contract\nThe Company has assessed the treatment of costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. Sales \ncommissions have historically been expensed as incurred. Under Topic 606, the Company capitalizes sales \ncommissions related to multi-year service contracts, which are paid for upfront, and amortizes the asset over the \nperiod of benefit, which is the service period. Sales commissions paid on service contract renewals, are \ncommensurate with the sales commissions paid on the initial contracts.\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligation\nThe Company’s remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to \nperformance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied as of period end, consisting of deferred revenue \nand backlog. The Company’s backlog represents purchase orders received from customers for future product \nshipments and services that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied as of period end. The Company’s backlog is \nsubject to future events that could cause the amount or timing of the related revenue to change, and, in certain \ncases, may be canceled without penalty. Orders in backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following receipt or \nmay relate to multi-year support service obligations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and \nis recognized as expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period) under the straight-line \namortization method. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\n The Company estimates the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under its 2007 Employee Stock \nPurchase Plan (the “ESPP”) using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. The ESPP provides for consecutive \nsix-month offering periods and the Company's historical volatility data in the valuation of shares that are \npurchased under the ESPP.\nThe Company accounts for the fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) using the closing market \nprice of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. For new-hire grants, RSUs typically vest ratably on \nan annual basis over four years. For annual refresh grants, RSUs typically vest ratably over 18 months to three \nyears.\nINFINERA CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n76"

These PSUs may become eligible for vesting to begin before the \nend of the applicable performance period, if the applicable financial target is met. The number of shares to be \nissued upon vesting of these PSUs is capped at the target number of PSUs granted. The Company assesses the \nachievement status of these PSUs on a quarterly basis and records the related stock-based compensation \nexpenses based on the estimated achievement payout.\nIn addition, the Company granted other PSUs to certain employees that only vest upon the achievement \nof specific operational performance criteria. The Company assesses the achievement status of these PSUs on a \nquarterly basis and records the related stock-based compensation expenses based on the estimated \nachievement payout.\nEmployee Benefit and Pension Plans\nThe Company operates a number of post-employment plans in Germany, as well as smaller post-\nemployment plans in other countries, including both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Benefit cost \nand obligations pertaining to these plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on \nplan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. The \ndiscount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed-income securities with \nmaturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. Mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan \nparticipants. The expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects the Company's actual \nexperience and future expectations. The expected long-term return on plan assets is determined based on asset \nallocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and management’s expected returns for each \nasset class. The Company evaluates its expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital \nmarket assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected long-term return on plan assets. The \nCompany updates the expected long-term return on assets when the Company observes a sufficient level of \nevidence that would suggest the long-term expected return has changed.\nResearch and Development\nAll costs to develop the Company’s hardware products are expensed as incurred. Software \ndevelopment costs are capitalized beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and \nending when a product is available for general release to customers. Generally, the Company’s software \nproducts are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. As a result, costs subsequent to \nachieving technological feasibility have not been significant and all software development costs have been \nexpensed as incurred.\nAdvertising\nAll advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $1.5 \nmillion, $1.6 million, and $1.3 million, respectively.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to \nestimate its taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company estimates actual current tax \nexpense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items, such as \naccruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets \nand liabilities, which are included in consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets represent future \ntax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in consolidated statements of \noperations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss, or credit carryforwards are \nutilized. Accordingly, realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income within the \nrespective jurisdictions against which these deductions, losses and credits can be utilized within the applicable \nfuture periods.\nThe Company must assess the likelihood that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will be \nrecovered from future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions, and to the extent the Company believes \nthat recovery does not meet the “more-likely-than-not” standard, it must establish a valuation allowance. The \nultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the \nperiods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management judgment is required in \ndetermining its provision for income taxes, its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance \nINFINERA CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n77"

In evaluating the need for a full or partial valuation allowance, all \npositive and negative evidence must be considered, including the Company's forecast of taxable income over the \napplicable carryforward periods, its current financial performance, its market environment, and other factors. \nBased on the available objective evidence, at December 31, 2022, management believes it is not more likely \nthan not that the domestic net deferred tax assets will be realizable in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the \ndomestic net deferred tax assets are subject to a full valuation allowance. To the extent that the Company \ndetermines that deferred tax assets are realizable on a more likely than not basis, and an adjustment is needed, \nthat adjustment will be recorded in the period that the determination is made.\nDuring 2022, the Company executed an internal realignment of its supply chain and customer-facing \nentities. Among other things, the new structure aligned and consolidated the exploitation of its intellectual \nproperty and the allocation of the associated commercial risk and reward with the customer-facing entities that \nmanage its supply chain. The impact of this internal realignment is reflected in the Company’s tax provision for \nthe year ended December 31, 2022.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe Company considers the functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries to be the local currency. \nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet \ndate, revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the period. Equity \ntransactions are translated using historical exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency translation \nadjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the \naccompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nFor all non-functional currency account balances, the re-measurement of such balances to the \nfunctional currency will result in either a foreign exchange transaction gain or loss, which is recorded to other \nincome (loss), net, in the Company's consolidated statement of operations, in the same period that the re-\nmeasurement occurred. Aggregate foreign exchange transactions recorded was gain of $12.8 million in 2022 and \nlosses of $17.2 million and $0.2 million, in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company enters into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign \nexchange fluctuations on earnings from certain non-functional currency account balances denominated primarily \nin euros and British pounds. \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash consists primarily of cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, a portion may exceed \nfederally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at \nthe date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nFair Value Measurement\nPursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurements and its subsequent updates, fair value \nis defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value \nmeasurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers \nthe principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market \nparticipants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\nValuation techniques used by the Company are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. \nObservable or market inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs \nreflect the Company’s assumptions about market participant assumptions based on the best information \navailable. Observable inputs are the preferred source of values. These two types of inputs create the following \nfair value hierarchy:\nINFINERA CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n78"

The Company estimates the fair values of derivatives based on quoted market prices or \npricing models using current market rates. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and \ndiscount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate \ncurves, credit risk, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. \nFacilities-related Charges\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its facilities-related charges associated with its restructuring \nplans, based on estimated future discounted cash flows and unobservable inputs, which includes the amount and \ntiming of estimated sublease rental receipts that the Company can reasonably obtain over the remaining lease \nterm and the discount rate. \nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company \nmaintains an allowance for estimated credit losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required \npayments and reviewed the allowance quarterly. The Company determines expected credit losses by performing \ncredit evaluations of its customers' financial condition, establishing both a general reserve and specific reserve \nfor customers in adverse financial condition and adjusting for its expectations of changes in conditions that may \nimpact the collectability of outstanding receivables. The Company considers a customer's receivable balance \npast due when the amount is due beyond the credit terms extended, The Company considers factors such as \nhistorical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances, and geographic or country-specific \nrisks. Amounts are written off when receivables are determined to be uncollectible.\nAllowances for Sales Returns\nCustomer product returns are approved on a case by case basis. Specific reserve provisions are made \nbased upon a specific review of all the approved product returns where the customer has yet to return the \nproducts to generate the related sales return credit at the end of a period. Estimated sales returns are provided \nfor as a reduction to revenue. At December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, revenue was \nreduced for estimated sales returns by $3.6 million, $0.8 million, and $2.4 million, respectively.\nConcentration of Risk\nFinancial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of \ncash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, foreign exchange contracts and accounts receivable.\nThe risk with respect to foreign exchange contracts is mitigated by entering into these contracts with a \nlarge high-quality financial institution and the Company monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparty \nconsistently.\nThe risk with respect to accounts receivable is mitigated by ongoing credit evaluations that the \nCompany performs on its customers. As the Company continues to expand its sales internationally, it may \nexperience increased levels of customer credit risk associated with those regions. Collateral is generally not \nrequired for accounts receivable but may be used in the future to mitigate credit risk associated with customers \nlocated in certain geographical regions.\nINFINERA CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n79"

No \ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of the Company's revenue in 2021.\nThe Company depends on sole source or limited source suppliers for several key components and raw \nmaterials. The Company generally purchases these sole source or limited source components and raw materials \nthrough standard purchase orders and does not have long-term contracts with many of these limited-source \nsuppliers. While the Company seeks to maintain sufficient reserve stock of such components and raw materials, \nthe Company’s business and results of operations could be adversely affected if any of its sole source or limited \nsource suppliers suffer from capacity constraints, lower than expected yields, deployment delays, work \nstoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output.\n Derivative Instruments\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of its \nbusiness. As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative instruments, specifically forward \ncontracts, to reduce the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on earnings. The forward contracts are with \nhigh-quality institutions and the Company monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties consistently. The \nCompany’s objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the \nderivative contracts used to hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting fair values of assets. \nThe Company does not use derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nThe Company enters into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to \nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise primarily from euro and British pounds. Gains and losses on \nthese contracts are intended to offset the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on the underlying account \nbalances, and therefore, do not subject the Company to material balance sheet risk. \nThe Company has entered into factoring agreements, to sell certain receivables to unrelated third-party \nfinancial institutions. These transactions are accounted for in accordance with ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing \n(“ASC 860”). ASC 860 and result in a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective \ncontrol over and risk related to the receivables to the buyers. The Company's factoring agreements do not allow \nfor recourse in the event of uncollectability, and the Company does not retain any interest in the underlying \naccounts receivable once sold. \nInventory Valuation\nInventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods and are stated at standard cost \nadjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or net realizable value. Costs are recognized utilizing the first-in, \nfirst-out method. Net realizable value is based upon an estimated selling price reduced by the estimated cost of \ndisposal. The determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimated average selling \nprices based upon recent sales volumes, industry trends, existing customer orders, current contract price, future \ndemand and pricing and technological obsolescence of the Company’s products.\nInventory that is obsolete or in excess of the Company’s forecasted demand or is anticipated to be sold \nat a loss is written down to its estimated net realizable value based on historical usage and expected demand. In \nvaluing its inventory costs and deferred inventory costs, the Company considered whether the net realizable \nvalue of inventory delivered or expected to be delivered at less than cost, primarily comprised of common \nequipment, had declined. The Company concluded that, in the instances where the net realizable value of \ninventory delivered or expected to be delivered was less than cost, it was appropriate to value the inventory costs \nand deferred inventory costs at cost or net realizable value, whichever is lower, thereby recognizing the cost of \nthe reduction in net realizable value of inventory in the period in which the reduction occurred or can be \nreasonably estimated. The Company has, therefore, recognized inventory write-downs as necessary in each \nperiod in order to reflect inventory at the lower of actual cost or net realizable value. \nThe Company considers whether it should accrue losses on firm purchase commitments related to \ninventory items. Given that the net realizable value of common equipment is below contractual purchase price, \nthe Company has also recorded losses on these firm purchase commitments in the period in which the \ncommitment is made. When the inventory parts related to these firm purchase commitments are received, that \ninventory is recorded at the purchase price less the accrual for the loss on the purchase commitment.\nINFINERA CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n80"

Hardware warranties provide the purchaser with protection \nin the event that the product does not perform to product specifications. During the warranty period, the \npurchaser’s sole and exclusive remedy in the event of such defect or failure to perform is limited to the correction \nof the defect or failure by repair, refurbishment or replacement, at the Company’s sole option and expense. The \nCompany's hardware warranty periods generally range from one to five years from date of acceptance for \nhardware and the Company's software warranty is 90 days. Upon delivery of the Company's products, the \nCompany provides for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty. The \nhardware warranty accrual is based on actual historical returns and cost of repair experience and the application \nof those historical rates to the Company's in-warranty installed base. The provision for warranty claims fluctuates \ndepending upon the installed base of products and the failure rates and costs of repair associated with these \nproducts under warranty. Furthermore, the Company's costs of repair vary based on repair volume and its ability \nto repair, rather than replace, defective units. In the event that actual product failure rates and costs to repair \ndiffer from the Company's estimates, revisions to the warranty provision are required. In addition, from time to \ntime, specific hardware warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise with specific \nproducts. The Company regularly assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the \namounts as necessary.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is \ncomputed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.

Initially, these assets are not subject to amortization, but once projects \nhave been completed, these assets are transferred to developed technology, which are subject to amortization, \nwhile assets related to projects that have been abandoned are impaired and expensed to research and \ndevelopment. \nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the \nidentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

The Company \nrecognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company does not \naccount for lease components (e.g., fixed payments including rent) separately from the non-lease components \n(e.g., common-area maintenance costs).\nUpon abandoning or committing to a plan to abandon a leased property in the short term before the \nlease term expires, the Company assesses the fair value of its remaining obligation under the lease and records \nan impairment of the ROU asset, if needed.

Applying the transition guidance, the Company was required to apply the guidance to all \nimpacted financial instruments that were outstanding as of December 26, 2021 with the cumulative effect \nrecognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. \nThe adoption of ASU 2020-06 required the Company to record a $196.5 million reduction of additional \npaid in capital, on December 26, 2021, due to the recombination of the equity conversion component of \nconvertible debt remaining outstanding, which was initially separated and recorded in equity. The $122.0 million \nincrease in debt represented the removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation. \nThe Company recognized a $74.5 million cumulative effect decrease of initially applying ASU 2020-06 as an \nadjustment to the December 26, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Interest expense recognized in \nfuture periods will be reduced as a result of accounting for the convertible senior notes as a liability instrument. \nSince the Company had a net loss in 2022, the convertible senior notes were determined to be anti-dilutive and \ntherefore had no impact to basic or diluted net loss per share in 2022 as a result of adopting ASU 2020-06. The \nprior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported \nunder the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\n3. \nLeases\nThe Company has operating leases for real estate (facilities) and automobiles. For the fiscal years \nended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, operating lease expense was \n$21.1 million, $25.7 million and $34.0 million, respectively. Included in operating lease expense were rent \nexpense and impairment charges due to restructuring resulting in abandonment of certain lease facilities, \namounting to $8.1 million, $6.5 million and $9.9 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, \nDecember 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively.

The Company’s primary foreign currency risk \nmanagement objective is to protect the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of \nreported earnings. The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts, primarily short term in nature. \nHistorically, the Company enters into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to manage its \nexposure to fluctuation in foreign exchange rates that arise from its euro and British pound denominated account \nbalances. Gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset the impact of foreign exchange rate \nfluctuations on the underlying foreign currency denominated account balances, do not subject the Company to \nmaterial balance sheet risk. \nThe Company had no outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts as of December 31, \n2022. As of December 25, 2021, the Company had $29.5 million outstanding foreign currency exchange forward \ncontract and posted collateral of $0.9 million to cover associated potential credit risk exposure. This collateral \namount was classified as other long-term restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe before-tax effect of foreign currency exchange forward contracts was a gain of $0.6 million, $0.9 \nmillion and $0.3 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, included in other income (expense), net, in the \nconsolidated statements of operations. In each of these periods, the impact of the gross gains and losses were \noffset by foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the underlying foreign currency denominated amounts. \nThe Company does not designate foreign currency exchange forward contracts as hedges for \naccounting purposes and accordingly, changes in the fair value are recorded in the accompanying consolidated \nstatements of operations. These contracts were with one high-quality institution and the Company consistently \nmonitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties.\nINFINERA CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n88"

The Company also used a portion of the remaining net proceeds to fund \nthe cash portion of the purchase price of the Acquisition, including fees and expenses relating thereto, and used \nthe remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nThe Capped Calls have an initial strike price of $9.87 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which \ncorresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2024 Notes. The Capped Calls have initial cap prices of $15.19 \nper share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, 40.8 \nmillion shares of common stock. The Capped Calls transactions are expected generally to reduce or offset \npotential dilution to the Company's common stock upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes and/or offset any cash \npayments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2024 Notes, as the \ncase may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The Capped Calls expire on various dates \nbetween July 5, 2024 and August 29, 2024. The Capped Calls were recorded as a reduction of the Company’s \nstockholders’ equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe net proceeds to the Company from the issuance of 2027 Notes were approximately $193.3 million \nafter deducting initial purchasers' fee and other debt issuance costs. The Company used the remaining net \nproceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital to fund growth and potential strategic \nprojects.\nThe net proceeds to the Company from the issuance of 2028 Notes were approximately $362.4 million \nafter deducting the initial purchasers' fee and other debt issuance costs. The Company used approximately \n$283.6 million, which included accrued and unpaid interest, of the net proceeds from this issuance to repurchase \napproximately $299.8 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2024 Notes concurrently with the issuance. This \ntransaction involved a contemporaneous exchange of cash between the Company and holders of the 2024 Notes \nparticipating in the issuance of the 2028 Notes. Accordingly, the transaction was evaluated for modification or \nextinguishment accounting in accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt – Modifications and Extinguishments on a \ncreditor-by creditor basis depending on whether the exchange was determined to have substantially different \nterms. The repurchase of the 2024 Notes and issuance of the 2028 Notes were deemed to have substantially \ndifferent terms based on the present value of the cash flows or significant difference between the value of the \nconversion option immediately prior to and after the exchange. Therefore, the repurchase of the 2024 Notes was \naccounted for as a debt extinguishment. The Company recorded a $15.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt \non its consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, which includes the \nwrite-off of related deferred issuance costs of $3.5 million. After giving effect to the repurchase, the total \nremaining principal amount outstanding under the 2024 Notes as of December 31, 2022 was $102.7 million.\nThe Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds from the issuance of 2028 Notes for general \ncorporate purposes, including working capital and to fund growth and potential strategic projects.\nThe 2024 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the 2028 Notes mature on September 1, 2024, March 1, 2027 and \nAugust 1, 2028, respectively.

The \ncarrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument \nthat does not have an associated conversion feature. The carrying amounts of the equity component \nrepresenting the conversion option related to the 2024 Notes and 2027 Notes were $128.7 million and \n$67.8 million, respectively. This was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from its par \nvalue. The equity component was recorded in additional paid-in-capital and was not re-measured as long as it \ncontinued to meet the conditions for equity classification. The excess of the principal amount of the liability \ncomponent over its carrying amount (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense over the respective \ncontractual term of the convertible senior notes at an effective interest rate of 9.92%.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on December 26, 2021 and in accounting for the debt issuance \ncosts of $12.9 million and $6.7 million related to the 2024 Notes and 2027 Notes, respectively, the Company \nallocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components of the convertible senior notes based on \ntheir relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component were $8.7 million and $4.3 million, \nrelated to the 2024 Notes and 2027 Notes, respectively, and were amortized to interest expense using the \neffective interest method over the contractual term of the convertible senior notes. Issuance costs attributable to \nthe equity component were netted with the equity component in additional paid-in-capital.\nOn December 26, 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 based on a modified retrospective \ntransition method. Under such transition, prior-period information has not been retrospectively adjusted.\nIn accounting for the convertible senior notes after adoption of ASU 2020-06, the convertible senior \nnotes are accounted for as a single liability.

      "text": "Loss Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. \nThese may relate to disputes, litigation and other legal actions. In the preparation of its quarterly and annual \nfinancial statements, the Company considers the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability, including \nwhether it is probable, reasonably possible or remote that a liability has been incurred, as well as the Company’s \nability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. In accordance with U.S. \nGAAP, an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the \namount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information to determine \nwhether any accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. As of each of December 31, \n2022 and December 25, 2021, the Company has accrued the estimated liabilities associated with certain loss \ncontingencies.\nIndemnification Obligations\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require it to \nindemnify parties against third-party claims. The terms of such indemnification obligations vary. These contracts \nmay relate to: (i) certain real estate leases under which the Company may be required to indemnify property \nowners for environmental and other liabilities, and other claims arising from the Company’s use of the applicable \npremises; and (ii) certain agreements with the Company’s officers, directors and certain key employees, under \nwhich the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities.\nIn addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify certain customers for claims made against the \nCompany’s products, where such claims allege infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including, \nbut not limited to, patents, registered trademarks, and/or copyrights. Under the aforementioned intellectual \nproperty indemnification clauses, the Company may be obligated to defend the customer and pay for the \ndamages awarded against the customer under an infringement claim as well as the customer’s attorneys’ fees \nand costs. These indemnification obligations generally do not expire after termination or expiration of the \nagreement containing the indemnification obligation. In certain cases, there are limits on and exceptions to the \nCompany’s potential liability for indemnification. The Company cannot estimate the amount of potential future \npayments, if any, that it might be required to make as a result of these agreements. The maximum potential \namount of any future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnification \nobligations could be significant.\nAs permitted under Delaware law and the Company’s charter and bylaws, the Company has \nagreements whereby it indemnifies certain of its officers and each of its directors. The term of the indemnification \nperiod is for the officer’s or director’s lifetime for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or \nwas, serving at the Company’s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the \nCompany could be required to make under these indemnification agreements could be significant; however, the \nCompany has a director and officer insurance policy that may reduce its exposure and enable it to recover all or \na portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of its insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the \nestimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal.\nINFINERA CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n103"

Volatility in funded status occurs when asset values change differently \nfrom liability values and can result in fluctuations in costs in financial reporting.

Asset allocation decisions are recommended by the trustees for the specific plan and \nagreed to by the Company's management. Investment objectives are designed to generate returns that will \nenable the plan to meet its future obligations. The Company's management reviews the investment strategy and \nperformance semi-annually and discuss alternatives to manage volatility. \nBasis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets \nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset \nclass in which the plan invests and the weight of each asset class in the target mix. Expected asset returns \nreflect the current yield on government bonds, risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns \nwhich considers each country’s specific inflation outlook.

This “Controls and Procedures” section includes information \nconcerning the internal controls and controls evaluation referred to in the certifications.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n \nAn evaluation was performed by our management, with the participation of our CEO and our CFO, of \nthe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d -15(e) under \nthe Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be \ndisclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and \nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated \nand communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions \nregarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, \n2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\n \nOur management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our \ninternal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter \nhow well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s \nobjectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, \nand the benefits of controls must be considered relative to its costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in \nall control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or \nfraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any \nsystem of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be \nno assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. \nProjections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, \ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions or deterioration in the degree of \ncompliance with policies or procedures. \nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n \nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2022 there were no changes in our internal control over \nfinancial reporting which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) \nof Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to \nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are continually monitoring and assessing the \nINFINERA CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n117"
