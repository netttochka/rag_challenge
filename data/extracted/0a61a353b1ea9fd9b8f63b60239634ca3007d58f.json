With Downer’s services impacting millions of lives every \nday, the sustainability of the Group’s operations is paramount \n– for its people, partners, shareholders, customers and their \ncustomers. Downer delivers these services while managing \nthe impacts of its activities on people, the environment \nand communities in which the Group operates and working \ncollaboratively with its supply chain.

The Group understands that its ability \nto do this is fundamental to Downer’s long-term success.\nGroup Financial Performance\nFor the 12 months ended 30 June 2022, Downer reported a \ndecrease in total revenue and earnings before interest, tax and \namortisation of acquired intangibles (EBITA) driven by the loss \nof contribution from the Mining and Laundries divestments \nmade in the current and prior periods. In addition, the Group’s \nfinancial performance has been impacted by COVID-19 as well \nas severe wet weather conditions as a result of La Niña. \nThe main features of the result for the 12 months ended \n30 June 2022 were:\n\t§ Total revenue1 of $12.0 billion, down 2.0%\n\t§ Statutory EBITA of $358.0 million, down 10.7%; \nfrom $401.0 million\n\t§ EBITA margin of 3.0% down from 3.3% at 30 June 2021\n\t§ Statutory earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) \nof $323.2 million, down 3.5%; from $334.8 million\n\t§ Statutory net profit after tax and before amortisation \nof acquired intangible assets (NPATA) of $176.4 million, \ndown 23.3%; from $230.0 million\n\t§ Statutory net profit after tax (NPAT) of $152.0 million, \ndown 17.3%; from $183.7 million.\nGearing has decreased by 1.3 percentage points (pp) to 17.7% \nsince June 2021 reflecting the strong operating cash flows and \nproceeds from the divestment program partially offset by the \nimpact of the share buy-back program.\nCash conversion for the year was 83.9% and 88.9% after \nadjusting for $22.3 million2 cash outflows related to items \nrecognised in FY20 and funded from the July 2020 capital \nraising, and $12.7 million bid costs for the Queensland Train \nManufacturing Program.\nCorporate costs decreased by $2.7 million or, 2.6%, to \n$100.5 million as a result of portfolio restructure and cost \nmanagement, partially offset by higher information technology \nsecurity and insurance related costs.\nNet finance costs decreased by $19.5 million or, 18.6%, to \n$85.4 million driven by lower average debt drawn and lower \nlease interest expense.\nThe underlying effective tax rate of 28.0% is lower than the \nstatutory corporate tax rate of 30.0% due to the impact of items \nincluding non-taxable distributions from joint ventures and \nlower tax rates in overseas jurisdictions (e.g. New Zealand).\nIndividually Significant Items (ISIs) totalled $41.2 million loss \nbefore interest and tax for the year, ($48.9 million loss after-tax). \nThese ISIs relate to: \n\t§ The fair value movement of the Downer Contingent Share \nOptions (DCSO) issued in FY21 as part of the acquisition of \nthe remaining 12.2% interest in Spotless\n\t§ Divestments and exit costs\n\t§ Portfolio restructure costs\n\t§ Bid costs\n\t§ Probuild credit loss\n\t§ Gain on sale of PP&E.\nRefer to Note B3 to the Financial Report for further details.\n1.\t\nTotal revenue is a non-statutory disclosure and includes revenue, other \nincome and notional revenue from joint ventures and other alliances not \nproportionately consolidated.\n2.\t\nDowner undertook a Non-renounceable Pro-rata Entitlement Offer, for \nwhich the uses included the funding of payroll remediation costs and legal \nsettlements of New Zealand building works.\n11\nDirectors’ Report     |"

Both the \nnear-term and the long-term targets \nhave a base year of 2020.\nDowner’s key climate-related challenge is to decouple its GHG \nemissions from revenue growth.\nIn FY22, Downer completed a detailed review of its most \nmaterial climate-related risks and opportunities in line with the \nTaskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). \nThis work built on Downer’s previous TCFD analysis in 2019, \nand reaffirmed that climate change presents considerable \nopportunities for Downer – and that these opportunities will \nincrease as efforts to decarbonise accelerate.\nThe analysis determined that Downer’s greatest exposure \nto transition risk are its asphalt plants as well as its light and \nheavy vehicle fleet and plant and equipment. Downer has \ndecarbonisation strategies and plans to minimise exposure \nto transition risks.\nIn addition, Downer has undertaken a review of its capital \nallocation process to integrate climate thinking and \nconsiderations. This led to the creation of a centralised \ndecarbonisation fund to support initiatives that will help \nachieve Downer’s net zero commitments.\nRisks to manage include: the physical risks to Downer’s fixed \nassets, key sites and locations (such as extreme heat, bushfires \nand severe weather events); transition risks associated with \ndecarbonising Downer’s asphalt manufacturing process and \nits fleet; regulatory risk and cost increase due to Government \npolicy (i.e. carbon price); reputational risk such as customer \nand shareholder expectations; and reducing Downer’s Scope \n3 emissions, in particular emissions derived from purchased \ngoods and services.\n20\n|     Downer EDI Limited"

The \nimpact of widespread COVID-19 infections within the community \nand the restrictions placed on businesses and employees by \ngovernment were not anticipated at the time we set our targets \nand forecasts for 2022. Additionally, the prolonged and severe \nwet weather patterns experienced throughout Australia’s \neastern States have been debilitating and unprecedented. \nThe impact of COVID-19 and severe wet weather patterns \nhave materially impacted the Company’s financial performance \nin 2022.\nNotwithstanding the difficulties presented during the period \nour staff and management responded outstandingly in \nhighly challenging circumstances, maximising outcomes for \nshareholders, protecting not only the performance of your \nCompany but also the communities in which Downer operates, \nall while delivering quality service outcomes for our customers. \nIf not for this ‘above and beyond’ effort, our Company would not \nbe in the strong position it is in today.\nWe remain leaders in the markets in which we operate, \nstrengthening our position over the past 12 months with \n$36.1 billion work in hand. Our Net Debt to EBITDA is just \n1.6x with available liquidity of $1.9 billion. We have won over \n$3.5 billion in new work over the last quarter of 2022 setting \nthe Company up for a strong 2023 and beyond.\nDuring the period our executive team have continued to \nimprove the portfolio by:\n\t§ Completing the exit of the Open Cut Mining East and Otraco \nbusinesses, delivering on the strategy to exit capital-intensive \nbusinesses and significantly decreasing the Group’s carbon \nemissions profile\n\t§ Completing the exit of the Hospitality businesses, \nimproving the Group’s resilience and reducing volatility\n\t§ Acquiring Fowlers Asphalting in Victoria’s Gippsland\n\t§ Completing the sale of our Rosehill Asphalt Plant and the \nconstruction of our new world leading replacement plant.\nMany of the activities that Downer’s people perform every \nday have potential risks and ensuring they remain safe is of \nparamount importance. Downer’s Lost Time Injury Frequency \nRate for the year was 0.82 and the Total Recordable Injury \nFrequency Rate was 2.35. Sadly, a long-term Downer employee \nin New Zealand died in May 2022 following a fall at work. \nAlthough the cause of death is not yet known, Downer has \ntreated this as a workplace fatality. Downer operates in sectors \nthat are exposed to high-risk activities and, while we have a \nhistory of strong safety performance, we are determined to learn \nfrom this loss. The health and safety of our people is Downer’s \nnumber one priority.\nThe impact of divestments or acquisitions on executive \nremuneration can be significant. The Board’s overarching \nconcern is to ensure executives:\n\t§ Are accountable for delivery of the annual budget \nand business plan\n\t§ Consider potential acquisition or divestment \nopportunities without the influence of their impact \non remuneration outcomes.\nThe Board’s policy is that:\n\t§ Where a transaction is both material and unbudgeted, \nthe impact of the transaction when calculating the key \nperformance indicators on which executive performance is \nmeasured should be removed. This ensures that executives \nare ‘no better or worse off’ due to the transaction\n\t§ For individually significant items, whether to adjust for their \nimpact (positive or negative) is considered having regard to \nthe circumstances relevant to each.\nIn 2022 the impact of the acquisition of Fowlers Asphalting, the \nexit of the remaining Hospitality contracts, the divestments of \nthe Mining businesses of Otraco and Open Cut Mining East, \nand the gain on the sale of the Rosehill Asphalt Plant have been \nremoved, in line with policy.\n25\nDirectors’ Report     |"

This is consistent with policy and past practice. More detail \ncan be found on these items at section 7.4.2 of this report.\nMost importantly, the Board has assessed the impact of \nCOVID-19 and severe wet weather on executive performance \nKPIs and formed the view that the executive was likely to \nachieve at least target earnings performance in 2022, in the \nabsence of those impacts.\nAfter extensive deliberation of these issues and the Company’s \nfinancial and non-financial performance, the Board determined \nit important and appropriate to exercise discretion and award \nan STI outcome of 65% for the Executives, which is between \nthreshold and target. In keeping with policy, 50% of these \nawards are deferred.\nIn assessing the appropriate level of award the Board has \nbalanced the challenging environment for shareholders and the \nstrong competition for talent and retention across Australia and \nNew Zealand, which is unparalleled in recent years.\nLink between Downer performance and reward outcomes\nDowner’s remuneration framework for key senior employees \nhas been very successful in aligning Downer’s strategy and \nthe creation of alignment between senior executives and \nshareholders.

They are the Remuneration Committee and the Nominations and Corporate \nGovernance Committee.\nThe role of the Remuneration Committee is to review and make recommendations to the Board in relation to executives in \nrespect of:\n\t§ Executive remuneration and incentive policy\n\t§ Remuneration of senior executives of the Company\n\t§ Executive reward and its impact on risk management\n\t§ Executive incentive plans\n\t§ Equity-based incentive plans\n\t§ Superannuation arrangements\n\t§ Recruitment, retention, performance measurement and termination policies and procedures for all Key Management Personnel \nand senior executives reporting directly to the Managing Director\n\t§ Disclosure of remuneration in the Company’s public materials including ASX filings and the Annual Report\n\t§ Retirement payments for all Key Management Personnel and senior executives reporting directly to the Managing Director.\nThe Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for recommending and reviewing remuneration \narrangements for the Executive Director and Non-executive Directors of the Company.\nEach Committee has the authority to engage external professional advisors without seeking approval of the Board or management. \nDuring the reporting period, the Remuneration Committee retained Guerdon Associates Pty Ltd as its advisor. Guerdon Associates \nPty Ltd does not provide services to management and is considered to be independent.\n6.\t Description of Executive Remuneration\n6.1  Executive remuneration structure\nExecutive remuneration has a fixed component and a component that varies with performance.\nThe variable component ensures that a proportion of pay varies with performance. Performance is assessed annually for \nperformance periods covering one year and three years. Payment for performance assessed over one year is an STI. Payment for \nperformance over a three-year period is an LTI.\nIn order for maximum STIs to be awarded, performance must achieve a stretch goal that is a clear margin above the planned budget \nfor the period. This enables the Company to attract and retain better performing executives, and ensures pay outcomes are aligned \nwith shareholder returns.\nTarget STIs are less than the maximum STI. Target STI is payable on achievement of planned objectives. For executives, the target \nSTI is 75% of the maximum STI. The maximum total remuneration that can be earned by an executive is capped. The maximums are \ndetermined as a percentage of fixed remuneration.\nExecutive position\n \nTarget STI\n% of fixed \nremuneration\n \nMaximum STI\n% of fixed\n remuneration\n \nMaximum LTI\n% of fixed\n remuneration\nMaximum total\n performance\n based pay as a\n % of fixed\nremuneration\nManaging Director\n75\n100\n100\n200\nKMP\n56.25\n75\n50\n125\nThe proportions of STI to LTI take into account:\n\t§ Market practice\n\t§ The service period before executives can receive equity rewards\n\t§ The behaviours that the Board seeks to encourage through direct key performance indicators\n\t§ The guideline for the Managing Director to maintain a shareholding as a multiple of pay after long-term incentive rewards \nhave vested.\n32\n|     Downer EDI Limited"

While market levels of \nremuneration are monitored on a regular basis, there is no contractual requirement or expectation that any adjustments will \nbe made.\nNo adjustment has been made to remuneration for the Managing Director since July 2012, other than a voluntary reduction in \nhis fixed remuneration by 50% for the period 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 in recognition of the likely impact of the coronavirus \npandemic on Downer and its people. The funds from this voluntary remuneration reduction, along with contributions from Directors \nand other executives, were used to establish a fund to provide financial assistance to employees experiencing severe hardship.\n6.3  Short-term Incentive\n6.3.1  STI tabular summary\nThe following table outlines the major features of the 2022 STI plan.\nPurpose of STI plan\n\t§ Focus performance on drivers of shareholder value over a 12-month period\n\t§ Improve Zero Harm and people related results\n\t§ Ensure a part of remuneration varies with the Company’s 12-month performance.\nMinimum performance ‘gateway’ \nbefore any payments can \nbe made\nAchievement of a gateway based on budgeted Group NPATA for corporate executives and \nDivision EBITA for divisional heads.\nMaximum STI that can be earned\n\t§ Managing Director: up to 100% of fixed remuneration\n\t§ KMP: up to 75% of fixed remuneration.\nPercentage of STI that can \nbe earned on achieving \ntarget expectations\n75% of the maximum.

The IPM must average 1 across \nall participants\n\t§ Application of an IPM cannot result in an award greater than the maximum STI% level set \nout in section 6.1.\nDiscretion to vary payments\nThe Board, in its discretion, may vary STI payments by up to + or – 100% from the payment \napplicable to the level of performance achieved, up to the maximum for that executive.\nPerformance period\n1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022.\nPerformance assessed\nAugust 2022, following audit of accounts.\nAdditional service period after \nperformance period for payment \nto be made\n50% of the award is deferred with the first tranche of 25% vesting one year following award \nand the second tranche of 25% vesting two years following award.\nPayment timing\nSeptember 2022 for the first cash payment of 50% of the award.

      "text": "Board discretion\nThe Board may exercise discretion to:\n\t§ Reduce partly or fully the value of the deferred components that are due to vest in certain \ncircumstances, including where an executive has acted inappropriately or where the Board \nconsiders that the financial results against which the STI performance measures were tested \nwere incorrect in a material respect or have been reversed or restated\n\t§ Settle deferred components in shares or cash.\nNew recruits\nNew executives (either new starts or promoted employees) are eligible to participate in the \nSTI in the year in which they commence in their position with a pro-rata entitlement.\nTerminating executives\nThere is no STI entitlement where an executive’s employment terminates prior to the end of \nthe financial year. Where an executive’s employment terminates prior to the vesting date, the \nunvested deferred components will be forfeited. However, the Board has retained discretion \nto vest deferred awards, in the form of shares or cash, in their ordinary course where the \nexecutive is judged to be an eligible leaver.\n6.3.2  STI overview\nThe STI plan provides for an annual payment that varies with annual performance. This has been applied to performance measured \nover the Company’s financial year to 30 June 2022.\nThe basis of the plan is designed to align STI outcomes with financial results. No STI is paid unless a minimum profit gateway is \nmet. For corporate executives, the gateway is based on the Group budgeted profit target. For Divisional executives, the gateway \nis based on the Division budgeted profit target. Profit for this purpose is defined as NPATA for Corporate executives and EBITA \nfor Divisional executives. This minimum must be at a challenging level to justify the payment of STI to an executive and deliver an \nacceptable return for the funds employed in running the business. Positive and negative impacts from material but unbudgeted and \nopportunistic transactions are excluded from gateway assessment. Whether to exclude the impact of significant items (positive or \nnegative) is considered on a case by case basis.\nAs noted in section 6.1, the maximum STI that can be earned is capped to minimise excessive risk taking.\nDeferral is a key feature as part of the STI structure. Payment of 50% of the award is made at the time of award in cash and the \nremaining 50% of the award earned is deferred over two years.\nThe first payment of 50% of the award will be in cash after finalisation of the annual audited results. The payment of the deferred \ncomponent of the award will be in the form of two tranches, each to the value of 25% of the award.\nThe deferred components represent an entitlement to cash or shares, subject to the satisfaction of a continued employment \ncondition. The first tranche will vest one year following award and the second tranche will vest two years following award, provided \nan executive remains employed by the Group at the time of vesting.\nThe value of deferred components will generally be settled in shares, net of applicable personal tax. This is designed to encourage \nexecutive share ownership, and not adversely impact executives who have to meet their taxation obligations arising from the \nvesting of the deferred components. However, the Board retains the discretion to vest deferred awards, in the form of shares or \ncash, and will generally have regard to an executive’s individual circumstances and existing level of equity ownership.\nNo dividend entitlements are attached to the deferred components during the vesting period.\nWhere an executive ceases employment with the Group prior to the vesting date, the deferred components will be forfeited. \nHowever, the Board has retained the discretion to vest deferred awards, in the form of shares or cash, in their ordinary course \nwhere the executive is judged to be an eligible leaver.\n6.3.3  How STI payments are assessed\nTarget STI plan percentage  \nof pay\nAn individual’s target incentive under the STI plan is expressed as a percentage of fixed \nremuneration. The STI plan percentage is set according to policy set out in section 6.1.\nOrganisational or divisional \nscorecard result\nAs a principle, ‘target’ achievement would be represented at budget. Thresholds and maximums \nare also set.\nIndividual Performance \nModifier (IPM)\nAt the end of the plan year, eligible employees are provided with an IPM against their key \nperformance indicators and relative performance. Individual key performance indicators are set \nbetween the individual and the Managing Director (if reporting to the Managing Director) or the \nBoard (if the Managing Director) at the start of the performance period. IPMs must average to 1.\nSTI plan incentive calculation\nFixed remuneration x maximum STI plan percentage x scorecard result x IPM.\n34\n|     Downer EDI Limited"

      "text": "6.4.2  LTI overview\nExecutives participate in a LTI plan. This is an equity-based \nplan that provides for a reward that varies with Company \nperformance over three-year measures of performance.\nThree-year measures of performance are considered to be the \nmaximum reasonable time period for setting incentive targets \nfor earnings per share and are generally consistent with market \npractice in the Company’s sector.\nThe payment is in the form of performance rights. The \nperformance rights do not have any dividend entitlements or \nvoting rights. If all the vesting requirements are satisfied, the \nperformance rights will vest and the executives will receive \nshares in the Company or cash at the discretion of the Board.\nThe 2022 LTI represents an entitlement to performance rights \nto ordinary shares exercisable subject to satisfaction of both a \nperformance condition and a continued employment condition. \nGrants will be in three equal tranches, with each tranche subject \nto an independent performance requirement. The performance \nrequirements for each tranche will share two common features:\n\t§ Once minimum performance conditions are met, the \nproportion of performance rights that qualify for vesting \ncommences at 30% and gradually increases pro-rata with \nperformance. This approach provides a strong motivation for \nmeeting minimum performance, but avoids a large ‘cliff’ which \nmay encourage excessive risk taking\n\t§ The maximum reward is capped at a ‘stretch’ performance \nlevel that is considered attainable without excessive \nrisk taking.\nPerformance for the 2022 LTI grants will be measured over \nthe three-year period to 30 June 2024.\nThe proportion of performance rights that can vest will be \ncalculated in August 2024, but executives will be required to \nremain in service until 30 June 2025 to be eligible to receive \nany shares.\nWhere an executive ceases employment with the Group prior \nto the vesting date, the rights will be forfeited. However, the \nBoard will retain the discretion to retain executives in the plan in \ncertain circumstances such as the death, total and permanent \ndisability or retirement of an executive. In these circumstances, \nthe Board will also retain the discretion to vest awards in the \nform of cash.\nAfter vesting, any shares will remain subject to a trading \nrestriction that is governed by the Company’s Securities \nTrading Policy.\nAll unvested performance rights will be forfeited if the Board \ndetermines that an executive has committed an act of fraud, \ndefalcation or gross misconduct or in other circumstances at \nthe discretion of the Board.\n6.4.3  Performance requirements\nOne tranche of performance rights in the 2022 LTI grant will \nqualify for vesting subject to performance relative to other \ncompanies, while the other two tranches of performance rights \nwill qualify for vesting subject to separate, independent absolute \nperformance requirements.\nThe relative performance requirement applicable to the first \ntranche of performance rights is based on total shareholder \nreturn (TSR). TSR is calculated as the difference in share \nprice over the performance period, plus the value of shares \nearned from reinvesting dividends received over this period, \nexpressed as a percentage of the share price at the beginning \nof the performance period. If the TSR for each company in the \ncomparator group is ranked from highest to lowest, the median \nTSR is the percentage return to shareholders that exceeds the \nTSR for half of the comparison companies. The 75th percentile \nTSR is the percentage return required to exceed the TSR for \n75% of the comparison companies.\nPerformance rights in the tranche to which the relative TSR \nperformance requirement applies will vest pro-rata between the \nmedian and 75th percentile. That is, 30% of the tranche vest at \nthe 50th percentile, 32.8% at the 51st percentile, 35.6% at the \n52nd percentile and so on until 100% vest at the 75th percentile.\nThe comparator group for the 2022 LTI grants will be the \ncompanies, excluding financial services companies, in the ASX \n100 index as at the start of the performance period on 1 July \n2021. Consideration has been given to using a smaller group of \ndirect competitors for comparison, however:\n\t§ Limiting the comparator group to a small number of direct \ncompetitors could result in very volatile outcomes from \nperiod to period\n\t§ Management’s strong focus on improving the Company’s \nranking among ASX 100 companies has become embedded \nin Company culture, so reinforcing this rather than trying to \ndislodge it with another focus was considered desirable.\nThe absolute performance requirement applicable to the \nsecond tranche of performance rights is based on Earnings per \nShare (EPS) growth over the three-year performance period to \n30 June 2024. The EPS measure is based on AASB 133 Earnings \nper Share.\nThe tranche of performance rights dependent on the EPS \nperformance condition will vest pro-rata between 5% compound \nannual EPS growth and 10% compound annual EPS growth.\nVesting applies on a pro-rata basis from 30% upon meeting \nthe minimum compound annual EPS growth performance level \nof 5% to 100% at 10% compound annual EPS growth. Capping \nreduces the tendency for excessive risk taking and volatility that \nmay be encouraged if the annual compound EPS growth bar is \nset above 10%.\n38\n|     Downer EDI Limited"

      "text": "The absolute performance requirement applicable to the \nthird tranche of performance rights is based on the Scorecard \ncondition over the three-year performance period to \n30 June 2024.\nThe Scorecard condition is designed to:\n\t§ Strengthen retention through the setting of challenging \ntargets on an annual basis that reflect prevailing market \nconditions, for a portion of LTI awards\n\t§ Align with the STI plan to encourage a long-term approach \nto achieving annual financial performance targets\n\t§ Improve the line of sight for executives so as to increase \nmotivation and focus on consistent performance\n\t§ Focus on performance sustainability through reward of \nconsistent achievement of absolute performance targets \nover the long term.\nThe Scorecard condition is comprised of two independent \nabsolute components of equal weighting. These components \nare based on Group NPATA and Group FFO.\nThe performance of each component will be measured over \nthe three-year period to 30 June 2024.\nNPATA and FFO targets are set at the beginning of each of the \nthree financial years. The performance of each component will \nbe assessed each year relative to the targets. Performance \nof each component will be determined as the average of the \nannual performance assessments for the three years.

This guideline requires that the Managing Director \nholds vested long-term incentive shares equal in value to 100% \nof his fixed remuneration. The Managing Director’s shareholding \nis currently well in excess of the guideline.\nThe guideline requirement has been developed to reinforce \nalignment with shareholder interests. The Remuneration \nCommittee has discretion to allow variations from this \nguideline requirement.\nThe Board retains the right to vary from policy in exceptional \ncircumstances. However, any variation from policy and the \nreasons for it will be disclosed.\n6.5  Treatment of major transactions\nDowner has delivered significant shareholder value through a \nlong history of strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestments. \nOn each occasion, the Board considers the impact of these \ntransactions. Where a transaction is both material and \nunbudgeted, the Board considers whether it is appropriate \nto adjust for its impact on the key performance indicators on \nwhich executive performance is measured. The objective of \nany adjustment is to ensure that opportunities to add value \nthrough an opportunistic divestment or acquisition should \nnot be fettered by consideration of the impact on incentive \npayments. That is, executives should be ‘no better or worse \noff’ as a result of the transaction. No adjustments are made for \nmarket reactions to a transaction as the Board believes that \nmanagement is accountable for those outcomes.\nThe Board considers this approach to be appropriate as it:\n\t§ Ensures that executives and the Board consider these \ntransactions solely based on the best interests of Downer\n\t§ Means executives remain accountable for transaction \nexecution and post-transaction performance from the \nnext budget cycle\n\t§ Ensures that executives complete opportunistic transactions \nthat are in the long-term interests of shareholders\n\t§ Is consistent with the Board’s long-term view when \nconsidering the value of major transactions to \nDowner’s shareholders\n\t§ Ensures Downer remains agile and responsive in managing its \nportfolio by pursuing opportunities as and when they emerge \nrather than being constrained by the annual budget process.\n39\nDirectors’ Report     |"

Each of these items is described \nbelow at sections 7.4.1 and 7.4.2 of this report, along with the impact of the item and effect on remuneration outcomes at \nsection 7.4.3.\n7.4.1  Major transactions\nIn 2022 Downer continued to optimise its portfolio in keeping with its Urban Services strategy through restructuring, partnering, \nacquisition and divestment. \nDowner undertook five major unbudgeted transactions during 2022. These transactions were the acquisition of Fowlers Asphalting, \nthe exit of the Hospitality businesses, the divestments of the Mining businesses of Otraco and Open Cut Mining East, and the sale \nof the Rosehill Asphalt Plant. \nIn accordance with its policy, the Board considered the impact of each major transaction on incentive outcomes and \ndetermined that:\n\t§ The Fowlers Asphalting acquisition was a material, unbudgeted transaction for which it was appropriate to adjust \nincentive outcomes\n\t§ The exit of Hospitality businesses was a material, unbudgeted transaction for which it was appropriate to adjust \nincentive outcomes\n\t§ The divestment of the Otraco business was a material, unbudgeted transaction for which it was appropriate to adjust \nincentive outcomes\n\t§ The divestment of the Open Cut Mining East business was a material, unbudgeted transaction for which it was appropriate \nto adjust incentive outcomes\n\t§ The gain on sale of the Rosehill site was a material, unbudgeted transaction for which it was appropriate to adjust \nincentive outcomes.\n7.4.2  Significant items\nDuring the year, three unbudgeted items had a significant impact. The Board considers such items at the end of each performance \nperiod and whether it is appropriate to adjust for their impact on incentive outcomes.\nThe Board considered it was appropriate to adjust incentive outcomes for the following items:\nItem\nDescription\nFair value adjustment on \nthe Downer Contingent \nShare Options\nIn September 2020, Downer issued contingent share options as part of the consideration for its \nacquisition of the remaining interests in Spotless.\nThe options are required to be remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. For 2022, the options \nwere revalued downwards by $3.7 million post-tax, resulting in an unbudgeted gain.\nIssuing the securities in order to acquire the remaining interests in Spotless was considered to be  \nin the best interests of Downer.\nIt was determined that it was appropriate to adjust incentive outcomes for this item.\nBid costs\nDowner is in the process of tendering for the Queensland Train Manufacturing Program. \nThis opportunity was identified in the business planning process, however crystallised earlier \nthan expected. In order to secure this opportunity, it was necessary to incur bid costs of $12.7 million \n(post-tax $8.9 million) which was unbudgeted in 2022. \nSecuring this opportunity is considered to be in the best interest of Downer. Accordingly, it was \ndetermined that it was appropriate to adjust incentive outcomes for this item.\nCredit risk loss \n– Probuild\nIn November 2018, Downer entered contracts with Probuild Constructions (Australia) Pty Ltd \n(Probuild) for the provision of mechanical and electrical services for the new Victoria Police building \nin Melbourne. On 23 February 2022 Probuild entered voluntary administration and appointed \nan Administrator.\nDowner achieved Practical Completion of its services on 9 July 2020 with the defect liability \nperiod ending on 9 July 2022. There are outstanding claims which are unpaid by Probuild, of which \npost-tax $27.7 million has been recognised by Downer and recovery is now subject to risk due to \nthe administration.\nThe Board determined that no adjustment be made for this item.\n43\nDirectors’ Report     |"

The impact \nof COVID-19 and severe wet weather patterns materially impacted the Company’s financial performance.\nNotwithstanding the difficulties presented during the period our staff and management responded outstandingly in highly \nchallenging circumstances, maximising outcomes for shareholders, protecting not only the performance of the Company but also \nthe communities in which Downer operates, all while delivering quality service outcomes for customers. If not for this ‘above and \nbeyond’ effort, Downer would not be in the strong position it is in today.\nDuring the period the executive team continued to improve the Company by: \n\t§ Completing the exit of the Open Cut Mining East and Otraco businesses, delivering on the strategy to exit capital-intensive \nbusinesses and significantly decreasing the Group’s carbon emissions profile\n\t§ Completing the exit of the Hospitality businesses, improving the Group’s resilience and reducing volatility \n\t§ Acquiring Fowlers Asphalting in Victoria’s Gippsland \n\t§ Completing the sale of our Rosehill Asphalt Plant and the construction of a world-leading replacement plant. \nThe Board assessed the impact of COVID-19 and severe wet weather on executive performance KPIs and formed the view that the \nexecutive was likely to achieve at least target earnings performance in 2022, in the absence of those impacts.\nAfter extensive deliberation of these issues and the Company’s financial and non-financial performance, the Board determined it \nimportant and appropriate to exercise discretion to award an STI outcome of 65% for the executives, which is between threshold \nand target. In keeping with policy, 50% of these awards are deferred.\nIn assessing the appropriate level of award the Board has balanced the challenging environment for shareholders and the strong \ncompetition for talent and retention across Australia and New Zealand, which is unparalleled in recent years.\n7.4.4  Future periods\nFor major transactions completed in 2022, the impact on operational performance is included in the 2023 budget and accordingly \nno adjustments are expected in respect of FY23 operational performance.\n7.5  Variations from policy\nThere were no variations from policy in 2022.\n45\nDirectors’ Report     |"

      "text": "11.\t Description of Non-executive Director Remuneration\n11.1  Non-executive Director remuneration policy\nDowner’s Non-executive Director remuneration policy is to provide fair remuneration that is sufficient to attract and retain Directors \nwith the experience, knowledge, skills and judgement to steward the Company.\nFees for Non-executive Directors are fixed and are not linked to the financial performance of the Company. The Board believes this \nis necessary for Non-executive Directors to maintain their independence.\nNon-executive Directors are not entitled to retirement benefits. Shareholders approved an annual aggregate cap of $2.0 million \nfor Non-executive Director fees at the 2008 AGM. The allocation of fees to Non-executive Directors within this cap has been \ndetermined after consideration of a number of factors, including the time commitment of Directors, the size and scale of the \nCompany’s operations, the skill sets of Board members, the quantum of fees paid to Non-executive Directors of comparable \ncompanies and participation in Board Committee work.\nThe Chairman receives a fee of $410,625 per annum (inclusive of all Committee fees) and superannuation. The other Non-executive \nDirectors each receive a base fee of $164,250 per annum. Additional fees are paid for Committee duties: $35,000 for the chair of the \nAudit and Risk Committee; $27,000 for the chair of each of the Zero Harm Committee and Remuneration Committee, and $17,000 \nfor the chair of the Tender Risk Evaluation Committee.\nThe basis of fees and the fee pool are reviewed when new Directors are appointed to the Board, when the structure of the Board \nchanges, or at least every three years. Reference is made to individual Non-executive Director fee levels and workload (i.e. number \nof meetings and the number of Directors) at comparably sized companies from all industries other than the financial services sector, \nand the fee pools at these companies. In addition, an assessment is made on the extent of flexibility provided by the fee pool to \nrecruit any additional Directors for planned succession after allocation of fees to existing Directors.\nA review of fees was conducted in 2021. The review found that base fees paid to the Chairman and Non-executive Directors \nremained appropriate however fees paid for chairing or serving as a member of a committee were below market levels. Accordingly, \nas foreshadowed in the 2021 Remuneration Report, the following changes in fees were applied from 1 July 2021:\n\t§ Fees set at a fixed value inclusive of superannuation, rather than a fee plus superannuation at the superannuation guarantee rate\n\t§ Increase in the Chairman fees for the Remuneration Committee to $27,000 from $16,425\n\t§ Increase in the Chairman fees for the Zero Harm Committee to $27,000 from $16,425\n\t§ Increase in the Chairman fees for the Tender Risk Evaluation Committee to $17,000 from $16,425\n\t§ Introduction of fees for committee members at the rate of 50% of the respective committee Chairman fee.\n50\n|     Downer EDI Limited"

This results in complex and \njudgemental revenue recognition from \nrendering of services and construction \ncontracts and therefore significant audit \neffort is required to gather sufficient audit \nevidence for revenue recognition. \nWe focused on the Group’s assessment of \nthe following elements of revenue recognition \nfor rendering of services and construction \ncontracts, as applicable: \n• \nRevisions to total expected costs for \ncertain events or conditions occurring \nduring the performance of the contract, or \nare expected to occur to complete the \ncontract, which is difficult to estimate; \n• \nThe Group’s assessment of when a \nmodification to the contract scope and/or \nprice for variations and claims is approved \nand enforceable.

The Group’s \nOur procedures included: \n• \nWe obtained an understanding of the Group’s \nprocess of accounting for rendering of services \nand construction contract revenues. We \nconsidered the appropriateness of the Group’s \naccounting policy for rendering of services and \nconstruction contract revenues, including \nvariations and claims and variable consideration, \nagainst the requirements of the accounting \nstandards. We tested key controls such as: \n- \nManagement’s review and approval of \ninformation for key bids including estimated \nproject milestones, projected Earnings Before \nInterest and Tax (EBIT), Net Present Value \n(NPV), Return On Funds Employed (ROFE), \nand potential legal risks; \n- \nManagement’s review of key contracts where \nevents or conditions have occurred that \nrequire changes to revenue recognition;  \n- \nThe Group’s requirement to obtain customer \nacceptance prior to billing an invoice. \n• \nWe selected a statistical sample of revenue \nrecognised and checked to evidence of the service \nbeing performed such as customer approval.   \n• \nWe used data analytic routines to select a sample \nof contracts for testing based on a number of \nquantitative and qualitative factors.

For the samples selected, where \nrelevant: \n- \nwe read the selected contract terms and \nconditions to evaluate the individual \ncharacteristics of each contract reflected in the \nGroup’s estimate of revenue; \n- \nwe assessed the estimation of total expected \ncosts, including cost contingencies for \ncontracting risks, by challenging the Group’s \nproject and finance managers on their \nestimations. We also checked key forecast \ncost assumptions to independent sources and \nunderlying documentation such as inflation, \nEnterprise Bargaining Agreements for wage \nrates, salary costs and agreements with \nsubcontractors;  \n- \nwe evaluated the Group’s assessment of \nwhen a modification to the contract scope \nand/or price for variations and claims is \napproved and enforceable. This included \nassessing the underlying records, legal \ndocuments, customer correspondence and \ncontracts. We recalculated the amount of \nrevenue using the modified features of the \ncontract. We compared the recalculated \namounts against the amounts recorded by the \nGroup; \n- \nwe assessed the Group’s estimation of the \nhighly probable amount of revenue for \nvariations and claims. This included comparing \nunderlying evidence such as correspondence \nwith customers, and reports from objective \ntime and cost claim experts (where applicable) \nfor consistency with contract terms; \n- \nwe evaluated the Group’s legal and external \nexperts’ reports received on contentious \nmatters to identify conditions indicating \ninappropriate recognition of variations and \nclaims. We checked the consistency of this to \nthe inclusion or not of an amount in the \nestimates used for revenue recognition;"

These \nconditions necessitate additional scrutiny by \nus, in particular to address the objectivity of \nsources used for assumptions, and their \nconsistent application. \nThe significant judgement involved in key \nassumptions required the involvement of \nvaluation specialists to supplement our senior \naudit team members in assessing this key \naudit matter. \nchallenged the Group’s projected cash flows by \ncomparing the budget and business plan to our \nunderstanding of the business. We compared \nactual performance in FY22 to the budget for \nFY23. We also considered the revenue growth rate \nand EBIT margin between FY22 and the terminal \nyear in the models through our sensitivity analysis. \n• \nWe considered the sensitivity of the models by \nvarying key assumptions including revenue growth \nrate and EBIT margin, long-term growth rates and \ndiscount rates, within a reasonably possible range. \nWe considered the interdependencies of key \nassumptions when performing the sensitivity \nanalysis. We did this to identify those CGUs at \nhigher risk of impairment and those assumptions \nat higher risk of bias or inconsistency in application \nto focus our further procedures.    \n• \nWe obtained independent economic views on the \nexpected revenue growth rates for the CGUs in \nthe forecast years to challenge the forecast \ncashflows.  \n• \nFor the Facilities CGU with a higher risk of \nimpairment we performed a range of sensitivity \nanalyses to identify those assumptions at higher \nrisk of bias or inconsistency in application. This \nincluded the discount rate, long-term growth rate, \nrevenue growth rate and EBIT margin. We \nassessed the inclusion of expected tender wins \nand contract renewals by comparing to historical \nwin and renewal rates to inform this testing. We \nconsidered the sensitivity of the models by varying \nkey assumptions within a reasonably possible \nrange. \n• \nWorking with our valuation specialists we: \no \nindependently developed a discount rate \nrange using publicly available market data \nfor comparable entities, adjusted by risk \nfactors specific to the Group and the \nindustry it operates in; and  \no \nindependently assessed the long-term \ngrowth rate for each of the CGUs against \npublicly available data and compared this \nto the Group’s assumption.  \n• \nWe assessed the Group’s disclosures of the \nquantitative and qualitative considerations in \nrelation to the valuation of goodwill, by comparing \nthese disclosures to our understanding and the \nrequirements of the accounting standards."

Other significant accounting policies are contained \nin the notes to the Financial Report to which they relate.\n(i) Principles of consolidation\nThe Financial Report incorporates the financial statements \nof the Company and entities controlled by the Group and its \nsubsidiaries. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed \nto, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with \nthe entity and has the ability to affect those returns from its \ninvolvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those \nreturns through its power over the entity.\nThe Financial Report includes the information and results of \neach subsidiary from the date on which the Company obtains \ncontrol and until such time as the Company ceases to control \nsuch entity.\nIn preparing the Financial Report, all intercompany balances \nand transactions, and unrealised profits arising within the \nconsolidated entity, are eliminated in full.\n(ii) Foreign currency\nTransactions, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign \ncurrencies are translated into Australian dollars at reporting \ndate using the following applicable exchange rates:\nForeign currency amount\nApplicable exchange rate\nTransactions\nDate of transaction\nMonetary assets and liabilities\nReporting date\nNon-monetary assets and  \nliabilities carried at fair value\nDate fair value \nis determined\nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from translation are \nrecognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and \nOther Comprehensive Income, except for qualifying cash flow \nhedges which are deferred to equity.\nOn consolidation the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of \nforeign operations are translated into Australian dollars using \nthe following applicable exchange rates:\nForeign currency amount\nApplicable exchange rate\nIncome and expenses\nAverage exchange rate\nAssets and liabilities\nReporting date\nEquity\nHistorical date\nForeign exchange differences resulting from translation are \ninitially recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve \nand subsequently transferred to the profit or loss on disposal \nof the foreign operation.\n(iii) Finance and borrowing costs\nFinance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwind \nof discounts on provisions, cost to establish financing facilities \n(which are expensed over the term of the facility), losses on \nineffective hedging instruments that are recognised in profit \nor loss and finance lease charges."

Segment information\nIdentification of reportable segments\nAn operating segment is a component of an entity that engages \nin business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur \nexpenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the \nGroup’s chief operating decision maker in order to effectively \nallocate Group resources and assess performance.\nThe Group has identified its operating segments based on the \ninternal reports that are reviewed and used by the Group CEO \nin assessing performance and in determining the allocation \nof resources. The operating segments are identified by the \nGroup based on the nature of the services provided. Discrete \nfinancial information about each of these operating businesses \nis reported to the Group CEO on a recurring basis.\nThe reportable segments are based on a combination of \noperating segments determined by the similarity of the services \nprovided, the sources of the Group’s major risks that could \ntherefore have the greatest effect on the rates of return and \ntheir quantitative contribution to the Group’s results.\nDuring the year, the composition of business units within \noperating segments were realigned to better reflect how the \nGroup’s chief operating decision maker assesses performance \nand allocates Group resources. As a result, the Asset Services \nbusiness unit (previously reported as part of the Engineering, \nConstruction and Maintenance (EC&M) segment) was \nreallocated to the Facilities segment. The Mining business unit \n(previously a separate reportable segment) and the Engineering \nand Construction business unit (previously reported as part \nof the EC&M segment), have been included within All other \nsegments following the reduction in their contribution to the \nGroup’s performance following divestments and wind-down of \ncontracts. The new structure aligns the segment reporting with \nDowner’s end markets and management reporting structure.\nThe Group has restated the previously reported segment \ninformation for the year ended 30 June 2021."

Revenue is measured \nat the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. \nDetermining the timing of the transfer of control – at a point in \ntime or over time – requires judgement. Revenue is recognised \nif it meets the criteria below.\n(i) Rendering of services\nThe Group primarily generates service revenue from the \nfollowing activities:\n\t§ Maintenance and management of transport infrastructure\n\t§ Utilities infrastructure maintenance services (gas, power \nand water)\n\t§ Maintenance and installation of infrastructure in the \ntelecommunications sector\n\t§ Industrial plant maintenance\n\t§ Rollingstock maintenance and rail asset \nmanagement services\n\t§ Engineering and consultancy services\n\t§ Facilities management\n\t§ Contract mining services, mining assets maintenance \nservices, tyre management and blasting.\nTypically, under the performance obligations of service \ncontracts, the customer consumes and receives the benefit \nof the service as it is provided. As such, service revenue is \nrecognised over time as the services are provided.\n(ii) Construction contracts\nThe contractual terms and the way in which the Group operates \nits construction contracts are predominantly derived from \nprojects containing one performance obligation. Under these \nperformance obligations, customers either simultaneously \nreceive and consume the benefits as the Group performs them \nor performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer \ncontrols as the asset is created or enhanced. Therefore, \ncontracted revenue is recognised over time based on stage \nof completion of the contract.\n(iii) Sale of goods\nRevenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer \nobtains control of goods.\n(iv) Other revenue\nOther revenue primarily includes rental income.\n(v) Other income\nOther income primarily includes insurance recoveries, \ngovernment grants and gains on sale of property, plant \nand equipment.\nInsurance recoveries relate to insurance refunds received \nfor claims lodged that met the recoverability criteria of being \n‘virtually certain’ following confirmation of indemnity received \nfrom insurers.\nGovernment grants relate to income received under the \nNew Zealand Government’s Wage Subsidy Scheme, COVID \nleave support scheme available to eligible businesses that were \nadversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as in \nrelation to the New Zealand Government’s apprentice boost \nscheme. The Group elects to present these subsidies in ‘Other \nincome’ as allowed under AASB 120 Accounting for Government \ngrants and disclosure of Government assistance."

      "text": "73\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements     |\nGain on sale of property, plant and equipment primarily relates \nto the compulsory acquisition of Downer’s land at Rosehill. \nFor more details, see Note B3.\nContract modifications\nFor services and construction contracts, revenue from variations \nand claims is recognised to the extent they are approved or \nenforceable under the contract. The amount of revenue is then \nrecognised to the extent it is highly probable that a significant \nreversal of revenue will not occur.\nIn making this assessment, the Group considers a number \nof factors including nature of the claim, formal or informal \nacceptance by the customer of the validity of the claim, stage \nof negotiations, or the historical outcome of similar claims \nto determine whether the enforceable and ‘highly probable’ \nthreshold has been met.\nRevenue in relation to modifications, such as a change in the \nscope of the contract, will only be included in the transaction \nprice when it is approved by the parties to the contract or the \nmodification is enforceable and the amount becomes highly \nprobable. Modifications may also be recognised when client \ninstruction has been received in line with customary business \npractice for the customer.\nContract costs (tender costs)\nCosts incurred during the tender/bid process are expensed, \nunless they are incremental to obtaining the contract and \nthe Group expects to recover those costs or where they are \nexplicitly chargeable to the customer regardless of whether \nthe contract is obtained.\nPerformance obligations and contract duration\nRevenue is allocated to each performance obligation and \nrecognised as the performance obligation is satisfied which \nmay be at a point in time or over time.\nAASB 15 requires a granular approach to identify the different \nrevenue streams (i.e. performance obligations) in a contract by \nidentifying the different activities that are being undertaken \nand then aggregating only those where the different activities \nare significantly integrated or highly interdependent. Revenue \nwill be recognised, on certain contracts over time, as a single \nperformance obligation when the services are part of a series \nof distinct goods and services that are substantially integrated \nwith the same pattern of transfer.\nAASB 15 provides guidance in respect of the term over which \nrevenue may be recognised and is limited to the period for \nwhich the parties have enforceable rights and obligations. When \nthe customer can terminate a contract for convenience (without \na substantive penalty), the contract term and related revenue is \nlimited to the termination period.\nThe Group has elected to apply the practical expedient to \nnot adjust the total consideration over the contract term for \nthe effect of a financing component if the period between \nthe transfer of services to the customer and the customer’s \npayment for these services is expected to be one year or less.\nMeasure of progress\nThe Group recognises revenue using the measure of progress \nthat best reflects the Group’s performance in satisfying \nthe performance obligation within the contracts over time. \nThe different methods of measuring progress include an \ninput method (e.g. costs incurred) or an output method (e.g. \nmilestones reached). The same method of measuring progress \nwill be consistently applied to similar performance obligations.\nVariable consideration\nVariable consideration that is contingent on the Group’s \nperformance, including key performance payments, liquidated \ndamages and abatements that offset revenue under the \ncontract, is recognised only when it is highly probable that \na reversal of that revenue will not occur.\nIn addition, where the identified revenue stream is determined \nto be a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially \nthe same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the \ncustomer (e.g. maintenance services), variable consideration is \nrecognised in the period/(s) in which the series of distinct goods \nor services subject to the variable consideration are completed.\nLoss-making contracts\nLoss-making contracts are recognised under AASB 137 \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets \nas onerous contracts.\nKey estimate and judgement: Revenue recognition\nStage of completion\nDetermining the stage of completion requires an estimate of expenses incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs.\nModifications\nWhen a contract modification exists and the Group has an approved enforceable right to payment, revenue in relation to claims \nand variations is only included in the transaction price when the amount claimable becomes highly probable. Management uses \njudgement in determining whether an approved enforceable right exists.\nVariable consideration\nDetermining the amount of variable consideration requires an estimate based on either the ‘expected value’ or the ‘most likely \namount’. The estimate of variable consideration can only be recognised to the extent it is highly probable that a significant \nrevenue reversal will not occur in future.\nChanges in these estimates or judgements could have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group."

The fair value at \nissue date of these options was recognised as a liability arising \non the acquisition of the shares. The DCSO are classified as a \nliability, with subsequent changes in the fair value recognised \nin the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other \nComprehensive Income. Since 30 June 2021, the fair value \nof the DCSO has decreased by $3.7 million, which has been \nrecognised in ‘Other income’ in the Consolidated Statement \nof Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income during \nthe year. This income is primarily driven by the decrease in \nDowner’s share price from $5.59 at 30 June 2021 to $5.05 \nat 30 June 2022.\nDivestments and exit costs\nThe divestment program has been completed following the \ndisposal of Otraco on 1 December 2021, the sale of Open Cut \nMining East (OCE) on 17 December 2021, and the exit from a \nnumber of Hospitality contracts. Assets previously utilised by \nthose businesses which will no longer be utilised by the Group \nhave been written off. The material elements of divestment and \nexit costs include:\n\t§ $17.3 million net pre-tax loss (including disposal costs) from \nthe disposal of Otraco and OCE. Refer to Note F6.\n\t§ $58.5 million pre-tax exit costs, relating to impairments of IT \ninfrastructure and applications ($25.5 million), impairment of \nright-of-use assets and leasehold improvements for leased \nproperties ($13.3 million); and inventory write-offs and other \nexit costs totalling $19.7 million.\n\t§ A net income tax benefit of $5.0 million arising on divestment \nand exit costs. This is comprised of an income tax benefit \nof $22.6 million on divestment costs offset in part by \nincome tax expense of $17.6 million on derecognition of \ndeferred tax balances in the AE Smith Construction tax-\nconsolidated group due to a change in strategic direction \nof these companies.\nPortfolio restructure costs\nAs a result of the divestment program, Downer has reduced \nmanagement overhead with restructuring costs of $7.6 million \nexpensed during the year.\nProbuild credit loss\nIn November 2018, the Group entered into contracts with \nProbuild Constructions (Australia) Pty Ltd (Probuild) as a \nsubcontractor for the provision of mechanical and electrical \nservices for the new Victoria Police building in Melbourne. On \n23 February 2022 Probuild entered into voluntary administration \nand appointed an Administrator. The Practical Completion of \nservices was achieved on 9 July 2020.\nThere are outstanding claims which are unpaid by Probuild, \nof which approximately $29.4 million had previously been \nrecognised as a contract asset by the Group. Recovery is now \nsubject to risk due to the administration. The total expense \nrecognised in the year of $34.6 million includes the impairment \nof this contract asset, trade receivables balances as well as legal \ncosts incurred.\nThe net income tax benefit arising on the Probuild credit loss \nis $6.9 million. No income tax benefit has been recognised on \nunrecoverable Probuild costs in the AE Smith Construction tax-\nconsolidated group as a consequence of the change in strategic \ndirection of these companies."

The Group’s \naccounting policy had historically been to capitalise costs \nrelated to the configuration and customisation of SaaS \narrangements as intangible assets in the Statement of \nFinancial Position.\nDowner used SaaS across a range of businesses and functions. \nFollowing the adoption of the above IFRIC agenda decision, \ncurrent SaaS arrangements were identified and assessed \nto determine if the Group has control of the software. For \nthose arrangements where control does not exist, the Group \nderecognised the intangible previously capitalised. The \nadoption of the above agenda decisions has resulted in \nrecognition of costs to configure SaaS arrangements as a pre-\ntax expense of $14.0 million in the Consolidated Statement of \nProfit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income in the year.\nFollowing the implementation of the IFRIC interpretation around \nSaaS arrangements in FY21, the interpretation now forms part \nof the Group’s recurring accounting treatment for these costs \n(refer to Note C7).\nB4.

      "text": "83\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements     |\nThe Group has policies to manage its overall exposure to credit \nrisk as set out in Note G2(e).\nIn assessing lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) as at 30 June \n2022, the Group has considered the risk arising from the \neconomic impacts of COVID-19 and potential defaults occurring \nwithin the smaller construction environment in which Downer \noperates. The Group has assessed ECLs by segmenting the \nportfolio of trade receivables and contract assets by customer \n(i.e. Government and Private) as well as by geography to better \nassess inherent credit risk. The Company defines counterparties \nas ‘Government’ if the contract is with a Federal, State or Local \nGovernment body. Any counterparties other than those defined \nas ‘Government’ are classified as ‘Private’, and includes sectors \nheavily regulated by Government organisations (such as Gas \nand Electricity), Blue-Chip listed companies, contracts run \nunder the Public-Private-Partnership model ((PPPs) for which \nGovernment organisations are often the end customer), large \nmultinational companies, network infrastructure companies, as \nwell as other private sector businesses.\nThe credit risk associated with Government balances is \nconsidered to be negligible (2021: negligible) due to the high \ncreditworthiness of the counterparties. No ‘Government’ related \nbalances are currently in default.\nFor ‘Private’ balances, the Group has assessed the potential \ncredit risk of default on key customers utilising credit ratings \nprovided by financial institutions. For those ‘Private’ receivables/ \ncontract assets that are ultimately backed by the Government \nor a Government body, the credit risk is considered to be low or \nnegligible. For those counterparties that are currently in default \nor a risk of default is determined, the Group has recognised \nspecific impairment/credit allowances. As at 30 June 2022, \nthe $32.4 million loss allowance includes a specific provision of \n$29.4 million in relation to Probuild Pty Ltd as this customer is \ncurrently under administration.\nThe ECLs have decreased from $7.4 million at 30 June 2021 \nto $2.6 million at 30 June 2022 reflecting a lower credit risk in \nthe current portfolio of trade receivables and contract assets, \ndetermined based on the above methodology and in reference \nto past default experience.\nCredit losses on ‘Private’ counterparty balances have historically \naveraged less than 1%. The allowance for credit losses, \nexcluding specific provisions, is 0.3% (2021: 0.6%) of the trade \nreceivables and contract assets.\nRemaining performance obligations\nAs of 30 June 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction \nprice allocated to the remaining performance obligations \nis $15,973.1 million (2021: $13,572.6 million). The Group will \nrecognise this revenue when the performance obligations \nare satisfied. Approximately ~40% of remaining performance \nobligations are expected to occur within the next five years; \nwith the remaining ~60% related to long-term service/\nmaintenance contracts ranging up to 40 years.\nThe remaining performance obligations balances for both \n30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021 presented above relate to the \nrevenue expected to be recognised from ongoing contracts with \nan expected duration of more than 12 months.\nDuring the current financial year revenue of $2,696.3 million has \nbeen recognised in relation to performance obligations satisfied \nor partially satisfied in previous periods.\nRecognition and measurement\nTrade receivables\nTrade receivables and other receivables are initially recognised \nat fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the \neffective interest rate method, less an allowance for impairment.\nContract assets\nContract assets primarily relate to the Group’s rights to \nconsideration for work performed but not billed at the reporting \ndate. The contract assets are transferred to trade receivables \nwhen the rights have become unconditional. This usually \noccurs when the Group issues an invoice in accordance with \ncontractual terms to the customer.\nPayments from customers are received based on a billing \nschedule/milestone basis, as established in our contracts.\nCosts to obtain or fulfil contracts\nCosts incremental to obtaining a contract and that are expected \nto be recovered or are explicitly chargeable to the customer \nregardless of whether the contract is obtained are capitalised.\nFinancial assets and liabilities\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) contains a classification \nand measurement approach for financial assets that reflects \nthe business model in which assets are managed and their cash \nflow characteristics.\nAASB 9 contains three principal classification categories for \nfinancial assets: measured at amortised cost, fair value through \nother comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through \nprofit or loss (FVTPL).\nFair value\nDue to the short-term nature of these financial rights, the \ncarrying amounts of the trade receivables and contract assets \nare estimated to represent their fair values."

Trade receivables and contract assets – continued \nRecognition and measurement – continued \nImpairment\nThe Group has applied the simplified approach to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables, contract assets \nand finance lease receivables as permitted by AASB 9.\nThe Group considers the relevant credit risk associated with disaggregated portions of the financial assets and after considering \nspecific provisions against counterparties and defaults, applies an expected credit loss (ECL) percentage derived from recorded \nhistoric credit losses associated with specific population. The key disaggregation of the balances is between those that are backed \nby Government funding and those that are not and between those that are current or are overdue less than 90 days or become \nmore than 90 days overdue. The Group exercises considerable judgement about how economic factors (such as the economic \nimpact triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic) affect the ECL of each of the disaggregated balances independently, and applies a \npremium as deemed appropriate to adjust the historically determined default rates to present the total expected credit losses on \nthe current balances.\nThis impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI (except for investments in equity instruments).\nKey estimate and judgement: Credit risk\nCredit risk represents the risk that a counterparty will fail to perform an obligation causing a financial loss to the Group. The \nGroup minimises credit risk by undertaking transactions with a large number of customers in various industries and geographical \nareas. A credit risk management policy is in place and exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.\nThe Group uses historical information as a basis for the estimation of expected credit losses and then adjusts its assessment \nof credit risk based on current macro/micro-economic conditions; however, judgement is applied in doing this assessment.\nC3.

The cost represents the excess of the cost of a business \ncombination over the fair value of the identifiable assets, \nliabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.\nCustomer contracts and relationships on acquisition\nCustomer contracts and relationships acquired as part of \na business combination are recognised separately from \ngoodwill and are carried at fair value at date of acquisition \nless accumulated amortisation and any accumulated \nimpairment losses.\nBrand names on acquisition\nBrand names acquired as part of a business combination are \nrecognised separately from goodwill and are carried at fair value \nat date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and any \naccumulated impairment losses.\nIntellectual property on acquisition\nIntellectual property acquired as part of a business combination \nis recognised separately from goodwill and is carried at fair \nvalue at date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and \nany accumulated impairment losses.\nIntellectual property, software and system development\nIntangible assets acquired by the Group, including intellectual \nproperty (purchased patents and trademarks) and software \nare initially recognised at cost, and subsequently measured at \ncost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. \nInternally developed systems are capitalised once the project is \nassessed to be feasible. The costs capitalised include consulting \nand direct labour costs. Costs incurred in determining project \nfeasibility are expensed as incurred.\nSoftware-as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements\nSaaS arrangements are service contracts providing the Group \nwith the right to access the cloud provider’s application software \nover the contract period. As such the Group does not receive a \nsoftware intangible asset at the contract commencement date.\nFor SaaS arrangements, the Group assesses if the contract will \nprovide a resource that it can ‘control’ to determine whether \nan intangible asset is present. If the Group cannot determine \ncontrol of the software, the arrangement is deemed a service \ncontract and any implementation costs including costs to \nconfigure or customise the cloud provider’s application software \nare recognised as operating expenses when incurred.\nAmortisation\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a \nstraight-line basis over their useful lives. The estimated useful \nlives are generally:\nItem\nUseful life\nCustomer contracts and relationships\n1-20 years\nBrand names\n20 years\nIntellectual property acquired\n15-20 years\nSoftware and system development\n5-15 years\nOther intangible assets\n20 years\nThe estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed \nat the end of each annual reporting period.\nImpairment of assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful \nlife are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if \nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that they might \nbe impaired.\nOther assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or \nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount \nmay not be recoverable.\nAn impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which \nthe asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. \nFor the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped \nat the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable \ncash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows \nfrom other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units or \nCGUs). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered \nimpairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment \nat each reporting date."

Intangible assets – continued\nAllocation of goodwill to Groups of \nCash-Generating Units\nGoodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes \nto Groups of CGUs that represent the lowest level within \nthe Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal \nmanagement purposes.\nThe final stage of the Spotless integration into the Group \noccurred on 1 July 2021 which enabled a number of operational \nchanges and business unit structures to be reorganised.\nThis restructure impacted the Group’s internal reporting \nstructure and the level at which performance and goodwill is \nmonitored. This has resulted in a change to the manner in which \nimpairment testing of goodwill has been performed.\nThe Group has reassessed its Groups of CGUs with five Groups \nof CGUs (previously eight) identified.\nThe goodwill allocation to each of the Groups of CGUs \n(hereafter ‘CGUs’) is presented below:\nCarrying value of \nconsolidated goodwill\n2022\n$’m \n2021\nrestated(i)\n$’m \nTransport Australia\n435.8 \n428.0 \nRail and Transit Systems \n55.3 \n55.3 \nUtilities Australia\n294.4 \n294.4 \nNew Zealand\n193.1 \n196.7 \nFacilities\n1,306.4 \n1,306.4 \n2,285.0 \n2,280.8 \n(i) \t FY21 goodwill has been reallocated to reflect the changes to the CGUs.\nKey estimates and judgements:\nImpairment of assets\nDetermination of potential impairment requires an estimation \nof the recoverable amount of the CGUs to which the goodwill \nand intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are allocated. \nKey assumptions requiring judgement include projected cash \nflows, discount rates, budgeted revenue growth rate and \nEBIT margin, and the long-term growth rate.\nEstimation of useful life\nThe estimation of the economic useful life of software is \ninitially determined based on historical experience. The \nuseful lives of intangible assets recognised on business \ncombinations is independently determined based on detailed \nreviews of similar assets and underlying factors. These useful \nlives are regularly reassessed for indicators of any change \nto the initial assessments. If the economic useful lives are \ndetermined to have changed, the amortisation of the assets \nis adjusted to reflect the new expected useful life, impacting \nthe future amortisation recognised.\nRecoverable amount testing\nThe recoverable amount of the identified CGUs has been \nassessed using the higher of ‘value in use’ (VIU) and ‘fair value \nless cost of disposal’ (FVLCD). For each CGU, this has resulted \nin a ‘value in use’ methodology being used.\nValue in use calculation\nIn assessing VIU, the estimated future cash flows are discounted \nto their present value using a discount rate that uses current \nmarket assessments of the time value of money and the risks \nspecific to the CGU.\nThe Group determines the recoverable amount, using three-\nyear cash flow projections based on the FY23 budget and the \nbusiness plans for the years ending 30 June 2024 and 2025 (as \napproved by the Board). For FY26 onwards, the Group assumes \na long-term growth rate of 2.5% to reflect the organic growth \nexpectations of the industry.\nCash flow projections are determined utilising budgeted \nEarnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) less tax, capital \nmaintenance spending and working capital changes, adjusted \nto exclude any uncommitted restructuring costs and future \nbenefits to provide a ‘free cash flow’ estimate. This calculated \n‘free cash flow’ is then discounted to its present value using a \npost-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments \nof the time value of money and the risks specific to the \nasset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not \nbeen adjusted."

Those with a higher \nproportion of the customer base being Government Agencies \nor Government-owned corporations in the provision of critical \nservices were the least impacted and include businesses within \nthe Transport Australia and Rail and Transit Systems CGUs, in \naddition to the Facilities Management (Government and Health \n& Education) businesses within the Facilities CGU. The Utilities \nAustralia CGU was modestly impacted by COVID-19 in FY22, \nmost notably within the Meter Reading and Water Services \nbusinesses. New Zealand was more materially impacted due to \nthe extent of lockdowns across the country, whilst the Facilities \nCGU also experienced meaningful impacts in Hospitality \nand Asset Services due to event cancellations and deferred \nmaintenance expenditure.\nThe business plans for FY24 onwards assume no material \nCOVID-19 disruptions.\nInflation and price escalation\nThe Group’s exposure to inflationary pressures in labour, \nmaterial and other costs in its long-term services contracts is \nmitigated via contractual mechanisms and allowances for price \nmovements. These mechanisms typically include one of, or \nmultiple of, the following: consumer price index, labour index, \nrelevant materials indices (such as bitumen) or contractual price \nrebasing at select intervals. In addition, the Group has a number \nof ‘cost-plus’ reimbursable contracts where inflation does not \nrepresent a risk. \nOngoing cash flow forecasts\nThe cash flow projections through to the terminal year are \nbased on the Group’s past experience and assessment of \neconomic and regulatory factors affecting the business in which \nthe Downer businesses operate. Specifically, for each CGU:\n\t§ Transport Australia is expected to benefit from activity/\nvolume growth in road infrastructure post the impact of \nsevere wet weather in FY22 and from increased Government \ninvestment in Western Melbourne and Western Sydney as \nwell as in regional Australia.\n\t§ Rail and Transit Systems is expected to benefit from new \nopportunities on rail fleet extensions and maintenance \ncontracts, increased work opportunities in Queensland and \nfrom emerging trends on energy consumption and energy \nsaving initiatives across rail and transit system sectors.\n\t§ Utilities Australia is expected to benefit from an increase in \nactivity from existing customers in the wireless programs and \nin the water sector including increased levels of activity in \nmaintenance work contracts."

The Group assumes a long-term growth rate of \n2.50% (FY21: 2.25%) to allow for organic growth on the existing \nasset base. The increase in the rate is in line with economic \nconditions and ending of a sustained period of suppressed \ninflation rates.\n(iii) Discount rates\nPost-tax discount rates of between 8.5% and 8.9% reflect \nthe Group’s estimate of the time value of money and risks \nassociated with each CGU.\nIn determining the appropriate discount rate for each CGU, \nconsideration has been given to the estimated weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC) for the Group adjusted for \ncountry and business risks specific to that CGU. The post-tax \ndiscount rate is applied to post-tax cash flows that include \nan allowance for tax based on the respective jurisdiction’s tax \nrate.

Based on the modelling \nand analysis performed utilising a ‘value in use’ model, the \nrecoverable amount of the Facilities CGU is expected to be \ngreater than its carrying value.\nManagement has identified that a reasonably possible \nunfavourable change in the three-year compound annual \nrevenue growth rate, EBIT margin assumption, long-term \nterminal growth rate and discount rate assumptions, in isolation, \nand in the absence of any mitigating factors or unchanged \ncircumstances, would result in the carrying value of the Facilities \nCGU becoming equal to the recoverable amount.\nThe following table shows the approximate individual change in \nkey assumptions under a downside sensitivity scenario for the \nestimated recoverable amount of the Facilities CGU to be equal \nto the carrying amount.\nIndividual changes in key assumptions  \nthat would result in nil headroom\nDecrease in assumed revenue or \nEBIT margin percentage\n(8.7%)\nDecrease in long-term growth rate \nfrom 2.5% to 1.6%\nIncrease in the post-tax discount rate \nfrom 8.7% to 9.3%\nOther than as disclosed above the Group believes that for all \nCGUs, any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions \nwould not cause the carrying value of the CGUs to exceed their \nrecoverable amounts."

      "text": "93\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements     |\nImpact of climate change\nThe Group recognises that an integrated approach to managing \nrisks and opportunities is essential. The Downer Board, through \nits oversight functions, has ensured Downer appropriately \nconsiders Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks, \nincluding those related to climate change. Climate-related \nrisks and opportunities are incorporated into Downer’s broader \ncorporate strategy, planning and risk management processes. \nThis includes through the development of decarbonisation \nstrategies, plans to mitigate exposure to physical and transition \nrisks, and consideration of embedding emissions reduction \ntargets into capital allocation and decision-making process.\nDowner is committed to decarbonising its operations, \nrecognising the need to develop emissions reduction targets \nthat align with the 2015 Paris Agreement goals to pursue efforts \nto limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C by the end of this \ncentury. To guide its ambition, Downer has set an absolute \nnear-term target of 50% reduction of its Scope 1 and 2 GHG \nemissions by 2032 and an absolute near-term target of 30% \nreduction of its Scope 3 emissions by 2032. Downer has set \na long-term target to be Net Zero1 in Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG \nemissions by 2050, subject to future available technologies. \nBoth the near-term and the long-term targets have a base year \nof 2020.\nIn FY22, Downer completed a detailed review of its most \nmaterial climate-related risks and opportunities in line with \nthe Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures \n(TCFD), building on the work that Downer completed and \ndisclosed through the Downer Sustainability Report in 2019. \nThere remains uncertainty regarding the pace of global and \nlocal efforts to decarbonise, the economic and policy tools \nwhich may be used by governments and regulators, customer \nrequirements, and the technology available to be applied. \nTherefore, Downer undertook scenario analysis to test the \nresilience of its business strategy, leveraging prioritised climate \nrelated risk and opportunities. In addition, the scenario analysis \nwas used to assess and quantify the estimated financial impact \nof different climate scenarios across Downer’s operations and \nvalue chain, including potential mitigation costs arising from \nphysical and transition risks, and the opportunities arising from \nnew and existing business lines.\nTo assess the physical risks, Downer used a moderate emission \nscenario (rise between 2°C and 3°C by 2100) and a high \nemission scenario (rise above 4°C by 2100). To assess the \ntransition risk, Downer chose two of the Network for Greening \nthe Financial System (NGFS) 1.5°C aligned scenarios consisting \nof the Net Zero 20502 scenario and the Divergent Net Zero3 \nscenario. The NGFS climate scenarios have been selected \nto provide insights into the risks and opportunities of the \ntransition to a low carbon future. The NGFS dataset contains \n1\t\nNet Zero is defined as the mitigation of direct emissions to as low a level as possible and offsetting the remainder through carbon removals. Downer has utilised the \nScience Based Target Initiative’s threshold of a 90% reduction in its emissions as being ‘as low a level as possible’.\n2\t\nNGFS Net Zero 2050 is an ambitious scenario that limits global warming to 1.5°C through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching net zero CO2 emissions \naround 2050. This scenario assumes that ambitious climate policies are introduced immediately.\n3\t\nNGFS Divergent Net Zero reaches net zero by 2050 but with higher costs due to divergent policies introduced across sectors and a quicker phase out of fossil fuels. \nThis scenario differentiates itself from the Net Zero 2050 by assuming that climate policies are more stringent in the transportation and buildings sectors, while \ndecarbonisation of energy supply and industry is less stringent.\nmultiple parameters (e.g. emissions trajectory, carbon price \nand fuel mix) at the sub sectoral and country levels for each of \nthe geographies being investigated, allowing the comparison \nof difference across geographies within the same plausible \nfuture scenario.\nNot all assumptions used in scenario modelling (for TCFD \npurposes) are appropriate for incorporation in impairment \nmodels required by accounting standards. The modelled \nscenarios set out below were not included in the Group’s \nimpairment model assumptions relating to asset values \nor cashflow. \nThe scenario analysis performed considered the following \nimpacts to asset values and cashflows:\n\t§ Physical risks to Downer’s non-current assets, including key \nsites and locations, from events such as extreme heat, an \nincreased frequency and severity of bushfires, and severe \nweather events. The scenario analysis quantified a physical \nrisk which is not material to the Group’s future cashflows. \nThe analysis confirmed no change to the expected useful \neconomic lives of non-current assets as disclosed in Note C5. \n\t§ Transition risks are primarily associated with decarbonising \nDowner’s carbon intensive non-current assets, in the \nTransport CGU’s asphalt manufacturing process, and \ntransitioning from internal combustion engine to an electric \none for the light and heavy vehicle fleets. The analysis \ndetermined that the impact of decarbonising the asphalt \nplants through energy efficiency measures, using alternate \nor emerging fuels, or new technology, is not expected to \nmaterially impact the Group’s forecast cash flows.\n\t§ Light vehicle fleet replacement from internal combustion \nengines to electric vehicles is anticipated to occur from \n2025 onwards, with heavy vehicle replacements anticipated \nto commence from 2030 onwards. Management continues \nto assess options for fleet replacement in the short term; \nhowever, any acceleration from these dates is limited by \ntechnology and global supply constraints.\nThe modelled impact is not material to the Group’s cashflows, \nwith the analysis reaffirming that the anticipated response to \nclimate change presents a net opportunity for Downer. This \nnet opportunity is likely to increase as efforts to decarbonise \naccelerate, due to the significant opportunities for Downer’s \nbusiness lines to support both new and existing customers’ \ndecarbonisation transitions."

These balances were subject \nto an independent actuarial review as at 30 June 2022.\nThe main movements during the year were $1.6 million of services costs expensed to the profit or loss, $6.8 million of actuarial gains \non the obligation, and the Group contributions of $1.1 million (all pre-tax amounts).\nKey actuarial assumptions used in determining the values were a discount rate of 4.4% and an expected salary increase rate of \n3.0%. Sensitivity analysis shows a 0.5 percentage point reduction in the discount rate would increase the obligation by 4.2% and \n0.5 percentage point increase in the expected salary increase rate would increase the obligation by 3.6%.\nKey estimate and judgement: Valuation of the defined benefit plan assets and obligations\nThere are a number of estimates and assumptions used in determining the defined benefit plan assets, obligations and \nexpenses. These include salary increases, future earnings, and the returns on fund investments. Any difference in these \nassumptions or estimates will be recognised in other comprehensive income and not through the income statement. The net of \nthe plan assets and obligations recognised in the statement of financial position will be affected by any movement in the returns \non the investment or the rate of interest.\nD3.

The cost of these transactions is recognised \nin profit or loss and credited to equity over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the \nnumber of rights that are expected to vest for service and non-market performance conditions. The expense recognised each year \ntakes into account the most recent estimate.\nThe fair value at grant date is independently determined using an option pricing model and takes into account any market related \nperformance conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are not considered when determining value; however they are included in \nassumptions about the number of rights that are expected to vest.\nCash-settled transactions\nThe amount payable to employees in respect of cash-settled share-based payments is recognised as an expense, with a \ncorresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the payment. \nThe liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date based on the fair value, with any changes in the liability \nbeing recognised in profit or loss.\nD4.

Financing facilities – continued \nCovenants on financing facilities\nDowner Group’s financing facilities contain undertakings \nto comply with financial covenants and ensure that Group \nguarantors of these facilities collectively meet certain \nminimum threshold amounts of Group EBITA and Group Total \nTangible Assets.\nThe main financial covenants which the Group is subject to are \nNet Worth, Interest Service Coverage and Leverage.\nFinancial covenants testing is undertaken monthly and reported \nat the Downer Board meetings. Reporting of financial covenants \nto financiers occurs semi-annually for the rolling 12-month \nperiods to 30 June and 31 December. Downer Group was in \ncompliance with all its financial covenants as at 30 June 2022.\nBank guarantees and insurance bonds\nThe Group has $1,964.7 million of bank guarantee and \ninsurance bond facilities to support its contracting activities. \n$1,064.1 million of these facilities are provided to the Group on a \ncommitted basis and $900.6 million on an uncommitted basis.\nThe Group’s facilities are provided by a number of banks and \ninsurance companies on an unsecured and revolving basis. \n$1,372.9 million (refer to Note C9) of these facilities were utilised \nas at 30 June 2022 with $591.8 million unutilised. These facilities \nhave varying maturity dates between financial years 2023, 2024 \nand 2025.\nThe underlying risk being assumed by the relevant financier \nunder all bank guarantees and insurance bonds is corporate \ncredit risk rather than project-specific risk.\nThe Group has flexibility in respect of certain committed facility \namounts (shown as part of the unutilised bilateral loan facilities) \nwhich can, at the election of the Group, be utilised to provide \nadditional bank guarantee capacity.\nRefinancing requirements\nThe Group will negotiate with existing and, where required, with \nnew financiers to extend the maturity date or refinance facilities \nmaturing within the next 12 months. The Group’s financial \nmetrics and credit rating as well as conditions in financial \nmarkets and other factors may influence the outcome of these \nnegotiations. As at 30 June 2022, the Group has no debt \nfacilities maturing within the 12 months to 30 June 2023.\nCredit ratings\nThe Group has an Investment Grade credit rating of BBB \n(Outlook Stable) from Fitch Ratings. Where the credit rating is \nlowered or placed on negative watch, customers and suppliers \nmay be less willing to contract with the Group. Furthermore, \nbanks and other lending institutions may demand more \nstringent terms (including increased pricing, reduced tenors \nand lower facility limits) on all financing facilities, to reflect the \nweaker credit risk profile."

Generally, the Group uses its incremental \nborrowing rate as the discount rate.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease \nliability comprise:\n\t§ Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), \nless any lease incentives receivable\n\t§ Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate\n\t§ The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is \nreasonably certain to exercise that option\n\t§ The amount expected to be payable under a residual \nvalue guarantee\n\t§ Payments of penalties for termination of the lease, if the lease \nterm reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate \nthe lease.\nVariable lease payments not included in the initial measurement \nof the lease liability are recognised directly in profit or loss.\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the \ncarrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using \nthe effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying \namount to reflect the lease payments made.\nThe Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a \ncorresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use \nasset) whenever:\n\t§ The lease term has changed or there is a significant event \nor change in circumstances resulting in a change in the \nassessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case \nthe lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised \nlease payments using a revised discount rate\n\t§ The lease payments change due to changes in an index or \nrate or a change in the amount expected to be payable under \na residual value guarantee\n\t§ A lease contract is modified, and the lease modification is \nnot accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the \nlease liability is remeasured based on the lease term of the \nmodified lease by discounting the revised lease payments \nusing a revised discount rate at the effective date of \nthe modification.\nThe expense charged to profit or loss for low value and short-\nterm leases (excluded from lease liabilities) is analysed as:\n2022\n$’m \n2021\n$’m\nLease expenses\nLand and buildings\n2.0 \n2.1\nPlant and equipment\n43.4\n52.7\nTotal lease expenses\n45.4\n54.8\nKey estimate and judgement: Lease liabilities\n(i) Extension option\nIn determining the lease term, the Group considers all facts \nand circumstances that create an economic incentive to \nexercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination \noption. Extension options (or periods after termination \noptions) are only included in the lease term if the lease is \nreasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).\n(ii) Incremental borrowing rate\nIn determining the present value of the future lease \npayments, the Group discounts the lease payments using \nan incremental borrowing rate (IBR). The IBR reflects the \nfinancing characteristics and duration of the underlying \nlease. Once a discount rate has been set for a leased asset \n(or portfolio of assets with similar characteristics), this rate \nwill remain unchanged for the term of that lease. When a \nlease modification occurs, and it is not accounted for as a \nseparate lease, a new IBR will be assigned to reflect the new \ncharacteristics of the lease."

Acquisition of businesses\nCurrent year acquisitions\nFowlers\nOn 30 November 2021, the Group acquired 100% of Fowlers \nAsphalting Pty. Limited, Gippsland Asphalt Pty. Ltd. and Tarmac \nLinemarking Pty Ltd (‘Fowlers’) for total consideration of \n$25.9 million. Total consideration for this acquisition comprises \n$24.0 million cash paid (net of $0.6 million cash balances \nacquired) and $1.3 million deferred consideration. The fair \nvalue of the acquired net assets amounts to $18.1 million \nresulting in goodwill of $7.8 million being recognised. Fowlers \nis an asphalting and civil construction business operating in \nthe Gippsland area of Victoria. The acquisition accounting for \nFowlers remains provisionally accounted for as at 30 June 2022.\nGoodwill from acquisition\nThe goodwill resulting from the above acquisition represents \nthe future market development, expected revenue growth \nopportunities, technical talent and expertise, and the benefits \nof expected synergies. These benefits are not recognised \nseparately from goodwill because they do not meet the \nrecognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets.\nOther\nDuring the year, deferred consideration payments of $0.1 million \nwere made (2021: $14.3 million) in relation to acquisitions \ncompleted in previous periods.\nPrior year acquisitions\nOther\nThe purchase of the remaining Spotless shares not already owned \nin the year ended 30 June 2021 did not represent an acquisition \nof a business as the Group already controlled this entity.\nMeasurement of fair values\nThe valuation techniques used for measuring the fair value \nof material assets acquired were as follows:\nAsset/liability \nacquired\nValuation technique\nTrade receivables \nand contract assets\nCost technique – considers the expected \neconomic benefits receivable when due.\nProperty, plant \nand equipment\nMarket comparison technique and cost \ntechnique – the valuation model considers \nquoted market prices for similar items \nwhen available and current replacement \ncost when appropriate.\nIntangible assets\nMulti-period excess earnings method – \nconsiders the present value of net cash \nflows expected to be generated by the \ncustomer contracts and relationships, \nintellectual property and brand names, \nexcluding any cash flows related to \ncontributory assets. For the valuation of \ncertain brand names, discounted cash \nflow under the relief from royalty valuation \nmethodology has been utilised.\nTrade payables and \nother payables\nCost technique – considers the expected \neconomic outflow of resources when due.\nAsset/liability \nacquired\nValuation technique\nBorrowings\nCost technique – considers the expected \neconomic outflow of resources when due.\nProvisions\nCost technique – considers the probable \neconomic outflow of resources when the \nobligation arises.\nRecognition and measurement\nBusiness combinations\nThe Group accounts for business combinations using the \nacquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. \nThe consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at \nfair value. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in \nprofit or loss.\n(i) Acquisition achieved in stages\nWhere a business combination is achieved in stages, the \nGroup’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is \nremeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date \nwhen the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, \nif any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from \ninterests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have \npreviously been recognised in other comprehensive income \nare reclassified to profit or loss where such treatment would be \nappropriate if that interest were disposed of or control of the \nacquiree obtained.\n(ii) Contingent consideration\nThe subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of \ncontingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement \nperiod adjustments depends on how the contingent \nconsideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is \nclassified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting \ndates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within \nequity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or \nliability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates with the \ncorresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss.\n(iii) Non-controlling interest\nThe Group can elect, on an acquisition by acquisition basis, to \nrecognise non-controlling interests in an acquired entity either \nat fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s share of the \nacquired entity’s net identifiable assets/(liabilities).\nKey estimate and judgement: Acquisition \nof businesses\nAccounting for acquisition of businesses requires judgement \nand estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets \nand liabilities. The relevant accounting standard allows the \nfair value of assets acquired to be refined in a window of a \nyear after the acquisition date and judgement is required to \nensure that the adjustments made reflect new information \nobtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of \nthe acquisition date. The adjustments made to the fair value \nof assets are retrospective in nature and have an impact on \ngoodwill recognised on acquisition."

Capital and financial risk management\n(a) Capital risk management\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of debt and equity. \nThe Group may vary its capital structure by adjusting the \namount of dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing \nnew shares or increasing or reducing debt.\nThe Group’s objectives when managing capital are to \nsafeguard its ability to operate as a going concern so that it \ncan meet all its financial obligations when they fall due, provide \nadequate returns to shareholders, maintain an appropriate \ncapital structure to optimise its cost of capital and maintain \nan investment grade credit rating to ensure ongoing access \nto funding.\nA buy-back of Downer’s shares was announced to the \nmarket on 27 April 2021 and the buy-back commenced on \n8 June 2021. As of 30 June 2022, a total of 28,365,995 shares \nwere purchased for total consideration of $167.4 million, \nfunded by the Group’s cash reserves.\n(b) Financial risk management objectives\nThe Group’s Treasury function manages the funding, liquidity \nand financial risks of the Group. These risks include foreign \nexchange, interest rate, commodity and financial counterparty \ncredit risk.\nThe Group enters into a variety of derivative financial \ninstruments to manage its exposures including:\n(i)\t Forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange \nrate risk arising from cross-border trade flows, foreign \nincome and debt service obligations\n(ii)\t Cross-currency interest rate swaps to manage the interest \nrate and currency risk associated with foreign currency \ndenominated borrowings\n(iii)\t Interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk\n(iv)\t Commodity forward contracts to manage commodity price \nmovements in contracts.\nThe Group does not enter into or trade derivative financial \ninstruments for speculative purposes.\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount \nreported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, \nwhen there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised \namounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or \nrealise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. No \nmaterial amounts with a right to offset were identified in the \nConsolidated Statement of Financial Position.\n(c) Foreign currency risk management\nThe Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in \nforeign currencies. As a result, exposures to exchange rate \nfluctuations arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within \napproved policy parameters, utilising forward foreign exchange \ncontracts and cross-currency swaps.\nThe carrying amounts of the Group’s unhedged foreign \ncurrency denominated financial assets and financial liabilities \nat the reporting date are as follows:\nFinancial\nassets(i)\nFinancial\nliabilities(i)\n2022 \n$’m \n2021 \n$’m \n2022 \n$’m \n2021 \n$’m \nUS Dollar (USD)\n1.3 \n2.3 \n– \n– \nEuro (EUR)\n0.6 \n– \n2.3 \n– \n(i) \t The above table shows foreign currency financial assets and liabilities in \nAustralian dollar equivalent.\nForeign currency forward contracts\nThe following table summarises, by currency pairs, the Australian dollar value (unless otherwise stated) of forward exchange \ncontracts outstanding as at the reporting date:\nOutstanding contracts\nWeighted average \nexchange rate\nForeign currency\nContract value\nFair value\n2022 \n \n2021  \n2022 \nFC'm \n2021 \nFC'm \n2022 \n$'m \n2021 \n$'m \n2022 \n$'m \n2021 \n$'m \nBuy USD/Sell AUD\nLess than 3 months\n0.7217 \n0.7728 \n7.2 \n5.1 \n10.0 \n6.7 \n0.5 \n0.2 \n3 to 6 months\n0.7305 \n0.7729 \n9.6 \n12.1 \n13.1 \n15.7 \n0.8 \n0.4 \nLater than 6 months\n0.7387 \n0.7593 \n7.5 \n2.8 \n10.1 \n3.7 \n0.7 \n–\n24.3 \n20.0 \n33.2 \n26.1 \n2.0 \n0.6 \nSell USD/Buy AUD\nLess than 3 months\n0.7194 \n0.7755 \n3.5 \n5.8 \n4.9 \n7.4 \n(0.2)\n(0.2)\n3 to 6 months\n0.7431 \n0.7625 \n12.4 \n6.9 \n16.7 \n9.1 \n(1.2)\n(0.1)\nLater than 6 months\n0.7225 \n0.7777 \n8.8 \n29.9 \n12.2 \n38.5 \n(0.5)\n(1.3)\n24.7 \n42.6 \n33.8 \n55.0 \n(1.9)\n(1.6)"

The Group has a number of undrawn facilities, which if utilised would be \non a floating rate basis.\nThe Group uses cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposures.

The selected basis point increase or decrease \nrepresents the Group’s assessment of the possible change \nin interest rates on variable rate instruments, cross-currency \ninterest rate swaps and interest rate swaps. An increase in \ninterest rates of 100 basis points on the unhedged position \n(mostly cash and cash equivalents) will generate a profit of \n$7.3 million (2021: $7.7 million profit) to the profit or loss; a similar \ndecrease in interest rates will generate a loss of $7.3 million \n(2021: $7.7 million loss) to the profit or loss.\nFor hedged positions designated as cash flow hedges, \nan increase and decrease in interest rates of 100 basis \npoints will generate an increase and decrease in equity \nof $5.8 million (2021: $2.0 million) and $5.6 million \n(2021: $3.5 million) respectively.\n(e) Credit risk management\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a financial counterparty will \ndefault on its contractual obligations in respect of a financial \ninstrument, resulting in a potential loss to the Group.\nTrade receivables and contract assets arise from a large \nnumber of customers, spread across diverse industries and \ngeographical areas. A credit risk assessment is performed at \nthe onset of material contracts to assess the financial condition \nof the counterparty and reviewed annually to take account \nof any changes in the risk profile of the counterparty. Where \npossible, a bank guarantee or performance bond, or parent \nguarantee from a creditworthy counterparty, is sought to secure \na counterparty’s contractual payment obligations. Refer to \nNote C2 for details on credit risk arising from trade receivables \nand contract assets.\nFinancial counterparty credit limits and the related credit \nacceptability of financial counterparties are set by a Board \napproved Treasury Policy that is subject to annual review to \nensure it remains relevant to the external environment and \nreflects the Group’s risk appetite at all times. The Treasury \nPolicy sets clear parameters for determining acceptable \nfinancial counterparties and limits the exposure the Group \nmay have at any one time to any financial counterparties to \nmitigate financial loss due to a default by a counterparty. \nNo material exposure is considered to exist by virtue of the \nnon-performance of any financial counterparty.\nCredit risk on derivative financial instruments and cash \nbalances held with financial counterparties is managed by \nGroup Treasury with transactions only made with approved \ncounterparties that have a minimum investment grade rating \nfrom Standard & Poor’s of A- (or equivalent from Moody’s or \nFitch rating agencies). In limited circumstances, surplus cash \nmay be held in foreign jurisdictions with financial counterparties \nthat do not meet the minimum rating threshold where there is \nno other alternative.\nThe carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial \nstatements, net of any allowances for losses, represents the \nGroup’s maximum exposure to credit risk."

Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of \nderivatives, except those that qualify as effective hedges, are immediately recognised in profit or loss.\nHedge accounting\nAASB 9 aligns the accounting for hedging instruments closely with the Group’s risk management objectives and strategy and \napplies a more qualitative and forward-looking approach to assessing hedge effectiveness. The Group has elected to adopt the \ngeneral hedge accounting model in AASB 9. AASB 9 includes requirements on rebalancing hedge relationships and prohibiting \nvoluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting.\nFair value hedges\nFair value hedges are used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset, liability or firm commitment. \nFor fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or \nliability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are immediately recorded in profit or loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when \nthe hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\nCash flow hedges\nCash flow hedges are used to hedge risks associated with contracted and highly probable forecast transactions. For cash flow \nhedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is deferred in equity and the gain or loss relating to the \nineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\nAmounts deferred in equity are transferred to profit or loss in the same period the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss. When \nthe forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the gains and losses previously \ndeferred in equity are transferred to form part of the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or liability.\nIf the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised \nimmediately in profit or loss. If the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge \naccounting, any gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.\nG3.

Any ineffective portion of \nchanges in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\nValuation of financial instruments\nFor financial instruments measured and carried at fair value, the Group uses the following to categorise the methods used:\n\t§ Level 1: fair value is calculated using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\t§ Level 2: fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset \nor liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices)\n\t§ Level 3: fair value is estimated using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\nDuring the year there were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value hierarchies.\nThe following table shows the valuation technique used in measuring Level 2 and 3 fair values, as well as significant unobservable \ninputs used:\nType\nValuation technique\nSignificant unobservable input\nCross-currency and \ninterest rate swaps\nCalculated using the present value of the estimated \nfuture cash flows based on observable yield curves.\nNot applicable.\nForeign currency \nforward contracts\nCalculated using forward exchange rates prevailing \nat the balance sheet date.\nNot applicable.\nUnquoted equity \ninvestments\nCalculated based on the Group’s interest in the net \nassets of the unquoted entities.\nAssumptions are made with regard to future expected \nrevenues and discount rates. Changing the inputs \nto the valuations to reasonably possible alternative \nassumptions would not significantly change the \namounts recognised in profit or loss, total assets or \ntotal liabilities, or total equity."

Downer recognises that sustainability is \nvital for securing long-term environmental, economic and social \nviability and understands its role in contributing to a sustainable \nfuture for communities to prosper.\nDowner’s sustainability strategy is integrated into its \nbusiness strategy which is shaped by its four Pillars: Safety; \nDelivery; Relationships; and Thought Leadership. Downer’s \ncommitment to sustainability is outlined on the Downer \nwebsite and within the Sustainability Report located \nat www.downergroup.com/2022sustainabilityreport.\nDowner leverages its understanding of Environment, Social \nand Governance mega-trends and key material sustainability \nissues to drive innovation and identify new sources of growth \nand revenue for the business. Downer operates in sectors that \nare closely connected to the investment that is being driven \nby population growth and urbanisation. These sectors include \nroads, rail, light rail, other public transport, power, gas, water, \ntelecommunications, health, education, defence and other \ngovernment sectors.\nThese sectors are served by Downer’s Urban Services \nbusinesses – Transport, Utilities, and Facilities. These \nbusinesses have demonstrated strength and resilience, hold \nmarket-leading positions and attractive medium-term and \nlong-term growth opportunities. They have a high proportion \nof government and government-related contracts and a capital \nlight, services-based business model, with a lower risk profile \nand are generating more predictable revenues and cash flows.\nDowner’s Urban Services strategy delivers many environmental \nand social benefits including a move to lower capital intensive \nand lower carbon activities which supports Downer’s \ndecarbonisation pathway. Downer completed the sale of \nits Open Cut Mining East business in December 2021. This \ncompleted the divestment of Downer’s former Mining Service \nBusiness Unit.\nDowner is proud of the role we play in creating more sustainable \ncities and improving the quality of life in Australia and New \nZealand. Our customers trust us to deliver these services, which \nwill have a direct impact on their customers every day.\nWith our services impacting millions of lives every day, the \nsustainability of our operations is paramount – for our people, \nour partners, our shareholders, our customers and their \ncustomers. We deliver these services while managing the \nimpacts of our activities on the environment and communities \nin which we operate, and working collaboratively with our supply \nchain. We understand that our ability to do this is fundamental \nto Downer’s long-term success.\nDowner’s ESG Reporting Approach\nDowner prepares its Sustainability Report with reference to the \nGlobal Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Standards to provide investors \nwith comparable information relating to environmental, social \nand governance (ESG) performance. Specifically, Downer’s \napproach takes into consideration the GRI’s principles for \ninforming report content: materiality, completeness, and \nsustainability context and stakeholder inclusiveness. A key \nfocus is to demonstrate how Downer delivers sustainable \nreturns while managing risk and being responsible in how \nit operates.\nDowner seeks to identify the issues that have the greatest \npotential to impact its future success and returns to \nshareholders. In FY21, Downer revisited its materiality \nassessment in line with the GRI Standards via a rigorous \nindependently-led process to formally engage internal and \nexternal stakeholders to understand what they believe are \nthe material sustainability issues for Downer and inform \nthe identification of its material issues by economic, social, \nenvironmental and governance.\nThe materiality assessment provided key sustainability insights \nfor Downer’s strategy and frames the content for this year’s \nSustainability Report. The results were positive with strong \nalignment between internal and external stakeholder views.\nDowner continues to refine its material issues list as a result \nof changes in the organisation, and the market in which it \noperates. Downer typically undertakes a comprehensive \nmateriality assessment every two to three years or when there \nhave been significant or material changes within the business.\nFor example, Downer’s last materiality assessment in 2021 took \ninto consideration the divestment of the Laundries and Mining \nServices businesses. A desktop review of the results from our \n2021 assessment was undertaken this year, with no significant \nchanges to the business."

In fulfilling this function, the Downer Board also receives \noversight from Downer’s Zero Harm Board Committee, Audit \nand Risk Committee, Tender Risk Evaluation Committee and \nDisclosure Committee. ESG related risks and opportunities are \nincorporated into Downer’s broader corporate strategy, planning \nand risk management processes.\nThe Downer Board recognises that an integrated approach \nto managing ESG risks and opportunities is essential. This has \nbeen reflected in the strengthening of Downer’s governance \nand increased focus in both Board and Executive forums \nthroughout the 2022 financial year. Managing our business to \nbe sustainable over the long term has always been front of mind \nfor Downer’s Board.\nESG risks and opportunities are governed as part of Downer’s \nGroup Risk and Opportunity Management Framework and \nProject Risk Management Framework. Downer identifies, \nmanages and discloses material climate-related risks as part \nof Downer’s standard business practices, and, in accordance \nwith the Group and Business Unit strategies, which apply to \neveryone at Downer.\nDowner’s Zero Harm Management System Framework sets \nthe Company’s Zero Harm and sustainability governance \nrequirements. Downer maintained its centralised third-party \naccreditation to the International Standards ISO 45001 \n(Safety), ISO 9001 (Quality) and ISO 14001 (Environment). \nThis gives Downer a single system of work for safety, quality \nand environment, and a framework to develop, implement and \nmonitor The Downer Standard.\nThe Board’s Zero Harm Committee oversees the strategy and \nmonitors the development and implementation of Downer’s Zero \nHarm management systems, improvement and performance \nreporting systems, and monitors Downer’s Zero Harm \nperformance. Effective monitoring occurs through extensive \ninternal and third-party audit programs, with oversight by both \nthe Board Zero Harm and Board Audit and Risk Committees. \nOther aspects of Downer’s approach to sustainability are \noverseen by other relevant corporate governance forums, \nfor example the Group Diversity Committee.\nThe method for measuring the Company’s performance \nis clearly set out in its governance framework. Short-term \nremuneration incentives are offered to senior managers in \nrelation to the Company’s performance against Zero Harm and \nSustainability targets. These targets include the management \nof Downer’s Safety performance (LTIFR and TRIFR), Zero Harm \ncritical risks, developing improvement plans aligned to the \nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals and focusing on \ndecarbonisation (GHG emissions reductions) in order to achieve \nDowner’s science-based target to be net zero by 2050.\nDowner’s Zero Harm performance during 2022 is summarised \nbelow. More comprehensive information is provided in Downer’s \n2022 Sustainability Report which will be available on the Downer \nwebsite www.downergroup.com/2022sustainabilityreport.\nHealth, Safety and Wellbeing\nDowner’s business is founded on a deeply held value of Zero \nHarm. Health and safety is Downer’s highest priority, its top \nmaterial issue and the first of its strategic pillars. Zero Harm \nis embedded in Downer’s culture and is fundamental to future \nsuccess. Downer’s managers, supervisors and employees \nbring this core principle to fruition and actively live it every day, \nvigilantly protecting the health and safety of themselves and \nothers in and around its workplaces.\nDowner’s approach to health and safety is built on leading, \ninnovating, managing risk, rethinking processes, applying lessons \nlearnt, and adopting and adapting practices that aim to achieve \nzero work-related injuries. Downer’s integrated lifecycle approach \nis a market differentiator and enables its people to work safely in \nindustry sectors that may be inherently hazardous. In everything \nit does, the health and safety of its people and communities that \nit works within is always its top priority."

Although the cause of death \nis not yet known, Downer has treated this as a workplace \nfatality. This incident is a reminder of the challenges of ensuring \nwe remain vigilant and relentlessly manage the Critical Risks \nassociated with the work we do every day.\nDuring FY22, Downer incurred two penalty infringement notices \nrelating to safety concerns totalling $13,904 (AUD).\n\t§ A penalty infringement for $10,904 (AUD) was issued \nconcerning an alleged technical breach of the Public Health \nand Wellbeing Act 2008 (Vic). Downer believed it was in \ncompliance, in that the scope of work being conducted at \nthat location was permitted in accordance with the list of \nexempted works, and that Downer had received authorisation. \nDowner was unsuccessful in its administrative appeal of \nthe notice and opted to pay the fine rather than pursue \nfurther challenges.\n\t§ Downer’s VEC Civil Engineering business was issued with \nan infringement notice for $3,000 (AUD) relating to work in \nproximity of overhead power lines.\nDowner was also charged with a breach of the Heavy Vehicle \nNational Law Application Act 2013 (Vic) relating to overload \nof a heavy vehicle moving stockpile, which required a short \ntravel on public roads. Downer has entered into an Enforceable \nUndertaking with the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator.\nDowner partnered with McConnell Dowell in a joint venture \nto deliver Stage 2 of the Christchurch Southern Motorway \nextension and upgrade (CSM2). On 30 October 2019, a \ncyclist was fatally injured in a collision with a concrete truck \ndelivering concrete to the CSM2 project. As a result, Downer \nand McConnell Dowell were charged with one offence under \nsections 36(2), 48(1) and 48(2) of the Health and Safety at \nWork Act 2015 in relation to the incident. On 22 March 2022, \nWork Safe New Zealand accepted an Enforceable Undertaking \nfrom Downer New Zealand Limited which commits to total \nexpenditure of at least $1,000,000 (NZD) to develop a training \nprogram, support a scoping study, develop a NZQA qualification \nand facilitate a cyclist awareness campaign, in order to improve \nsafety for vulnerable road users.\nStrategic initiatives as identified for FY22 have been progressed \nand have continued to strive for a more aligned and consistent \napproach across the Group.

      "text": "130\n|     Downer EDI Limited\nClimate Change and TCFD Update\nDecarbonisation is now recognised as humanity’s greatest \nchallenge and Downer is well placed to have a significant role \nin decarbonising the economy in Australia and New Zealand.\nThe economics of climate change are rapidly shifting, \npresenting significant opportunities for Downer’s services. \nDowner’s Urban Services strategy delivers many environmental \nand social benefits, including a move to lower capital intensive \nand lower carbon activities, supporting Downer’s climate change \nresilience and decarbonisation pathway. Downer is committed \nto reducing its direct emissions profile and is well positioned to \nservice our customers through the energy transition essential \nfor the broader economy to achieve Net Zero by 2050.\nDowner accepts the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange’s assessment of the science related to climate change \nand supports the Paris Agreement in transitioning to net zero \nemissions by 2050 to limit the global temperature increase to \n1.5°C by the end of this century. Downer will track its progress \ntowards its emissions reduction target and review its emission \nreduction approach in line with Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change (IPCC) updated scientific reports, whilst \nconsidering other developments in low-emissions technology, \nto ensure a practical and affordable transition towards \nthis commitment.\nTo guide its ambition, Downer has set an absolute near-term \ntarget of 50% reduction of its Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by \n2032 and an absolute near-term target of 30% reduction of its \nScope 3 emissions by 2032. Downer has set a long-term target \nto be net zero1 in Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 2050, \nsubject to future available technologies. Both the near-term and \nthe long-term targets have a base year of 2020.\nBuilding on the TCFD disclosures that Downer has made \nannually since 2019 and coupled with the changes in Downer’s \nbusiness and strategy in FY22 a detailed review of Downer’s \nmost material climate-related risks and opportunities was \ncompleted. This work reaffirmed that climate change presents \nconsiderable opportunities for Downer, and that these \nopportunities increase as efforts to decarbonise accelerate. \nThe insights and findings from the work undertaken will \ncontinue to inform Downer’s decarbonisation plans and \ngrowth strategies.\nDowner also undertook a review of the Taskforce on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) annex, released in October \n2021, which updated their implementation guidance. To which, \nwe have undertaken further work to assess and understand the \ndecarbonisation financial implications.\n1.\t\nNet Zero is defined as the mitigation of direct emissions to as low a level as possible and offsetting the remainder through carbon removals. Downer has utilised \nthe Science Based Target Initiative’s threshold of a 90% reduction in its emissions as being ‘as low a level as possible’.\nIn FY22, an assessment was commenced to quantify the \nestimated financial impact of different climate scenarios on \nDowner’s value chain. It also assessed the potential mitigation \ncosts against the identified risks. There are three key areas \nof focus for this work: Downer’s fleet, our asphalt plants, and \nthe physical climate impacts on Downer’s fixed assets and key \noperational locations.\nA review was also commenced to review Downer’s current \ncapital asset decision-making process. This review \nhas examined opportunities to integrate more formal \nclimate considerations into Downer’s capital allocation \ndecision-making process.\nIn FY23 Downer will enhance its position as a thought leader \nin this space by developing and publishing a standalone Climate \nChange Report, which will complement this Annual Report and \nthe Sustainability Report. The Climate Change Report will be \nprepared to provide shareholders and potential shareholders \nwith information on Downer’s climate-related plans. This \nincludes its strategies to thrive through the energy transition \nby summarising our climate-related plans, activities and \ndisclosures in accordance with the TCFD.\nDowner believes its own pathway to Net Zero is essential in \nadding credibility to the services we deliver to our customers \nto help them decarbonise their own operations. Downer remains \nfocused on six key areas to ensure we meet our near-term and \nlong-term science-based target commitments. Downer has a \nclear pathway to Net Zero by 2050, which aligns with its Urban \nService Strategy. The six key focus areas include:\n1.\t Increase our focus on core urban services which has seen \na shift from high capital, carbon intensive industries to lower \ncarbon activities.\n2.\t Continue to focus on energy efficiency and GHG \nemission reductions.\n3.\t Decarbonise our fixed assets with new technology and \nfuel switching.\n4.\tDecarbonise Downer’s fleet through electric and alternate \nfuel vehicles.\n5.\t Increase uptake of renewables on- and off-grid.\n6.\tReducing Scope 3 emissions i.e. low carbon materials, \ne.g. bituminous products; and working with suppliers to lower \ntheir emissions.\nIn February 2022, Downer established a Fleet Decarbonisation \nCommittee, with Executive support from the CFO, Head \nof Sustainability, Head of Road Services and Head of \nUtilities. This committee demonstrates the importance of \nfleet decarbonisation to Downer and provides governance \nand oversight on Downer’s fleet decarbonisation plan and \nassociated actions."
