Business.\nINFORMATION ABOUT AURORA\nUnless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to the “Company,” “Aurora,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to the business of Aurora Innovation Holdings,\nInc. and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Merger (defined below), and to Aurora Innovation, Inc. and its subsidiaries after the completion of the Merger.\nCorporate History and Background\nOn November 3, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Aurora Innovation, Inc. (f/k/a Reinvent Technology Partners Y and referred to herein as the “Company”), consummated a\nbusiness combination with Aurora Innovation Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (f/k/a Aurora Innovation, Inc. and f/k/a Avian U Merger Holdco Corp. and referred to\nherein as “Legacy Aurora”), and RTPY Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to an\nAgreement and Plan of Merger dated July 14, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement” and the transactions contemplated thereby, the “Merger”), by and among the Company, Legacy\nAurora and Merger Sub. Our Class A common stock and public warrants are listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “AUR” and “AUROW,” respectively. Our Class B common\nstock is neither listed nor publicly traded.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a business combination between the Company and Legacy Aurora was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with\nand into Legacy Aurora, with Legacy Aurora surviving as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On the Closing Date, the Company\nchanged its name from Reinvent Technology Partners Y to Aurora Innovation, Inc.\nCompany Overview\nOur mission is to deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly.\nAurora was founded in 2017 by Chris Urmson, Sterling Anderson, and Drew Bagnell, three of the most prominent leaders in the self-driving space. Led by a team with\ndeep experience, we are developing the Aurora Driver based on what we believe to be the most advanced and scalable suite of self-driving hardware, software, and data services\nin the world to fundamentally transform the global transportation market. The Aurora Driver is designed as a platform to adapt and interoperate amongst a multitude of vehicle\ntypes and applications. To date, we have successfully integrated the Aurora Driver into numerous different vehicle platforms designed to meet its requirements: from passenger\nvehicles to light commercial vehicles to Class 8 trucks. By creating a common driver platform for multiple vehicle types and use cases, the capabilities we develop in one\nmarket reinforce and strengthen our competitive advantages in other areas. For example, highway driving capabilities developed for trucking will carry over to highway\nsegments driven by passenger vehicles in ride hailing applications. We believe this is the right approach to bring self-driving to market and will enable us to target and transform\nmultiple massive markets, including trucking, passenger mobility, and local goods delivery.\nBeyond the economic opportunity, we believe we have a unique opportunity to have a material positive impact on the lives of millions of people, while also improving\nbusiness productivity. First and foremost, we are focused on the opportunity to greatly improve road safety. In trucking, we can enable logistics networks to move goods more\nefficiently, and also help fill the shortage of truck drivers by providing a self-driving option. We will expand access to transportation, improving the lives of the millions of\npeople with a disability in the U.S. who have difficulty traveling outside of the home. And we will give people back their time that can be made more productive and enjoyable.\nWe intend to launch trucking as our first driverless product, as we believe its massive scale, significant structural need, attractive unit economics, and self-similar\noperating environment will allow us to rapidly deploy and profitably scale on high-volume, highway-focused routes. Drafting on the revenue and technical capability we expect\nthis trucking product to generate, we plan to leverage the extensibility of the Aurora Driver to deploy and scale into the passenger mobility and local goods delivery markets.\nToday, we operate our self-driving test vehicle fleet in diverse weather and operating environments, across the Bay Area, Pittsburgh and Texas, allowing us to create a more\nrobust self-driving system. We also autonomously haul (under the supervision of vehicle operators) truck freight on behalf of our pilot customers in preparation for driverless\ncommercialization.\n1"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nOur first-principles approach, which we define as “Self-Driving 2.0,” underpins our technology development strategy for the Aurora Driver. We made foundational\ninvestments early on, based on our prior experience in the self-driving industry, that allow us to accelerate development and position our platform for long-term scalability.\nSome of these foundational investments include developing the Aurora Driver with what we believe to be the optimal combination of machine-learned and rule-based\napproaches. We have also built a proprietary Virtual Testing Suite, which makes our development more efficient and faster than traditional approaches that rely heavily on on-\nroad vehicle fleets. While many companies in the self-driving industry tout miles driven as a metric, our Virtual Testing Suite allows us to iterate faster and more efficiently,\nwhile reducing our reliance on on-road testing.\nWe have also invested in our next-generation sensing suite, which combines the best of camera, radar, and lidar. This includes developing our Aurora FirstLight Lidar,\nwhich uses proprietary frequency modulated continuous wave (“FMCW”) technology that enables long-range sensing, and simultaneous detection of both the position and\nvelocity of objects. We believe that when combined with our industry-leading sensor suite and perception system, this technology uniquely enables safe operation at highway\nspeeds and is unmatched by our competitors’ alternative solutions. We believe this unlocks the global trucking market, as trucks must be capable of operating at up to 65 miles\nper hour and 80,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, necessitating redundant long-range sensing in order to plan and take action appropriately. High-speed operation is also key to\nunlocking the full opportunity set across passenger mobility and local goods delivery, where a significant percentage of trips require operation on highways and other high-\nspeed roads.\nTo bring our product to market at scale, we focus on what we do best – building self-driving technology – and through strategic partnerships work with best-in-class\ncompanies to deliver the benefits of our technology broadly. We have strategic partnerships with:\n•\nPACCAR & Volvo, who together represent a significant share of US Class 8 truck sales.\n•\nToyota, a leading vehicle manufacturer globally.\n•\nUber, a leading ride hailing company globally.\nWith these strategic partnerships, each party is making significant investments towards integrating the Aurora Driver into their vehicles and logistics and mobility networks.\nWe believe that partnering with other industry leaders enables us to scale more efficiently, as it allows us to focus on what we do best – developing the Aurora Driver—while\nour partners handle activities such as vehicle manufacturing, fleet ownership, and operation. We are proud that these industry leaders have selected Aurora as their self-driving\npartner. During 2022, we operated commercial trucking pilots with FedEx, Werner, Schneider, and Uber Freight in which we regularly and autonomously haul loads under the\nsupervision of vehicle operators, and also explore integrating access to Uber Freight’s digital freight network within our autonomous trucking subscription service. We also\nannounced a strategic collaboration with Ryder Systems to pilot on-site fleet maintenance to support current autonomous freight pilot operations and prepare for commercial\noperation at scale.\nWe expect to ultimately commercialize the Aurora Driver in a Driver as a Service (“DaaS”) business model, in which we will supply self-driving technology and earn\nrevenue on a fee per mile basis. We do not intend to own nor operate large vehicle fleets ourselves. We will partner with automotive companies, fleet operators, and other third\nparties to commercialize and support Aurora-powered vehicles. We expect that these strategic partners will support activities such as vehicle manufacturing, financing and\nleasing, service and maintenance, parts replacement, facility ownership and operation, and other commercial and operational services as needed. We expect the DaaS model to\nenable an asset-light and high-margin revenue stream for Aurora, while allowing us to scale more rapidly through partnerships.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have assembled an approximately 1,700-person team, consisting of leading experts in robotics, machine learning, hardware design,\nsoftware engineering, systems engineering, and safety. We believe that our combined experience and expertise allow us to move faster and more efficiently than our\ncompetitors as we make purposeful, foundational technological investments in safe and scalable self-driving technology.\n2"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nCommercialization & Growth Strategy\nWe plan to commercialize the Aurora Driver safely, quickly, and broadly. We believe our self-driving technology has a strong value proposition with benefits including:\n•\nimproved safety,\n•\nfaster, more efficient goods movement,\n•\nmore reliable freight supply,\n•\nreduced insurance expenses,\n•\nenhanced energy efficiency,\n•\nincreased access to passenger mobility, and\n•\ngreater individual productivity.\nTrucking\nWe plan to launch Aurora Horizon, our driverless trucking subscription service, as our first commercial product. We have prioritized this segment as we believe it is an\noptimal first product for both commercial and technical reasons:\n•\nCommercial. As a critical part of the United States economy, responsible for moving a significant portion of goods, the trucking industry is a large market\nopportunity. The trucking industry also faces a number of ongoing challenges that the Aurora Driver can help solve. The industry has experienced a persistent driver\nshortage, resulting in high driver turnover. Growth in e-commerce increases customer expectations for same- or next-day delivery, while service restrictions on driver\noperating hours create inherent limitations to optimally fast and responsive supply chains. These constraints increase the cost to transport goods and create supply\nchain inefficiencies. By enabling greater efficiency, autonomous trucks can have a significant positive impact. For these reasons, the US Department of Transportation\nhas stated that autonomous trucking has the potential to be meaningfully additive to US GDP over time. We believe our technology can help solve key pain points of\nfleet owners by providing a consistent driver supply, the ability to offer fast and efficient transport, and fuel efficiency. In turn, we believe this creates significant\ndemand and willingness to pay for our product. Additionally, the design and road construction of highways is more standardized and defined across the United States\ninterstate highway system than are local roads, and a very significant amount of freight volume is concentrated on major highway corridors. We believe these factors\nwill enable rapid and broad scaling.\n•\nTechnical. The United States interstate highway system is a more structured environment than urban streets given limited access to pedestrians, bicyclists, and\ncrossing intersections. Moreover, moving goods avoids the complexity of solving for passenger ride comfort, as the system can be optimized to drive cautiously and,\nfor instance, pull over on the highway shoulder safely if the system encounters something that it has not learned to handle autonomously. One element of highway\nautonomous trucking that must be considered is the increased requirements on the system’s perception capabilities, particularly as it relates to seeing at far range,\ngiven that the vehicle may weigh up to 80,000 pounds and operate at up to 65 miles per hour. Aurora’s investment in long-range perception, including Aurora’s\nproprietary FirstLight Lidar, enables us to solve this, while benefiting from the other elements that make deploying trucks on highways an advantageous initial market\nentry point.\nDuring 2022, we operated commercial trucking pilots with FedEx, Werner, Schneider, and Uber Freight in which we regularly and autonomously hauled loads under the\nsupervision of vehicle operators, and also explored integrating access to Uber Freight’s digital freight network within our autonomous trucking subscription service. We also\nannounced a strategic collaboration with Ryder Systems to pilot on-site fleet maintenance to support current autonomous freight pilot operations and prepare for commercial\noperation at scale.\nWe plan to initially launch Aurora Horizon in Texas, which has the largest freight market in the US, a favorable business and regulatory environment, and moderate\nweather. These characteristics make it an attractive market for our initial driverless launch. From there, we plan to expand to other key freight corridors, which we will prioritize\nbased on commercial, technical, and regulatory considerations.\nPassenger Mobility\nOur second core market focuses on passenger mobility, initially targeting the ride hailing space with Aurora Connect, our driverless ride hailing subscription service.\n3"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nAs it exists today, however, passenger mobility is subject to inefficiencies and responsible for notable negative impacts – roadway deaths, lost productivity, and\ngreenhouse gas emissions. These are all challenges that self-driving technology has the potential to help alleviate. We believe that the Aurora Driver can provide a safer\nalternative to manually-driven transport, return numerous hours that would otherwise have been spent driving, and expedite the transition to electric vehicles.\nWe believe technological advancements in ride-hailing and lower structural costs, enabled by self-driving technology, will expand ride-hailing into more passenger\nmobility use cases and drive mass adoption, further democratizing access to mobility and increasing the passenger mobility market opportunity for our self-driving technology.\nWe aim to improve the rider experience through the quality, cleanliness, and consistency of the Aurora Driver-powered fleet while also offering more rider control over the in-\nvehicle experience (e.g. music, climate). Future vehicle platforms may be designed to support specific transportation use cases (e.g. airport trips, commutes, social rides) that\nfurther improve the experience offered today.\nWe plan to launch Aurora Connect following the launch and initial expansion of Aurora Horizon, leveraging our strategic relationships with Toyota and Uber. As we use\nthe same Aurora Driver hardware and software as for trucking, we will leverage capabilities already in use by our trucking product. Our ability to drive safely at high speed will\nallow us to serve the significant fraction of ride-hailing trips that require high speed on interstates and highways. We expect our growth will consist of commercial expansion\nwithin and across cities.\nLocal Goods Delivery\nOur third core market is local goods delivery, which spans several sub-segments, including last-mile parcel and post, prepared food, grocery, and business-to-business\n(“B2B”) delivery.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of local goods delivery, as well as the supply chain disruptions that can be experienced when consumer\nbehavior changes abruptly. We expect consumer demand for online shopping and on-demand ordering will largely remain in place following the COVID-19 pandemic and that\nretailers, restaurants, and other local businesses will seek to address these preferences through expanded delivery channels. Self-driving technology can provide meaningful\nvalue in making e-commerce and on-demand purchases more affordable for consumers and more accessible to businesses.\nRelative to trucking and passenger mobility, we believe local goods delivery has more advanced technical complexity given active problem-solving related to identifying\nappropriate drop-off locations and completion of the “last 50 feet” of goods delivery from vehicle to door. We expect that the Aurora Driver will be uniquely positioned to serve\nthis market based on reinforcing competitive advantages and technical gains from trucking and ride hailing. We expect the operating domain for local goods delivery to overlap\nclosely with personal mobility and commercial operations of local goods delivery to commence following personal mobility launch.\nExpand global footprint\nWe intend for the Aurora Driver to serve people and communities around the world. Our commercial operations will start in the United States, but we expect to broaden\nour footprint to include international markets where the value proposition of our technology is compelling, regulations are conducive, and roadways are comparable. This\nincludes, but is not limited to, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Australia and New Zealand.\nSelf-reinforcing effects of our business model\nWe believe that our operation across these three large markets leads to multiple beneficial self-reinforcing effects for our business model:\n1. Higher return on development investment. By being able to recoup the significant majority of our development costs across multiple end markets, we increase the\nreturn on our overall investment, as well as each capability we develop.\n2. Economies of scale and cost reduction. The scale we generate in one market will serve to drive down our hardware cost. Because we use the same hardware stack\nacross vehicle types, this reduces our cost to serve each end-market in which we operate.\n3. Learning and data. By having an ever-increasing Aurora-Driver powered vehicle fleet, we collect more data and driving experience to hone our system; the benefit\naccrues across all markets in which we operate.\n4. Reputation. Trust in our company and technology is paramount, and we expect that the trust we earn – with governments, the public, and partners – builds across the\nmarkets in which we operate.\n4"

Chris led the Google self-driving car team\nand was technology director for Carnegie Mellon when it won the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge; Sterling developed MIT’s Intelligent CoPilot, then launched Tesla’s Model\nX and Autopilot; Drew worked for two decades at the intersection of machine learning and robotics across industry and academia at Carnegie Mellon. As of December 31,\n2022, Aurora has assembled an approximately 1,700-person team, of whom approximately 1,500 focus on engineering and product. Our company consists of world-leaders in\nrobotics, machine learning, hardware design, software engineering, systems engineering, and safety. Aurora has over 1,300 awarded and pending patents worldwide. In 2021,\nAurora acquired and integrated Uber’s self-driving unit, strengthening our team, our technology, and our intellectual property. The acquisition added to the breadth and depth of\ntalent we have to deliver on our mission. We foster a high-performance and mission-driven culture which drives successful execution, and we believe this makes us an employer\nof choice in our industry.\nNext-generation technology\nUnencumbered by legacy technology and methods, we have taken a clean sheet approach to creating a safe and scalable self-driving system. We have invested in key\nareas of differentiation that we believe provide a long-term advantage, including:\n•\nCareful integration of machine learning and engineering approaches throughout our perception and motion planning systems\n•\nVirtual Testing Suite that allows for accelerated and efficient development\n•\nDifferentiated long-range, high-resolution, multi-modal sensor suite that includes FirstLight Lidar technology, which allows numerous advantages over traditional\nlidar, including the ability to unlock safe operation at highway speeds\n•\nScalable maps that are maximally relevant to the challenges of self-driving\nCommon driver platform technology, scalable across vehicle types and use cases\nThe Aurora Driver is built on a common architecture that is designed to adapt readily to the vehicle platform it controls. This allows the Aurora Driver to learn from and\nleverage its experience and capabilities across a wide range of vehicle makes and models. We invested early in our hardware suite to minimize reliance on any one vehicle\nplatform, allowing greater optionality in both the types of vehicles we use as well as their commercial applications.\nDifferentiated go-to-market strategy\nOur technology enables us to first target trucking, which we believe is the optimal way to enter the market and scale self-driving technology. Because of the extensibility\nof the Aurora Driver across vehicle types and use cases, we are able to take advantage of capability overlap across use cases, increased learning with scale, and cost reductions\nin our self-driving system. Therefore, the capabilities and scale we develop in trucking accelerate our expansion into passenger mobility and local goods delivery, and vice\nversa.\nDeep strategic partnerships which support commercialization at scale\nWe have developed strategic partnerships with industry leaders like PACCAR, Volvo, Toyota and Uber and will work together to develop and scale Aurora Driver-\npowered trucks and self-driving passenger vehicles. Our partners are industry leaders in their respective fields and we are able to leverage each of our respective strengths as we\ncommercialize. This allows us to scale faster and more efficiently.\nEfficiency of development and operation\nWe believe that our approach to technological development, coupled with our Driver as a Service business model, enables us to develop and scale our technology\nefficiently. This is further enhanced by our collaboration with Uber, which allows us access to proprietary anonymized data related to trip demand and economics. This data\nallows us to optimize our development roadmap to invest in the highest value markets and capabilities.\n5"

A strong, inclusive, and\neffective culture is fundamental for the long-term success of a business, and even more so when delivering a technology as complex and transformative as self-driving. We are\nbuilding an enduring company and our culture and values represent an advantage in delivering and scaling our product.\nOur Product\nThe Aurora Driver\nWe are building the Aurora Driver – the hardware, software, and services to enable safe, cost-efficient, and high-uptime autonomous driving service. The Aurora Driver\nis based on a common driver platform design that can integrate with vehicles of various makes, models, and classes to serve multiple commercial applications. To date, we have\nsuccessfully integrated the Aurora Driver across numerous different vehicle platforms.\nThe Aurora Driver is designed to deliver fully autonomous driving without the need for a human in the vehicle. This is classified as Level 4 – High Automation, with the\nvehicle capable of performing all driving functions under certain conditions, such as specific road types and weather. This set of conditions is referred to as the system’s\n“operating domain.” We believe that, because a driver is no longer required inside the vehicle, this level of automation allows for step-change benefits in both safety and\nefficiency and opens massive commercial opportunities.\nAurora’s custom-designed hardware suite includes full sensor coverage on three sensing modalities: lidar, radar, and camera, as well as high-performance computing to\nenable rapid response time. The computer powers Aurora’s self-driving software, which plans a safe path of motion for the vehicle in order to reach its destination.\nThe commercial self-driving vehicles that integrate with the Aurora Driver will include redundant steering, braking, and power to promote safe vehicle operation in the\nevent of a component failure. We work closely with our OEM partners to develop a safe, reliable, and scalable integrated solution.\nDriver as a Service Business Model\nThe Aurora Driver will be delivered as a service via Aurora Horizon, our driverless trucking subscription service, and Aurora Connect, our driverless ride hailing\nsubscription service. We intend to partner with our ecosystem of OEMs, fleet operators, and mobility and logistics services, as well as other third parties, to commercialize and\nsupport Aurora-powered vehicles. With our business model, fleet owners will purchase Aurora Driver-powered vehicles from our OEM partners, subscribe to the Aurora Driver,\nand utilize Aurora-certified fleet service partners to operate autonomous mobility and logistics services. In many instances, the same party may play multiple roles: for example,\nour OEM partners will in certain cases also provide maintenance services and act as a fleet operator.\n6"

We have made\npurposeful, foundational technological investments that we believe will enable us to move towards meaningful commercialization more safely, quickly, and broadly. Examples\nof this ‘self-driving 2.0’ approach, across both hardware & software, include:\n1. Proprietary lidar technology to unlock highway speeds;\n2. Next-generation approach to Perception and Planning that leverages the distinct strengths of both machine learning and engineered approaches;\n3. Common driver platform approach which allows our system to scale onto different vehicle types, such as cars and Class 8 trucks;\n4. Aurora’s Virtual Testing Suite, which increases engineering velocity; and\n5. Scalable approach to high-definition maps\nProprietary Lidar technology\nAurora’s long-range, multi-modal sensing suite consists of high-resolution, high dynamic range and long-range cameras, next-generation imaging radar, and our\nindustry-leading proprietary FirstLight Lidar.\nFirstLight alone provides a number of meaningful performance advantages over traditional lidar sensors. Traditional pulsed lidar is amplitude-modulated (“AM”), which\nworks by emitting brief light pulses at a fixed frequency. The locations of objects are determined based on how long it takes for those laser pulses to bounce off surfaces and\nreturn to the sensor. The challenge with AM lidar is that it has limited range, requires multiple measurements to estimate speed, and is susceptible to lidar-to-lidar and solar\ninterference. Aurora’s FirstLight uses frequency-modulated continuous-wave (“FMCW”) lidar technology. This has a number of key advantages, which we believe are critical\nto unlocking safe operation at highway speeds:\n1. Greater Range. Our lidar can see nearly twice as far as a typical automotive AM lidar, because our coherent measurement enables single-photon sensitivity. The\nenhanced range of our FMCW lidar enables the detection and tracking of objects and actors at the very long ranges essential for high-speed driving.\n2. Simultaneous Range and Velocity. FirstLight instantaneously measures the radial velocity of the targets as well as distance. This allows quicker reaction times and\nbetter tracking of other objects on or near the road.\n3. Interference Immunity. Each FirstLight sensor is primarily sensitive to only the signals it creates. Therefore, it benefits from immunity to interference from ambient\nsunlight and to lidar-to-lidar interference, which will be important as self-driving fleets scale.\n7"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nLeveraging the Best of Machine Learning and Engineered Approaches\nAurora’s approach to designing the Aurora Driver software leverages our team’s expertise in both machine learning and fundamental engineering. Use of either approach\nfor solving a problem has advantages and disadvantages, and therefore the thoughtful fusion of both is critical to creating a safe and scalable system. The key distinctions\nbetween machine learning and engineering are that:\n•\nEngineered systems are built by humans and tend to be simpler and more introspectable (i.e. can understand ‘why’ an action is taken).\n•\nMachine-learned systems are tuned and developed by algorithms and trained on data. This can allow for greater nuance and complexity, and have the additional\nadvantage that new data can improve overall performance. However, machine-learned systems are less introspectable than engineered systems.\nAurora’s software teams are selective in their application of each, and frequently bring both to bear on a single task in ways that utilize the independent strengths of each\nto create a higher-performance system.\nAn example of this is the Planning system. As the Aurora Driver operates, it uses an engineered approach to maintain appropriate safety buffers—an example is\nmaintaining sufficiently safe following distance, such that the Aurora Driver can stop safely even if the car in front of it brakes aggressively. Using this engineered approach\npermits strong safety guarantees. However, a system built around such guarantees alone would not drive in a human-like fashion, and may act in such a way that other road\nusers would find it unpredictable. Therefore, we also employ a machine-learned approach where the system learns from exemplary human drivers how to naturally behave\nduring many commonplace interactions, such as merging onto a highway—subject to the buffers defined by the engineered system. Interleaving these two methods allows for\nthe creation of verifiably safe, and natural, driving behavior.\nCommon Driver Platform Approach\nThe Aurora Driver has been designed from the ground up to support multiple automakers and commercial applications with the same core hardware and software. We\ninvested early in a hardware suite that is consistent across vehicle platforms, and software that adapts to the unique behaviors, constraints, and dynamics of whatever vehicle it\ncontrols—whether that be a Class 8 tractor or light passenger vehicle.\nThe Aurora Driver uses the same hardware suite across trucks and passenger vehicles. Because all Aurora-Driver powered vehicles carry a common set of self-driving\nhardware and software, Aurora and its partners benefit from the collective scale of all participants on the platform.\nSignificant Investments in Virtual Development\nOur Virtual Testing Suite is a major engineering accelerator. Virtual testing refers to any time that our system is being tested in response to synthetic or historical data as\nopposed to operating in real-time on the road. Aurora incorporates frequent and extensive use of virtual testing.\nThere are numerous benefits to virtual testing:\n•\nEfficiency. Aurora’s motion planning simulation is 2,500 times less expensive than on-road testing.\n•\nSpeed. Aurora’s Virtual Testing Suite can scale to continuously simulate the equivalent of over 50,000 trucks on the road. This figure will grow both as a result of\nincreased technological innovation inside Aurora, as well as from expanding scale available from leading cloud computing providers.\n•\nSafety. Aurora’s Virtual Testing Suite dramatically reduces the number of on-road miles of driving needed to develop the Aurora Driver, which reduces exposure to\nrisk associated with on-road testing.\n•\nVariation. Aurora’s Virtual Testing Suite can automatically alter details to create myriad permutations from a single scenario encountered on the road, and even\nsimulate scenarios we have not previously encountered on the road. We can adjust factors like weather, traffic density, or pedestrian behavior. We can quickly test\nagainst many thousands of likely variations to understand how the system would have responded.\n•\nRepeatability. As our sensor stack evolves, our Virtual Testing Suite remains relevant, whereas past real-world data collected on an out-of-date sensor stack becomes\nobsolete. We believe this is unique to Aurora due to our industry-leading expertise in sensor data simulation and systemically generating new scenarios.\nAurora has invested significantly in virtual testing at a time when much of the self-driving industry was focused on real world mileage accumulation. We believe that as\nthe industry reaches the long tail of development, these investments will increasingly accelerate our path to market and scale relative to competitors.\n8"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nScalable Approach to High-definition Mapping\nAurora’s approach to mapping aims to optimize for two factors: first, a map that is maximally relevant to the challenges of self-driving; and second, a map that can be\nmaintained at scale.\nThe Aurora Atlas is a map purpose-designed for these goals. It is broken into smaller maps that cover sub-areas, which are referred to as shards. Many classic maps have\nnot been built for self-driving and thus prioritize global positioning accuracy at a substantial detriment to local accuracy. Aurora’s map shards, however, prioritize being locally\naccurate, as it is far more important that the Aurora Driver knows the location of nearby actors and objects as accurately as possible rather than where it is in some global sense.\nWe do this without sacrificing any meaningful amount of the Aurora Driver’s broader context about where it is in the world or along a route.\nThe sharded, locally consistent approach to the Aurora Atlas enables scalability. Rebuilding the content of a shard takes minutes, whereas for classic maps, these areas\ncan be the size of an entire city and take far longer to adjust. Swapping out a shard in a live deployed map is possible to do rapidly over-the-air, whereas deploying an entirely\nnew map for a city requires a lengthy process. Finally, as the Aurora Driver begins to operate in new areas, the increase in mapped content will not alter existing content or\nrequire any editing/re-release of past maps, which a non-sharded approach would require; this keeps existing operational support much simpler even under a rapid expansion\nplan.\nOur Culture\nAurora’s values guide our work and culture and support our ability to deliver our mission. They set the tone for the way we operate, they define who we are and how we\ndo things, and they guide us when we face difficult situations. Our values are:\n1. Focus for Impact. We create space to solve problems that matter. We don’t have time for distractions, so we work with urgency and focus on the work that will\naccelerate our progress towards our mission and strengthen our company;\n2. Operate with Integrity. We do the right thing. We are thoughtful and use good judgment. And, we always keep the best interest of our people and our mission at the\nforefront of how we work;\n3. Celebrate our Diversity. Inviting and including diverse perspectives and experiences make us stronger as a team, and help us better represent the world we live in.\nWe are building a technology and a company to serve all people and all communities;\n4. Rise to the Occasion. We’re charting a path that is challenging yet filled with an incredible opportunity to impact generations to come. This is not an easy task, it\ntakes resilience, hard work and dedication. Embracing the hard stuff energizes and inspires us to continue. We rally to deliver on our commitments to our partners and\neach other;\n5. Win together. We are a stronger team when we elevate our unique strengths in service of our common goals. We thrive on open and honest communication to create\nan environment of mutual accountability, understanding, achievement, and respect;\n6. No jerks. We work from the assumption that people are good, fair, and honest and that the intention behind their actions is positive. We are intentional in how we\ncommunicate and interact, and we hold each other accountable.\nCompetition\nOur main sources of competition fall into two categories:\n•\nTechnology-focused companies building end-to-end technical capabilities for self-driving applications\n•\nAutomotive players building internal self-driving development programs\nThe principal competitive success factors in our market, in no particular order, include, but are not limited to:\n•\nTechnology quality, reliability, and safety\n•\nEngineering capabilities\n•\nBusiness model and go-to-market approach\n•\nCommercial partnerships\n•\nCost and efficiency\n•\nPatents and intellectual property portfolio\n9"

Additionally, we protect our proprietary rights through agreements with our commercial partners, supply-chain vendors, employees, and\nconsultants, as well as close monitoring of the developments and products in the industry.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we owned over 1,300 patents and pending applications, including U.S. and foreign. In addition, we have 6 registered U.S. trademarks, 32\nregistered foreign trademarks and 11 pending trademark applications. Our patents and patent applications cover a broad range of technology relevant to self-driving vehicles.\nMaterial Agreements\nPACCAR Strategic Partnership\nIn January 2021, we entered into a global strategic partnership with PACCAR in preparation for the launch of the Aurora Driver’s first application in trucking. This\npartnership combines PACCAR’s considerable expertise in heavy-duty truck development, manufacturing, and sales with our deep understanding of autonomous vehicle\ntechnology to bring a safe, efficient self-driving product to market quickly and deploy it broadly. This partnership brings PACCAR and Aurora engineering teams together\naround an accelerated development program to create truly driverless-capable trucks, starting with the Peterbilt 579 and Kenworth T680. PACCAR and Aurora plan to develop a\nsuite of self-driving fleet services, including servicing and maintenance options for the deployment and operation of these trucks at scale over the next several years.\nUber Strategic Partnership\nIn January 2021, we acquired Uber’s self-driving unit. This acquisition expanded our talent base significantly, and we gained valuable research and technical assets that\nstrengthened and accelerated the first Aurora Driver application for heavy-duty trucks while allowing us to continue and accelerate our work on light-vehicle products.\nIn addition to acquiring Uber’s self-driving unit, we announced a strategic partnership with Uber that connects our technology to the world’s leading ride-hailing\nplatform and strengthens our position to deliver the Aurora Driver broadly. In support of our partnership with Uber, and concurrent with the acquisition of Uber’s self-driving\nunit, Uber invested $400 million in Aurora and Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi is a member of our board of directors.\nAs part of our partnership with Uber, we receive access to Uber data. This allows more efficient development and operation, as we are able to refine our market selection\nand prioritize our capability roadmap based on real-world data.\nToyota Strategic Collaboration\nIn February 2021, we announced a long-term, global, and strategic collaboration with Toyota and DENSO, one of the largest global automotive manufacturers and tier-\none automotive suppliers, respectively, to build and globally deploy self-driving cars at scale.\nAs part of this collaboration, our engineering teams are jointly developing and testing driverless-capable vehicles equipped with the Aurora Driver, starting with the\nToyota Sienna.

Our first commercial truck with\nVolvo will be adapted to the requirements of the Aurora Driver. These trucks will combine the best of Volvo’s technology with the Aurora Driver into a compelling and scalable\nlogistics platform.\nAs Volvo’s official technology partner for US hub-to-hub solutions, the parties will develop an unprecedented autonomous offering with one of the most trusted\ncommercial truck manufacturers in the world. This partnership will be the center of the integration of the Aurora Driver into Volvo’s on-highway trucks and development of\nindustry-leading Transportation as a Service solutions.\nGovernment Regulation\nAt both the federal and state level, the U.S. provides a positive regulatory environment to permit safe testing and development of autonomous vehicle functionality.\nAurora’s Government Relations team regularly engages with our partners in government to further develop the relationships and regulations necessary to successfully deploy\nour technology.\nAurora has developed bipartisan support of self-driving technology in both chambers of the U.S. Congress as well as the U.S. Department of Transportation and its\nagencies. At Aurora, we work with the federal government to ensure it maintains its regulatory authority over the design, construction, and performance of vehicles and applies\nthat same authority to the regulation of highly automated vehicles.\nAs vehicles equipped with our sensors are deployed on public roads, we will be subject to legal and regulatory authorities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety\nAdministration (NHTSA), the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), state agencies like Departments of Transportation or Departments of Motor Vehicles,\nand local transportation departments. As the development of federal and state legal frameworks around autonomous vehicles continue to evolve, we may be subject to additional\nregulatory schemes. We do not anticipate any near-term federal standards that would impede the foreseeable deployments of our technology. U.S. federal regulations are largely\npermissive of deployments of higher levels of safe and responsible autonomous functionality.\nStates, such as Arizona, Florida, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Texas, continue to attract self-driving companies with a welcoming regulatory climate that provides the\npredictability necessary to deploy our technology in those communities. Some states, particularly California, institute operational requirements or restrictions for certain\nautonomous functions. We believe such hurdles will be removed as we work with our government partners to highlight the benefits of self-driving technology. We work closely\nwith state and local elected officials and regulatory bodies to ensure they continue to welcome the testing and deployment of self-driving vehicles on their roads. By working\nwith these officials to develop technology neutral policies that promote a diverse set of highly automated vehicle use cases and create a level playing field for the industry, we\nbelieve that Aurora will be able deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly.\nSimilar such reporting and regulatory requirements exist or are being developed in foreign markets. For example, markets such as the EU also continue to develop their\nrespective standards to define deployment requirements for higher levels of autonomy. Germany, a leader in the automotive industry, recently approved legislation that would\nallow for the deployment of self-driving technology without a human driver. Given the intense work in these areas, we expect a workable path forward in the near-term.\nWe are subject to the Electronic Product Radiation Control Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. These requirements are enforced by the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (“FDA”). Electronic product radiation includes laser technology. Regulations governing these products are intended to protect the public from\nhazardous or unnecessary exposure. Manufacturers are required to certify in product labeling and in reports to the FDA that their products comply with applicable performance\nstandards as well as maintain manufacturing, testing, and distribution records for their products.\nSimilarly, as a company deploying cutting-edge technology with international partners, we are also subject to trade, customs product classification and sourcing\nregulations. Finally, our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage\nregulations. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee\nhealth and safety.\n11"

The industry can be characterized by a significant number of technical and\ncommercial challenges, including an expectation for better-than-a-human driving performance, large funding requirements, long vehicle development lead times, specialized\nskills and expertise requirements of personnel, inconsistent and evolving regulatory frameworks, a need to build public trust and brand image, and real world operation of an\nentirely new technology. If we are not able to overcome these challenges, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations will be negatively impacted and\nour ability to create a viable business may not materialize at all.\nAlthough we believe that our self-driving systems and supporting technology are promising, we cannot assure you that our technology will succeed commercially. The\nsuccessful development of our self-driving systems and related technology involves many challenges and uncertainties, including:\n•\nachieving sufficiently safe self-driving system performance as determined by us, government & regulatory agencies, our partners, customers, and the general public;\n•\nfinalizing self-driving system design, specification, and vehicle integration;\n•\nsuccessfully completing system testing, validation, and safety approvals;\n•\nobtaining additional approvals, licenses or certifications from regulatory agencies, if required, and maintaining current approvals, licenses or certifications;\n•\nreceiving performance by third parties that supports our R&D and commercial activities;\n•\npreserving core intellectual property rights, while obtaining intellectual property rights, technology or materials from third parties that may be critical to our R&D\nactivities; and\n•\ncontinuing to fund and maintain our current technology development activities.\nWe are an early stage company with a history of losses, and we expect to incur significant expenses and continuing losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred net losses on an annual basis since our inception. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we incurred net losses of\n$1,723 million, $755 million, and $214 million, respectively. We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we begin\ncommercial operation of our self-driving technology, which may take longer than we currently expect or may never occur. Even if we successfully develop and sell our self-\ndriving solutions, there can be no assurance that they will be commercially successful. We expect the rate at which we will incur losses to be substantially higher in future\nperiods (excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment of $1,114 million recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022) as we continue to scale our development\nand commercialize products. Because we will incur the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive incremental revenues with respect thereto, our losses in future\nperiods will be significant. In addition, we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in revenues, which\nwould further increase our losses.\n16"

This relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to\nevaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Risks and challenges we have faced or expect to face include our ability to:\n•\ndesign, develop, test, and validate our self-driving technology for commercial applications;\n•\nproduce and deliver our technology at an acceptable level of safety and performance;\n•\nproperly price our products and services;\n•\nplan for and manage capital expenditures for our current and future products;\n•\nhire, integrate and retain talented people at all levels of our organization;\n•\nforecast our revenue, budget for and manage our expenses;\n•\nattract new partners and retain existing partners;\n•\nnavigate an evolving and complex regulatory environment;\n•\nmanage our supply chain and supplier relationships related to our current and future products;\n•\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;\n•\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\n•\neffectively manage our growth and business operations, including the impacts of unforeseen market changes on our business;\n•\ndevelop and protect intellectual property rights; and\n•\nsuccessfully develop new solutions, features, and applications to enhance the experience of partners and end-customers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above, as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk\nFactors” section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical financial data and operate in\na rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a\nmore predictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies with limited\noperating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or\nchange, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nIt is possible that our technology will have more limited performance or may take us longer to complete than is currently projected. This would adversely impact our\naddressable markets, commercial competitiveness, and business prospects.\nOur products and self-driving system are technical and complex, and commercial application requires that we meet very high standards for technology performance and\nsystem safety. We may be unable to timely release new products that meet our intended commercial use cases, and we may therefore experience more limited monetization of\nour technology. These risks are particularly relevant for factors such as our self-driving system’s operational domain (i.e., the conditions under which our system is designed to\noperate), which includes variables such as traversable road networks, speeds, and weather patterns. It is possible that there may be additional limitations in our operating\ncapabilities depending upon a number of factors, including, for example, vehicle type (e.g. car, truck) and actor density (e.g. pedestrians, cyclists). If that is the case, we may be\nmore restricted in our addressable market opportunities.\nCommercial deployment has taken longer in the self-driving industry than anticipated, and it may take us more time to complete our own technology development and\ncommercialization than is currently projected. The achievement of broadly applicable self-driving technology will require further technology improvements including, for\nexample, handling non-compliant or unexpected actor behavior and inclement weather conditions. These improvements may take us longer than expected which would increase\nour capital requirements for technology development, delay our timeline to commercialization, and reduce the potential financial returns that may be expected from the\nbusiness.\n17"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nWe plan to publicly disclose certain progress and performance metrics, including the Autonomy Readiness Measure and the Autonomy Performance Indicator. These\nmetrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement; real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics and metrics values that are below expectations could materially\nand adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe plan to publicly disclose a measure of our progress toward the commercial launch of Aurora Horizon (the “Autonomy Readiness Measure”). The Autonomy\nReadiness Measure is the weighted function of completeness of our Safety Case (which is an internally-derived, claims-based approach that provides a generalized structured\nargument to addressing safety items implicated by developing and operating self-driving technology on public roads). There are inherent challenges in calculating the Autonomy\nReadiness Measure, including the fact that management judgment is used when applying weighting to individual pieces of evidence that support the claims that we are making\nin our Safety Case (e.g., based on complexity, effort required to complete, scope of the Company’s commercial launch route, etc.) as well as when evaluating the percentage\ncomplete of a particular piece of evidence. If individual pieces of evidence supporting the claims of our Safety Case turn out to be more complex, more challenging to complete,\ninsufficiently comprehensive or conclusive, or more time or capital intensive than we originally anticipated, adjustments will be required to be made to our calculations of the\nAutonomy Readiness Measure. If our Autonomy Readiness Measure is not an accurate representation of our progress toward commercial launch, or if investors perceive this\nmeasure not to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies in the Safety Case or our calculations of the Autonomy Readiness Measure, our reputation may be\nsignificantly harmed, the timing of commercial launch of Aurora Horizon could be delayed, and our stock price could decline, any of which could materially and adversely\naffect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n    We also plan to publicly disclose supplemental information regarding the on-road performance of the Aurora Driver (the “Autonomy Performance Indicator”). There are\ninherent challenges in calculating this metric. For example, one of the components of this indicator is commercially representative miles driven where the vehicle received\nhuman assistance via a vehicle operator intervention or other on-site support, but where it is determined, through internal analysis including simulation, that the support received\nwas not required by the Aurora Driver. There is management judgment involved in using internal analysis to determine whether or not such human assistance was necessary,\nand third parties may reasonably disagree with positions taken by the Company on such determinations. Further, it is possible that we could conclude that human assistance was\nnot necessary even where the Aurora Driver did not perform correctly and/or in a way that we intended. Additionally, we do not expect the Autonomy Performance Indicator to\nincrease linearly as we approach commercial launch, nor do we anticipate that this indicator will be 100% even at launch, because certain situations (e.g., flat tires) will always\nrequire on-site support. If the Autonomy Performance Indicator is not a sufficient or accurate representation of the Aurora Driver’s on-road performance, if investors do not\nperceive it to be accurate, or it does not convey the level of performance anticipated, our reputation may be significantly harmed, our stock price could decline, and it could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking the Autonomy Readiness Measure and the Autonomy\nPerformance Indicator may change over time, which could result in unanticipated changes to the metrics or estimates that we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools\nwe use to track these metrics are not an accurate indicator of our performance or contain other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are\nbased on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring our progress toward\ncommercial launch.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and some market participants have substantially greater resources. If one or more of our competitors broadly commercialize\ntheir self-driving technology before we do, develop superior technology, or are perceived to have better technology, our business prospects and financial performance\nwould be adversely affected.\nThe market for self-driving technology is highly competitive and can be characterized by rapid technological change. Our future success will depend on our ability to\ndevelop and commercialize in a sufficiently timely manner in order to maintain competitiveness. Several companies, including, but not limited to, Waymo, GM Cruise,\nTuSimple, Tesla, Zoox/Amazon, Apple, Motional, Pony.ai, Intel Mobileye, and Embark are investing heavily in building this technology. These companies compete with us\ndirectly by offering self-driving technology for the same or similar use cases. If our competitors, including those previously mentioned, broadly commercialize their technology\nbefore we do, develop superior technology, or are perceived to have better technology, they may capture market opportunities and establish relationships with customers and\npartners that might otherwise have been available to us.\n18"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nMaterial commercialization of self-driving technology first involves pilot deployments, which we and other competitors are currently performing. Competitors may\ninitiate similar deployments in various different use cases and/or geographies earlier than we will. Several of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing,\nR&D, and other resources. In the event that one or many of these competitors broadly commercializes their technology before we do, our business prospects and financial\nperformance would be adversely impacted.\nOur services and technology may not be accepted and adopted by the market at the pace we expect or at all.\nSelf-driving technology is still nascent and is neither generally understood nor universally accepted. We are at risk of adverse publicity that stems from any public\nincident involving self-driving vehicles (whether involving Aurora or a competitor), which could result in decreased end-customer demand for our technology. Part of our\ncommercialization plan includes public awareness and education campaigns, but this guarantees neither public nor customer acceptance of our services. If we cannot gain\nsufficient trust in our technology, we will be unable to commercialize as intended. We may also experience adverse publicity that argues self-driving technology is replacing\nhuman jobs and disrupting the economy. Such media attention could cause current and future partners to terminate their business with us, which would significantly impact our\nability to make future sales.\nFurther, as the market for self-driving cars develops, the differences in the approaches of Aurora and others will become more widely known to suppliers, insurers,\nregulators and others. Until these distinctions are known and appreciated, the actions of a single market participant may be imputed to the self-driving industry as a whole. As\nsuch, as a result of an action or inaction by a third-party, it is possible that suppliers, insurers, regulators and others may refuse or cease to interact with or conduct business with\nthe self-driving industry as a whole, including Aurora.\nIf the market does not accept and adopt our services and technology at the pace we expect or at all, it could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect that our business model will become less capital intensive as we transition our business to our Driver as a Service model and if that transition is delayed or does\nnot occur, we will require significant additional capital investment to run our business.\nOur business plan envisions a two-phase process for ownership and operation of Aurora-powered self-driving vehicles. Early in our commercialization, we intend to own\nor lease and operate a limited fleet and will invest in self-driving system hardware, base vehicles, and commercial facilities (such as freight terminals). We believe this firsthand\nexperience will help us to harden our operational processes, service level agreements, and enable a more effective transition to working with external partners on operational\nactivities. After this initial period of Aurora ownership and operation, we expect to transition to a Driver as a Service business model. Under this model, one or more third-party\npartners would own and operate Aurora-powered vehicles and would also manage activities such as financing, maintenance, cleaning, and fleet facilities.\nSince it is more capital-intensive for us to own or lease and operate our own fleet of vehicles, any delay in the transition to the Driver as a Service model will require\nadditional investments of capital and could mean we may not be able to reach scale as quickly as projected in prior filings. In addition, it is possible that we may be required to\nfund and operate commercial facilities as part of our product offering, as opposed to partnering with third parties. Although we believe, based on partner discussions, that such a\ntransition will be possible in our intended timeframes, there is no guarantee that third parties will be able or willing to own and operate Aurora-powered vehicles as soon or\nramp as quickly as expected at desirable commercial terms. Similarly, we expect to partner with other third parties who will own and operate terminal facilities, but we may\ndetermine that we will need to own or operate more of these facilities ourselves. Such difficulties could have adverse impacts on our business, prospects, financial condition,\nand growth potential. As such, this model may present unpredictable challenges associated with third-party dependency which could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\n19"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nIt is possible that Aurora’s self-driving unit economics do not materialize as expected, in particular as we transition to our Driver as a Service model. This could\nsignificantly hinder our ability to generate a commercially viable product and adversely affect our business prospects.\nOur business model is premised on our future expectations and assumptions regarding unit economics of the Aurora Driver and our transition, including the timing\nthereof, to our Driver as a Service model. There are uncertainties in these assumptions and we may not be able to achieve the unit economics we expect for many reasons,\nincluding but not limited to:\n•\ncosts of the self-driving system hardware;\n•\nother fixed and variable costs associated with self-driving vehicle operation;\n•\nuseful life;\n•\nvehicle utilization; and\n•\nproduct pricing.\nTo manage self-driving hardware costs, we must engineer cost-effective designs for our sensors, computers, and vehicles, achieve adequate scale, and freeze hardware\nspecifications while enabling continued software improvements. In addition, we must continuously push initiatives to optimize supporting cost components such as vehicle and\nself-driving system maintenance, cloud storage, telecom data feed, facilities, cleaning, operations personnel costs, and useful life. This will require significant coordination with\nour third-party fleet partners and adequate cost management may not materialize as expected or at all, which would have material adverse effects on our business prospects.\nSelf-driving technology is a new product and the appropriate price points are still being determined. Additionally, increased competition may result in pricing pressure\nand reduced margins and may impede our ability to increase the revenue of our technology or cause us to lose market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable changes in any of these or other unit economics-related factors, many of which are beyond our control,\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of our senior management team and, specifically, our Chief Executive Officer, and if we are not successful in retaining our senior\nmanagement team and, in particular, our Chief Executive Officer, and in attracting or retaining other highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully\nimplement our business strategy.\nOur success depends, in significant part, on the continued services of our senior management team, which has extensive experience in the self-driving industry. The loss\nof any one or more members of our senior management team, for any reason, including resignation or retirement, could impair our ability to execute our business strategy and\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, we are highly dependent on Chris Urmson, our Founder and Chief\nExecutive Officer, who remains deeply involved in all aspects of our business, including product development. If Mr. Urmson ceased to be involved with Aurora, this would\nadversely affect our business because his loss could make it more difficult to, among other things, compete with other market participants, manage our R&D activities and retain\nexisting partners or cultivate new ones. Negative public perception of, or negative news related to, Mr. Urmson may adversely affect our brand, relationship with partners or\nstanding in the industry.\nOur success similarly hinges on the ability to attract, motivate, develop and retain a sufficient number of other highly skilled personnel, including software, hardware,\nsystems engineering, automotive, safety, operations, design, finance, marketing, and support personnel. Competition for qualified highly skilled personnel can be strong, and we\ncan provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel now or in the future. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares of our\ncapital stock they own or the shares of our capital stock underlying their equity incentive awards have significantly reduced in value or the vested shares of our capital stock\nthey own or vested shares of our capital stock underlying their equity incentive awards have significantly appreciated. The significant reduction in the value of our common\nstock may require us to grant additional or larger individual equity incentive awards in order to prevent employee departures and to attract new personnel. The issuance of\nadditional shares upon settlement or exercise of those awards would result in dilution to the holders of our common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale\nin the public market, and may have a negative impact on our stock price.\n20"

Further, any inability to recruit, develop and retain qualified employees may result in high employee turnover and may force\nus to pay significantly higher wages, which may harm our profitability.\nAdditionally, we do not carry key man insurance for any of our management executives, and the loss of any key employee or our inability to recruit, develop and retain\nthese individuals as needed, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur business plans require a significant amount of capital. In addition, our future capital needs may require us to sell additional equity or debt securities that may dilute\nour stockholders.\nThe fact that we have a limited operating history means we have limited historical data on the demand for our products and services. As a result, our future capital\nrequirements are uncertain and actual capital requirements may be different from those we currently anticipate. We expect to continue investing in research and development to\nimprove our self-driving technology. We expect we will need to seek equity or debt financing to fund a portion of our future expenditures. Such financing might not be available\nto us in a timely manner, on terms that are acceptable, or at all.\nOur ability to obtain the necessary financing to carry out our business plan is subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions and investor acceptance\nof our business model. Additional funding may be more difficult to obtain, or may be more expensive, as a result of increases in inflation and interest rates in the U.S. economy\ngenerally. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of such financing unattractive or unavailable to us. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds, we will\nhave to significantly reduce our spending, delay or cancel our planned activities, or substantially change our corporate structure, which could have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness and financial prospects.\nWe may experience difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations.\nWe expect to experience significant growth in the scope and nature of our operations. Our ability to manage our operations and future growth will require us to continue\nto improve our operational, financial and management controls, compliance programs and systems automation. We are currently in the process of strengthening our compliance\nprograms, including in relation to export controls, privacy and cybersecurity and anti-corruption. We will also need to reduce our reliance on manual operations in the areas of\nbilling and reporting and make certain other improvements to support our complex arrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense recognition for our future\noperations. We may not be able to implement improvements in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing controls, programs, systems and\nprocedures, which could have an adverse effect on the accuracy of our reporting, business relationships, reputation and financial results.\nOur operating and financial results projections that were previously provided rely in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions or\nanalyses prove to be incorrect, our actual results of operations may be materially different from projections that we previously filed and our estimates of certain financial\nmetrics may prove inaccurate.\nWe use various estimates in formulating our business plans. We base our estimates upon a number of assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and\neconomic uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. Our estimates therefore may prove inaccurate, causing the actual amount to differ from our\nestimates. These factors include, without limitation:\n•\nassumptions around vehicle miles traveled (“VMT”);\n•\nthe degree of utilization achieved by our self-driving technology;\n•\nthe price our customers are willing to pay;\n•\nthe timing and breadth of our technology’s operating domain and product models;\n•\noperational costs of our self-driving technology and their useful life;\n•\ngrowth in core development and operating expenses;\n21"

Previously announced projections, forecasts and estimates relating to the\nexpected size and growth of the markets for self-driving technology may prove similarly imprecise. We are pursuing prospects in multiple markets that are undergoing rapid\nchanges, including in technological and regulatory areas, and it is difficult to predict the timing and size of the opportunities.\nUnfavorable changes in any of the above or other factors, including around the total addressable market and market opportunity, most of which are beyond our control,\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of growing our business, we have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions. If we fail to successfully select, execute or integrate our acquisitions, it could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our stock price could decline.\nFrom time to time, we may undertake acquisitions to add new products and technologies, acquire talent, form new strategic partnerships, or enter into new markets or\ngeographies. In addition to possible stockholder approval, we may need approvals and licenses from relevant government authorities for such future acquisitions and to comply\nwith any applicable laws and regulations, which could result in increased delay and costs, and may disrupt our business strategy if such approvals are ultimately denied.\nFurthermore, acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets, businesses, key personnel, partners and end-customers, vendors and suppliers require significant\nattention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nAdditionally, acquired assets or businesses may not generate the financial results we expect. Key personnel or large numbers of employees who join Aurora through\nacquisitions may decide to leave Aurora to work for other businesses or competitors of Aurora, thereby diminishing the value of our acquisitions. Acquisitions could result in\nthe use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence of significant goodwill impairments, amortization expenses for other\nintangible assets and exposure to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business. Additionally, the acquisition and integration processes create a risk that management\nand employees of Aurora become distracted. Finally, the costs of identifying and consummating acquisitions may be significant. Failure to successfully identify, complete,\nmanage and integrate acquisitions could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and could cause our stock price to\ndecline.\n22"

We utilize reputable third-\nparty service providers or vendors for a substantial portion of our data and source code, and these providers could also be vulnerable to harms similar to those that could damage\nour systems, including sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism causing potential disruptions. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance,\nespecially during peak usage times, as we expand the usage of our platform.

The techniques used by cyber\nattackers change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, and we may face difficulties and delays in identifying, responding to, and otherwise\naddressing security breaches and incidents. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, more of our and our service providers’ personnel are working remotely, which increases the risks of\nsecurity breaches and cyberattacks. Although we maintain and continue to develop information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property,\ntechnology, and materials theft, data breaches and other cyber incidents, including a formal incident response plan, such measures will require updates and improvements, and\nwe cannot guarantee that such measures will be adequate to detect, prevent or mitigate cyber incidents. The implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of\nthese systems requires significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving, expanding and updating\ncurrent systems, including the disruption of our data management, procurement, production execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes. These risks may\naffect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or produce, sell, deliver and service our solutions, adequately protect our intellectual property\nrights and proprietary or competitively sensitive information, technology or materials, or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, applicable\nlaws, regulations and contracts. Further, we utilize reputable third-party service providers or vendors for a substantial portion of our data and source code. We cannot be sure\nthat the systems upon which we rely, including those of our third-party vendors or suppliers, will be effectively implemented, maintained or expanded as planned. If we do not\nsuccessfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be\nimpaired, and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our intellectual\nproperty rights and proprietary or competitively sensitive information, technology or materials could be compromised or misappropriated, and our reputation may be adversely\naffected. If these systems do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing\nthese functions.\nA significant cyber incident could impact production capability, harm our reputation, cause us to breach our contracts with other parties or subject us to regulatory\ninquiries, investigations, and other proceedings, or claims, demands, or other litigation, and otherwise create material costs and liabilities, any of which could materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our insurance coverage for cyber-attacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we\nmay experience as a result of a cyber incident, and any cyber incident may result in an increase in our costs for insurance or insurance not being available to us on economically\nfeasible terms, or at all. Insurers may also deny us coverage as to any future claim. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\n24"

Aurora-\npowered vehicles contain complex IT systems and are designed with built-in data connectivity. We are implementing security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access\nto the information technology networks and systems installed in our vehicles. However, hackers or unauthorized third parties may attempt to gain unauthorized access to\nmodify, alter, and use such networks and systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles’ functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to access data\nstored in or generated by our products. As techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against\nus or our third-party service providers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to anticipate, or implement adequate measures to protect against, these attacks. Any such\nsecurity incidents could result in unexpected control of or changes to the vehicles’ functionality and safe operation and any such incidents, or the reporting or perception that\nthey have occurred, could result in legal claims or proceedings, regulatory inquiries, investigations, and other proceedings, and negative publicity and harm to our reputation,\nwhich would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. Additionally, any similar incidents suffered by our\ncompetitors or other companies in the self-driving vehicle ecosystem, or the reporting or perception of them having occurred, may also result in negative publicity and concerns\nabout the security of self-driving technology, which could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\nFailures, or perceived failures, to comply with privacy, data protection, and information security requirements in the variety of jurisdictions in which we operate, or may\noperate, may adversely impact our business, and such legal requirements are evolving, uncertain and may require improvements in, or changes to, our policies and\noperations.\nOur current and potential future operations and sales subject us to laws and regulations addressing privacy and the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer and\nprotection of a variety of types of data. For example, the European Commission has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation and California enacted the California\nConsumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, which went into effect January 1, 2023, both of which provide for potentially\nmaterial penalties for non-compliance. Numerous other jurisdictions have proposed or enacted legislation addressing these matters, including state laws similar to the California\nConsumer Privacy Act that have taken, or will take, effect in 2023. These regimes may, among other things, impose data security requirements, disclosure requirements, and\nrestrictions on data collection, uses, and sharing that may impact our operations and the development of our business. These laws and regulations are evolving rapidly, with new\nlaws and regulations proposed and enacted frequently in various jurisdictions. While, generally, we do not have access to, collect, store, process, or share information collected\nby our solutions unless our partners choose to proactively provide such information to us, our products may evolve both to address potential partner requirements or to add new\nfeatures and functionality that may change our obligations under existing or future laws, regulations, contractual obligations or other actual or asserted obligations to which we\nare or may become subject, including industry standards. Therefore, the full impact of these regimes on our business is rapidly evolving across jurisdictions and remains\nuncertain at this time.\nWe may also be affected by cyber-attacks and other means of gaining unauthorized access to our technology, systems, and data. For instance, cyber criminals, insiders or\nunauthorized third parties may target us or third parties with which we have business relationships to obtain data, or in a manner that disrupts our operations or compromises\nour products or the systems into which our products are integrated.\n25"

Since these regimes are evolving,\nuncertain and complex, especially for a global business like ours, we may need to update or enhance our compliance measures as our products, markets and end-customer\ndemands further develop, and these updates or enhancements may require implementation costs, including costs to modify our practices with respect to data storage, data use,\nand other aspects of data processing, and we may face allegations that laws, regulations, or other actual or asserted obligations are consistent with our practices or the features of\nour solutions. In addition, we may not be able to monitor and react to all developments in a timely manner. The compliance measures we do adopt may prove ineffective. Any\nfailure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with current and future regulatory, partner or end-customer-driven privacy, data protection, and information security obligations\nthat apply, or are argued to apply, to us, or to prevent or mitigate security breaches or incidents, cyber-attacks, or improper access to, use of, or disclosure of data, or any security\nissues or cyber-attacks affecting us, could result in significant liability, costs (including the costs of mitigation and recovery), and a material loss of revenue resulting from the\nadverse impact on our reputation and brand, loss or unavailability of or an inability to use or process proprietary information and data, disruption to our business and\nrelationships, and diminished ability to retain or attract partners and end-customers. Such events may result in governmental enforcement inquiries, investigations, and other\nproceedings and actions, private claims, demands, and litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause partners and end-customers to lose trust in us, which\ncould have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nOur future insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks or may be prohibitively expensive.\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from product liability, accidents, acts of God, and other claims against us, for which we may\nhave no insurance coverage. Further, because we operate in a new and thus inherently risky industry, insurance policies may not be available to us on terms and rates that are\nacceptable to us or at all. In addition, as a general matter, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, and we cannot be certain\nthat our future insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay\nsubstantial amounts, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, actions or inactions of others in our\nindustry, through no fault of our own, may materially increase the cost of insurance and/or materially decrease the coverages available to us on commercially reasonable terms.\nAny financial or economic crisis, or perceived threat of such a crisis, including a significant decrease in consumer confidence, could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, the United States and global economies suffered dramatic downturns as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a deterioration in the credit markets and\nrelated financial crisis as well as a variety of other factors including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit\navailability, ratings downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. The United States and certain foreign governments have taken unprecedented actions\nin an attempt to address and rectify these extreme market and economic conditions by providing liquidity and stability to the financial markets. If the actions taken by these\ngovernments are not successful, the return of adverse economic conditions may negatively impact the demand for our technology and may negatively impact our ability to raise\ncapital, if needed, on a timely basis and on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur financial instruments, including warrants, are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in fair value could have a material effect on our financial results.\nIncluded on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 contained elsewhere in this Annual Report are derivative liabilities related to embedded features contained within\nour public and private placement warrants as well as shares issued to Reinvent Sponsor Y LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company (the “Sponsor”) with price-based\nvesting criteria.\nAccounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”), provides for the remeasurement of the fair value of such derivatives at each balance\nsheet date, with a resulting non-cash gain or loss related to the change in the fair value being recognized in earnings in the statement of operations. As a result of the recurring\nfair value measurement, our financial statements and results of operations may fluctuate quarterly, based on factors which are outside of our control. Due to the recurring fair\nvalue measurement, we expect that we will recognize non-cash gains or losses on these financial instruments each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or losses\ncould be material. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\n26"

Our management is likewise required, on a\nquarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses identified through such evaluation in those internal\ncontrols.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud, and a material weaknesses could result in us being unable to\nmaintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors losing\nconfidence in our financial reporting, our securities price declining or us facing litigation as a result of the foregoing.\nIf we identify any material weaknesses in the future, any such identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or\ndisclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law\nrequirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting\nand our stock price may decline as a result. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid\npotential future material weaknesses.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates, adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income, changes in tax laws or regulations, changes in our ability to\nutilize our net operating losses, or other tax-related changes could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will be subject to income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, and our tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing\njurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax\nassets and liabilities; expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances; tax effects of stock-based compensation; changes in tax laws, regulations or\ninterpretations thereof; or lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in\njurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could materially and adversely\naffect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax\nassets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, we may be subject to income tax audits by various tax jurisdictions. Although we believe our\nincome tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles, an adverse resolution by one or more taxing authorities\ncould have a material impact on the results of our operations.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had estimated U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $1,166 million and $1,116 million, respectively. Our U.S. federal\nand state net operating loss carryforwards subject to expiration will begin to expire in 2036 and 2029, respectively. In general, we may potentially use these net operating losses\nto offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Furthermore, U.S. federal net operating losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017\nmay only be used to offset 80% of our taxable income. This may require us to pay U.S. federal income taxes in future years despite generating a loss for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes in prior years. Limitations under state law may differ. We have established a valuation allowance against the carrying value of these deferred tax assets.\n27"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nIn addition to the potential net operating loss carryforward limitations previously note above, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that\nundergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income. The limitations\napply if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by one or\nmore stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of a company’s stock over a three-year period. If we have experienced an ownership change at any time since\nour incorporation, we may already be subject to limitations on our ability to utilize our existing net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset taxable income\nor tax liability. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change. Similar provisions of state tax law\nmay also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, even if we earn net taxable income in the future, our ability to use these or our pre-change net\noperating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income or tax liability may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future\nincome tax liability to us.\nRecent changes and currently proposed changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\nAs previously noted above, we are and will be generally subject to tax laws, regulations, and policies of several taxing jurisdictions. In addition, potential changes in tax\nlaws, as well as other factors, could cause us to experience fluctuations in our future tax obligations and effective tax rates and otherwise adversely affect our future tax\npositions and/or our future tax liabilities. For example, in August of 2022 the United States enacted a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks and a 15% alternative minimum tax on\nadjusted financial statement income as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Further, many countries, and organizations such as the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development have proposed implementing changes to existing tax laws, including a proposed 15% global minimum tax. Any of these developments or changes\nin U.S. federal, state, or international tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our future effective tax rate and our operating results. There can be no assurance that our\nfuture effective tax rates or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these or other developments or changes in law.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nOur success is contingent on our ability to successfully maintain, manage, execute and expand on our existing partnerships and obtain new partnerships.\nOur self-driving technology is integrated into the vehicles of our OEM partners, while logistics services partners, ride-sharing partners and fleet service partners can act\nas both a customer and an operator of Aurora-powered vehicles. While we are providing our self-driving technology to these partners, they are simultaneously providing their\nvehicles, fleet operational activities, and, in some cases, access to end-customers.\nIn order for this business model to be successful, we will need to enter into definitive long-term contracts and commercial arrangements with partners such as PACCAR,\nUber, Toyota and Volvo, which expand upon the current agreements and historic working relationships we have in place. In the event such contracts do not materialize, we may\nnot be able to implement our business strategy in the timeframe anticipated, or at all. If we are unable to enter into definitive agreements or are only able to do so on terms that\nare unfavorable to us, we may not be able to timely identify adequate strategic relationship opportunities, or form strategic relationships, and consequently, we may not be able\nto fully carry out our business plans. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on our statements about our development plans and partnerships or their feasibility\nin the timeframe anticipated, or at all.\nPartners and end-customers may be less likely to purchase our products if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service, technology, and other\noperations will continue in the long term. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us\nif they are not convinced that our business will succeed. Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among partners, end-customers,\nsuppliers, analysts, ratings agencies and other parties in our products, long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be particularly\ncomplicated by certain factors including those that are largely outside of our control, such as our limited operating history, end-customer unfamiliarity with our technology, any\ndelays in scaling production, delivery and service operations to meet demand, competition and uncertainty regarding the future of self-driving vehicles or our other services\ncompared with market expectations.\n28"

We refer to these component suppliers as our single source suppliers. These components are susceptible to supply shortages, long lead times for components, and\nsupply changes, any of which could disrupt our supply chain and could delay commercialization of our products to users. For example, the Aurora Driver relies on single source\nsuppliers for several components including GPU microchips which we use for machine learning inference, vehicle gateway electronic control units, and automotive radar\nsensors. Supply of these components world-wide may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as industry consolidation and geopolitical conditions such as\ninternational trade wars like the U.S. trade war with China, Russia’s actions in Ukraine and increased political tensions in Russia, Europe or Asia. Such shortages, increased\ncomponent lead times, reduced allocations of components and decommitments of orders have resulted in and may continue to result in increased component prices, fewer\nsourcing options, unpredictability of supply, prolonged manufacturing disruptions and increased product lead times.\nWe are reliant on third-party suppliers to design, develop, industrialize and manufacture components for us. In order for these suppliers to undertake the investment\nneeded to produce these components, they may require us to commit to terms, pricing or purchase volumes that are not acceptable to us.\nWhile we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source and other\ncomponents, we may be unable to do so in the short term (or at all) at prices or quality levels and/or on terms that are favorable to us and we may experience significant delays\nwhile re-engineering our system to accept any replacement parts.\nManufacturing in collaboration with partners is subject to risks.\nOur business model relies on outsourced manufacturing of vehicles and will include outsourced manufacturing of our self-driving system hardware and vehicle\nintegration. The cost of tooling a manufacturing facility with a collaboration partner is high, but the exact dollar value will not be known until we enter into specific\nmanufacturing agreements. Collaboration with third parties to manufacture vehicles and self-driving system hardware is subject to risks that are outside of our control. We have\nin the past, and could in the future, experience delays in development and production when and if our partners do not meet agreed upon timelines or experience capacity\nconstraints. There is a risk of potential disputes with partners, which could stop or slow vehicle production, and we could be affected by adverse publicity related to our\npartners, whether or not such publicity is related to such third parties’ collaboration with us. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will not deviate from agreed-\nupon quality standards.\nWe may be unable to enter into agreements with manufacturers on terms and conditions acceptable to us and therefore we may need to contract with other third parties or\nsignificantly add to our own production capacity. We may not be able to engage other third parties or establish or expand our own production capacity to meet our needs on\nacceptable terms, or at all. The expense and time required to adequately complete any transition may be greater than anticipated. Any of the foregoing could materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nBurdensome regulations, inconsistent regulations, or a failure to receive regulatory approvals of our technology could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operation.\nThere has been relatively little mandatory federal government regulation of the self-driving industry to date. Currently, there are no Federal Motor Vehicle Safety\nStandards that relate to the performance of self-driving technology. While our team includes nationally recognized safety experts and we have built organizational, operational,\nand safety processes to ensure that the performance of our technology meets rigorous standards, there can be no assurance that these measures will meet future regulatory\nrequirements enacted by government bodies nor that future regulatory requirements will not inherently limit the operation and commercialization of self-driving technology. In\nsome jurisdictions, we could be required to present our own safety justification and evidence base, and in other areas it is possible that we may be required to pass specific self-\ndriving safety tests. We have not yet tested our technology to the full extent possible, in all conditions under which we anticipate operations to occur. The failure to pass these\nsafety tests or receive appropriate regulatory approvals for commercialization would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue at the rate we anticipate.\n29"

For example, in Europe, certain vehicle safety regulations apply to automated braking and steering systems, and certain treaties also restrict the\nlegality of certain higher levels of automation, while certain U.S. states have legal restrictions on automation, and many other states are considering them. Such a regulatory\npatchwork could hinder the commercial deployment of our technology and have adverse effects on our business prospects and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations that commonly apply to e-commerce businesses, such as those related to privacy and personal information, tax and consumer\nprotection. These laws and regulations vary from one jurisdiction to another and future legislative and regulatory action, court decisions or other governmental action, which\nmay be affected by, among other things, political pressures, attitudes and climates, as well as personal biases, may have a material impact on our operations and financial\nresults.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations and trade and economic sanctions. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products and solutions are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs\nregulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls as well as similar controls\nestablished in the countries in which we do business. Export control laws and regulations and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to\nembargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. In addition, complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular geography may be time-\nconsuming and result in the delay or loss of revenue opportunities. Exports of our products and technology must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If we\nfail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or\nimport privileges, fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers.\nAdditionally, any allegations of non-compliance with sanctions laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, prosecution,\nenforcement actions, fines, damages, severe administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, loss of export privileges, collateral consequences, remedial measures, suspension or\ndebarment from government contracts and legal expenses, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations and also our reputation.\nFor example, the U.S. government recently announced new controls restricting the ability to send certain products and technology related to semiconductors,\nsemiconductor manufacturing, and supercomputing to China without an export license. These new controls also apply to certain hardware containing these specified integrated\ncircuits. It is possible that the Chinese government will retaliate in ways that could impact our business. Additionally, these restrictions could disrupt the ability of China to\nproduce semiconductors and other electronics and impact our ability to source components from China.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that\ncould limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries. Any change in export or import\nregulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies\ntargeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products and solutions to, existing or potential end\ncustomers with international operations or create delays in the introduction of our products and solutions into international markets. Any decreased use of our products and\nsolutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products and solutions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n30"

In addition, we have in\nthe past and could face in the future a variety of labor and employment claims against us, which could include but is not limited to general discrimination, wage and hour,\nprivacy, ERISA or disability claims. In such matters, government agencies or private parties may seek to recover from us very large, indeterminate amounts in penalties or\nmonetary damages (including, in some cases, treble or punitive damages) or seek to limit our operations in some way. These types of disputes could require significant\nmanagement time and attention or could involve substantial legal liability, adverse regulatory outcomes, and/or substantial expenses to defend.

No assurances can be given that any proceedings and claims will not have a material and adverse impact on\nour business, financial condition or results of operations or that our established reserves or our available insurance will mitigate this impact.\nChanges to global political, regulatory and economic conditions or foreign laws and policies, or interpretation of existing foreign laws and policies, could materially and\nadversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in global political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, research, manufacturing, development, technology, and\ninvestment in the territories or countries where we currently purchase our components, sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business. The U.S.\nhas recently instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the\nU.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our\nbusiness. A number of other nations have proposed or instituted similar measures directed at trade with the United States in response. As a result of these developments, there\nmay be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade that could adversely affect our business. Additionally, certain existing and future foreign political,\nregulatory and economic conditions, such as ongoing geopolitical tensions related to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, resulting sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries,\nand retaliatory actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions, may make it impractical or impossible to launch in certain markets, may delay our launch in certain\nmarkets, or may impose onerous conditions to launch in such markets (e.g., requiring a local partner and/or the disclosure of proprietary or competitively sensitive information,\ntechnology or materials). It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations to adapt to or comply with any such changes, and any failure to do so\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to, and must remain in compliance with, numerous laws and governmental regulations concerning the manufacturing, use, distribution and sale of our\nproducts.

Federal, state\nand local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require the current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate\nhazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at or from the property. Under federal law, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or\noperators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Compliance with\nenvironmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures. In addition, we could incur costs to comply with such current or future laws and regulations, the\nviolation of which could lead to substantial fines and penalties.\nWe may have to pay governmental entities or third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs that they incurred in connection with any\ncontamination at our current and former properties without regard to whether we knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Liability under these laws may be strict,\njoint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of waste directly attributable to us.\nEven if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by these environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-\nup costs incurred. Environmental liabilities could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance.

The\nFCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees and business partners acting on our behalf, including agents, from corruptly offering,\npromising, authorizing or providing anything of value to a “foreign official” for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise\nobtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires publicly listed companies to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately reflect transactions and\ndispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. The U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and other anti-corruption laws also prohibit non-\ngovernmental “commercial” bribery and soliciting or accepting bribes. We sometimes leverage third parties to conduct our business abroad. We, our employees, agents,\nrepresentatives, business partners and third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or\naffiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries\neven if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. Our policies and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations may not be sufficient\nand our directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants, agents, and business partners could engage in improper conduct for which we may be held responsible. As\nwe increase our international conduct of business, our risks under these laws may increase.\nAny allegations or non-compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, adverse\nmedia coverage, investigations, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, severe administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, loss of export privileges, collateral\nconsequences, remedial measures, and legal expenses, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations\nand also our reputation.

Regulations governing these products are intended to protect the public from hazardous or unnecessary exposure and are enforced by the FDA.\nManufacturers are required to certify in product labeling and reports to the FDA that their products comply with applicable performance standards as well as maintain\nmanufacturing, testing, and distribution records for their products. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, which could require\nus to cease distribution of our products, recall or remediate products already distributed to partners or end-customers, or subject us to FDA enforcement.\nWe may be subject to product liability that could result in significant direct or indirect costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nOur self-driving technology presents the risk of significant injury, including fatalities. We may be subject to claims if our technology is involved in an accident and\npersons are injured or purport to be injured. The occurrence of any errors or defects in our products could make us liable for damages and legal claims. In addition, we could\nincur significant costs to correct such issues, potentially including product recalls. Any negative publicity related to the perceived quality of our technology could affect our\nbrand image, partner and end-customer demand, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, liability claims may\nresult in litigation, including class actions, the occurrence of which could be costly, lengthy and distracting and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nAny product recall of ours or our partners in the future may result in adverse publicity, damage our brand and could materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if any vehicles powered by our self-driving technology prove to\nbe defective or non-compliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards. Such recalls involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other\nresources, which could materially and adversely affect our brand image in our target markets, as well as our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOnce we commercialize our technology, we may be required to obtain specialized insurance, which may not be available to the capacity or on the terms that we require\nto achieve the economics we expect. Further, any insurance that we carry may not be sufficient or it may not apply to all situations. Similarly, our partners could be subjected to\nclaims as a result of such accidents and bring legal claims against us to attempt to hold us liable. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our brand,\nrelationships with partners, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights\nDespite the actions we are taking to defend and protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary interests, we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce\nour intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized parties from copying or reverse engineering our solutions. Our efforts to protect and enforce our intellectual\nproperty rights and prevent third parties from violating our rights may be costly.\nThe success of our products and our business depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and other intellectual property rights and maintain adequate legal protection\nfor our products in the United States and other international jurisdictions. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws, as well\nas confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection.\nWe cannot assure you that any patents will be issued with respect to our currently pending patent applications or that any trademarks will be registered with respect to\nour currently pending applications in a manner that gives us adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages, if at all, or that any patents issued to us or any trademarks\nregistered by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We have filed for patents and trademarks in the United States and in certain international jurisdictions, but\nsuch protections may not be available in all countries in which we operate or in which we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, or may be difficult to enforce in\npractice. Our currently-issued and applied-for patent and trademark registrations and applications, and any future patents and trademarks that may be issued, registered or\napplied for, as applicable, may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. We also cannot be certain that\nthe steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop\ntechnologies that are competitive to us or infringe our intellectual property rights.\n33"

Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or reverse engineer our technology or certain\naspects of our solutions that we consider proprietary. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to prevent unauthorized\nparties from copying or reverse engineering our solutions, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to block the importation of infringing\nproducts into the United States.\nAny such litigation, whether initiated by us or a third party, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we obtain favorable outcomes in litigation, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies,\nespecially in the context of unauthorized parties copying or reverse engineering our solutions.\nFurther, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defending intellectual property rights infringement\nclaims and to enforcing their intellectual property rights than we have. Attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their\nown intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights or claims against us or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part.\nEffective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available, and competitors\nbased in other countries may sell infringing products in one or more markets where our intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce or afforded less protection. Failure to\nadequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage\nand a decrease in our revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThird-party claims that we are infringing intellectual property rights, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive\nlicenses, and our business could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we hold key patents related to our products, a number of companies, both within and outside of the self-driving vehicle industry, hold other patents covering\naspects of self-driving technology. In addition to these patents, participants in this industry typically also protect their technology, especially embedded software, through\ncopyrights and trade secrets. In recent years, there has been significant litigation globally involving patents and other intellectual property rights. We have received, and in the\nfuture may receive, inquiries from other intellectual property rights holders and may become subject to claims that we infringe their intellectual property rights, particularly as\nwe expand our presence in the market, expand to new use cases and face increasing competition. We are also party to certain agreements that may limit our trademark rights in\ncertain jurisdictions; while we believe these agreements are unlikely to have a significant impact on our business as currently conducted, our ability to use our existing\ntrademarks in new business lines in the future may be limited. In addition, parties may claim that the names and branding of our products infringe their trademark rights in\ncertain countries or territories. Although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, if such a claim were to prevail, we may have to change the names and\nbranding of our products in the affected territories and we could incur other costs.\nWe currently have a number of agreements in effect pursuant to which we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our partners, suppliers, and channel\npartners and other partners from damages and costs which may arise from the infringement by our products of third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. The scope\nof these indemnity obligations varies, but may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorneys’ fees. We do not carry insurance to\ncover intellectual property rights infringement claims. A claim that our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, even if untrue, could adversely affect our\nrelationships with our partners, may deter future partners from purchasing our products and could expose us to costly litigation and settlement expenses. Even if we are not a\nparty to any litigation between a partner and a third party relating to infringement by our products, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us\nto defend our products against intellectual property rights infringement claims in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party.

Further, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay\nsubstantial damages or obtain an injunction. An adverse determination also could invalidate our intellectual property rights and adversely affect our ability to offer our products\nto our partners and may require that we procure or develop substitute products that do not infringe, which could require significant effort and expense. Any of these events could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property rights infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and could cause us to incur substantial costs.\nCompanies, organizations or individuals, including our current and future competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would\nprevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop or sell our products, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, we\nmay receive inquiries from holders of patents or trademarks inquiring whether we are infringing their proprietary rights and/or seek court declarations that they do not infringe\nupon our intellectual property rights. Companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights relating to self-driving technology (including sensors, hardware and\nsoftware for self-driving vehicles) or other related technology may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise asserting their rights and seeking licenses. In\naddition, if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to do one or more of the following:\n•\ncease selling, incorporating or using products that incorporate or use the challenged intellectual property rights;\n•\npay substantial damages;\n•\nobtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or\n•\nredesign our technology.\nA successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and\nmanagement’s attention.\nWe also hold licenses to intellectual property rights from third parties, including inbound licenses provided in connection with commercial and other arrangements, and\nwe may face claims that our exercises of these intellectual property rights infringe the rights of others. In such cases, we may seek indemnification from our licensors under our\nlicense contracts with them. However, our rights to indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our costs and losses, depending on our use of the technology,\nwhether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation, and other factors.\nWe rely on licenses from third parties for intellectual property rights that are critical to our business, and we would lose the rights to such intellectual property rights if\nthose agreements were terminated or not renewed.\nWe expect that the long-term contracts and commercial arrangements that we have and intend to enter into with partners may include licenses. We rely on these licenses\nfrom our partners for certain intellectual property rights that are or may become critical to our business. Termination of our current or future partner agreements could cause us\nto have to negotiate new or amended agreements with less favorable terms or cause us to lose our rights under the original agreements.\nIn the case of a loss of intellectual property rights relating to technology used in our systems, we may not be able to continue to manufacture certain components for our\nproduct or for our operations or may experience disruption to our manufacturing processes as we test and re-qualify any potential replacement technology.

If another party has filed a patent application to the same subject matter as we have, we may not be entitled to the protection sought by the patent application.\nWe also cannot be certain whether the claims included in a patent application will ultimately be allowed in the applicable issued patent. Further, the scope of protection of\nissued patent claims is often difficult to determine. As a result, we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will issue, or that our issued patents will afford\nprotection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, our competitors may design around our issued patents, which could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs our patents may expire and may not be extended, our patent applications may not be granted and our patent rights may be contested, circumvented, invalidated or\nlimited in scope. In particular, we may not be able to prevent others from developing or exploiting competing technologies, which could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be granted patents pursuant to our pending applications. Even if our patent applications succeed and we are issued patents in\naccordance with them, these patents may still be contested, circumvented or invalidated in the future. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us\nwith meaningful protection or competitive advantages. The claims under any patents that issue from our patent applications may not be broad enough to prevent others from\ndeveloping technologies that are similar or that achieve results similar to ours. The intellectual property rights of others could also bar us from licensing and exploiting any\npatents that issue from our pending applications. Numerous patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in the fields in which we have developed and are\ndeveloping our technology. These patents and patent applications might have priority over our patent applications and could subject our patent applications to invalidation.\nFinally, in addition to those who may claim priority, any of our existing or pending patents may also be challenged by others on the basis that they are otherwise invalid or\nunenforceable.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how.\nWe rely on technical measures and contractual measures to protect proprietary or competitively sensitive information, technology or materials (such as trade secrets,\nknow-how and confidential information) that may not be patentable or subject to copyright, trademark, trade dress or service mark protection, or that we believe is best\nprotected by means that do not require public disclosure. We generally seek to protect this proprietary information by limiting its disclosure and, when disclosed, by entering\ninto confidentiality agreements, or consulting services or employment agreements that contain non-disclosure and non-use provisions with our employees, consultants,\ncontractors and third parties. However, we may fail to enter into the necessary agreements, and even if entered into, these agreements may be breached or may otherwise fail to\nprevent disclosure, third-party infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary information, may be limited as to their term and may not provide an adequate remedy in the\nevent of unauthorized disclosure or use of proprietary information. Trade secrets or confidential information may also be willfully or unintentionally disclosed, including by\nemployees, who may leave our company and join our competitors. We have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our current or future manufacturing\npartners and suppliers and could lose future trade secret protection if any unauthorized disclosure of such information occurs. In addition, our proprietary information may\notherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors or other third parties. To the extent that our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors and other\nthird parties use intellectual property rights or other technology or materials owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting\nknow-how and inventions. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or\nmaintain protection for our proprietary information could adversely affect our competitive business position. Furthermore, laws regarding trade secret rights in certain markets\nwhere we operate may afford little or no protection to our trade secrets.\nWe also rely on physical and electronic security measures to protect our proprietary information, but we cannot provide assurance that these security measures will not be\nbreached or provide adequate protection for our property or any proprietary information that we hold. There is a risk that third parties may obtain and improperly utilize our\nproprietary information to our competitive disadvantage.

Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose\nvaluable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products, which could\nseverely harm our business.

Open source software is made available to the general\npublic on an “as-is” basis under the terms of a non-negotiable license. Certain open source licenses may give rise to obligations to disclose or license our source code or other\nintellectual property rights if such open source software is integrated with our proprietary software or distributed in certain ways. We currently combine our proprietary\nsoftware with open source software, but not in a manner that we believe requires the release of the source code of our proprietary software to the public. If we combine or\ndistribute our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in the future, we could be required to release the source code to our proprietary software as\nopen source software, or could be required to cease using the relevant open source software which might be costly to replace. Open source licensors also generally do not\nprovide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, if the license terms for the open source software that we\nuse change, we may be forced to re-engineer our software, incur additional costs or discontinue the use of certain offerings if re-engineering could not be accomplished in a\ntimely manner. Although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our offerings to unintended conditions, there is a risk that these licenses could be\nconstrued in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our offerings.

Compliance with public company requirements will increase costs and make certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements require us to\ncarry out activities Aurora has not done previously. For example, we created new board committees and have adopted new internal controls and disclosure controls and\nprocedures. In addition, expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements will be incurred. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified\n(for example, if the auditors identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting), we could incur additional costs rectifying\nthose issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of it. In addition, we have obtained director and officer liability\ninsurance. Risks associated with our status as a public company may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board or as executive officers.\nThe additional reporting and other obligations imposed by these rules and regulations increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and\nadministrative activities. These increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand the business and achieve strategic\nobjectives. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase\ncosts.\n37"

If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower\nthan they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised\naccounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the\nadoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to opt out of such an extended transition period\nand, therefore, we may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. This may make\ncomparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of\nusing the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nOur bylaws (the “Bylaws”) designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States as the exclusive forum\nfor substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors,\nofficers or employees.\nOur Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for\n(i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other\nemployees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation (the\n“Certificate of Incorporation”) or our Bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the\nState of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our Bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for\nresolving any complaints asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\n39"

This\nexclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees,\nwhich may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under\nthe Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Further, the enforceability of similar choice of forum\nprovisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable\nor unenforceable. For example, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware recently determined that a provision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive\nforum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. However, this decision may be reviewed and ultimately\noverturned by the Delaware Supreme Court. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision in our Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may\nincur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.\nCharter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. These provisions could also make it more\ndifficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n•\nauthorizing our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could discourage a takeover attempt or delay changes in\ncontrol;\n•\ncertain of our shareholders, including our founders, hold sufficient voting power to control voting for election of directors and amend our Certificate of Incorporation;\n•\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n•\nproviding that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n•\nlimiting the liability of, and the indemnification of, our directors and officers;\n•\nprohibiting the adoption, amendment or repeal of our Bylaws or the repeal of the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation regarding the election and removal of\ndirectors without the required approval of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors;\n•\nenabling our Board of Directors to amend the Bylaws, which may allow our Board of Directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit\nthe ability of an acquirer to amend the Bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n•\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n•\nlimiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n•\nrequiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals, which could preclude Stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings\nof stockholders and delay changes in our Board of Directors and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its\nown slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to\nreplace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL\ngovern Aurora. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with\nAurora for a certain period of time without the consent of its Board of Directors.\nThese and other provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price\ninvestors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these\nprovisions.\n40"

Under the Lockup\nAgreements we entered into in connection with the Merger (the “Lockup Agreements”), such lock-up restrictions began at the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) and end in\ntranches of 25% of the Lock-Up Parties’ Lock-up Shares at each of (i) November 3, 2022, (ii) November 3, 2023, (iii) November 3, 2024 and (iv) November 3, 2025.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, (i) each of Mr. Urmson, Mr. Anderson and Mr. Bagnell (collectively, the “Aurora Founders”) may sell Registrable Securities (as defined in the\nAmended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement entered into in connection with the Merger) up to an amount of $25 million each and (ii) if, after Closing, Aurora\ncompletes a transaction that results in a change of control, the Lock-Up Parties’ Lock-up Shares are released from restriction immediately prior to such change of control. Under\nthe Sponsor Agreement dated July 14, 2021, the Sponsor’s Lock-up Shares are subject to the same releases as the Lock-Up Parties’ Lock-up Shares, except the Sponsor’s Lock-\nup Shares do not contain the right to sell Registrable Securities held by the Aurora Founders, as described in the previous sentence.\nOnce such securities are released from lock-up restrictions, the applicable stockholders will not be restricted from selling shares of our common stock held by them,\nother than by applicable securities laws.

These sales, or the\nperception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nAs restrictions on resale end, the sale or possibility of sale of these shares could have the effect of increasing the volatility in our share price or the market price of our\ncommon stock could decline if the holders of currently restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile and could decline significantly.\nThe stock markets, including Nasdaq on which we list our shares of Class A common stock, have from time to time experienced significant price and volume\nfluctuations. The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could decline significantly. In addition, the trading volume in our Class A common stock may\nfluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our Class A common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares at an\nattractive price (or at all). The market price of our Class A common stock could fluctuate widely or decline significantly in the future in response to a number of factors.

This type of\nlitigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with the Aurora Founders. This will limit or preclude your ability to influence\ncorporate matters, including the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Shares held by the Aurora Founders represent 49.1% of the\nvoting control of the Company as of December 31, 2022. Therefore, the Aurora Founders, individually or together, will be able to significantly influence matters submitted to\nour stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of\nour assets or other major corporate transactions. The Aurora Founders, individually or together, may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you\ndisagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company,\ncould deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nFuture transfers by the holders of our Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of our Class A common stock, subject to limited\nexceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. In addition, each share of our Class B common stock will convert automatically into one\nshare of our Class A common stock upon (i) the date specified by affirmative written election of the holders of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of our Class B common\nstock, (ii) the date set by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date on which the shares of our Class B common stock\nheld by the Aurora Founders and their permitted entities and permitted transferees represent less than 20% of our Class B common stock held by the Aurora Founders and their\npermitted entities as of immediately following the closing of the Merger or (iii) nine months after the death or total disability of the last to die or become disabled of the Aurora\nFounders, or such later date not to exceed a total period of 18 months after such death or disability as may be approved by a majority of our independent directors.\n43"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nWe cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on our stock price.\nWe cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or other\nadverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes.\nIn July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capital structures to be\nincluded in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite\n1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred new\nmulti-class listings from certain of its indices; however, in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal voting structures” in its\nindices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under the announced policies, our dual class capital structure would make us\nineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices will not\nbe investing in our stock. These policies are still fairly new and it is as of yet unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded\nfrom the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companies that are included. Because of our dual class structure, we\nwill likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment\nfunds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our\nClass A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe exercise of warrants for our Class A common stock would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our\nstockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had warrants to purchase an aggregate of 21 million shares of our Class A common stock outstanding, comprising 12 million public\nwarrants and 9 million private placement warrants. These warrants became exercisable 30 days after the completion of the Merger. The likelihood that those warrants will be\nexercised increases if the trading price of shares of our Class A common stock exceeds the exercise price of the warrants. The exercise price of these warrants is $11.50 per\nshare.\nThere is no guarantee that the warrants will become in the money prior to their expiration on November 3, 2026, and as such, the warrants may expire worthless.\nTo the extent the warrants are exercised, additional shares of our Class A common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of our common stock\nand increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of shares issued upon the exercise of warrants in the public market or the\npotential that such warrants may be exercised could also adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may redeem unexpired public warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to their holders, thereby making public warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any time prior to their expiration at a price of $0.01 per warrant, if and only if, the last reported sales\nprice of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a\nwarrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders (the\n“Reference Value”). If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying\nsecurities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants as described above could force you to: (1) exercise your warrants and pay\nthe exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so; (2) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to\nhold your warrants; or (3) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, we expect would be substantially less than\nthe market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us in such a case so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted\ntransferees, but the Sponsor has agreed to exercise all of its private placement warrants for cash or on a “cashless basis” on or prior to the redemption date, in the event that the\nReference Value exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) and we elect to redeem\nthe public warrants pursuant to the Warrant Agreement and notify the Sponsor of such election and the redemption date on or prior to the date we mail a notice of redemption to\nthe holders of the public warrants.\n44"

In such a case, the holders will be able to exercise their warrants\nprior to redemption for a number of shares of our common stock determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our common stock. The value received\nupon exercise of the warrants (1) may be less than the value the holders would have received if they had exercised their warrants at a later time where the underlying share price\nis higher and (2) may not compensate the holders for the value of the warrants, including because the number of shares received is capped at 0.361 shares of our Class A\ncommon stock per warrant (subject to adjustment) irrespective of the remaining life of the warrants.\nIn the event we elect to redeem the warrants that are subject to redemption, we will mail the notice of redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, not less than thirty\ndays prior to the redemption date to the registered holders of the warrants to be redeemed at their last addresses as they appear on the registration books. Any notice mailed in\nsuch manner will be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not the registered holder received such notice and we are not required to provide any notice to\nthe beneficial owners of such warrants. Additionally, while we are required to provide such notice of redemption, we are not separately required to, and do not currently intend\nto, notify any holders of when the warrants become eligible for redemption. If you do not exercise your warrants in connection with a redemption, including because you are\nunaware that such warrants are being redeemed, you would only receive the nominal redemption price for your warrants.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or the market in which we operate, or if they\nchange their recommendations regarding our securities adversely, the price and trading volume of our securities could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, market or\ncompetitors. If any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our shares of common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative\nrecommendations about our competitors, the price of our Class A common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who covers us were to cease our coverage of us or fail to\nregularly publish reports on it, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture issuances of debt securities and equity securities may adversely affect us, including the market price of our Class A common stock and may be dilutive to existing\nstockholders.\nIn the future, we may incur debt or issue equity ranking senior to our Class A common stock. Those securities will generally have priority upon liquidation. Such\nsecurities also may be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting its operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable\nsecurities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Class A common stock. Because our decision to issue debt or\nequity in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature or success of our future\ncapital raising efforts. As a result, future capital raising efforts may reduce the market price of our Class A common stock and be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our securities.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq\nmay take steps to delist our securities. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of the securities and would impair your ability to sell or purchase the\nsecurities when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would\nallow our securities to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our securities, prevent our securities from dropping below the Nasdaq\nminimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements. Additionally, if our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from,\nNasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the\nliquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Aurora should be read together with Aurora’s Consolidated Financial\nStatements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected\nperformance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside of Aurora’s control and actual results may differ\nsignificantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking\nstatements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report and under the heading “Cautionary Note Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nPercentage amounts included in this Annual Report have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures, but on the basis of such amounts prior to\nrounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this Annual Report may vary from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our consolidated\nfinancial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Certain other amounts that appear in this Annual Report may not sum due to rounding.\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nsection to “Aurora,” “we,” “us,” “our” and other similar terms refer to Legacy Aurora prior to the Merger and to Aurora and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect\nto the Merger.\nAurora’s Business\nAurora is developing the Aurora Driver based on what it believes to be the most advanced and scalable suite of self-driving hardware, software, and data services in the\nworld to fundamentally transform the global transportation market. The Aurora Driver is designed as a platform to adapt and interoperate amongst vehicle types and\napplications. To date, it has been successfully integrated into numerous different vehicle platforms: from passenger vehicles to light commercial vehicles to Class 8 trucks. By\ncreating one driver system for multiple vehicle types and use cases, Aurora’s capabilities in one market reinforce and strengthen its competitive advantages in others. For\nexample, highway driving capabilities developed for trucking will carry to highway segments driven by passenger vehicles in ride hailing applications. We believe this approach\nwill enable us to target and transform multiple massive markets, including trucking, passenger mobility, and local goods delivery market.\nWe expect that the Aurora Driver will ultimately be commercialized in a Driver as a Service (“DaaS”) business model, in which we will supply self-driving technology.\nWe do not intend to own nor operate a large number of vehicles ourselves. Throughout commercialization, we expect to earn revenue on a fee per mile basis. We intend to\npartner with OEMs, fleet operators, and other third parties to commercialize and support Aurora-powered vehicles. We expect that these strategic partners will support activities\nsuch as vehicle manufacturing, financing and leasing, service and maintenance, parts replacement, facility ownership and operation, and other commercial and operational\nservices as needed. We expect this DaaS model to enable an asset-light and high margin revenue stream for Aurora, while allowing us to scale more rapidly through\npartnerships. During the start of commercialization, though, we expect to briefly operate our own logistics and mobility services, where we own and operate a small fleet of\nvehicles equipped with our Aurora Driver. This level of control is useful during early commercialization as we will define operational processes and playbooks for our partners.\nWe plan to first launch Aurora Horizon, our driverless trucking subscription service, as we believe that is where we can make the largest impact the fastest, given the\nmassive industry demand, attractive unit economics, and the ability to deploy on high volume highway-focused routes. Future success will be dependent on our ability to\nexecute against our product roadmap to launch Aurora Horizon. From there, we plan to leverage the extensibility of the Aurora Driver to deploy and scale into the passenger\nmobility market with Aurora Connect, our driverless ride hailing subscription service, and in the longer-term the local goods delivery market.\n49"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nSignificant Events and Transactions\nThe Merger\nOn November 3, 2021, the Company consummated a business combination with Legacy Aurora pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Under this method of accounting, Legacy Aurora was treated as the acquirer while the Company was treated\nas the acquired company for financial statement reporting purposes. The Merger provided an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $1,134 million including $1,000 million in\nproceeds from the private investment in public equity (“PIPE”) transaction that was consummated with the Merger. Transaction costs incurred by both parties to the Merger\ntotaled $88 million.\nAs a result of the Merger, we became the successor to a SEC-registered and Nasdaq-listed company which required us to hire additional personnel and implement\nprocedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. We expect to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for,\namong other things, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and external accounting and legal and administrative resources, including\nincreased audit and legal fees.\nATG Business Combination\nOn January 19, 2021, Aurora acquired 100% of the voting interests of ATG, the self-driving technology division of Uber. The acquisition date fair value of the\nconsideration transferred was $1,916 million, which consisted of both preferred and common stock issued to the shareholders of ATG. Aurora accounted for the acquisition as a\nbusiness combination and recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value on the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase consideration over the fair value\nof the assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.\nGlobal Economic Conditions\nThe COVID-19 pandemic that began in late 2019 introduced significant volatility to the global economy, disrupted supply chains and had a widespread adverse effect on\nthe financial markets. Additionally, changes in economic conditions, supply chain constraints, logistics challenges, labor shortages, the conflict in Ukraine, and steps taken by\ngovernments and central banks, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other stimulus and spending programs, have led to higher inflation, which has led\nto an increase in costs and has caused changes in fiscal and monetary policy, including increased interest rates. Our operating results could be materially impacted by these\nchanges and other changes in the overall macroeconomic environment and other economic factors.\nWorldwide economic conditions remain uncertain, particularly due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased inflation. The general economic and capital\nmarket conditions both in the U.S. and worldwide, have been volatile in the past. The capital and credit markets may not be available to support future capital raising activity on\nfavorable terms. If economic conditions decline, our future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected.\n50"

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities. Short-term investments consist of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities.\nWe have incurred negative cash flows from operating activities and significant losses from operations in the past. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and that\nwe will need to opportunistically raise additional capital to support the continued development and commercialization of the Aurora Driver. We believe our cash on hand and\nshort-term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this Annual\nReport.\nCash Flows\nCash flows for the periods were as follows (in millions):\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nNet cash used in operating activities\n$\n(508) $\n(564) $\n(192)\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n(852)\n250 \n343 \nNet cash provided by financing activities\n11 \n1,540 \n2 \nNet (decrease) increase\n(1,349)\n1,226 \n153 \nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of the period\n1,626 \n400 \n247 \nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of the period\n$\n277 $\n1,626 \n$\n400 \nCash Flows Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $508 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $56 million from $564 million for the twelve\nmonths ended December 31, 2021. The change in operating cash flows was primarily due to an increase of cash received under the collaboration project plan with Toyota Motor\nCorporation and a decrease of professional expenses and other expenses paid in connection with the acquisition of ATG which did not recur during the most recent period\npartially offset by increased incentive compensation payments.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 increased $372 million from $192 million for the twelve months ended December\n31, 2020 primarily due to increased payroll costs due to an increased headcount resulting from acquisitions.\nCash Flows (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $1,102 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 from the twelve months ended December 31, 2021,\nprimarily due to the net purchases of short-term investments of $837 million, and the comparative period including $294 million in net cash acquired through the acquisitions of\nbusinesses.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $93 million from $343 million for the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2020 primarily due net maturities of short-term investments in the comparative period, partially offset by net cash acquired through the acquisitions of businesses.\nCash used for purchases of property and equipment were $15 million, $48 million and $7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 included net proceeds from the Merger of $1,134 million and net proceeds from\nthe issuance of Series U-2 preferred stock of $398 million.\n53"

Legal fees and other costs associated with such actions are expensed as incurred. We assess\nthe need to record a liability for litigation and other loss contingencies, with reserve estimates recorded if we determine that a loss related to the matter is both probable and\nreasonably estimable. No material losses were recorded in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nThe Company has entered into a contract for cloud hosting services under which non-cancelable future minimum payments as of December 31, 2022 are: $61 million for\n2023, $61 million for 2024, $64 million for 2025, and $38 million for 2026. Commitments under operating lease contracts are detailed within Note 10 – Leases to our\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Preparation of the financial\nstatements requires our management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amount of revenue and operating and other expenses, assets and\nliabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption\nis complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Such fair values require significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to the\nvaluation of acquired intangible assets. Significant estimates and assumptions utilized in the valuation of certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated\nreplacement cost, profit margin, opportunity cost, useful lives, and discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which\nare inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Measurement period adjustments are reflected at the time identified, up\nthrough the conclusion of the measurement period, which is the time at which all necessary information is received, and is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.\nValuation of Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase consideration of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is\nevaluated for impairment annually on December 31, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of\ngoodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value.\nDuring the second and fourth quarters of 2022, the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock and its market capitalization declined significantly. As a result,\nthe Company determined that triggering events had occurred and goodwill impairment assessments were performed.\nThe Company utilized a market approach valuation method utilizing the observable market price of the Company’s Class A common stock as it represented the best\nevidence of the fair value of its reporting unit. Based on the results of the goodwill impairment assessment, the Company recognized a $1,114 million goodwill impairment\nduring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\nValuation of Derivative Liabilities\nThe Company accounts for shares held by Reinvent Sponsor Y LLC (the “Sponsor”) not forfeited under the terms of the Merger Agreement and subject to price based\nvesting terms (the “Earnout Shares”) as a derivative liabilities. The liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation analysis with any\nchanges in fair value reflected in the statement of operations until the vesting conditions are met or the shares expire.\nThe Monte Carlo simulation analysis is dependent upon management estimates and assumptions, primarily related to expected volatility and risk-free interest rates. The\nexpected volatility is determined based on the historical equity volatility of comparable companies over a period that matches the expected term of the instrument. The risk-free\ninterest rate is based on relevant U.S. treasury rates for a period that matches the expected term of the instrument.\n54"

The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect not to take advantage of the\nextended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, and any such election to not take advantage of the extended\ntransition period is irrevocable. We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and have elected to take advantage\nof the benefits of this extended transition period.

(the “Company” or “Aurora”) is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and its mission is to deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely,\nquickly, and broadly. The Company is developing the Aurora Driver, an advanced and scalable suite of self-driving hardware, software and data services designed as a platform\nto adapt and interoperate amongst vehicle types and applications.\nThe Company was initially incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on October 2, 2020 and was formerly known as Reinvent Technology Partners Y (“RTPY”).\nOn November 3, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), the Company filed a notice of deregistration with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies, domesticated as a Delaware\ncorporation, and changed its name to Aurora Innovation, Inc. As contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 14, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), Aurora\nconsummated a business combination (the “Merger”) whereby RTPY Merger Sub, Inc., a direct subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into Aurora Innovation Holdings,\nInc., a Delaware corporation (f/k/a Aurora Innovation, Inc. and referred to herein as “Legacy Aurora”). Refer to Note 3 – Acquisitions for additional details regarding the\nMerger.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions between the Company and\nits controlled subsidiaries have been eliminated.\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization and operations and cash flows presented prior to the Closing Date represent those of Legacy Aurora and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries (see Note 3 – Acquisitions).\nCollaboration Revenue\nIn January 2021, the Company entered into a collaboration framework agreement with Toyota Motor Corporation (“Toyota”) with the intention of deploying the Aurora Driver\ninto a fleet of Toyota Sienna vehicles, subject to further agreement of a collaboration project plan that was signed in August 2021.\nCollaboration revenue is recognized using the input measure of hours expended as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the collaboration project plan. Differences\nbetween collaboration revenue recognized and payments collected under the agreement are recognized as a contract asset or contract liability at the end of each reporting period.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents are deposits and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of change\ninclude due to interest rate, quoted price, or penalty of withdrawal. U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity, when purchased, of 90 days or less are considered to be cash\nequivalents.\nRestricted cash consists of funds that are contractually restricted as to usage or withdrawal, typically due to the Company’s operating lease agreements. Due to these restrictions,\nthe Company has presented restricted cash separately from cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet.\nShort-term Investments\nThe Company’s short-term investments in U.S. Treasury securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company measures short-term investments\nat fair value on a recurring basis based on quoted market prices, and unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are included in other comprehensive loss. Upon sale, realized\ngains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net on the statements of operations. No impairment losses have been recognized on short-term investments in the\nperiods presented.\nThe Company’s short-term investments in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity, when purchased, of 90 days or less are considered highly liquid investments and are reported\nas cash equivalents.\n63"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate. In determining fair value, management uses a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are\nset forth below:\nLevel 1:     Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2:     Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs\nother than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nOur primary financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and derivative liabilities. For the\nfinancial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, their estimated fair value approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these\ninstruments.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which is twenty years for buildings; the shorter of the\nlease term and the estimated useful life (up to seven years) for leasehold improvements; and over three to five years for all other asset categories.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at inception. The Company leases real estate and equipment which have been recognized as operating leases,\nexcept for those leases with a lease term of 12 months or less which are recognized as short-term leases and expensed on a straight-line basis.\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the initial measurement of operating lease liabilities. Certain lease contracts include non-lease\ncomponents, such as operations and maintenance. The Company combines and accounts for lease and these non-lease components as a single lease component. Certain real\nestate leases include one or more options to renew; the exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s discretion and is included in the lease term when it is determined\nthat the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. The discount rates utilized to measure operating lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company’s\nincremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in lease agreements cannot be readily determined.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are reflected at the time identified, up through the conclusion of\nthe measurement period, which is the time at which all necessary information is received, and is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually on December 31, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying\namount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value.\nAcquired intangible assets primarily consist of in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) from the Company’s historical acquisitions. IPR&D assets that have not been\ncompleted are subject to impairment considerations annually on December 31, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nNo impairment losses were recognized on acquired intangible assets during the periods presented.\n64"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthat the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company performs impairment testing at the level that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are\nlargely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amounts to the expected future undiscounted cash\nflows attributable to the assets. If it is determined that an asset may not be recoverable, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.\nNo material impairment losses were recognized on long-lived assets during the periods presented.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred, and consist primarily of personnel costs, hardware and electrical engineering prototyping, cloud computing, data\nlabeling, and third-party development services. To date, the Company has not capitalized software development costs related to the development of the Aurora Driver due to the\nremaining planning, designing, coding and testing activities necessary for technology validation and safe autonomous operation.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company measures stock-based compensation using the fair value based method on the grant date. Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) are measured based on fair value of the\nCompany’s publicly traded common stock, while stock options are measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with assumptions including expected term, risk-free\ninterest rate, and expected volatility. Due to the Company’s limited historical stock option exercise experience as a public company, the expected term of stock options is\ndetermined utilizing the simplified method based on vesting and contractual terms. The expected volatility is determined based on the historical volatility of comparable public\ncompanies over the expected term of the stock option. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nStock-based compensation for awards with only service conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period,\nwhile awards with service and performance conditions is recognized on a graded-vesting basis over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes the effect of\nforfeitures in the period they occur.\nDerivative Liabilities\nThe Company accounts for the public and private placement stock purchase warrants (collectively “the warrants”) as derivative liabilities. The liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis with any changes in fair value reflected in the statement of operations until the warrants are exercised, redeemed, or expire.\nThe Company accounts for shares held by Reinvent Sponsor Y LLC (the “Sponsor”) not forfeited under the terms of the Merger Agreement and subject to price based vesting\nterms (the “Earnout Shares”) as derivative liabilities. The liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis with any changes in fair value reflected in the statement of\noperations until the vesting conditions are met or the shares expire.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are\nestablished when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which: (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions\nwill be sustained on the basis of technical merits of the position, and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the Company\nrecognizes the tax benefit as the largest amount that is cumulatively more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLiabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been\nincurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.\n65"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nCertain Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Company’s operations are principally funded by available liquidity from cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Management expects to continue to incur\noperating losses and that the Company will need to opportunistically raise additional capital to support the continued development and commercialization of the Aurora Driver.\nManagement believes that cash on hand and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least\ntwelve months from the date of these financial statements.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company\nprimarily maintains its cash and cash equivalents at U.S. commercial banks, while its short-term investments primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities. Cash and cash\nequivalents deposited with domestic commercial banks generally exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurable limit, though the Company has not experienced\nany credit losses on its deposits.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn December 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,\nwhich simplifies accounting for income taxes by revising or clarifying existing guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, as well as removing certain exceptions within ASC 740.\nThe Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2022 and there was not a material impact.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, that replaces the\nincurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP. The new impairment model requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most\nfinancial assets and certain other instruments. Entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first\neffective reporting period. The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2022 and there was not a material impact.\nNote 3. Acquisitions\nThe Merger\nOn November 3, 2021, Aurora consummated the Merger with Legacy Aurora.\nIn connection with the Merger, issued and outstanding shares of Legacy Aurora common stock converted into shares of Aurora common stock and outstanding Legacy Aurora\nequity awards converted into Aurora equity awards based on the exchange ratio of approximately 2.1708 (the “Exchange Ratio”), based on the following events contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement:\n• the cancellation and conversion of all 205 million issued and outstanding shares of Legacy Aurora redeemable convertible preferred stock into 205 million shares of Legacy\nAurora common stock;\n• the surrender and exchange of all 458 million shares of Legacy Aurora common stock, including shares of Legacy Aurora common stock resulting from the conversion of\nLegacy Aurora redeemable convertible preferred stock, were converted to 995 million shares of Aurora common stock, as adjusted by the Exchange Ratio;\n• the cancellation and surrender of all 38 million granted and outstanding vested and unvested Legacy Aurora stock options, which were converted into 82 million Aurora stock\noptions to purchase shares of Aurora common stock with the same terms and vesting conditions, as adjusted by the Exchange Ratio; and\n• the cancellation and exchange of all 16 million granted and outstanding vested and unvested Legacy Aurora RSUs, which were converted into 35 million Aurora RSUs for\nshares of Aurora common stock with the same terms and vesting conditions, as adjusted by the Exchange Ratio.\nThe other related events that occurred concurrent with the Merger are summarized below:\n• the Company sold 100 million shares of Aurora common stock for aggregate proceeds of $1,000 million to certain institutional and accredited investors (the “PIPE\nInvestment”);\n• the 7 million issued and outstanding shares of Aurora common stock beneficially held by the Sponsor became subject to transfer restrictions and contingent forfeiture\nprovisions upon the Merger (the “Earnout Shares”), of which 2 million of the Earnout Shares became subject to time-based provisions and 5 million of the Earnout Shares\nbecame subject to time- and market-based provisions; see Note 8 – Equity Incentive Plans for more information; and\n• the public holders of 76 million shares of Aurora common stock exercised their redemption feature resulting in an aggregate payment of $755 million (the “Redemption”).\n66"

The proceeds were net of $755 million paid in relation with the Redemption and $49 million of costs incurred prior to the Merger.\nIn connection with the Merger, Legacy Aurora incurred $41 million in transaction costs consisting of banking, legal, and other professional fees, of which $36 million was\nrecorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and $5 million was expensed in the consolidated statements of operations. Total net cash proceeds to the Company were\n$1,134 million.\nReverse Recapitalization\nThe Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, the Company is treated as the acquired company and\nthe Merger is treated as the equivalent of Legacy Aurora issuing shares for the net assets of the Company, accompanied by a recapitalization. The accounting acquirer was\nprimarily determined based on Legacy Aurora shareholders having the largest voting interest in the post-combination company and the ability to appoint the majority of the\nmembers of the Board of Directors as well as Legacy Aurora management holding executive management roles in the post-combination company and are responsible for the\nday-to-day operations which are comprised of Legacy Aurora activities.\nThe net assets of the Company were recognized at historical cost as of the Closing Date, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.

The redeemable convertible preferred stock was valued based on a concurrent purchase of the Company’s\nredeemable convertible preferred stock. The common stock was valued based on its fair value as the acquisition date, as determined using an option pricing method model.\nIn January 2021, the Company paid $10 million relating to financial advisory fees with a former related party of which $8 million was recognized as transaction costs\nassociated with the acquisition and $2 million was recorded as a reduction to redeemable convertible preferred stock as issuance costs in the twelve months ended December 31,\n2021.

Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\nExchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal\nControl – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Company’s assessment, management\nhas determined that its internal controls over financial reporting were effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 covered by this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nControl systems, no matter how well conceived and operated, are designed to provide a reasonable, but not an absolute, level of assurance that the objectives of the\ncontrol system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to\ntheir costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if\nany, have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nItem 9B. Other Information.\nNone.\nItem 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.\nNot applicable.\n79"

(“us,” “our,” “we, “Aurora” or the “Company”) as specified\nin our certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) and bylaws (the “Bylaws”). Because the following description is only a summary, it does not contain all\nthe information that may be important to you. For a complete description of the matters set forth in this summary, you should refer to the Certificate of Incorporation, the\nBylaws, the Warrant Agreement, dated as of dated as of March 15, 2021, by and between our legal predecessor Reinvent Technology Partners Y (“RTPY”) and Continental\nStock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, as amended by the Amendment of Warrant Agreement, dated as of February 28, 2022, by and among Aurora Innovation,\nInc., Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (as amended, the “Warrant Agreement”), and the Amended and Restated\nRegistration Rights Agreement, dated as of November 3, 2021, by and among Aurora Innovation, Inc. and the other parties thereto (the “Registration Rights Agreement”),\nwhich are included as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.5 is a part, and to the applicable provisions of Delaware law.\nGeneral\nThe authorized capital stock of Aurora consists of 52,000,000,000 shares of capital stock, $0.00001 par value per share, of which:\n•\n50,000,000,000 shares are designated as Class A common stock (the “Class A Common Stock”);\n•\n1,000,000,000 shares are designated as Class B common stock (the “Class B Common Stock”); and\n•\n1,000,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were 759,864,240 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding, 411,510,876 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding and no\nshares of preferred stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, our board of directors (the “Board”) has the authority, without stockholder approval except as\nrequired by the listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”), to issue additional shares of Class A Common Stock. Until the final conversion of all\noutstanding shares of Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation (the “Final Conversion Date”), any issuance of additional shares of\nClass B Common Stock requires the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock voting as a separate class.\nCommon Stock\nWe have two series of authorized common stock, Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B\nCommon Stock are generally identical, except with respect to voting and conversion.\nDividend Rights\nSubject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of funds\nlegally available if our board of directors (the “Board”), in its discretion, determines to issue dividends and then only at the times and in the amounts that the Board may\ndetermine."

The holders of\nClass A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock will generally vote together as a single class, unless otherwise required by law. Under the Certificate of Incorporation,\napproval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock voting as a separate class is required to increase or decrease the number of authorized\nshares of Class B Common Stock. In addition, Delaware law could require either holders of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock to vote separately as a single\nclass if we were to seek to amend our Certificate of Incorporation in a manner that alters or changes the powers, preferences or special rights of the Class A Common Stock or\nthe Class B Common Stock in a manner that affected its holders adversely but does not so affect the shares of the other series of common stock, then that series would be\nrequired to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment.\nUntil the Final Conversion Date, approval of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock voting as a separate class is required to:\n•\namend or modify any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with, or otherwise alter, any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation to modify the\nvoting, conversion or other rights, powers, preferences, privileges or restrictions of the Class B Common Stock;\n•\nreclassify any outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock into shares having rights as to dividends or liquidation that are senior to the Class B Common Stock or\nthe right to have more than one vote for each share thereof;\n•\nissue any shares of Class B Common Stock, including by dividend, distribution or otherwise; or\n•\nauthorize, or issue any shares of, any class or series of our capital stock having the right to more than one vote for each share thereof.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size, each serving staggered three-year\nterms. Only the directors in one class will be subject to election by a plurality of the votes cast at each annual meeting of stockholders, with the directors in the other classes\ncontinuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. Stockholders do not have the ability to cumulate votes for the election of directors.\nNo Preemptive or Similar Rights\nOur common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights, is not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions.\nRight to Receive Liquidation Distributions\nIf we become subject to a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up in connection with which the Board has determined to effect a distribution of assets to any holders of\ncommon stock, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders would be distributable ratably among the holders of common stock and any participating Aurora\npreferred stock outstanding at that time, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights of and the payment of liquidation\npreferences, if any, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock."

      "text": "Conversion of Class B Common Stock\nEach share of Class B Common Stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A Common Stock. Shares of Class B Common Stock\nwill automatically convert into shares of Class A Common Stock upon sale or transfer except for certain transfers described in the Certificate of Incorporation, including estate\nplanning or charitable transfers where sole dispositive power and exclusive voting control with respect to the shares of Class B Common Stock are retained by the transferring\nholder or such transferring holder’s spouse. In addition, each outstanding share of Class B Common Stock held by a stockholder who is a natural person, or held by the\npermitted entities and permitted transferees of such natural person (as described in the Certificate of Incorporation), will convert automatically into one share of Class A\nCommon Stock upon the death of such natural person. In the event of the death or permanent and total disability of Chris Urmson, Sterling Anderson or James Andrew Bagnell\n(collectively, the “Aurora Founders”), shares of Class B Common Stock held by such Aurora Founder, his permitted entities or permitted transferees will convert to Class A\nCommon Stock, provided that the conversion will be deferred for nine months, or up to 18 months if approved by a majority of our independent directors, following his death or\npermanent and total disability and provided further, that to the extent any other Aurora Founder has or shares voting control over such shares, the shares of Class B Common\nStock will be treated as held of record by the Aurora Founder that has or shares voting control. Transfers between the Aurora Founders are permitted transfers and will not\nresult in conversion of the shares of Class B Common Stock that are transferred and such shares of Class B Common Stock will be treated as held of record by the transferee\nAurora Founder. With respect to any shares of Class B Common Stock over which the spouse of an Aurora Founder has voting control, such shares of Class B Common Stock\nwill convert to shares of Class A Common Stock upon divorce if the spouse retains voting control.\nEach share of Class B Common Stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A Common Stock upon (i) the date specified by affirmative written election of\nthe holders of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, (ii) the date fixed by the Board that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days\nfollowing the date on which the shares of Class B Common Stock held by the Aurora Founders and their permitted entities and permitted transferees represent less than 20% of\nthe Class B Common Stock held by the Aurora Founders and their permitted entities as of immediately following the consummation of our business combination with RTPY\n(the “Business Combination”) or (iii) nine months after the death or total disability of the last to die or become disabled of the Aurora Founders, or such later date not to exceed\na total period of 18 months after such death or disability as may be approved by a majority of our independent directors.\nPreferred stock\nThe Board has the authority, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law and the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation, to issue preferred stock in one or more\nseries, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and\nany of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions, in each case without further vote or action by our stockholders. The Board can also increase or decrease the number of shares\nof any series of preferred stock, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The Board may\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. The\nissuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company and might adversely affect the market price of common stock and the voting and other rights of the\nholders of common stock. We have no current plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nRegistration Rights\nUnder the Registration Rights Agreement, certain holders of Aurora common stock or their permitted transferees have the right to require us to register the offer and sale\nof their shares, or to include their shares in any registration statement that we file, in each case as described below."

      "text": "Shelf Registration Rights\nThe holders of at least $50.0 million of shares having registration rights then outstanding can request that we effect an underwritten public offering pursuant to such\nresale shelf registration statement. We are not obligated to effect more than eight (8) such registrations within any 12-month period. These shelf registration rights are subject to\nspecified conditions and limitations, including the right of the managing underwriter or underwriters to limit the number of shares included in any such registration under certain\ncircumstances.\nPiggyback Registration Rights\nIf we propose to register the offer and sale of our common stock under the Securities Act, all holders of these shares then outstanding can request that we include their\nshares in such registration, subject to certain marketing and other limitations, including the right of the underwriters to limit the number of shares included in any such\nregistration statement under certain circumstances. As a result, whenever we propose to file a registration statement under the Securities Act, other than with respect to a\nregistration (i) relating to any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) on Form S-4 (or similar form that relates to a transaction subject to Rule 145 under the Securities\nAct or any successor rule thereto), (iii) relating to an offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of Aurora, (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, (v) a “block\ntrade,” or an underwritten registered offering not involving a roadshow or (vi) an “at the market” or similar registered offering through a broker, sales agent or distribution\nagent, whether as agent or principal, the holders of these shares are entitled to notice of the registration and have the right, subject to certain limitations, to include their shares in\nthe registration.\nWarrants\nPublic Warrants\nEach warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at\nany time. The warrants will expire five years after the completion of the Business Combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\nWe are not obligated to deliver any shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise\nunless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a\ncurrent prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is\navailable, including as a result of a notice of redemption described below under “Redemption of Warrants when the price per share of Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds\n$10.00”. No warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the\nissuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption is available. In the event that\nthe conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and\nsuch warrant may have no value and expire worthless.\nA registration statement covering the issuance, under the Securities Act, of the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant has been declared\neffective on November 12, 2021, and we have agreed to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration\nof the warrant in accordance with the provisions of the Warrant Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, if our shares of Class A Common Stock are, at the time of any exercise\nof a warrant, not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our\noption, require holders of warrants (the “Public Warrants”) issued in connection with RTPY’s initial public offering on March 18, 2021 (the “RTPY IPO”) who exercise their\nPublic Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in\neffect a registration statement, but will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not\navailable. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the lesser of\n(A) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market\nvalue” (defined below) less the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value and (B) 0.361. The “fair market value” shall mean the volume weighted average price\nof the shares of Class A Common Stock for the 10 trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent."

In no event will the warrants be exercisable in connection with this redemption feature for more than 0.361 shares of Class A Common\nStock per warrant (subject to adjustment). Finally, as reflected in the table above, if the warrants are out of the money and about to expire, they cannot be exercised on a\ncashless basis in connection with a redemption by us pursuant to this redemption feature, since they will not be exercisable for any shares of Class A Common Stock."

      "text": "This redemption feature differs from the typical warrant redemption features used in many other blank check offerings, which typically only provide for a redemption of\nwarrants for cash (other than the Private Placement Warrants) when the trading price for the shares of Class A Common Stock exceeds $18.00 per share for a specified period of\ntime. This redemption feature is structured to allow for all of the outstanding warrants to be redeemed when the shares of Class A Common Stock are trading at or above $10.00\nper share, which may be at a time when the trading price of our shares of Class A Common Stock is below the exercise price of the warrants. We have established this\nredemption feature to provide us with the flexibility to redeem the warrants without the warrants having to reach the $18.00 per share threshold set forth above under\n“—Warrants—Public Warrants—Redemption of Warrants when the price per share of Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00.” Holders choosing to exercise their\nwarrants in connection with a redemption pursuant to this feature will, in effect, receive a number of shares for their warrants based on an option pricing model with a fixed\nvolatility input as of the date of the RTPY IPO. This redemption right provides us with an additional mechanism by which to redeem all of the outstanding warrants, and\ntherefore have certainty as to our capital structure as the warrants would no longer be outstanding and would have been exercised or redeemed. We will be required to pay the\napplicable redemption price to warrant holders if we choose to exercise this redemption right and it will allow us to quickly proceed with a redemption of the warrants if we\ndetermine it is in our best interest to do so. As such, we would redeem the warrants in this manner when we believe it is in our best interest to update our capital structure to\nremove the warrants and pay the redemption price to the warrant holders.\nAs stated above, we can redeem the warrants when the shares of Class A Common Stock are trading at a price starting at $10.00, which is below the exercise price of\n$11.50, because it will provide certainty with respect to our capital structure and cash position while providing warrant holders with the opportunity to exercise their warrants on\na cashless basis for the applicable number of shares. If we choose to redeem the warrants when the shares of Class A Common Stock are trading at a price below the exercise\nprice of the warrants, this could result in the warrant holders receiving fewer shares of Class A Common Stock than they would have received if they had chosen to wait to\nexercise their warrants for shares of Class A Common Stock if and when such shares of Class A Common Stock were trading at a price higher than the exercise price of $11.50.\nNo fractional shares of Class A Common Stock will be issued upon exercise. If, upon exercise, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we\nwill round down to the nearest whole number of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock to be issued to the holder. If, at the time of redemption, the warrants are\nexercisable for a security other than the shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, the warrants may be exercised for such security. At such time as\nthe warrants become exercisable for a security other than the shares of Class A Common Stock, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register under the\nSecurities Act the security issuable upon the exercise of the warrants.\nRedemption procedures\nA holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such warrant, to the\nextent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person’s affiliates), to the warrant agent’s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of\n9.8% (or such other amount as a holder may specify) of the shares of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise."

These provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing changes in control of our company.\nCertificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include a number of provisions that could deter hostile takeovers or delay or prevent changes in control of the Board or\nmanagement team, including the following:"

The existence of a classified board could delay a potential acquirer from obtaining majority\ncontrol of our board of directors, and the prospect of that delay might deter a potential acquirer.\nBoard of Directors Vacancies\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws authorize only the board of directors to fill vacant directorships, including newly created seats. In addition, the number of\ndirectors constituting the Board is permitted to be set only by a resolution adopted by a majority vote of our entire board of directors. These provisions prevent a stockholder\nfrom increasing the size of the Board and then gaining control of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees. This makes it more difficult to\nchange the composition of the Board and promotes continuity of management.\nStockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides that our stockholders may not take action by written consent but may only take action at annual or special meetings of our\nstockholders. As a result, a holder controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to amend our Bylaws or remove directors without holding a meeting of our\nstockholders called in accordance with the Bylaws. The Bylaws further provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority of the Board, the\nchairperson of the Board, our Chief Executive Officer or our President, thus prohibiting a stockholder from calling a special meeting. These provisions might delay the ability of\nour stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or for stockholders controlling a majority of our capital stock to take any action, including the removal of directors.\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations\nOur Bylaws provide advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for\nelection as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders or a special meeting of stockholders at which the election of directors is included as business to be brought before the\nspecial meeting. Our Bylaws also specify certain requirements regarding the form and content of a stockholder’s notice. These provisions might preclude our stockholders from\nbringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at our annual meeting of stockholders or a special meeting of stockholders\nif the proper procedures are not followed. We expect that these provisions may also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the\nacquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nNo Cumulative Voting\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law provides that stockholders are not entitled to cumulate votes in the election of directors unless a corporation’s certificate of\nincorporation provides otherwise. The Certificate of Incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting."

      "text": "Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws Provisions\nAmendments to certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation will require the approval of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting power of common stock.\nThe Bylaws provide that approval of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of our outstanding voting power voting as a single class is required for stockholders to amend or\nadopt any provision of our Bylaws.\nIssuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock\nThe Board generally has the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and\npreferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the Board. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock would enable the Board to\nrender more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other means.\nExclusive Forum\nOur Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for\n(i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other\nemployees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or\n(iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does\nnot have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants.\nUnless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the sole and exclusive forum for the\nresolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act against any person in connection with any offering of Aurora securities. Any person or\nentity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. Although we believe these provisions\nbenefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of applicable law for the specified types of actions and proceedings, the provisions may have the effect of\ndiscouraging lawsuits against us or our directors and officers.\nLimitations of Liability and Indemnification\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General\nCorporation Law. Consequently, our directors are not personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except\nliability for the following:\n•\nany breach of their duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders;\n•\nany act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\n•\nunlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or\n•\nany transaction from which they derived an improper personal benefit.\nAny amendment to, or repeal or elimination of, these provisions will not eliminate or reduce the effect of these provisions in respect of any act, omission or claim that\noccurred or arose prior to that amendment, repeal or elimination. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to provide for further limitations on the personal liability\nof directors of corporations, then the personal liability of our directors will be further limited to the greatest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law."

Our Bylaws provide that we may indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law\nany person who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is or was one of our employees or\nagents or is or was serving at our request as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or any other person, to the extent\nnot prohibited by applicable law. Our Bylaws also provide that we must advance expenses incurred by or on behalf of a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of\nany action or proceeding, subject to limited exceptions.\nFurther, have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers, which contain provisions broader than the specific\nindemnification provisions contained in the Delaware General Corporation Law. These indemnification agreements require us, among other things, to indemnify our directors\nand executive officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service. These indemnification agreements also generally require us to advance all expenses\nincurred by the directors and executive officers in investigating or defending any such action, suit or proceeding. We believe that these agreements are necessary to attract and\nretain qualified individuals to serve as directors and executive officers.\nThe limitation of liability and indemnification provisions included in our Certificate of Incorporation, in our Bylaws and in indemnification agreements that we have\nentered into with our directors and executive officers may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and executive officers for breach of their\nfiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and executive officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us\nand other stockholders. Further, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and\nexecutive officers as required by these indemnification provisions. At present, we are not aware of any pending litigation or proceeding involving any person who is, was, or is\nexpected be, one of our directors, officers, employees or other agents or is or was serving at our request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,\npartnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, for which indemnification is sought, and we are not aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for\nindemnification.\nWe have obtained insurance policies under which, subject to the limitations of the policies, coverage is provided to our directors and executive officers against loss\narising from claims made by reason of breach of fiduciary duty or other wrongful acts as a director or executive officer, including claims relating to public securities matters,\nand to us with respect to payments that may be made by us to these directors and executive officers pursuant to our indemnification obligations or otherwise as a matter of law.\nCertain of our non-employee directors may, through their relationships with their employers, be insured or indemnified against certain liabilities incurred in their\ncapacity as members of our board of directors.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling our company pursuant to the\nforegoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore\nunenforceable.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar and Warrant Agent\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock and the warrant agent for our warrants is American Stock Transfer &\nTrust Company. The transfer agent’s address is 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219, and its telephone number is (800) 937-5449.\nListing\nOur Class A Common Stock and warrants are listed under the Nasdaq symbols “AUR” and “AUROW,” respectively."
