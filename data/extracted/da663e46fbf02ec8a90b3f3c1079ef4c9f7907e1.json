We delivered solid results for \nshareholders while adeptly managing through \nthe continuing COVID pandemic, supply chain \ndisruptions, inflation, and tight labor markets.  \nOur success is driven by our people. \nAs a company, Albany achieved sales revenue \nof $1.035 billion in 2022, up about 11% from \n2021. Gross profit, Operating income, and \nAdjusted EBITDA all moved higher as well. \nWe finished 2022 with a strong balance sheet \nand healthy order books. \nOur Machine Clothing (MC) segment \nmaintained its global leadership position in \nthe paper machine clothing market. MC’s \nfinancial results continued to be impressive \nwith gross margins over 50% and Adjusted \nEBITDA margins of 37%, despite the head­\nwinds of inflation, supply chain disruptions, \ntight labor markets, currency shifts, and \nslowdowns in Europe and China. \nOur Engineered Composites (AEC) segment \ngrew top line sales revenues by nearly 40%, \nand its Adjusted EBITDA was $79 million, \nup about $10 million from 2021’s results. \nWe benefited from recovering commercial \naviation production led by more than 50% \ngrowth in the LEAP program. The business \nalso benefitted from the additional work we \nwon late in 2021 on the Sikorsky CH-53K \nhelicopter program. It’s a meaningful step up \nfor us, and with revenues of $100 million, the \nCH-53K is now our largest defense program. \nIt is expected to grow further as the program \nmoves toward full-rate production. Additional \nnew business in 2022 came from a variety \nof smaller commercial, defense and space \nprograms. These wins add another layer to \nthe segment’s growth.  \nResilient Operations \nand Organic Growth in 2022"

The products MC \nproduces are critical to the operation of our \ncustomers’ paper machines. We invest more \nthan any other competitor in developing the \nnext generation of belts and felts used in \npaper making. Our technologists and service \ntechnicians are second to none when it comes \nto supporting our customers in their quest to \nimprove efficiencies, quality and cost in their \npaper production processes. \nDemand for our machine clothing solutions \nis underpinned by long-term secular trends \ndriving demand for paper of all kinds—\nglobal growth in higher-value tissue and \nhygiene products, e-commerce and \npackaging demand, and a continued shift \nto sustainability as “paper replaces plastic” \nin more and more applications. We have \npositioned our global footprint, product \nofferings and technical services to take \nadvantage of these long-term positive trends. \nWe expect to do so profitably, delivering \nAdjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-30% \nrange with excellent cash flow. \nOur Engineered Composites segment \ncontinues to build its reputation in \nAerospace markets as a leader in advanced \ncomposite engineering, design, and \nmanufacturing. We continue to invest in \nthe next generation of composite \nmaterials and their industrialization, \nbuilding on the success of our proprietary \n3D Woven Composite materials used in \nthe LEAP program. \nIn addition, we are expanding our material \ncapabilities in composites and diversifying our \nbusiness mix by adding new customers and \nnew programs. Between 2021 and 2026, \nwe expect to double our AEC revenues and \nare targeting Adjusted EBITDA margins in \nthe low-to-mid 20% range.\nSuccess requires that we invest in our \npeople to ensure we build a culture that \nfosters technological leadership, customer \ncollaboration and operational execution that \nare best-in-class. It starts with our people."

      "text": "PART I\nItem 1. \nBusiness\nAlbany International Corp. (the Registrant, the Company, we, us, or our) and its subsidiaries are engaged in two \nbusiness segments.\nThe Machine Clothing (“MC”) segment supplies consumable permeable and impermeable belts used in the \nmanufacture of paper, paperboard, tissue and towel, pulp, nonwovens, fiber cement and several other industrial \napplications. Within the pulp and paper industry these belts are referred to as “machine clothing” or “paper machine \nclothing.”  In other industries we serve the products we produce are generally referred to as “processing belts.”\nWe design, manufacture, and market paper machine clothing for each section of the paper machine and for \nevery grade of paper. We manufacture and sell approximately twice as much paper machine clothing worldwide than \nany other company. Paper machine clothing products are customized, consumable products of technologically \nsophisticated design that utilize polymeric materials in a complex structure. The design and material composition of \npaper machine clothing can have a considerable effect on the quality of paper products produced and a meaningful \neffect on the energy and resource efficiency of the paper machines on which it is used. Principal paper machine \nclothing products include forming, pressing, and drying fabrics, and process belts. A forming fabric assists in paper \nsheet formation and conveys the very wet sheet through the forming section. Pressing fabrics are designed to carry \nthe sheet through the press section, where water is pressed from the sheet as it passes through the press nip. In the \ndrying section, drying fabrics manage air movement and hold the sheet against heated cylinders to enhance drying to \na final moisture content between 4% to 9%, depending on the grade. \nProcess belts are used in the press section to increase dryness and enhance sheet properties, as well as in \nother sections of the machine to improve runnability and enhance sheet qualities.\nThe MC segment also supplies engineered processing belts used in the manufacturing process in the pulp, \ncorrugator, nonwovens, fiber cement, building products, and textile industries.\nThe MC segment sells its products directly to customer end-users in countries across the globe. MC products, \nmanufacturing processes, and distribution channels are substantially the same in each region of the world in which we \noperate. The sales of paper machine clothing forming, pressing, and drying fabrics, individually and in the aggregate, \naccounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated Net sales during one or more of the last three years. No \nindividual customer accounted for as much as 10 percent of MC segment Net sales in any of the periods presented. A \nmajority of MC segment Net sales in the year ended December 31, 2022 were for use in the production of the growing \ngrades of tissue, containerboard, other paper categories, and other engineered fabrics, while less than 20% of MC \nsegment Net sales were for the production of the declining newsprint and printing and writing papers categories.\nThe Albany Engineered Composites (“AEC”) segment, provides highly engineered, advanced composite \nstructures to customers in the commercial and defense aerospace industries. The segment includes Albany Safran \nComposites, LLC (“ASC”), in which our customer, SAFRAN Group (\"SAFRAN\"), owns a 10 percent noncontrolling \ninterest. AEC, through ASC, is the exclusive supplier to the LEAP program of advanced composite fan blades and fan \ncases under a long-term supply contract. The LEAP engine is used on the Airbus A320neo, Boeing 737 MAX, and \nCOMAC 919 aircrafts. AEC’s largest aerospace customer is SAFRAN and sales to SAFRAN (consisting primarily of \nfan blades and cases for CFM’s LEAP engine) accounted for approximately 16 percent of the Company’s \nconsolidated Net sales in 2022. Other significant AEC programs include the production of structures and parts for the \nSikorsky CH-53K helicopter, F-35 fighter jet, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (\"JASSM\"), and Boeing 787 \nplatforms. AEC also supplies vacuum waste tanks for most of the Boeing 7X7 aircraft, as well as the fan case for the \nGE9X engine.  In 2022, approximately 46% of the AEC segment’s sales were related to U.S. government contracts or \nprograms.\nSee “Business Environment Overview and Trends” under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations, for a discussion of general segment developments in recent years.\n10"

MC's global manufacturing footprint \nis designed to most efficiently meet regional customer requirements. Our AEC business segment maintains \nmanufacturing facilities in the United States, France, Mexico, and Germany to meet customer demand in those \nregions.\nOur global presence subjects us to certain risks, including tariffs and other restrictions on trade, and controls on \nforeign exchange and the repatriation of funds. While the direct impact of recent developments in global trade and \ntariff policy has not been significant, there is risk that the impact of such developments on companies in our supply \nchain will be reflected in higher costs from affected suppliers. We have a cash repatriation strategy that targets a \ncertain amount of foreign current year earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. Changes in the trade or regulatory \ncompliance in any country that we have significant cash balances could make it difficult to repatriate foreign earnings \ncost-effectively in the future.\nEffect of Global Macroeconomic and Political Climate\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine is affecting the economic and global financial markets and exacerbating \nongoing economic challenges caused by impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including rising inflation and \nglobal supply chain disruptions. \nOur MC segment has historically generated approximately 2% of its annual net sales from customers in Russia \nand Ukraine.  In addition, a subsidiary within our Machine Clothing segment has been a partner in a joint venture \n(“JV”) that supplies paper machine clothing products to local papermakers in Russia. In March 2022, we made the \ndecision to cease doing business in Russia, including giving notice to our JV partner of our intent to exit the venture.  \nAs a result, we recognized $1.5 million expense in cost of goods sold and in Selling, General, and Administrative \nexpense, representing reserves against the risk of obsolescence of certain inventory destined for Russian customers \nand uncollectible receivables from Russian customers, respectively.  In the first quarter of 2022, we also wrote down \nthe net book value of our investment in the aforementioned JV to reflect our intent to exit such venture, resulting in \n$0.8 million impairment loss included in Other (income)/expense, net.\nOur cessation of doing business in Russia resulted in a reduction of approximately $10 million in annual net sales \nin the MC segment during 2022.\nDuring 2022, our segments saw higher input costs due to increased energy costs, tight supply market, and global \nlogistics challenges. Our MC segment experienced higher energy prices, higher labor costs, and  increased raw \nmaterial prices.  We continued to identify  alternatives to secure materials in the face of intense supply constraints.  \nLogistics costs have begun to stabilize compared to the same period last year, though they remained higher than pre-\npandemic levels.  \nWe anticipate inflationary pressure and energy cost escalation to be a primary input cost pressure in the near \nterm.\nThe ultimate financial impact due to the aforementioned global macroeconomic conditions and political climate is \ndifficult to predict.  During 2022, MC segment input costs increased approximately $10 million as a result of these \nfactors, or an unfavorable impact to the segment gross margin of approximately 140 basis points for the year.\nOur Albany Engineered Composites segment does not have significant direct exposure in Russia. However, it has \nnot been immune from supply chain disruptions.  Increasing fuel prices coupled with higher demand has resulted in \nincreased freight costs during the quarter, along with ongoing logistic constraints, higher labor costs, and increases in \nraw material prices.  Due to the nature of AEC’s contracts with its customers, we currently anticipate passing through \na portion of such cost increases to the customers. \n11"

      "text": "Until the effects of the macroeconomic conditions and political climate on global markets subside, there can be no \nassurance that our input costs will not continue to rise beyond our current estimate, thus unfavorably impacting our \nfuture results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nResearch and Development and Technology\nWe invest in research, new product development, and technical analysis with the objective of maintaining our \ntechnological leadership in each business segment. While much of our research activity supports existing products, \nwe also engage in significant research and development activities for new technology platforms, products and product \nenhancements.\nMC segment products are custom-designed for each user, depending on the type, size, and speed of the \nmachine, and the products being produced. Product design is also a function of the machine section, the grade of \nproduct being produced, and the quality of the stock used. Technical expertise, judgment, and experience are critical \nin designing the appropriate clothing for each machine, position, and application. As a result, many employees in \nsales and technical functions have engineering degrees, paper mill experience, or other manufacturing experience in \nthe markets in which they operate. Our market leadership position reflects our commitment to technological \ninnovation. This innovation has resulted in new MC products and/or enhancements across all of our product lines.\nAlbany Engineered Composites designs, develops and manufactures advanced composite parts for complex \naerospace applications, using a range of core technologies, including its proprietary 3D-woven reinforced composites \ntechnology, traditional 2D laminated composite structures, automated material placement, filament winding, through-\nthickness reinforcement, braiding, and thermoplastic pultrusion.\nIn addition to continuous significant investment in core research and development activities in pursuit of new \nproprietary products and manufacturing processes, experienced research and development employees in each \nbusiness segment also work collaboratively with customers, OEMs and suppliers on targeted development efforts to \nintroduce new products and applications in their respective markets.\nCompany-funded research expenses totaled $31.4 million in 2022, $29.6 million in 2021, and $25.8 million in \n2020. In 2022, these costs were 3.0 percent of total Company Net sales, including $15.4 million, or 3.6 percent of Net \nsales, in our AEC segment. Research and development in the AEC segment includes both Company-sponsored and \ncustomer-funded activities. Some customer funded research and development may be on a cost sharing basis, in \nwhich case, amounts charged to the collaborating entity are credited against research and development costs. For \ncustomer-funded research and development in which we anticipate funding to exceed expenses, we include amounts \ncharged to the customer in Net sales. Cost of sales associated with customer-funded research was $5.2 million in \n2022, $5.2 million in 2021, and $5.1 million in 2020.\nWe have developed, and continue to develop, proprietary intellectual property germane to the industries we \nserve. Our intellectual property takes many forms, including patents, trademarks, trade names and domains, and \ntrade secrets. Our trade secrets include, among other things, manufacturing know-how and unique processes and \nequipment. Because intellectual property in the form of patents is published, we often forgo patent protection and \npreserve the intellectual property as trade secrets. We aggressively protect our proprietary intellectual property, \npursuing patent protection when appropriate. Our active portfolio currently contains over 2,300 patents, and \napproximately 160 new patents are typically granted each year. While we consider our total portfolio of intellectual \nproperty, including our patents, to be an important competitive advantage, we do not believe that any single patent is \ncritical to the continuation of our business. All brand names and product names are trade names of Albany \nInternational Corp. or its subsidiaries. We have from time to time licensed some of our patents and/or know-how to \none or more competitors, and have been licensed under some competitors’ patents, in each case mainly to enhance \ncustomer acceptance of new products. The revenue from such licenses is less than 1 percent of consolidated net \nsales.\nRaw Materials\nPrimary raw materials for our MC products are polymer monofilaments and fibers, which have generally been \navailable from a number of suppliers. In addition, we manufacture polymer monofilaments, a basic raw material for all \ntypes of machine clothing, at our facility in Homer, New York, which supplies approximately 24 percent of our \nworldwide monofilament requirements. In the AEC segment, the primary raw materials are carbon fiber and resin. \nWhile there are a number of potential suppliers of carbon fiber and other raw materials used by AEC, the use of \ncertain suppliers may be mandated by customer agreements, and alternative suppliers would be subject to material \n12"

      "text": "qualification or other requirements that may preclude or delay their availability. In the case of mandated suppliers, \nAEC endeavors to enter into long-term supply agreements to help mitigate price and availability risks. Currently, the \nprimary raw materials used in each segment are derived from petroleum, and are therefore sensitive to changes in the \nprice of petroleum and petroleum intermediates.\nCompetition\nIn the paper machine clothing market, we believe that we had a worldwide market share of approximately 30 \npercent in 2022.\nPrice and technology are the primary means of competitive differentiation in the industry.  Albany’s Machine \nClothing product portfolio is broad and deep, with products for every part of the machine and a wide range of machine \ntypes and paper grades. The Company’s research and development team works closely with the sales and technical \norganization to develop new products to meet changes in customer needs, and also pursues targeted joint \ndevelopment activities with customers and equipment manufacturers to create new products. Albany’s experienced \nsales and technical team members – many of whom have worked in the industries that we serve - work closely with \neach customer to acquire deep understanding of the customer’s combination of raw materials, manufacturing \nequipment, manufacturing processes, and paper, pulp, nonwovens or other product being produced – a combination \nthat is unique to each customer, plant and machine. This experience and knowledge, combined with knowledge of \nand experience with the Company’s own extensive product portfolio, allows the sales and technical teams to ensure \nthat the appropriate machine clothing products are being supplied for each part of the machine, to customize those \nproducts as needed for best performance, and to continuously propose new products that offer each customer the \npossibility of even better performance and increased savings. Our paper machine clothing solutions enable our \ncustomers to reduce energy consumption, improve resource efficiency, and help maintain and improve water quality. \nThese efforts – which effectively integrate the Company’s experience and technological expertise into each product \nwe sell – are reflected in the Company’s strong competitive position in the marketplace. Some of the Company’s \npaper machine clothing competitors also supply paper machines, papermaking equipment, and aftermarket parts and \nservices, and often bundle clothing with original or rebuilt machines and/or aftermarket services.\nThe primary competitive factors in the markets in which our Albany Engineered Composites segment competes \nare product performance, delivery performance, quality, and price. Achieving lower weight without sacrificing strength \nis the key to improving fuel efficiency, which helps reduce the carbon footprint of global aviation, and is a critical \nperformance requirement in the aerospace industry. Our broad array of capabilities in composites enables us to offer \ncustomers the opportunity to displace metal components and, in some cases, conventional composites with lower-\nweight, high-strength, and potentially high-temperature resistant composites. The dominant competitive factor is the \nrelative importance the customer places on these performance benefits, which include fuel savings/ emissions \nreductions due to lower weight, against the possible cost advantage of more traditional metal and composite \ncomponents.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAlbany International recognizes that its long, successful history and future opportunities are directly linked to \ndedicated, engaged and diverse employees that serve the Company in all business operations.   Albany currently \nemploys approximately 4,100 people, with significant operations in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. \nWages and benefits are competitive with those of other manufacturers in the geographic areas in which our facilities \nare located. A number of hourly employees outside of the United States are members of various unions. In general, \nwe consider our relations with employees to be excellent. Employees participate in regular training programs \nappropriate for their responsibility and extensive optional training programs have been developed for those who seek \nprofessional and personal growth opportunities. All employees are required to participate in safety training on a \nregular basis. We have systematically and continuously reduced our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) by \napproximately 65% since 2019 to 0.48 in 2022.  \nThe Company’s Executive Vice President- Human Resources and Chief Human Resources Officer meets \nregularly with the Chief Executive Officer to align Human Capital strategy, plan and initiatives with business strategy \nand goals. Albany’s Human Capital Resources plan ensures that we provide a rewarding employee experience across \nthe company.  We continuously review our Human Capital Resources metrics, including safety metrics and action \nplans, to promote an emotionally and physically safe and inclusive working environment.\nOur Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) Council develops a holistic and actionable DE&I strategy that seeks \ndiversity, nurtures inclusion, amplifies innovation and empowers champions.  Our hiring strategy recruits candidates \nfrom a broad range of hiring sources that target people with diverse backgrounds and skills to fill open positions within \nthe Company. Approximately 26% of our global workforce were women in 2022. Our Empowering Women Leaders \nNetwork aims to continue increasing representation of women at all levels to contribute to the Company’s business \nsuccess through relationships, and partnerships.\n13"

      "text": "Item 1A. \nRISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only \nrisks and uncertainties facing the Company. This list is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. If any of \nthe events contemplated by the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could \nbe materially adversely affected.  Some of these risks are described below and in the documents incorporated by \nreference, and investors should take these risks into account when evaluating any investment decision involving the \nCompany. \nRisks related to our business and operations\nThe effects of COVID-19 and other potential future public health crises, epidemics, pandemics or similar \nevents on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows are uncertain\nThe public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken by governments, \nbusinesses, and the public at large to limit COVID-19's spread has had, and are expected to continue to have, certain \nnegative effects on the markets we serve. These effects include deteriorating general economic conditions in many \nregions of the world, increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income, decline in consumer confidence, and \nchanges in consumer spending habits. In the U.S. and in several other countries these effects appear to be on the \nwane.  Nevertheless, the evolution of the pandemic, governments’ responses to the pandemic, and individuals’ \nbehavior in response to the pandemic and its effects, in aggregate, continue to impact business conditions in varied \nand unpredictable ways. Certain adverse impacts specific to the Company include, without limitation:\n•  During 2022, some employees in various plants contracted the COVID-19 virus, which led to workforce \nabsences of employees that contracted the virus and others that may have been exposed. Highly contagious \ndiseases such as COVID-19 create the risk that we may need to shut down one of our facilities for an extended period \nof time, which could increase our costs and affect our ability to meet commitments to customers.  In 2022, although \nwe did not shut down any of our plants due to COVID-19, production at some plants was affected by government \nshutdown orders in areas adjacent to those plants.  There is no guarantee that future government shutdown orders, or \nour own future shutdowns, should they occur, will not have a more significant impact on our production.\n•  Behavioral changes that have occurred during the pandemic have impacted demand for various products that \nare made with MC fabrics. The above effects could have an adverse impact on demand for publication paper grades, \nand perhaps other grades of paper, including without limitation packaging paper grades, as well as on demand for \nnon-woven fabrics and fiber cement products used in the construction industry; such impacts would in turn adversely \nimpact demand for the MC products used to manufacture such paper grades or building products. A decline in \nrevenues would lead to lower gross profit on those products and the possibility of unabsorbed fixed manufacturing \ncosts.\n• The Albany Engineered Composites segment generates a significant portion of its revenue from commercial \naerospace programs and contracts for the U.S. Department of Defense. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly \nimpacted passenger air travel which, in turn, has impacted and is likely to continue to impact the commercial \naerospace programs that provide a source of revenue for the Company. Such programs could be delayed or canceled \nwhich, in addition to a loss of revenue and gross profit, could lead to write-offs for Company investments for those \nprograms. The pandemic has resulted in significant costs for the U.S. government, which could lead to program \ndelays or cancellations, and a corresponding decrease in our revenues. \n• Disruptions in supply chains have placed constraints on our ability to source key raw materials and services \nwhich could impact our ability to deliver products to customers as scheduled. Additionally, manufacturing or delivery \ncosts could increase.\n• While we do not anticipate material impairments on our assets as a result of COVID-19, changes in our \nexpectations for net sales, earnings potential and cash flows associated with our intangible assets and goodwill that \nfall below our current projections could result in such assets being impaired. \n16"

      "text": "A number of industry factors have had, and in future periods could have, an adverse impact on \nsales, profitability and cash flow in the Company’s MC and AEC segments\nSignificant consolidation and rationalization in the paper industry in recent years have reduced global \nconsumption of paper machine clothing in certain markets and for certain grades. Developments in digital media have \nadversely affected demand for newsprint and for printing and writing grades of paper, which has had, and is likely to \ncontinue to have, an adverse effect on demand for paper machine clothing in those markets. At the same time, \ntechnological advances in papermaking, including in paper machine clothing, while contributing to the papermaking \nefficiency of customers, have in some cases lengthened the useful life of our products and reduced the number of \npieces required to produce the same volume of paper. These factors have had, and in the future are likely to have, an \nadverse effect on paper machine clothing sales.\nThe market for paper machine clothing in recent years has been characterized by continuous pressure to provide \nmore favorable commercial terms, which has continued to place pressure on our operating results. We expect such \npressure to remain intense in all paper machine clothing markets, especially during periods of customer consolidation, \nplant closures, or when major contracts are being renegotiated. The emergence of Chinese competitors exacerbates \nthis risk.\nSimilar pressures exist in the markets in which AEC competes. During 2019, Net sales under the LEAP contract \nexceeded $210 million.  Due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, the destocking of the supply chain and the \nimpact of the pandemic on air travel, Net sales generated by the LEAP contract were approximately $100 milllion in \neach of 2020 and 2021, before improving to $165 million in 2022. \nAdditionally, many of AEC’s customers, as well as the companies supplied by our customers are under pressure \nto achieve acceptable returns on their substantial investments in recent years in new technologies, new programs and \nnew product introductions. This has contributed to a relentless focus on reducing costs, resulting in continuous \npressure for cost reduction and pricing improvement throughout the supply chain. The recent wave of consolidation in \nthe aerospace industry could continue or intensify these pressures.\nThe long-term organic growth prospects of AEC are subject to a number of risks\nThe prospect of future successful organic growth in AEC depends in large part on its ability to maintain and grow \na healthy pipeline of potential new products and applications for its technologies, to transform a sufficient number of \nthose potential opportunities into commercial supply agreements, and to then execute its obligations under such \nagreements. In addition, existing and future supply agreements, especially for commercial and defense aerospace, \nare subject to the same curtailment or cancellation risks as the programs they support.\nAEC is currently working on a broad portfolio of potential new product applications in the aerospace industry. \nThese development projects may or may not result in commercial supply opportunities. In the event that AEC \nsucceeds in developing products and securing contracts to manufacture and supply them, it will face the same \nindustrialization and manufacturing ramp-up risks that it currently faces in its existing contracts, and AEC may or may \nnot be successful in meeting its obligations under these contracts. Failure to manage these development, \ncommercialization and execution risks could have a material adverse impact on AEC’s prospects for revenue growth.\nIn addition to dealing with these development and manufacturing execution risks, future AEC growth will likely \nrequire increasingly larger amounts of cash to fund the investments in equipment, capital, and development efforts \nneeded to achieve this growth.  Until AEC is able to consistently generate cash flows sufficient to fund its existing \noperations and any future investment to support its growth, it will remain dependent on the MC segment’s ability to \ngenerate cash. A significant decline in MC sales, operating income or cash flows could therefore have a material \nadverse impact on AEC’s growth.\nThe U.S. Government’s Department of Defense (“DoD”) Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (“CMMC”) \nprogram introduces new and unique risks for DoD contractors \nUnder the applicable federal regulations for DoD contractors, AEC is required to comply with the agencies \ncurrent cybersecurity regulations. In addition to these current regulations, AEC will be required to comply with the new \nCMMC program requirements on future contracts as they are flowed down from our DoD prime customers in the \ncoming years. Given the current and planned future portfolio of U.S. Government-related business, AEC expects to be \nrequired to comply fully with the highest levels of the planned CMMC framework and will potentially be subject to third-\nparty or U.S. Government audit to certify our compliance.

If AEC were to \nsupply products with manufacturing defects, or products that failed to conform to contractual requirements, we could \nbe required to recall and/or replace them, and could also be subject to substantial contractual damages or warranty \nclaims from our customers. AEC could also be subject to product liability claims if such failures were to cause death, \ninjury or losses to third parties, or damage claims resulting from the grounding of aircraft into which such defective or \nnon-conforming products had been incorporated. We are required to meet, and maintain continuous independent \ncertification, to certain international industry standards including AS/EN9100 quality management system standards \nand Nadcap Special Processes certifications that are designed to assure rigorous quality standards are maintained \nthroughout the aerospace industry supply chain.  Additionally, we maintain product liability insurance and other \ninsurance at levels we believe to be prudent and consistent with industry practice to help mitigate these risks, these \ncoverages may not be sufficient to fully cover AEC’s exposure for such risks, which could have a material adverse \neffect on AEC’s results of operations and cash flows.\nDeterioration of global economic conditions could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and \nresults of operations\nThe Company identifies in this section a number of risks, the effects of which may be exacerbated by an \nunfavorable economic climate. For example, a recession could lead to lower consumption in all paper grades \nincluding tissue and packaging, which would not only reduce consumption of paper machine clothing but could also \nincrease the risk of greater price competition in the machine clothing industry.\nSimilarly, in the Company’s AEC segment, a decline in global or regional economic conditions could result in \nlower orders for aircraft or aircraft engines, or the cancellation of existing orders, which would in turn result in reduced \ndemand for the AEC components utilized on such aircraft or engines. Demand for AEC’s light-weight composite \naircraft components is driven by demand for the lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft engine and other applications into \nwhich they are incorporated, such as the CFM LEAP engine. Fuel costs are a significant part of operating costs for \nairlines and, in many cases, may constitute a carrier’s single largest operating expense. A sustained drop in oil prices, \nand related decline in the price of jet fuel, could prompt airlines to defer orders or delivery dates for such newer, more \nfuel-efficient airframes and aircraft engines, as the urgency to reduce fuel consumption may be lessened. In addition, \nany economic conditions that led to sustained high interest rates could affect the airline’s ability to finance new aircraft \nand engine orders.\nWeak or unstable economic conditions also increase the risk that one or more of our customers could be unable \nto pay outstanding accounts receivable, whether as the result of bankruptcy or an inability to obtain working capital \nfinancing from banks or other lenders. Furthermore, both the MC and AEC business segments manufacture products \nthat are custom-designed for a specific customer application. In the event of a customer liquidity issue, the Company \ncould also be required to write off amounts that are included in Contract assets,net or Inventories. In the case of AEC, \nsuch write-offs could also include investments in equipment, tooling, and non-recurring engineering, some of which \ncould be significant depending on the program.\nThe Company continues to experience increasing labor, raw material, energy, and logistic costs due to \nsupply chain constraints and inflationary pressures\nThe Company is a significant user of raw materials that are based on petroleum or petroleum derivatives. \nIncreases in the prices of petroleum or petroleum derivatives, particularly in regions that are experiencing higher \nlevels of inflation, could increase our costs, and we may not be able to fully offset the effects through price increases, \nproductivity improvements, and cost-reduction programs.\nThere is a limited number of suppliers of polymer fiber and monofilaments, key raw materials used in the \nmanufacture of machine clothing, and of carbon fiber and carbon resin, key raw materials used by AEC. In addition, \nthere are a limited number of suppliers of some of the equipment used in each of the MC and AEC segments. The \nrisks associated with limited suppliers increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has put pressure on \nthe supply chain in general, and  transportation companies that deliver raw materials to us and our products to \ncustomers, in particular.

AEC currently relies on single suppliers \nunder contracts they have with SAFRAN to meet the carbon fiber and carbon resin requirements for the LEAP \nprogram.  Lack of supply, delivery delays, or quality issues relating to supplied raw materials or for our key \nmanufacturing equipment could harm our production capacity.  Such could require the Company to attempt to qualify \none or more additional suppliers, which could be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process.  These disruptions could \nmake it difficult to supply our customers with products on time, which could have a negative impact on our business, \nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company also relies on the labor market in many regions of the world to meet our operational requirements, \nadvance our technology and differentiate products. Low rates of unemployment in key geographic areas in which the \nCompany operates can lead to high rates of turnover and loss of critical talent, which could in turn lead to higher labor \ncosts.\nOur ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace\nWe believe our brand names and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our products \nand services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. \nHowever, our reputation is susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with customers or competitors, \ncybersecurity incidents or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, compliance violations, \ngovernment investigations or legal proceedings. We may also experience reputational damage from employees, \nadvocacy groups, regulators, investors and other stakeholders that disagree with the way we conduct our business. \nSimilarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements by current or former customers, suppliers, \nemployees, competitors, joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, \nas well as members of the investment community or the media, including social media influencers.\nOur brand and reputation are also associated with our public commitments to various corporate environmental, \nsocial and governance (“ESG”) initiatives, including our goals for sustainability and inclusion and diversity.

Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and \ntime-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing customers reluctant to select us for new opportunities or \ncould negatively impact our relationships with existing customers and suppliers, resulting in a loss of business, and \ncould adversely affect our talent recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce \ninvestor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.\nSome of the Company’s competitors in the MC segment have the capability to make and sell paper machines \nand papermaking equipment as well as other engineered fabrics\nAlthough customers historically have tended to view the purchase of paper machine clothing and the purchase of \npaper machines as separate purchasing decisions, the ability to bundle fabrics with new machines and after-market \nservices could provide an advantage to our competitors. This underscores the importance of our ability to maintain the \ntechnological competitiveness and value of our products, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect \non our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMoreover, we cannot predict how the nature of competition in this segment may continue to evolve as a result of \nfuture consolidation among our competitors, or consolidation involving our competitors and other suppliers to our \ncustomers.\nConditions in the paper industry have required, and could further require, the Company to reorganize \nits operations, which could result in significant expense and could pose risks to the Company’s operations\nIn the recent past, we engaged in significant restructuring that included the closing of manufacturing operations. \nThese restructuring activities were intended to match manufacturing capacity to shifting global demand, and also to \nimprove the efficiency of manufacturing and administrative processes.

We have already stopped shipping our products to Russia and are in the process of winding down a \nsmall joint venture in that country which supplied dryer fabrics to local papermakers, resulting in lost sales and \npossible future write-offs.  However, we also expect that there could be further indirect impacts. For instance, the \nconflict has already caused disruption in the availability of shipping options between Asia and Europe. Supply chain \ndisruptions could make it more difficult to find favorable pricing and reliable sources for the raw materials we need, \nputting upward pressure on our costs and increasing the risk that we may be unable to acquire the materials or \nservices we need to continue to make and deliver certain products. Moreover, these same pressures could hinder our \ncustomers’ ability to source materials needed for their own manufacturing efforts, thereby reducing or slowing their \ndemand for our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pass through input cost increases to our \ncustomers or to fully offset them via operational efficiencies.  If we are unsuccessful in managing such cost increases, \nthey could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.  \nGeopolitical tensions have heightened elsewhere as well, including between China and Taiwan.

While long-term contracts provide an opportunity to realize steady and reliable revenues for extended periods, \nthey pose a number of risks, such as program cancellations, reductions or delays in orders by AEC’s customers under \nthese contracts, the termination of such contracts or orders, or the occurrence of similar events over which AEC has \nno or limited control. \nAccounting for long-term contracts and related assets requires estimates and judgments related to our progress \ntoward completion and the long-term performance on the contract. Significant judgments include potential risks \nassociated with the ability and cost to achieve program schedule, including customer-directed delays or reductions in \nscheduled deliveries, and technical and other specific contract requirements including customer activity levels and \nvariable consideration based upon that activity. Due to the size and long-term nature of many of AEC contracts, the \nestimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Management must \nmake assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and cost (which may include estimates of variable \nconsideration, including award fees and penalties), including, but not limited to, labor productivity and availability,  \ncomplexity and scope of the work to be performed, availability and cost of materials, length of time to complete the \nperformance obligation, availability and timing of funding from our customers, as well as overhead cost rates.  \nBecause of the significance of management’s judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different \namounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. \nChanges in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations \nand financial condition.\nSales of components for a number of programs that are currently considered to be important to the future \nrevenue-growth of AEC are pursuant to short-term purchase orders for a finite period or number of parts, or short-term \nsupply agreements with terms of one to four years. Such programs include airframe components for the F-35, forward \nfuselage frames for the Boeing 787, and aft transition assembly including skins and longerons for the CH-53K \nhelicopter. As a result, while AEC reasonably expects to continue as a supplier on these programs as long as it meets \nits obligations, there can be no assurance that this will be the case, or that, in programs where it is currently a sole \nsupplier, this sole supplier status will continue. Even if AEC’s status as a supplier is extended or renewed, there can \nbe no assurance that such extension or renewal will be on the same or similar commercial or other terms. Any failure \nby AEC to maintain its current supplier status under these programs, or any material change in their commercial or \nother terms, could have a material adverse effect on AEC’s future revenues and segment operating income.\nAEC derives a significant portion of its revenue from contracts with the U.S. Government's Department of \nDefense, which are subject to unique risks\nThe funding of DoD programs is subject to congressional appropriations. Many of the DoD programs in which we \nparticipate may last several years, but they are normally funded annually. Changes in military strategy and priorities \nmay affect future opportunities and/or existing programs. Long-term DoD contracts and related orders are subject to \ncancellation, delay or restructure, if appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made. The termination \nor reduction of funding for existing or new DoD programs could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings, \ncash flow and financial position.\nAdditionally, our business funded by the U.S. Government is subject to extensive federal and DoD agency \nacquisition regulations. As a result, specific business systems and processes, as well as our proposed contract costs, \nare subject to audits by U.S. Government agencies. U.S. Government representatives may audit our compliance with \nthese required federal regulations, and such audits could result in adjustments to allowable contract costs. Any costs \nfound to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must \nbe refunded. Certain business systems or processes found to be non-compliant to federal and agency regulations \ncould result in a suspension of work until such compliance issues are corrected. If any audit uncovers improper or \nillegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination \nof contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business \nwith the U.S. Government. Realization of any of these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings, \ncash flow and financial position.\n22"

LEAP engines are currently used on the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus \nA320neo and COMAC 919 aircraft. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX led to lower deliveries of parts, resulting in \nlower revenues during 2021 and 2022. While the grounding has now been lifted, the Boeing 737 MAX orders and \ndeliveries have yet to return to pre-grounding levels, which could result in longer than expected return to such levels in \nthe future and in lower LEAP revenues for a longer period. \nThe LEAP long-term supply agreement contains certain events of default that, if triggered, could result in \ntermination of the agreement by the customer, which would also have a material adverse impact on segment sales \nand profitability.\nA substantial portion of AEC’s non-LEAP revenue in the near term, and revenue growth opportunity in the longer \nterm, is dependent upon a small number of customers and programs. Unlike the 3D-woven composite components \nsupplied by ASC, parts supplied for such non-LEAP programs are capable of being made by a number of other \nsuppliers. Such programs include airframe components for the F-35, forward fuselage frames for the Boeing 787, and \nsponsons, tail-rotor pylons, horizontal stabilizers and struts for the CH-53K helicopter. Any failure by AEC to maintain \nits current supplier status under these programs, or any material change in their commercial or other terms, could \nhave a material adverse effect on AEC’s future sales and operating income.\nOur top ten customers in the MC segment accounted for a significant portion of our Net sales in 2022. The loss \nof one or more of these customers, or a significant decrease in the amount of machine clothing they purchase from \nus, could have a material adverse impact on MC's net sales and profitability. We could also be subject to similar \nimpacts if one or more such customers were to suffer financial difficulties and be unable to pay us for products they \nhave purchased. While we normally enter into long-term supply agreements with significant MC customers, the \nagreements generally do not obligate the customer to purchase any products from us, and may be terminated by the \ncustomer at any time with appropriate notice.\nRisks related to information technology and cybersecurity\nWe are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store \nelectronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our employees, \ncustomers and suppliers.

Depending on prevailing economic conditions at the time, the Company might find it difficult to modify \nor restructure the debt on attractive terms, or at all.\nWe use interest rate swaps to manage the interest cost associated with our borrowings. Borrowings under the \nrevolving credit facility and the interest rate swaps are currently based on LIBOR, which is expected to be phased out \nand replaced starting in 2024.  Future changes in the interest rate benchmark could affect the Company’s cost of \nborrowing and its cash flows, or the effectiveness of the hedges, which could have an effect on net income.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $261 million of additional borrowing capacity under our $700 \nmillion revolving credit facility. Incurrence of additional indebtedness could increase the above-described risks \nassociated with higher leverage. In addition, any such indebtedness could contain terms that are more restrictive than \nour current facilities.\nSignificant  changes in critical estimates and assumptions related to pension and other postretirement \nbenefit (“OPEB”) costs and liabilities could affect our earnings and pension contributions in future periods \nThe determination of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ expense or income involves significant \njudgments, specifically related to our discount rate, long-term return on assets, and other actuarial assumptions.  We \nestablish our discount rate assumption annually and review whether to change our long-term return on assets \nassumption annually.  These estimates and actuarial assumptions could change significantly as a result to changes in \neconomic, legislative, and/or demographic profiles.  Such changes could result in unfavorable changes to our pension \nand OPEB expense and funded status, and our cash contributions thereof, which could have a negative impact on our \nresults of operations.  Further, the difference between actual investment returns and our long-term return on asset \nassumptions would result in a change to our pension and OPEB expense, funded status, as well as our required \ncontributions to the plans.  We manage our plan assets in accordance with our investment management objectives, \nand they are subject to market volatility and other conditions.  Differences may also arise due to changes in \nregulatory, accounting and other requirements applicable to pension plans.     \nThe Company is exposed to the risk of increased expense in health-care related costs\nWe are largely self-insured for some employee and business risks, including health care programs in the United \nStates. Losses under all of these programs are accrued based upon estimates of the ultimate liability for claims \nreported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries and service \nproviders. However, these liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity \nof an illness and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, \nand management believes such accruals to be adequate. The Company also maintains stop-loss insurance policies to \nprotect against catastrophic claims above certain limits. If actual results significantly differ from estimates, our financial \ncondition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially impacted by losses under these programs, as well \nas higher stop-loss premiums in future periods.\n25"

Unanticipated \nchanges in foreign and domestic tax laws, regulations, or policies, or their interpretation and application by regulatory \nbodies, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our future profitability and cash flows. Our domestic and \ninternational tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these jurisdictions. Our future results \nof operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of \nearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, as well as changes in the overall profitability of the Company, \ntax legislation, and generally accepted accounting principles.  \nAs of December 31, 2022, we have approximately $50.1 million net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward in \nvarious taxing jurisdictions.  Our ability to utilize the NOL carryforward could be adversely impacted by several factors, \nincluding but not limited to significant changes to tax legislation and lower than expected future earnings of the \nCompany. \nWe are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions. The open tax years in these \njurisdictions range from approximately 2014 to 2022.  We regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by \ntax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. The results of tax audits and \nexaminations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of our tax exposures \ncould materially affect our financial results.\nRisks related to our legal and regulatory environment\nThe Company may fail to adequately protect its proprietary technology, which would allow competitors \nor others to take advantage of its research and development efforts\nProprietary trade secrets are a source of competitive advantage in each of our segments. If our trade secrets \nwere to become available to competitors, it could have a negative impact on our competitive strength. We employ \nmeasures to maintain the confidential nature of these secrets, including maintaining employment and confidentiality \nagreements; maintaining clear policies intended to protect such trade secrets; educating our employees about such \npolicies; clearly identifying proprietary information subject to such agreements and policies; and vigorously enforcing \nsuch agreements and policies. Despite such measures, our employees, consultants, and third parties to whom such \ninformation may be disclosed in the ordinary course of our business may breach their obligations not to reveal such \ninformation, and any legal remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages.\nThe Company is subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks\nWe are subject to a variety of legal proceedings. Litigation is an inherently unpredictable process and \nunanticipated negative outcomes are always possible. An adverse outcome in any period could have an adverse \nimpact on the Company’s operating results for that period.\nWe are also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate \nrisk management and compliance programs, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal \ncompliance risks will continue to exist and related legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which \ncannot be predicted with certainty, are likely to arise from time to time. Failure to resolve successfully any legal \nproceedings related to compliance matters could have an adverse impact on our results in any period.\nOur global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, \nand violation of these regulations could harm our business  \nWe are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anti corruption, \nimport/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and \ndisclosure control obligations, securities regulation, ESG initiatives, anti-competition, anti-money-laundering, data \nprivacy and protection, government compliance, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations and \nhuman rights. The global nature of our operations further increases the difficulty of compliance. \nCompliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. \nViolations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, \nenforcement actions or criminal sanctions against us and/or our employees, prohibitions on doing business and \ndamage to our reputation.

These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control and could limit the price that investors \nmight be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue new series of preferred stock without \nstockholder approval. Depending on the rights and terms of any new series created, and the reaction of the market to \nthe series, the rights or value of our Class A Common Stock could be negatively affected.

MD&A is provided as a \nsupplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying \nNotes included under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \nThe MD&A generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. \nDiscussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form \n10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations” in the \nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February \n25, 2022, incorporated herein by reference.\nBusiness Environment Overview and Trends\nOur reportable segments, Machine Clothing (“MC”) and Albany Engineered Composites (“AEC”) draw on the \nsame advanced textiles and materials processing capabilities, and compete on the basis of product-based advantage \nthat is grounded in those core capabilities.\nThe MC segment is the Company’s long-established core business and primary generator of cash. While it has \nbeen negatively impacted by well-documented declines in publication grades in the Company’s traditional markets, \nthere has been some offsetting effect due to growth in demand for packaging and tissue grades, as well as the \nexpansion of paper consumption and production in Asia and South America. We feel we are well-positioned in key \nmarkets, with high-quality, low-cost production in growth markets, substantially lower fixed costs in mature markets, \nand continued strength in new product development, technical product support, and manufacturing technology. Some \nof the markets in which our products are sold are expected to have low levels of growth and we face pricing pressures \nin all markets. Despite these market pressures on revenue, the MC business retains the potential for maintaining \nstable earnings in the future. MC has been a significant generator of cash, and we seek to maintain the cash-\ngenerating potential of this business by maintaining the low costs that we have achieved through continuous focus on \ncost-reduction initiatives, and competing vigorously by using our differentiated and technically superior products to \nreduce our customers’ total cost of operation and improve their paper quality.\nThe AEC segment provides significant longer term growth potential for the Company. Our strategy is to grow by \nfocusing our proprietary 3D-woven technology, as well as our non-3D technology capabilities, on high-value \naerospace (both commercial and defense) applications, while at the same time performing successfully on our \nportfolio of growth programs. AEC (including Albany Safran Composites, LLC (“ASC”), in which our customer \nSAFRAN Group owns a 10 percent noncontrolling interest) supplies a number of customers in the aerospace industry. \nAEC’s largest aerospace customer is the SAFRAN Group (\"SAFRAN\") and sales to SAFRAN, through ASC, \n(consisting primarily of fan blades and cases for CFM’s LEAP engine) accounted for approximately 16 percent of the \nCompany’s consolidated Net sales in 2022. AEC, through ASC, also supplies 3D-woven composite fan cases for the \nGE9X engine. AEC’s current portfolio of non-3D programs includes components for the CH-53K helicopter, \ncomponents for the F-35, missile bodies for Lockheed Martin’s JASSM air-to-surface missiles, fuselage components \nfor the Boeing 787, and vacuum waste tanks for Boeing 7-Series aircraft.  AEC is actively engaged in research to \ndevelop new applications in both commercial and defense aircraft engine and airframe markets. In 2022, \napproximately 46 percent of AEC sales were related to U.S. government contracts or programs.\n33"

      "text": "Net Sales\nAEC experienced significant growth during 2022, with Net sales increasing approximately $115 million, \nprimarily due to CH-53K and LEAP programs. Excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates, the \nincrease in Net sales was 39.6%.\nAEC has contracts with certain customers, including its contract for the LEAP program, where revenue is \ndetermined by a cost-plus-fee agreement. Revenue earned under these arrangements accounted for approximately \n40 percent of segment revenue for 2022 and 2021. LEAP engines are currently used on the  Airbus A320neo, Boeing \n737 MAX, and COMAC 919 aircraft. \nIn addition, AEC has long-term contracts in which the selling price is fixed.  In accounting for those contracts, we \nestimate the profit margin expected at the completion of the contract and recognize a pro-rata share of that profit \nduring the course of the contract using a cost-to-cost approach. Changes in estimated contract profitability will affect \nrevenue and gross profit when the change occurs, which could have a significant favorable or unfavorable effect on \nrevenue and gross profit in any reporting period. For contracts with anticipated losses, a provision for the entire \namount of the estimated remaining loss is charged against income in the period in which the loss becomes known. \nContract losses are determined considering all direct and indirect contract costs, exclusive of any selling, general or \nadministrative cost allocations, which are treated as period expenses. Expected losses on projects include losses on \ncontract options that are probable of exercise, excluding profitable options that often follow.\nGross Profit\nThe increase in Gross profit was primarily due to increased Net Sales due to growth on CH-53K and LEAP \nprograms.  Gross margin remained largely in line with the prior year.  \nOperating Income/(Loss)\nOperating income nearly doubled year over year, increasing $15.4 million in 2022, principally due to an  increase \nin Gross profit, as described above, partially offset by an increase in Selling and general expenses of $3.7 million \nrelated to investments in business development activities, and an increase in Research expense of $2.5 million \nrelated to investments in new technologies and enhanced capabilities.\nWorking Capital, Liquidity and Capital Structure\nWorking Capital\nPayment terms granted to paper industry and other machine clothing customers reflect general competitive \npractices. Terms vary with product, competitive conditions, and the country of operation. In some markets, customer \nagreements require us to maintain significant amounts of finished goods inventory to assure continuous availability of \nour products.\nIn addition to supplying paper, paperboard, and tissue companies, the MC segment is a leading supplier to the \nnonwovens (which includes the manufacture of products such as diapers, personal care, and household wipes), \nbuilding products, and tannery and textile industries. These non-paper industries have a wide range of customers, \nwith markets that vary from industrial applications to consumer use products. The AEC segment primarily serves \ncustomers in the commercial and defense aerospace market through both engine and airframe applications. AEC's \nworking capital levels rose sharply in the last few years in line with the segment's growth.  \nIn the MC segment, the Chinese New Year, summer months, and the end of the year are often periods of lower \nproduction for some of our customers, which, in the past contributed to seasonal variation in sales and orders. In \nrecent years, shorter order cycles and lower inventory levels throughout the supply chain have become a more \nsignificant factor in quarterly sales. The impact of these combined factors on any quarter can be difficult to predict, \nand can make quarterly comparisons less meaningful than annual comparisons. While seasonality is generally not a \nsignificant factor in the Albany Engineered Composites segment, the commercial terms of the supply agreement \ngoverning the LEAP program resulted in fourth quarter sales volatility in recent years.\n39"

The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by the following. AEC \ngenerated working capital cash inflows in Accounts receivable and Contract assets during 2021 (due to significant \ndeliveries of LEAP components throughout the year), while during 2022, AEC invested in working capital as it \nprepared to execute on its expanded CH-53K scope of work.  The Company made contributions of approximately \n$12.6 million to the U.S. pension plan during 2022, in connection with the termination of such plan (see discussion in \nNote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  In addition, the timing of customer and vendor invoice payments, \nas well as higher incentive compensation payouts during 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, contributed to \nreduced net cash provided by operating activities.  \nWe strategically deploy our cash with a focus on investing in our business and new technologies to provide our \ncustomers with enhanced capabilities, increase shareholder value, and position ourselves to take advantage of new \nbusiness opportunities as they arise.  Based on such strategy, we have continued to invest in our business and \ntechnologies through capital expenditures, research and development, and when appropriate, selective business \nacquisitions.  Our capital expenditures totaled $96.3 million and $53.7 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, \ncomprised of both sustaining and return seeking projects.  In the recent past, a portion of our capital expenditures \nconsisted of investments to improve operational productivity, in addition to producing a meaningful impact on energy \nand resource efficiency.\nNet cash used in financing activities during 2022 was $23.7 million compared to $99.6 million in 2021, driven by \nincreased borrowings during the current year that were partially used to fund repurchases of shares. \nLiquidity and Capital Structure\nWe finance our business activities primarily with cash generated from operations and borrowings, largely through \nour revolving credit agreement as discussed below.  Our subsidiaries outside of the United States may also maintain \nworking capital lines with local banks, but borrowings under such local facilities tend to be insignificant. \nUnder our $700 million unsecured credit agreement, $439 million of borrowings were outstanding as of December \n31, 2022.  We believe cash flows from operations and availability under our Credit Agreement will be adequate to \ncover our operations and business needs over the next twelve months.  As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and \ncash equivalents of $292 million and availability under our Credit Agreement of $261 million, for a total liquidity of \napproximately $553 million. For more information on  the revolving credit agreement, see Note 13 to the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements. \nAs of December 31, 2022, $273.2 million of our total cash and cash equivalents was held by non-U.S. \nsubsidiaries.

We have contractual commitments to repay \ndebt, make payments under leases, contribute to our pension and postretirement plans, and settle obligations related \nto agreements to purchase goods and services, income taxes, compensation plans, and as applicable, interest rate \nswaps.  We estimate these contractual commitments amount to approximately $588 million as of December 31, 2022, \nof which we expect to pay $44 million within the next year.  Such commitments are not representative of all our future \ncash requirements, which will vary based on future needs. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nFor the discussion of our accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The \npreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of \nAmerica requires management to make assumptions and estimates that directly affect the amounts reported in the \nConsolidated Financial Statements. Each of these assumptions is subject to uncertainties and changes in those \nassumptions or judgments which can affect our results of operations. In addition to the accounting policies stated in \nItem 8, financial statement amounts and disclosures are significantly influenced by market factors, judgments and \nestimates as described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nContracts with customers in the Machine Clothing segment have various terms that can affect the point in time \nwhen revenue is recognized. The contractual terms are closely monitored in order to ensure revenue is recognized in \nthe proper period.\nProducts and services provided under long-term contracts represent a significant portion of sales in the Albany \nEngineered Composites segment. AEC’s largest source of revenue is derived from the LEAP contract under a cost-\nplus-fee agreement. The fee is variable based on our success in achieving certain cost targets. Revenue is \nrecognized over time as costs are incurred. Under this contract, there is significant judgment involved in determining \napplicable contract costs and the amount of revenue to be recognized.\nWe also have fixed price long-term contracts, for which we use the percentage of completion (incurred cost to \ntotal estimated cost) method. That method requires significant judgment and estimation, which could be considerably \ndifferent if the underlying circumstances were to change. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs \nare required, any changes from prior estimates are included in earnings in the period the change occurs.\nAEC has long-term aerospace contracts under which there are two phases: a phase during which the production \npart is designed and tested, and a phase of supplying production parts. During the design and testing phases, we \nperform pre-production or nonrecurring engineering services, which are normally considered a fulfillment activity, \nrather than a performance obligation. Fulfillment activities that create resources that will be used in satisfying \nperformance obligations in the future, and are expected to be recovered, are capitalized in Other assets. The \ncapitalized costs are amortized into Cost of goods sold over the period which the asset is expected to contribute to \nfuture cash flows, including anticipated renewal periods. Accumulated capitalized costs are written-off when those \ncosts are determined to be unrecoverable.\nFor contracts with anticipated losses, a provision for the entire amount of the estimated remaining loss is \ncharged against income in the period in which the loss becomes known. Contract loss provisions include contract \noptions that are probable of exercise, excluding any profitable options that might be expected to follow. Contract \nlosses are determined considering all direct and indirect contract costs, exclusive of any selling, general or \nadministrative costs, which are treated as period expenses. We are required to limit our estimate of contract values to \nthe period of the legally enforceable contract. While certain contracts are expected to be profitable over the course of \nthe program life when including expected renewals, our estimate of contract revenues and costs is limited to the \nestimated value of enforceable rights and obligations, excluding anticipated renewals. In some cases, the contract \nperiod may result in a loss contract provision at the inception of the contract. \n41"

      "text": "Pension and Postretirement Liabilities\nWe sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans.  Our liabilities under these defined benefit plans \nare determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the \ndiscount rate, health care cost inflation rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. We review our actuarial \nassumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions when appropriate.\nDiscount Rate Selection\nWe select a discount rate for purposes of measuring obligations under defined benefit plans by matching cash \nflows separately for each plan to the yields on high-quality zero coupon bonds.  We use the RATE: Link 60-90 model \n(the \"RATE Link\"). We believe the projected cash flows used to determine RATE Link provide a good approximation of \nthe timing and amounts of our defined benefit payments under our plans and no adjustments to RATE Link has been \nmade.  \nMeasurement of our postretirement benefit obligations requires the use of several assumptions about factors \nthat will affect the amount and timing of future benefit payments. The assumed health care cost trend rates are the \nmost critical estimates for measurement of the postretirement benefit obligation. Changes in the health care cost trend \nrates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care benefit obligation.\nLong-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets Assumption\nOur expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived from our asset allocation strategies and \nanticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. Our analysis gives consideration to recent plan \nperformance and historical returns; however, the assumptions are primarily based on long-term, prospective rates of \nreturn. The weighted average long-term rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans is 3.2% for \n2022.\nBased on information provided by actuaries and other relevant sources, the Company believes that the \nassumptions used to estimate expenses, assets and liabilities of pensions and postretirement benefits are \nreasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact the Company’s financial position, results of \noperations or cash flows.\nIncome Taxes\nWe regularly assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through the reversal of \nexisting temporary differences and/or future taxable income.  To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not \nthat a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established.  The amount of a valuation \nallowance is based upon our best estimate of our ability to realize the deferred tax assets.  \nGoodwill and Intangible assets\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually.  Estimating the fair value of reporting \nunits requires the use of estimates and significant judgments, including but not limited to revenue growth rates, \noperating margins, discount rates, and future market conditions.  It is possible that these judgments and estimates \ncould change in future periods.\nThe determination of the fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business acquisition is subject to many \nestimates and assumptions.  Among such estimates and assumptions are royalties, discount rate and useful life.  We \nreview amortizable intangible asset groups for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate \nthat the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nRecent Pronouncements\nIn March 2022, the SEC issued a proposed rule to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity \nrisk management, strategy, governance, and incident reporting by public companies.  The proposed rules are \nintended to provide more consistent, comparable and decision-useful information so that investors can better evaluate \nthe Company’s exposure to cybersecurity risks, incidents, and strategies to mitigate risks and incidents. We will \ncontinue to monitor developments around this proposed rule.\nAlso in March 2022, the SEC issued a proposed rule that would enhance and standardize the climate-related \ndisclosures provided by public companies.  Under the proposed rule, we would be required to provide quantitative and \nqualitative disclosures in registration statements and annual reports that include climate-related financial impact and \nexpenditure metrics as well as a discussion of climate-related impacts on financial estimates and assumptions, all of \n42"

Such disclosures would also be subject to \nmanagement's internal control over financial reporting (\"ICFR\") and external audit. As a Company, we have long been \ncommitted to sustainable practices and corporate social responsibility and have more recently taken steps to \narticulate our values and goals, some of which are summarized in our published sustainability report that is included \nat our website www.albint.com. In 2020, we began establishing more formalized and scalable approaches to our \nsustainability practices, reporting and systems, in order to ensure we prioritize efforts that are impactful to our \nbusiness and stakeholders. We have begun to incorporate certain climate-related disclosures and risk factors in our \nexisting disclosures to this point.  We will continue to monitor developments around this proposed rule, which once \nfinalized, is expected to allow for a multi-year phased transition to achieving compliance.\nIn October 2022, the SEC adopted final rules regarding the recovery of erroneously awarded incentive-based\nexecutive compensation. The rules direct US securities exchanges to establish standards to require listed\nissuers to develop and implement a written policy providing for the recovery of incentive-based compensation\nreceived by current and former executive officers in the event of a required accounting restatement when that\ncompensation was based on an erroneously reported financial reporting measure. The new rule and related \namendments include a number of new disclosure requirements, including requiring issuers to file their recovery policy \nas an exhibit to their annual reports and establishing new cover page disclosures on Forms 10-K indicating whether \nthe financial statements included in the filing reflect the correction of an error and whether the error correction \nrequired an incentive-based compensation recovery analysis. The exchanges must file proposed listing standards to \nimplement the SEC’s directive no later than February 26, 2023 (which is 90 days after the final rules were published in \nthe Federal Register), and those listing standards must be effective no later than November 28, 2023. We will be \nrequired to adopt a recovery policy no later than 60 days after the listing standards become effective.\n     In November 2022, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council proposed new rules that would require many \nfederal contractors to provide certain climate-related disclosures. The proposed rule has a stated intent of prompting\nsuppliers to take action on measuring and managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions via public\ntransparency. The proposal would require “major” federal contractors, as defined, to provide public disclosure of:\n• scope 1, scope 2, and relevant scope 3 GHG emissions;\n• climate-related financial risk factors based on the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\nframework; and\n• GHG reduction targets established in line with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Major contractors\nwithout existing targets would be required to establish them.\nSmaller contractors, defined as “significant,” would be required to provide disclosure of scope 1 and scope 2\nGHG emissions. “Major” contractors are those receiving more than $50 million in federal contracts, while\n“significant” contractors are those receiving from $7.5 to $50 million in federal contracts. These thresholds are\nbased on the size of contracts awarded and not on related revenue in any given year. There are also limited\nexceptions. Based on our business with the federal government, we are highly likely to be considered a \"significant\" or \n\"major\" federal contractor in a given year and would be subject to the requirements in this proposal, if passed.  We will \ncontinue to monitor developments around this proposed rule, which if finalized, is expected to allow for a multi-year \nphased transition to achieving compliance.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis Form 10-K contains certain non-GAAP measures that should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute \nfor the related GAAP measures.  Such non-GAAP measures include net sales and percent change in net sales, \nexcluding the impact of currency translation effects; EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin; Net \ndebt; Net leverage ratio; and Adjusted earnings per share (or Adjusted EPS).  Management believes that these non-\nGAAP measures provide additional useful information to investors regarding the Company’s operational performance. \nPresenting Net sales and change in Net sales, after currency effects are excluded, provides management and \ninvestors insight into underlying sales trends. Net sales, or percent changes in net sales, excluding currency rate \neffects, are calculated by converting amounts reported in local currencies into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of a \nprior period.  These amounts are then compared to the U.S. dollar amount as reported in the current period.\nEBITDA (calculated as net income excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization), Adjusted \nEBITDA, and Adjusted EPS are performance measures that relate to the Company’s continuing operations.  The \nCompany defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding costs or benefits that are not reflective of the Company’s \nongoing or expected future operational performance.  Such excluded costs or benefits do not consist of normal, \n43"

The market risk is the \npotential loss arising from adverse changes in these rates as discussed below.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe have manufacturing plants and sales transactions worldwide and therefore are subject to foreign currency \nrisk. This risk is composed of both potential losses from the translation of foreign currency financial statements and \nthe remeasurement of foreign currency transactions. To manage this risk, we periodically enter into forward exchange \ncontracts either to hedge the net assets of a foreign investment or to provide an economic hedge against future cash \nflows. The total net assets of non-U.S. operations and long-term intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional \ncurrencies subject to potential loss amount to approximately $683.3 million. The potential loss in fair value resulting \nfrom a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to $68.3 million. \nFurthermore, related to foreign currency transactions, we have exposure to various nonfunctional currency balances \ntotaling $194.1 million. This amount includes, on an absolute basis, exposures to assets and liabilities held in \ncurrencies other than our local entity’s functional currency. On a net basis, we had $161.2 million of foreign currency \nassets as of December 31, 2022. As currency rates change, these nonfunctional currency balances are revalued, and \nthe corresponding adjustment is recorded in the income statement. A hypothetical change of 10 percent in currency \nrates could result in an adjustment to the income statement of approximately $16.1 million. Actual results may differ.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate fluctuations with respect to our variable rate debt, depending on general \neconomic conditions.\nOn December 31, 2022, we had the following variable rate debt:\n(in thousands, except interest rates)\nLong-term debt\nCredit agreement with borrowings outstanding, net of fixed rate portion, at an end of \nperiod interest rate of 5.88% in 2022, due in 2024\n$89,000\nTotal\n$89,000\nAssuming borrowings were outstanding for an entire year, an increase of one percentage point in weighted \naverage interest rates would increase interest expense by $0.9 million. To manage interest rate risk, we may \nperiodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the interest rates on variable rate debt to a \nspecific rate for a period of time. (See Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, included under Item 8 of this \nForm 10-K).\n49"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial \nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for \neach of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted \naccounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria \nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations \nof the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the \neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to \nexpress an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm \nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the \nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and \nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of \nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing \nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the \namounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting \nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the \nconsolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated \nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) \nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our \nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter \nin any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating \nthe critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or \ndisclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of estimated total contract costs at completion for Albany Engineered Composites revenue  \n \n \nrecognition for certain firm-fixed-price contracts\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, a portion of the Albany Engineered  \nComposites (AEC) segment revenue is earned under short duration, firm-fixed-price orders that are placed under \ndefinitive agreements, with revenue recognized over time as costs are incurred. Under the cost-to-cost measure \nof progress, the extent of progress toward completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to \nthe total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded proportionally as \ncosts are incurred.\n51"

We read relevant agreements, including amendments, and inquired of financial and \noperational personnel of the Company to identify factors that should be considered within the cost to complete \nestimates.

Our responsibility is to express an \nopinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an \nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and \ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit \nalso included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that \nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding \nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance \nwith generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those \npolicies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly \nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that \ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally \naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in \naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance \nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that \ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \ndeteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nAlbany, New York\nFebruary 24, 2023 \n53"

      "text": "1. Accounting Policies\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Albany International Corp. and its subsidiaries (the \nCompany, Albany, we, us, or our) after elimination of intercompany transactions. \nA subsidiary within our Machine Clothing segment has held a 50 percent interest as partner in a joint venture \n(“JV”) that supplies paper machine clothing products to local papermakers in Russia. Our consolidated financial \nstatements include our original investment in the entity, plus our share of undistributed earnings or losses, in the \naccount “Other Assets.”  In March 2022, we made the decision to cease doing business in Russia, including giving \nnotice to our JV partner of our intent to exit the venture, resulting in our full write-off of the net book value of our \ninvestment. \nThe Company owns 90 percent of the common equity of Albany Safran Composites, LLC (ASC) which is \nreported within the Albany Engineered Composites (AEC) segment.  Additional information regarding that entity is \nincluded in Note 10.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally \naccepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the \nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the \nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. \nEstimates are used in the accounting for, among others, revenue recognition, contract profitability, allowances for \ndoubtful accounts, rebates and sales allowances, inventory allowances, financial instruments, including derivatives, \npension and other postretirement benefits, goodwill and intangible assets, contingencies, income taxes, and other \naccruals. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions, which are believed to \nbe reasonable under the circumstances.  Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results \nreported in future periods may differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and \nthe effects of any revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to \nbe necessary.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn our Machine Clothing (MC) business segment, we recognize revenue at the point in time when we satisfy our \nperformance obligations related to the manufacture and delivery of products. In our Albany Engineered Composites \n(AEC) business segment, revenue from most long-term contracts is recognized over time using an input method as \nthe measure of progress. The classification of revenue in excess of progress billings on long-term contracts is \nincluded in Contract assets, net, which are rights to consideration that are conditional on something other than the \npassage of time, such as completion of remaining performance obligations. \nWe are required to limit our estimate of contract values to the period of the legally enforceable contract. While \ncertain contracts are expected to be profitable over the course of the program life when including expected renewals, \nour estimate of contract revenues and costs is limited to the estimated value of enforceable rights and obligations, \nexcluding anticipated renewals. This contract period may result in a loss contract provision at contract inception. \nExpected losses on projects include losses on contract options that are probable of exercise, excluding profitable \noptions that often follow. For contracts with anticipated losses, a provision for the entire amount of the estimated \nremaining loss is charged against income in the period in which the loss becomes known.

Cost of goods sold also includes provisions for loss contracts and charges for the \nwrite-off of inventories that result from an exit activity.\nSelling, General, Administrative, Technical, and Research Expenses\nSelling, general, administrative, and technical expenses are primarily comprised of wages, incentive \ncompensation, benefits, travel, professional fees, revaluation of trade foreign currency balances, and other costs, and \nare expensed as incurred. Selling expense includes costs related to contract acquisition and provisions for expected \ncredit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. Research expenses are charged to operations as \nincurred and consist primarily of compensation, supplies, and professional fees incurred in connection with intellectual \nproperty. Total company research expense was $31.4 million in 2022, $29.6 million in 2021, and $25.8 million in 2020.\nThe Albany Engineered Composites segment participates in both company-sponsored, and customer-funded \nresearch and development. Some customer-funded research and development may be on a cost-sharing basis and \nconsidered to be a collaborative arrangement, in which case both parties are active participants and are exposed to \nthe risks and rewards dependent on the success of the activity. In such cases, amounts charged to the collaborating \nentity are credited against research and development expense. For customer-funded research and development in \nwhich we anticipate funding to exceed expenses, we include amounts charged to the customer in Net sales, while \nexpenses are included in Cost of goods sold.\nRestructuring Expense\nWe may incur expenses related to exiting a line of business or restructuring of our operations, which could \ninclude employee termination costs, costs to consolidate or close facilities, or costs to terminate contractual \nrelationships. Restructuring expenses may also include impairment of Property, plant and equipment, as described \nbelow under “Property, Plant and Equipment”. Employee termination costs include severance pay and social costs for \nperiods after employee service is completed. Termination costs related to an ongoing benefit arrangement are \nrecognized when the amount becomes probable and estimable. Termination costs related to a one-time benefit \narrangement are recognized at the communication date to employees. Costs related to contract termination, \nrelocation of employees, outplacement and the consolidation or the closure of facilities, are recognized when incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences and tax attributes by \napplying enacted statutory tax rates applicable for future years to differences between existing assets and liabilities for \nfinancial reporting and income tax return purposes. The effect of tax rate changes on deferred taxes is recognized in \nthe income tax provision in the period that includes the enactment date.

In connection with certain sales in \nAsia Pacific, the Company accepts a bank promissory note as customer payment. The notes may be presented for \npayment at maturity, which is less than one year.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC 326, Current Expected Credit Losses \n(CECL), using the effective date (or modified retrospective) approach for transition. Under this transition method, \nperiods prior to 2020 were not restated. The pre-tax cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard was an \nincrease in credit loss reserves of $1.8 million, primarily for Accounts receivable and Contract assets. Including tax \neffects, Retained earnings was reduced by $1.4 million as a result of transitioning to the CECL standard. \nThe overarching purpose of the CECL standard is to provide greater transparency and understanding of the \nCompany’s credit risk. This accounting update replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology under previous \nGAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of \nreasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Under this standard, the Company recognizes \nan allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, such as Accounts receivable, \nContract assets and Noncurrent receivables. The allowance is determined using a CECL model that is based on an \nhistorical average three-year loss rate and is measured by financial asset type on a collective (pool) basis when \nsimilar risk characteristics exist, at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. The estimate reflects the risk of \nloss due to credit default, even when the risk is remote, and considers available relevant information about the \ncollectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and \nsupportable expected future economic conditions.\nThe Company also has Noncurrent receivables in the AEC segment that represent revenue earned which have \nextended payment terms. The Noncurrent receivables are invoiced to the customer, with 2% interest, over a 10-year \nperiod that started in 2020. \nSee additional information, including accounting policies related to our adoption of the CECL update, set forth in \nNotes 2 and 11.\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nContract assets includes unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the cost-to-cost \nmethod of revenue recognition is utilized, and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. \nContract assets are transferred to Accounts receivable, net, when the entitlement to payment becomes unconditional. \nContract liabilities include advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Contract liabilities are \nincluded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nSee additional information, including accounting policies related to our adoption of the CECL update, set forth in \nNotes 11 and 12.\nInventories\nCosts included in inventories are raw materials, labor, supplies and allocable depreciation and overhead. Raw \nmaterials inventory is valued on an average cost basis. Other inventory cost elements are valued at cost, using the \nfirst-in, first-out method. The Company writes down the inventories for estimated obsolescence, and to lower of cost or \nnet realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Write-downs of inventories \nare charged to Cost of goods sold. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by \nthe Company, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Once established, the original cost of the inventory \nless the related write-down represents the new cost basis of such inventories.\nSee additional information set forth in Notes 2 and 13.\nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1.

A contract is, or contains a lease if the contract conveys \nthe right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether \na contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, we assess whether:\n•\nThe contract involves the use of an identified asset. This may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be \nphysically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset,\n•\nThe lessee has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the \nperiod of use, and\n•\nThe lessee has the right to direct the use of the asset, which is demonstrated when the lessee has decision-\nmaking rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used.\nJudgment is required in the determination of whether a contract contains a lease, the appropriate classification, \nallocation of consideration, and the determination of the discount rate for the lease. Key estimates and judgments \ninclude how the Company determines (1) the discount rate it uses to discount the unpaid lease payments to present \nvalue, (2) lease term and (3) lease payments.\nWe have certain lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. For most of these leases, we account \nfor the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component, in accordance with the practical expedient that \nis available for ongoing accounting. Additionally, for certain other leases, such as for vehicles, we apply a portfolio \napproach. Such new leases are classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and \nclassification of expense recognition in the income statement. Expenses related to operating leases are recognized on \na straight-line basis, while those determined to be finance leases are recognized following a front-loaded expense \nprofile, in which interest and amortization are presented separately in the income statement.\nOperating lease ROU assets are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, while finance \nlease ROU assets are included in Property, plant, and equipment, net. Lease liabilities for both operating and finance \nleases are included in Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSee additional information set forth in Note 20.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, or if acquired as part of a business combination, at fair \nvalue. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for \nfinancial reporting purposes. In some cases, accelerated methods are used for income tax purposes. Significant \nadditions or improvements extending assets’ useful lives are capitalized; normal maintenance and repair costs are \nexpensed as incurred. The cost of fully depreciated assets remaining in use is included in the respective asset and \naccumulated depreciation accounts.

      "text": "Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Assets\nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at \ntheir estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair \nvalue of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. Intangible assets \nfrom acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer relationships, \ncustomer contracts, technology, intellectual property and other intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets with \nindefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually. \nWe perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the second quarter or more frequently \nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events \nor changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the \nbusiness climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, \nreorganizations of our business, or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. \nOur goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which \nis our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for \nimpairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining \nbusiness for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the \noperating results.\n       We may use qualitative or quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. When we use the \nqualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to \ndetermine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely \nthan not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. \nOtherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. To perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair \nvalue of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying \nvalue, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, \nexceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. \nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including \nrevenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and future market conditions, among others. To determine \nfair value, we utilize two market-based approaches and an income approach. Under the market-based approaches, \nwe utilize information regarding the Company, as well as publicly available industry information, to determine earnings \nmultiples. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each \nreporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent \nrisk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, management applied the qualitative assessment approach in performing its \nannual evaluation of goodwill for the Company's Machine Clothing reporting unit and two AEC reporting units and \nconcluded that each reporting unit’s fair value continued to exceed its carrying value. In addition, there were no \namounts at risk due to the estimated excess between the fair and carrying values. Accordingly, no impairment charges \nwere recorded. \nImpairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as \nthose described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the \nrelative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair \nvalue of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. See \nadditional information set forth in Note 18.\nFor some AEC contracts, we perform pre-production or nonrecurring engineering services. These costs are \nnormally considered a fulfillment activity, rather than a performance obligation. Fulfillment activities that create \nresources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future, and are expected to be recovered, are \ncapitalized to Other assets, which is classified as a noncurrent asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The \ncapitalized costs are amortized into Cost of goods sold over the period over which the asset is expected to contribute \nto future cash flows, which includes anticipated renewal periods.\nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1.

See additional information set forth in Note 18.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have incentive compensation plans that authorize the issuance of stock-based awards for key employees, \nwhich are designed to reward short and long-term contributions and provide incentives for recipients to remain with \nthe Company.  We issue stock-based awards in the form of restricted stock units and performance stock units that \ngenerally vest between one and five years from the grant date and can be settled in cash or shares.  Expenses \nassociated with these awards are recognized over each respective vesting period.  Liability based awards are settled \nin cash, while equity based awards are settled in stock.  See additional information for stock-based compensation \nplans in Note 22.\n  Unexercised options generally terminate twenty years after the date of grant for all plans, and must be \nexercised within ten years of retirement. We recognized no stock option expense during 2022, 2021, or 2020 and \nthere are currently no remaining unvested options for which stock-option compensation costs will be recognized in \nfuture periods. No stock options have been granted since 2002.\nDerivatives\nWe use derivatives from time to time to reduce potentially large adverse effects from changes in currency \nexchange rates and interest rates. We monitor our exposure to these risks and evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the risk \nof potentially large adverse effects versus the costs associated with hedging such risks.\nWe may use interest rate swaps in the management of interest rate exposures and foreign currency derivatives \nin the management of foreign currency exposure related to assets and liabilities (including net investments in \nsubsidiaries located outside the U.S.) denominated in foreign currencies. When we enter into a derivative contract, we \nmake a determination whether the transaction is deemed to be a hedge for accounting purposes. For those contracts \ndeemed to be a hedge, we formally document the relationship between the derivative instrument and the risk being \nhedged. In this documentation, we specifically identify the asset, liability, forecasted transaction, cash flow, or net \ninvestment that has been designated as the hedged item, and evaluate whether the derivative instrument is expected \nto reduce the risks associated with the hedged item. To the extent these criteria are not met, we do not use hedge \naccounting for the derivative.\nAll derivative contracts are recorded at fair value, as a net asset or a net liability. Changes in the fair value of the \nhedge are recorded, net of tax, in other comprehensive income. For transactions that are designated as hedges, we \nperform an evaluation of the effectiveness of the hedge. We measure the effectiveness of hedging relationships both \nat inception and on an ongoing basis.  The related gains and losses of derivative instruments, including those \ndesignated in hedge accounting relationships, are included as operating activities in the consolidated statements of \ncash flows.\nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in subsidiaries located outside the \nUnited States, changes in the fair value of derivatives are reported in other comprehensive income as part of \nTranslation adjustments.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nAs described in Note 4, we have pension and postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees. \nOur Pension Plus Plan in the United States was settled during the third quarter of 2022.This was a qualified defined \nbenefit pension plan that was previously terminated in the third quarter of 2021, and prior to that point was closed to \nnew participants and had frozen accrual of benefits. \nWe have liabilities for postretirement benefits in the U.S. and Canada. A majority of the liability relates to the U.S. \nplan. Effective January 2005, our postretirement benefit plan in the U.S. was closed to new participants, except for \ncertain life insurance benefits. In September 2008, we changed the cost sharing arrangement under this program \nsuch that increases in health care costs are the responsibility of plan participants and, in August 2013, we reduced the \nlife insurance benefit for retirees and eliminated that benefit for active employees.\nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1.

      "text": "The pension plans are generally trusteed or insured, and accrued amounts are funded as required in accordance \nwith governing laws and regulations. The annual expense and liabilities recognized for defined benefit pension plans \nand postretirement benefit plans are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key \nassumptions, including discount rates and expected return on plan assets, which are updated on an annual basis. We \nconsider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. Discount rate \nassumptions are based on the population of plan participants and a mixture of high-quality fixed-income investments \nwith durations that match expected future payments. The assumption for expected return on plan assets is based on \nhistorical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets.\nGovernment Grants\nThe Company recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that we will comply with \nthe conditions attached to them and the grants will be received. Government grants are recognized in the \nConsolidated Statements of Income on a systematic basis over the periods in which we recognize as expenses the \nrelated costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. A government grant that becomes receivable as \ncompensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support with no \nfuture related costs is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income of the period in which it becomes \nreceivable. \nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company was awarded an Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program \n(\"AMJP\") grant of $5.8 million, under the American Rescue Plan of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The AMJP \ngrant is an income related grant, the purpose of which is to provide payroll assistance to eligible U.S. aircraft \nmanufacturing/repair businesses who were impacted due to the COVID-19 downturn during 2020.  In order to receive \nthe grant, AEC was required to make several commitments, including a commitment that the company would not \ninvoluntarily furlough or lay-off employees within this segment during the period the grant was intended to cover.  All \nconditions were met and the Company recognized $5.8 million in its Consolidated Statements of Income for the year \nended December 31, 2021. The Company received $2.9 million in cash during 2021 and the remainder during 2022 \nand reflected cash received as an operating activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows over the \nperiods cash was received.  \nSubsequent Events\nWe review for subsequent events up through the date when our consolidated financial statements are available \nfor issuance.\n2. Revenue Recognition\nWe account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are \nidentified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is \nprobable. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer, and excludes \nany amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by \ntransferring control over a product or service, or a series of distinct goods or services, to the customer which occurs \neither at a point in time, or over time, depending on the performance obligation in the contract. A performance \nobligation is a promise in the contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account. \n“Control” refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the product. \nA contract’s transaction price is allocated to each material distinct performance obligation and is recognized as \nrevenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.\nIn our MC segment, our primary performance obligation in most contracts is to provide solution-based, custom-\ndesigned fabrics and belts to the customer. We satisfy this performance obligation upon transferring control of the \nproduct to the customer at a specific point in time. Contracts with customers in the MC segment have various terms \nthat can affect the point in time when revenue is recognized. Generally, the customer obtains control when the product \nhas been received at the location specified by the customer, at which time the only remaining obligations under the \nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1.

      "text": "contract may be fulfillment costs, in the form of shipping and handling, which are accrued when control of the product \nis transferred.\nIn the MC segment, contracts with certain customers may also obligate us to provide various product-related \nservices at no additional cost to the customer. When this obligation is material in the context of the contract with the \ncustomer, we recognize a separate performance obligation and allocate revenue to those services on a relative \nestimated standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price for these services is determined based upon an \nanalysis of the services offered and an assessment of the price we might charge for such services as a separate \noffering. As we typically provide such services on a stand-ready basis, we recognize this revenue over time. Revenue \nallocated to such service performance obligations is the only MC revenue that is recognized over time.\nIn our AEC segment, we primarily enter into contracts to manufacture and deliver highly engineered advanced \ncomposite products to our customers. A significant portion of AEC revenue is earned under short duration, firm-fixed-\nprice orders that are placed under a master agreement containing general terms and conditions applicable to all \norders placed under the master agreement. To determine the proper revenue recognition method, we evaluate \nwhether two or more orders or contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract, and whether \nthe combined or single contract contains single or multiple performance obligations. This evaluation requires \nsignificant judgment, and the decision to combine a group of contracts, or to allocate revenue from the combined or \nsingle contract among multiple performance obligations, could have a significant impact on the amount of revenue \nand profit recorded in a given period. For most AEC contracts, the nature of our promise (or our performance \nobligation) to the customer is to provide a significant service of integrating a complex set of tasks and components \ninto a single project or capability, which will often result in the delivery of multiple highly interdependent and \ninterrelated units.\nAt the inception of a contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration we expect to \nreceive for the products or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may \nvary, we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the \nextent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of \na significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to \nmitigate this risk.  \nWe estimate the transaction price based on our current rights, and do not contemplate future modifications \n(including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Many AEC contracts are \nsubsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change \nexisting enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to \naccount for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, we are able \nto conclude that such modifications are not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration of the \nobligations, and the interrelated nature of tasks, provided for in the modification and the existing contract. Therefore, \nsuch modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract, and we accumulate the values of \nsuch modifications in our estimates of contract value.\nRevenue is recognized over time for a large portion of our contracts in AEC as most of our contracts have \nprovisions that are deemed to transfer control to the customer over time. Revenue is recognized based on the extent \nof progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress \ntoward completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We \ngenerally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of assets to \nthe customer which occurs as we incur costs to produce the contract deliverables. Under the cost-to-cost measure of \nprogress, the extent of progress toward completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the \ntotal estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenue, including profit, is recorded proportionally \nas costs are incurred. Accounting for long-term contracts requires significant judgment and estimation, which could be \nconsiderably different if the underlying circumstances were to change. When any adjustments of estimated contract \nrevenue or costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are included in revenues or earnings in the period in \nwhich the change occurs.\nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2.

Contracts in the MC segment are generally for periods of less than a year. Most contracts \nin the AEC segment are short duration firm-fixed-price orders representing performance obligations with an original \nmaturity of less than one year. Remaining performance obligations on contracts that had an original duration of \ngreater than one year totaled $553 million as of December 31, 2022, $278 million as of December 31, 2021, and \n$86 million as of December 31, 2020, and related primarily to firm contracts in the AEC segment.

Corporate expenses include \nwages and benefits for corporate headquarters personnel, costs related to information systems development and \nsupport, and professional fees related to legal, audit, and other activities. These costs are not allocated to the \nreportable segments because the decision-making for these functions lies outside of the segments.\nMachine Clothing:\nThe Machine Clothing (“MC”) segment supplies permeable and impermeable belts used in the manufacture of \npaper, paperboard, tissue and towel, pulp, nonwovens, fiber cement and several other industrial applications. We sell \nour MC products directly to customer end-users in countries across the globe. Our products, manufacturing \nprocesses, and distribution channels for MC are substantially the same in each region of the world in which we \noperate.\nWe design, manufacture, and market paper machine clothing (used in the manufacturing of paper, paperboard, \ntissue and towel) for each section of the paper machine and for every grade of paper. Paper machine clothing \nproducts are customized, consumable products of technologically sophisticated design that utilize polymeric materials \nin a complex structure.\nAlbany Engineered Composites:\nThe Albany Engineered Composites (“AEC”) segment, provides highly engineered, advanced composite \nstructures to customers in the commercial and defense aerospace industries. The segment includes Albany Safran \nComposites, LLC (“ASC”), in which our customer, SAFRAN Group, owns a 10 percent noncontrolling interest, AEC, \nthrough ASC, is the exclusive supplier to the LEAP program of advanced composite fan blades and fan cases under a \nlong-term supply contract. \nThe LEAP engine is used on the Airbus A320neo, Boeing 737 MAX, and COMAC 919 aircrafts. AEC’s largest \naerospace customer is SAFRAN and sales to SAFRAN (consisting primarily of fan blades and cases for CFM’s LEAP \nengine) accounted for approximately 16 percent of the Company’s consolidated Net sales in 2022. In 2022, SAFRAN \nleased manufacturing space from AEC for the GE9X program. Rent paid by SAFRAN under this lease amounted to \n$0.9 million in both 2022 and 2021. AEC Net sales to SAFRAN were $169.3 million in 2022, $111.6 million in 2021, \nand $99.0 million in 2020. The total of Accounts receivable, Contract assets and Noncurrent receivable due from \nSAFRAN amounted to $80.8 million and $79.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  \nOther significant programs by AEC include the Sikorsky CH-53K, F-35, JASSM, and Boeing 787 programs. AEC \nalso supplies vacuum waste tanks for the Boeing 7-Series programs, and specialty components for the Rolls Royce \nlift fan on the F-35.

      "text": "4. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nPension Plans\nThe Company has defined benefit pension plans covering certain U.S. and non-U.S. employees. \nIn the third quarter of 2022, we took actions to settle pension plan liabilities related to the U.S. Pension Plus Plan, \nleading to charges totaling $49.1 million. This led to a reduction of unfunded pension liabilities of $6.2 million. This \nwas a qualified defined benefit pension plan that was previously terminated in the third quarter of 2021, and prior to \nthat point was closed to new participants and had frozen accrual of benefits. \nThe December 31, 2022 benefit obligations for remaining U.S. pension and postretirement plans were calculated \nusing the Pri-2012 mortality table with MP-2021 generational projection. For U.S. pension funding purposes, the \nCompany uses the plan’s IRS-basis current liability as its funding target, which is determined based on mandated \nassumptions.  Benefit accruals under the U.S. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), which is an \nunfunded plan, have been frozen. \nThe eligibility, benefit formulas, and contribution requirements for plans outside of the U.S. vary by location.\nBenefits under the Company's pension plan in Switzerland utilize a cash balance interest crediting rate for \ndetermination of plan liabilities.  As of December 31, 2022, the benefit obligation for that plan amounted to \n$2.9 million.\nIn addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides various medical, dental, and life insurance \nbenefits for certain retired United States employees. U.S. employees hired prior to 2005 may become eligible for \nthese benefits if they reach normal retirement age while working for the Company. Benefits provided under this plan \nare subject to change. Retirees share in the cost of these benefits. Any new employees hired after January 2005 who \nwish to be covered under this plan will be responsible for the full cost of such benefits. In September 2008, we \nchanged the cost-sharing arrangement under this program such that increases in health care costs are the \nresponsibility of plan participants. In August 2013, we reduced the life insurance benefit for retirees and eliminated the \nbenefit for active employees. The Company also provides certain postretirement life insurance benefits to retired \nemployees in Canada. As of December 31, 2022, the accrued postretirement liability was $34.8 million in the U.S. and \n$0.8 million in Canada. The Company accrues the cost of providing postretirement benefits during the active service \nperiod of the employees. The Company currently funds the plans as claims are paid.\nAccounting guidance requires the recognition of the funded status of each defined benefit and other \npostretirement benefit plan. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is \nrecognized as a liability. Company pension plan data for U.S. and non-U.S. plans has been combined for both 2022 \nand 2021, except where indicated below.\nThe Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs and benefit obligations are based on actuarial \nvaluations that are affected by many assumptions, the most significant of which are the assumed discount rate, \nexpected rate of return on pension plan assets, and mortality. Each of the assumptions is reviewed and updated \nannually, as appropriate. The assumed rates of return for pension plan assets are determined for each major asset \ncategory based on historical rates of return for assets in that category and expectations of future rates of return \nbased, in part, on simulated future capital market performance. The assumed discount rate is based on yields from a \nportfolio of currently available high-quality fixed-income investments with durations matching the expected future \npayments, based on the demographics of the plan participants and the plan provisions.\nGains and losses arise from changes in the assumptions used to measure the benefit obligations, and \nexperience different from what had been assumed, including asset returns different than what had been expected. \nThe Company amortizes gains and losses in excess of a “corridor” over the average future service of the plan’s \ncurrent participants. The corridor is defined as 10 percent of the greater of the plan’s projected benefit obligation or \nmarket-related value of plan assets. The market-related value of plan assets is also used to determine the expected \nreturn on plan assets component of net periodic cost. The Company’s market-related value for its U.S. plan is \nmeasured by first determining the absolute difference between the actual and the expected return on the plan assets. \nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n72"

      "text": "Investment Strategy\nOur investment strategy for pension assets differs for the various countries in which we have defined benefit \npension plans. Some of our defined benefit plans do not require funded trusts and, in those arrangements, the \nCompany funds the plans on a “pay as you go” basis. The largest of the funded defined benefit plans is in the United \nKingdom.\nUnited States plan:\nSince the settlement of the U.S. Pension Plus Plan during the third quarter of 2022, there have been no \ninvestments made to the remaining plans in the United States.  \nNon-United States plans:\nFor the countries in which the Company has funded pension trusts, the investment strategy may also be liability \ndriven or, in other cases, to achieve a competitive, total investment return, achieving diversification between and \nwithin asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on \nspecific risks and investment opportunities identified. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target \nallocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully \nimplement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions.\n        Fair-Value Measurements\nThe following tables present plan assets as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, using the fair-value hierarchy, \nwhich has three levels based on the reliability of inputs used, as described in Note 18. Certain investments that are \nmeasured at fair value using net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient are not required to be categorized in the \nfair value hierarchy table. The total fair value of these investments is included in the table below to permit \nreconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to amounts presented in the funded status table above.

The residual tax effects were \ncreated as a result of the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities originally established in other \ncomprehensive income in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% \nto 21% as of December 31, 2017. \nThe Company's subsidiary in Mexico has an intercompany loan payable in U.S. dollars. As a result of the weaker \nMexican peso, the Company recorded a revaluation loss in 2020 which is not deductible under Mexican tax law, \nleading to a $3.8 million discrete tax charge.\nThe Company has operations which constitute a taxable presence in 18 countries outside of the United States. \nThe Company is subject to audit in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Our open tax years for major \njurisdictions generally range from 2014-2022. \nDuring the periods reported, income outside of the U.S. was heavily concentrated within Brazil (34% tax rate), \nChina (25% tax rate), and Mexico (30% tax rate). The foreign rate differential of these jurisdictions was partially offset \nby Switzerland (7.8% tax rate). As a result, the foreign income tax rate differential was primarily attributable to these \ntax rate differences.\nOn August 16th, 2022, The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted, including various provisions which \nbecome effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022.  Included within the IRA were provisions for a \nnewly enacted Stock Repurchase Excise Tax, Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, among others.

Under the terms of the transaction agreements, ASC will be the \nexclusive supplier to SAFRAN of advanced 3D-woven composite parts for use in aircraft and rocket engines, thrust \nreversers and nacelles, and aircraft landing and braking systems (the “SAFRAN Applications”). AEC may develop and \nsupply parts other than advanced 3D-woven composite parts for all aerospace applications, as well as advanced 3D-\nwoven composite parts for any aerospace applications that are not SAFRAN Applications (such as airframe \napplications) and any non-aerospace applications.\nThe agreement provides SAFRAN an option to purchase Albany’s remaining 90 percent interest upon the \noccurrence of certain bankruptcy or performance default events, or if Albany’s Engineered Composites business is \nsold to a direct competitor of SAFRAN. The purchase price is based initially on the same valuation of ASC used to \ndetermine SAFRAN’s 10 percent equity interest, and increases over time as LEAP production increases.\nIn accordance with the operating agreement, Albany received a $28 million preferred holding in ASC which \nincludes a preferred return based on the Company’s revolving credit agreement.

This accounting update replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology under \nprevious GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range \nof reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Under this standard, the Company \nrecognizes an allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, such as Accounts \nreceivable, Contract assets and Noncurrent receivables. The allowance is determined using a CECL model that is \nbased on an historical average three-year loss rate and is measured by financial asset type on a collective (pool) \nbasis when similar risk characteristics exist, at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. The estimate \nreflects the risk of loss due to credit default, even when the risk is remote, and considers available relevant \ninformation about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and \nreasonable and supportable expected future economic conditions.\nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n10.

      "text": "While an expected credit loss allowance is recorded at the same time the financial asset is recorded, the \nCompany monitors financial assets for credit impairment events to assess whether there has been a significant \nincrease in credit risk since initial recognition, and considers both quantitative and qualitative information. The risk of \nloss due to credit default increases when one or more events occur that can have a detrimental impact on estimated \nfuture cash flows of that financial asset. Evidence that a financial asset is subject to greater credit risk includes \nobservable data about significant financial difficulty of the customer, a breach of contract, such as a default or past \ndue event, or it becomes probable that the customer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, among \nother factors. It may not be possible to identify a single discrete event, but rather, the combined effect of several \nevents that may cause an increase in risk of loss.\nThe probability of default is driven by the relative financial health of our customer base and that of the industries \nin which we operate, as well as the broader macro-economic environment. A changing economic environment or \nforecasted economic scenario can lead to a different probability of default and can suggest that credit risk has \nchanged.\n At each reporting period, the Company will recognize the amount of change in current expected credit losses as \nan allowance gain or loss in Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \nFinancial assets are written-off when the Company has no reasonable expectation of recovering the financial asset, \neither in its entirety, or a portion thereof. This is the case when the Company determines that the customer does not \nhave assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-\noff.\nThe following tables present the (increases)/decreases in the allowance for credit losses for Accounts receivable:\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31,\n2021\n(Charge)/ \nbenefit\nCurrency\ntranslation\nOther\nDecember 31,\n2022\nSpecific customer reserves\n$ \n(1,392) $ \n(1,331) $ \n50 $ \n597 $ \n(2,076) \nIncremental expected credit \nlosses\n \n(953)  \n(93)  \n25  \n—  \n(1,021) \nAccounts receivable expected \ncredit losses\n$ \n(2,345) $ \n(1,424) $ \n75 $ \n597 $ \n(3,097) \n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2020\n(Charge)/ \nbenefit\nCurrency\ntranslation\nOther\nDecember 31, \n2021\nSpecific customer reserves\n$ \n(1,742) $ \n(187) $ \n116 $ \n421 $ \n(1,392) \nIncremental expected credit \nlosses\n \n(2,065)  \n1,074  \n38  \n—  \n(953) \nAccounts receivable expected \ncredit losses\n$ \n(3,807) $ \n887 $ \n154 $ \n421 $ \n(2,345) \nThe following tables present the (increases)/decreases in the allowance for credit losses for Noncurrent \nreceivables:\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31,\n2021\n(Charge)/ \nbenefit\nCurrency\ntranslation\nOther\nDecember 31,\n2022\nNoncurrent receivables expected \ncredit losses\n$ \n(200) $ \n62 $ \n(2) $ \n— $ \n(140) \nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n11.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable\nintangible assets acquired in each business combination. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives\nare not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level, using either a qualitative\nor quantitative approach. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit,\nincluding goodwill, exceeds its fair value.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, management applied the qualitative assessment approach in performing its \nannual evaluation of goodwill for the Company's Machine Clothing reporting unit and two AEC reporting units and\nconcluded that each reporting unit’s fair value continued to exceed its carrying value. In addition, there were no\namounts at risk due to the estimated excess between the fair and carrying values. Accordingly, no impairment charges\nwere recorded.\n       We are continuing to amortize certain patents, trademarks and names, customer contracts, relationships and\ntechnology assets that have finite lives.The changes in intangible assets and goodwill from December 31, 2020 to \nDecember 31, 2022, were as follows:\nFinite-Lived intangible \nassets:\nAEC Trademarks and \ntrade names\n6-15\n$ \n45 $ \n(11) $ \n— $ \n34 \nAEC Technology\n10-15\n \n4,712  \n(554)  \n(274)  \n3,884 \nAEC Intellectual property\n15\n \n1,077  \n(83)  \n—  \n994 \nAEC Customer contracts\n6\n \n720  \n(720)  \n—  \n— \nAEC Customer \nrelationships\n8-15\n \n32,527  \n(3,474)  \n(154)  \n28,899 \nTotal Finite-Lived intangible \nassets, net\n$ \n39,081 $ \n(4,842) $ \n(428) $ \n33,811 \nIndefinite-Lived intangible \nassets:\nMC Goodwill\n$ \n68,329 $ \n— $ \n(2,888) $ \n65,441 \nAEC Goodwill\n \n113,795  \n—  \n(1,019)  \n112,776 \nTotal Indefinite-Lived \nintangible assets\n$ \n182,124 $ \n— $ \n(3,907) $ \n178,217 \n(in thousands, except for years)\nAmortization \nlife in years\nBalance at \nDecember 31, \n2021\nAmortization\nCurrency \nTranslation\nBalance at \nDecember 31, \n2022\nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n91"

Cash payments of interest amounted to $16.0 million in \n2022, $14.9 million in 2021 and $15.1 million in 2020.\nOn October 27, 2020, we entered into a $700 million unsecured Four-Year Revolving Credit Facility Agreement \n(the “Credit Agreement”) which amended and restated the prior amended and restated $685 million Five-Year \nRevolving Credit Facility  Agreement, which we had entered into on November 7, 2017 (the “Prior Agreement”). Under \nthe Credit Agreement, $439 million of borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2022. The applicable interest \nrate for borrowings was LIBOR plus a spread, based on our leverage ratio at the time of borrowing. At the time of the \nlast borrowing on December 30, 2022, the spread was 1.625%. The spread was based on a pricing grid, which \nranged from 1.500% to 2.000%, based on our leverage ratio. Based on our maximum leverage ratio and our \nConsolidated EBITDA, and without modification to any other credit agreements, as of December 31, 2022, we would \nhave been able to borrow an additional $261 million under the Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary terms, as well as affirmative covenants, negative covenants and \nevents of default that are comparable to those in the Prior Agreement. The Borrowings are guaranteed by certain of \nthe Company’s subsidiaries.\nOur ability to borrow additional amounts under the Credit Agreement is conditional upon the absence of any \ndefaults, as well as the absence of any material adverse change (as defined in the Credit Agreement).\nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n93"

      "text": "On June 14, 2021, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for the period October 17, 2022 through \nOctober 27, 2024. These transactions have the effect of fixing the LIBOR portion of the effective interest rate (before \naddition of the spread) on $350 million of indebtedness drawn under the Credit Agreement at the rate of 0.838% \nduring the period. Under the terms of those transactions, we pay the fixed rate of 0.838% and the counterparties pay \na floating rate based on the one-month LIBOR rate at each monthly calculation date. The monthly calculation date is \nthe 16th of each month, and on December 16, 2022, one month LIBOR  was 4.33%. On December 16, 2022, the all-\nin-rate on the $350 million of debt was 2.463%.\nOn October 17, 2022 our interest rate swap agreements that were in effect from December 18, 2017 terminated. \nThese transactions had the effect of fixing the LIBOR portion of the effective interest rate (before addition of the \nspread) on $350 million of indebtedness drawn under the Credit Agreement at the rate of 2.11% during the period. \nUnder the terms of those transactions, we paid the fixed rate of 2.11% and the counterparties paid a floating rate \nbased on the one-month LIBOR rate at each monthly calculation date. The all-in-rate on the $350 million of debt \nwas 3.735%.\nThese interest rate swaps are accounted for as a hedge of future cash flows, as further described in Note 18. No \ncash collateral was received or pledged in relation to the swap agreements.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, we are currently required to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined in the agreement) \nof not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 and minimum interest coverage (as defined) of 3.00 to 1.00.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our leverage ratio was 1.25 and our interest coverage ratio was 15.17. We may \npurchase our Common Stock or pay dividends to the extent our leverage ratio remains at or below 3.50, and may \nmake acquisitions with cash provided our leverage ratio does not exceed the limits noted above.\nIndebtedness under the Credit Agreement is ranked equally in right of payment to all unsecured senior debt. We \nwere in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2022.\nCurrently, our Credit Agreement and certain of our derivative instruments reference one-month USD LIBOR-\nbased rates, which are set to discontinue after June 30, 2023.  Regulators in the U.S. and other jurisdictions have \nbeen working to replace these rates with alternative reference interest rates that are supported by transactions in \nliquid and observable markets, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for USD LIBOR.  Our Credit \nAgreement contains provisions specifying alternative interest rate calculations to be employed when LIBOR ceases to \nbe available as a benchmark and we have adhered to the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which will govern our \nderivatives upon the final cessation of USD LIBOR.  Amendments to the Reference Rate Reform standard have \nhelped limit the accounting impact from contract modifications, including hedging relationships, due to the transition \nfrom LIBOR to alternative reference rates that are completed by December 31, 2024. We adopted certain provisions \nof this standard during 2021.  While we currently do not expect a significant impact to our operating results, financial \nposition or cash flows from the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates, we will continue to \nmonitor the impact of this transition until it is completed.\n18. Fair-Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an \nexit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between \nmarket participants at the measurement date. Accounting principles establish a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring \nfair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that \nthe most observable inputs be used when available. Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or \nliability, and include situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. We had no Level 3 \nfinancial assets or liabilities at December 31, 2022, or at December 31, 2021, other than certain pension assets (see \nNote 4).\nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n17.

Unrealized gains and losses on the swaps flow through the caption Derivative \nvaluation adjustment in the Shareholders’ equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

These instruments are measured using market foreign exchange prices and are \nrecorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Other assets and Accounts payable, as applicable. Changes in fair \nvalue of these instruments are recorded as gains or losses within Other (income)/expense, net.\nWhen exercised, the foreign currency instruments are net settled with the same financial institution that bought or \nsold them. For all positions, whether options or forward contracts, there is risk from the possible inability of the \nfinancial institution to meet the terms of the contracts and the risk of unfavorable changes in interest and currency \nrates, which may reduce the value of the instruments. We seek to mitigate risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of \ncounterparties and by monitoring the currency exchange and interest rate markets while reviewing the hedging risks \nand contracts to ensure compliance with our internal guidelines and policies.\nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n18.

Leases\nWe are generally the lessee in our lease transactions. Lessees are required to recognize a lease liability and a \nright of use (ROU) asset for leases with terms greater than 12 months, in accordance with the practical expedient that \nis available for ongoing accounting.\nROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an \nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized \non the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term, using the rate implicit \nin the lease. If that rate is not readily determinable, the rate is based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. \nThe operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease \nterms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Our ROU assets include the values associated with the \nadditional periods when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. We review the carrying value of ROU \nassets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not \nbe recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition.\nWe have entered into operating and finance leases for offices, manufacturing facilities, warehouses, vehicles, \nand certain equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 12 years, some of which include options \nto extend the leases for up to 10 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.\nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n18.

Commitments and Contingencies\nAsbestos Litigation\nAlbany International Corp. is a defendant in suits brought in various courts in the United States by plaintiffs who \nallege that they have suffered personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing paper machine clothing \nsynthetic dryer fabrics marketed during the period from 1967 to 1976 and used in certain paper mills.\nWe were defending 3,598 claims as of December 31, 2022.\nThe following table sets forth the number of claims filed, the number of claims settled, dismissed or otherwise \nresolved, and the aggregate settlement amount during the periods presented:\n2020\n3,708\n152\n59\n3,615\n$57\n2021\n3,615\n32\n26\n3,609\n93\n2022\n3,609\n43\n32\n3,598\n$125\nYear ended December 31,\nOpening \nNumber of \nClaims\nClaims \nDismissed, \nSettled, or\nResolved\nNew Claims\nClosing \nNumber of \nClaims\nAmounts Paid \n(thousands) to\nSettle or \nResolve\nWe anticipate that additional claims will be filed against the Company and related companies in the future, but \nare unable to predict the number and timing of such future claims. Due to the fact that information sufficient to \nmeaningfully estimate a range of possible loss of a particular claim is typically not available until late in the discovery \nprocess, we do not believe a meaningful estimate can be made regarding the range of possible loss with respect to \npending or future claims and therefore are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss in excess of \namounts already accrued for pending or future claims.\nWhile we believe we have meritorious defenses to these claims, we have settled certain claims for amounts we \nconsider reasonable given the facts and circumstances of each case. Our insurance carrier has defended each case \nand funded settlements under a standard reservation of rights. As of December 31, 2022 we had resolved, by means \nof settlement or dismissal, 38,022 claims. The total cost of resolving all claims was $10.6 million. Of this amount, \nalmost 100% was paid by our insurance carrier, who has confirmed that we have approximately $140 million of \nremaining coverage under primary and excess policies that should be available with respect to current and future \nasbestos claims.\nWe currently do not anticipate, based on currently available information, that the ultimate resolution of the \naforementioned proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations, or cash \nflows of the Company. Although we cannot predict the number and timing of future claims, based on the foregoing \nfactors, the trends in claims filed against us, and available insurance, we also do not currently anticipate that potential \nfuture claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n22.  Incentive Plans\nWe have incentive compensation plans that authorize the issuance of stock-based awards for key employees, \nwhich are designed to reward short and long-term contributions and provide incentives for recipients to remain with \nthe Company.  We issue stock-based awards in the form of restricted stock units and performance stock units that \ngenerally vest between one and five years from the grant date and can be settled in cash or shares.  Expenses \nassociated with these awards are recognized over each respective vesting period.  Liability based awards are settled \nin cash, while equity based awards are settled in stock. \nThe Albany International 2017 Incentive Plan provides key members of management with incentive \ncompensation based on achieving certain performance or service measures. Awards can be paid in cash, shares of \nClass A Common Stock, Options, or other stock-based or incentive compensation awards pursuant to the Plan. \nParticipants may elect to receive shares net of applicable income taxes. \nALBANY INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n100"

Each of these awards vests over three years from the grant date, and the \nextent of payout is dependent upon the achievement of certain performance metrics during the vesting period, as \ndefined by the Compensation Committee.  Payout is scheduled to occur no later than 90 days after the end of the \nvesting period.  If a participant terminates employment prior to the award becoming fully vested, the person may \nforfeit all or a portion of the incentive compensation award. The grant date share price is determined when the awards \nare approved each year and that price is used to measure the cost for the share-based portion of an award. Expense \nassociated with these awards is recognized over the vesting period. In connection with these awards, we recognized \nexpense of $3.9 million in 2022, $3.7 million in 2021 and $4.8 million in 2020. The net impact to earnings for the \nrespective years was $2.7 million, $2.6 million, and $3.4 million. Based on current estimates of achievement of certain \nperformance metrics, we anticipate recognizing $1.2 million of expense in 2022 and $0.3 million of expense in 2023 \nand 2024, respectively. \nBeginning in 2021, the executive management team also receives restricted stock units that vest annually on \nDecember 31 and pay out no later than 90 days after the vesting period ends.  The grant date share price is the date \nwhen the award is approved by the Compensation Committee and is used to measure the cost of the award.  We \nrecognized $1.5 million of expense in 2022 associated with these restricted stock units. The net impact to earnings \nwas $1.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were 860,629 shares of Company stock authorized for the payment of awards \nunder these plans.

Under this \nprogram, employees may earn more or less than the target award based on the Company’s results in the year of the \naward. Expense recognized for this plan amounted to $8.6 million in 2022, $6.6 million in 2021, and $5.4 million in \n2020. The net impact to earnings for the respective years was $6.0 million, $4.6 million, and $3.9 million. Based on \nawards outstanding at December 31, 2022, we expect to record approximately $16 million of compensation cost from \n2023 to 2026.

Such \ndisclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports under \nthe Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the \nCommission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is \naccumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as \nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nBased on and as of the date of this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have \nconcluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over \nfinancial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Also, \nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may \ndeteriorate.\nManagement, under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and \noversight of the Board of Directors, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control \nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 using the criteria set forth by the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring \nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework.\nBased on management’s assessment, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was \neffective at December 31, 2022. Our independent registered accounting firm has issued a report on the effectiveness \nof our internal control over financial reporting which is included under Item 8.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2022 that \nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n106"
