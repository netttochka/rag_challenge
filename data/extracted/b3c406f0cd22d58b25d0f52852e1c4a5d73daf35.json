      "text": "PART I\nITEM 1 AND 2. OUR BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES\nOverview\nTellurian Inc. (“Tellurian,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a Houston-based company that is developing and plans to own and operate a\nportfolio of natural gas, LNG marketing, and infrastructure assets that includes an LNG terminal facility (the “Driftwood terminal”), an associated pipeline (the “Driftwood pipeline”),\nother related pipelines, and upstream natural gas assets (collectively referred to as the “Business”). The Driftwood terminal and the Driftwood pipeline are collectively referred to as\nthe “Driftwood Project.” As of December 31, 2022, our upstream natural gas assets consist of 27,689 net acres and interests in 143 producing wells located in the Haynesville Shale\ntrend of northern Louisiana. Our Business may be developed in phases.\nAs part of our execution strategy, which includes increasing our asset base, we will consider various commercial arrangements with third parties across the natural gas value\nchain. We are also pursuing activities such as direct sales of LNG to global counterparties, trading of LNG, the acquisition of additional upstream acreage and drilling of new wells on\nour existing or newly acquired upstream acreage. We remain focused on the financing and construction of the Driftwood Project and related pipelines while managing our upstream\nassets.\nWe manage and report our operations in three reportable segments. The Upstream segment is organized and operates to produce, gather, and deliver natural gas and to acquire\nand develop natural gas assets. The Midstream segment is organized to develop, construct and operate LNG terminals and pipelines. The Marketing & Trading segment is organized\nand operates to purchase and sell natural gas produced primarily by the Upstream segment, market the Driftwood terminal’s LNG production capacity and trade LNG.\nWe continue to evaluate the scope and other aspects of our Business in light of the evolving economic environment, dynamics of the global political landscape, needs of\npotential counterparties and other factors. How we execute our Business will be based on a variety of factors, including the results of our continuing analysis, changing business\nconditions and market feedback.\nOverview of Significant Events\nLimited Notice to Proceed\nOn March 24, 2022, the Company issued a limited notice to proceed to Bechtel Energy Inc., formerly known as Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc. (“Bechtel”), under our\nLSTK EPC agreement for Phase 1 of the Driftwood terminal dated as of November 10, 2017 (the “Phase 1 EPC Agreement”). The Company commenced construction of Phase 1 of the\nDriftwood terminal on April 4, 2022.\nSenior Secured Convertible Notes due 2025\nOn June 3, 2022, we issued and sold $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Secured Convertible Notes due May 1, 2025 (the “Convertible Notes”). Net\nproceeds from the Convertible Notes were approximately $488.7 million after deducting fees and expenses.\nUpstream Asset Acquisition\nOn August 18, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of certain natural gas assets in the Haynesville Shale basin. The purchase price of $125.0 million was subject to\ncustomary adjustments totaling approximately $8.8 million, for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $133.8 million.\nEnvironmental, Social, Governance Practices\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into a pledge with the National Forest Foundation on a five-year plan for reforestation and other forest\nmanagement projects totaling $25.0 million across the United States. In 2022, the Company supported the planting of more than one million trees on 1,441 acres across the United\nStates and bolstered nursery capacity by one million seedlings.\nUpstream Natural Gas Drilling Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we put in production 13 operated Haynesville wells and participated in four non-operated Haynesville wells that were put in\nproduction.\n1"

      "text": "Natural Gas Properties\nReserves\nOur natural gas assets consist of 27,689 net acres and interests in 143 producing wells located in the Haynesville Shale trend of north Louisiana. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, our average net production was approximately 129.7 MMcf/d. All of our proved reserves were associated with those properties as of December 31, 2022. Proved\nreserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and condensate which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from\nknown reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions (i.e., costs as of the date the estimate is made). Proved reserves are categorized as either developed or undeveloped.\nOur reserves as of December 31, 2022 were estimated by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), an independent petroleum engineering firm, and are set forth in the\nfollowing table. Per SEC rules, NSAI based its estimates on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price of natural gas for each month from\nJanuary through December 2022. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided for under contractual arrangements, but not on escalations or reductions based\nupon future conditions. The price used for the reserve estimates as of December 31, 2022 was $6.36 per MMBtu of natural gas, adjusted for energy content, transportation fees and\nmarket differentials.\nThe following table shows our proved reserves as of December 31, 2022:\nNatural Gas\n(MMcf)\nProved reserves (as of December 31, 2022):\nDeveloped\n218,382 \nUndeveloped\n226,511 \nTotal proved reserves\n444,893 \nAs of December 31, 2022, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow from our proved reserves (the “standardized measure”) was approximately $1,036.3\nmillion.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company spent approximately $140.0 million on the conversion of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed\nreserves. The Company converted approximately 138 Bcfe of proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves, which represents a conversion rate of approximately 43%.\nRefer to Supplemental Disclosures About Natural Gas Producing Activities, starting on page 63, for additional details.\nControls Over Reserve Report Preparation, Technical Qualifications and Technologies Used\nOur December 31, 2022 reserve report was prepared by NSAI in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. Reserve definitions comply with the definitions provided\nby Regulation S‑X of the SEC. NSAI prepared the reserve report based upon a review of property interests being appraised, production from such properties, current costs of operation\nand development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, geoscience and engineering data, and other information we\nprovided to them. This information was reviewed by knowledgeable members of our Company for accuracy and completeness prior to submission to NSAI. A letter that identifies the\nprofessional qualifications of the individual at NSAI who was responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2022, has been filed as an\naddendum to Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated by reference herein.\nInternally, a Senior Vice President is responsible for overseeing our reserves process. Our Senior Vice President has over 20 years of experience in the oil and natural gas\nindustry, with the majority of that time in reservoir engineering and asset management. She is a graduate of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University with dual degrees in\nChemical Engineering and French, and a graduate of the University of Houston with a Masters of Business Administration degree. During her career, she has had multiple\nresponsibilities in technical and leadership roles, including reservoir engineering and reserves management, production engineering, planning, and asset management for multiple U.S.\nonshore and international projects. She is also a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.\nProduction\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we produced 47,322 MMcf, 14,302 MMcf and 16,893 MMcf of natural gas at an average sales price of $5.78, $3.52\nand $1.74 per Mcf, respectively. Natural gas production and operating costs for the periods ended December  31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $0.37, $0.48 and $0.28 per Mcfe,\nrespectively.\n2"

      "text": "Drilling Activity\nThe information in the table below should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation among the\nnumber of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found, or economic value. A dry well is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of\nproducing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well. A productive well is an exploratory, development, or extension well that is not a dry well.\nCompletion refers to installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been\nabandoned. The number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the fiscal year, regardless of when drilling was initiated. The table below shows the\nnumber of net productive and dry development operated and non-operated wells drilled during the past three years.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nDevelopment wells:\n    Productive\n13.5 \n6.9 \n    Dry\n— \n— \nWe had no exploratory wells drilled during any of the periods presented.\nWells\nAs of December 31, 2022, we owned working interests in 114 gross (45.6 net) productive natural gas wells. As of December 31, 2022, there were 22 gross (9.7 net) in process\nwells.\nAcreage\nWe have 7,982 gross (7,063 net) developed leasehold acres that are held by production. Additionally, we hold 21,650 gross (20,626 net) undeveloped leasehold acres. Of the\ntotal gross and net undeveloped acreage, 16,091 gross (15,681 net) acres are not held by production, of which 1,441 gross and net acres are set to expire in the fourth quarter of 2023\nunless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage prior to the expiration dates or unless such leasehold rights are extended or renewed.\nVolume Commitments\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we were not subject to any material volume delivery commitments. The Company is expected to be subject to gas gathering\nagreements in the near-term with two third-party companies that are constructing gathering systems in the Haynesville Shale. Upon the in-service date of these gathering systems, the\nCompany will have dedicated gathering capacity for a portion of the Upstream segment’s future natural gas production. The contracts will require the Company to make deficiency\npayments to the extent the Company does not meet the minimum volume commitments per the terms of each contract. The Company expects to fulfill this commitment with existing\nreserves. The Company will monitor current production, anticipated future production, and future development plans to meet its future commitments.\nGathering, Processing and Transportation\nAs part of our acquisitions of natural gas properties, we also acquired certain gathering systems that deliver the natural gas we produce into third-party gathering systems. We\nbelieve that these systems and other available midstream facilities and services in the Haynesville Shale trend are adequate for our current operations and near-term growth.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur operations are and will be subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules, regulations, and laws that include, but are not limited to, the NGA, the Energy Policy\nAct of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”), the Oil Pollution Act, the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), the Clean Air Act (the “CAA”), the Clean Water Act (the “CWA”), the Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the “PSIA”), and the Coastal Zone Management Act (the “CZMA”), as amended from time\nto time. These statutes cover areas related to the authorization, construction and operation of LNG facilities, natural gas pipelines and natural gas producing properties, including\ndischarges and releases to the air, land and water, and the handling, generation, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes. These laws are\nadministered and enforced by governmental agencies including but not limited to FERC, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), DOE/FECM, the U.S. Department of\nTransportation (“DOT”), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Louisiana Department\nof Natural Resources.

On January 19, 2021, FERC issued an order granting a prospective limited waiver of the\nprohibition on buy/sell arrangements for future proposed transactions in which the Company enters into: (1) an agreement to purchase natural gas from a potentially affiliated supplier;\nand (2) an agreement to sell LNG to affiliates in foreign commerce.\nEPAct 2005 amended Section 3 of the NGA to establish or clarify FERC’s exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting, construction, expansion or\noperation of LNG terminals, although except as specifically provided in EPAct 2005, nothing in the statute is intended to affect otherwise applicable law related to any other federal\nagency’s authorities or responsibilities related to LNG terminals.\nIn 2002, FERC concluded that it would apply light-handed regulation to the rates, terms and conditions agreed to by parties for LNG terminalling services, such that LNG\nterminal owners would not be required to provide open-access service at non-discriminatory rates or maintain a tariff or rate schedule on file with FERC, as distinguished from the\nrequirements applied to FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipelines. Although EPAct 2005 codified FERC’s policy, those provisions expired on January 1, 2015. Nonetheless, we\nsee no indication that FERC intends to modify its longstanding policy of light-handed regulation of LNG terminal operations.\nA certificate of public convenience and necessity from FERC is required for the construction and operation of facilities used in interstate natural gas transportation, including\npipeline facilities, in addition to other required governmental and regulatory approvals. In this regard, in April 2019, the Company obtained a certificate of public convenience and\nnecessity to construct and operate the Driftwood pipeline. On June 17, 2021, the Company filed an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the NGA in FERC Docket No. CP21-465-\n000, which, as amended, requests that FERC grant a certificate of public convenience and necessity and related approvals to construct, own and operate dual 42-inch diameter natural\ngas pipelines, an approximately 211,200 horsepower compressor station and appurtenant facilities to be located in Beauregard and Calcasieu Parishes, Louisiana, which would provide\na maximum seasonal capacity of 5.7 Bcf of natural gas per day. FERC issued the final environmental impact statement for the project on September 15, 2022. The final order on the\napplication is still pending.\nFERC’s jurisdiction under the NGA generally extends to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for\nultimate consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial or any other use and to natural gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale. FERC’s jurisdiction does not extend to\nthe production, gathering, local distribution or export of natural gas.\nSpecifically, FERC’s authority to regulate interstate natural gas pipelines includes:\n•\nrates and charges for natural gas transportation and related services;\n•\nthe certification and construction of new facilities;\n•\nthe extension and abandonment of services and facilities;\n•\nthe maintenance of accounts and records;\n•\nthe acquisition and disposition of facilities;\n•\nthe initiation and discontinuation of services; and\n•\nvarious other matters.\nIn addition, FERC has the authority to approve, and if necessary set, “just and reasonable rates” for the transportation or sale of natural gas in interstate commerce. Relatedly,\nunder the NGA, our proposed pipelines will not be permitted to unduly discriminate or grant undue preference as to rates or the terms and conditions of service to any shipper,\nincluding our own affiliates.\nEPAct 2005 amended the NGA to make it unlawful for any entity, including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or\ncontrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed\nby FERC. The anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales, gathering or production, but does apply to activities of\notherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” natural gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. EPAct\n2005 also gives FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA or Natural Gas Policy Act of more than $1 million per day per violation.\nOn February 18, 2022, FERC issued two policy statements: (1) an updated policy statement describing how it will determine whether a new interstate natural gas\ntransportation project is required by the public convenience and necessity under section 7 of the NGA; and (2) an interim policy statement explaining how FERC will assess the\nimpacts of natural gas\n6"

On March 24, 2022, FERC reissued the policy statements as drafts\nand requested additional comments. FERC is not applying the draft policy statements to new or pending applications until FERC issues the final policy statements. It is not clear when\nthe final policy statements will be issued.\nTransportation of the natural gas we produce, and the prices we pay for such transportation, will be significantly affected by the foregoing laws and regulations.\nU.S. Department of Energy, Office of Fossil Energy Export Licenses\nUnder the NGA, exports of natural gas to FTA countries are “deemed to be consistent with the public interest,” and authorization to export LNG to FTA countries shall be\ngranted by the DOE/FECM “without modification or delay.” FTA countries currently capable of importing LNG include but are not limited to Canada, Chile, Colombia, Jordan,\nMexico, Singapore, South Korea and the Dominican Republic. Exports of natural gas to Non-FTA countries are authorized unless the DOE/FECM “finds that the proposed\nexportation” “will not be consistent with the public interest.” We have authorization from the DOE/FECM to export LNG in a volume up to the equivalent of 1,415.3 Bcf per year of\nnatural gas to FTA countries for a term of 30 years and to Non-FTA countries for a term through December 31, 2050.\nFederal and State Regulation of Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety\nThe Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (the “NGPSA”) authorizes DOT to regulate pipeline transportation of natural (flammable, toxic, or corrosive) gas and other\ngases, as well as the transportation and storage of LNG. Amendments to the NGPSA include the Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, which addresses liquids pipelines, and the PSIA, which\ngoverns the areas of testing, education, training, and communication.\nPHMSA administers pipeline safety regulations for jurisdictional gas gathering, transmission, and distribution systems under minimum federal safety standards. PHMSA also\nestablishes and enforces safety regulations for onshore LNG facilities, which are defined as pipeline facilities used for the transportation or storage of LNG subject to such safety\nstandards. Those regulations address requirements for siting, design, construction, equipment, operations, personnel qualification and training, fire protection, and security of LNG\nfacilities. The Driftwood terminal will be subject to such PHMSA regulations.\nThe Driftwood pipeline and other related pipelines will also be subject to regulation by PHMSA, including those under the PSIA. The PHMSA Office of Pipeline Safety\nadministers the PSIA, which requires pipeline companies to perform extensive integrity tests on natural gas transportation pipelines that exist in high population density areas\ndesignated as “high consequence areas.” Pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests on a seven-year cycle. The risk ratings are based on numerous factors, including\nthe population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline, as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating. Testing consists of\nhydrostatic testing, internal electronic testing, or direct assessment of the piping. In addition to the pipeline integrity tests, pipeline companies must implement a qualification program\nto make certain that employees are properly trained. Pipeline operators also must develop integrity management programs for natural gas transportation pipelines, which requires\npipeline operators to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;\nimprove data collection, integration and analysis; repair and remediate the pipeline, as necessary; and implement preventive and mitigative actions.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act (PIPES Act) of 2020 was signed into law as part of the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act of 2021. The legislation reauthorizes the PHMSA pipeline safety program through fiscal year 2023 and provides for advances to improve pipeline safety. The\nlegislation includes a directive to PHMSA to update its current regulations for large-scale LNG facilities.\nOn January 11, 2021, PHMSA published a final rule in the Federal Register amending the Federal Pipeline Safety Regulations to reduce regulatory burdens and offer greater\nflexibility with respect to the construction, maintenance, and operation of gas transmission, distribution, and gathering pipeline systems, including updates to corrosion control\nrequirements and test requirements for pressure vessels. Mandatory compliance with this rule started on October 1, 2021.\nOn November 15, 2021, PHMSA published a final rule in the Federal Register revising the Federal Pipeline Safety Regulations to improve the safety of onshore gas gathering\npipelines. The rule extends reporting requirements to all gas gathering operators and applies a set of minimum safety requirements to certain gas gathering pipelines with large\ndiameters and high operating pressures. This rule went into effect on May 16, 2022.\nOn April 8, 2022, PHMSA published a final rule in the Federal Register revising the Federal Pipeline Safety Regulations applicable to most newly constructed and entirely\nreplaced onshore gas transmission, certain gas gathering, and hazardous liquid pipelines with diameters of six inches or greater. In the revised regulations, PHMSA establishes\nrequirements for operators of these lines to install rupture-mitigation valves or alternative equivalent technologies and establishes minimum\n7"

The final rule went\ninto effect on October 5, 2022.\nOn August 24, 2022, as subsequently corrected on October 25, 2022, PHMSA published a final rule in the Federal Register revising the Federal Pipeline Safety Regulations\nrelating to improved safety of onshore gas transmission pipelines. The amendments in this final rule clarify certain integrity management provisions, codify a management of change\nprocess, update and bolster gas transmission pipeline corrosion control requirements, require operators to inspect pipelines following extreme weather events, strengthen integrity\nmanagement assessment requirements, adjust the repair criteria for high-consequence areas, create new repair criteria for non-high consequence areas, and revise or create specific\ndefinitions related to the amendments. The rule goes into effect on May 24, 2023.\nThe Driftwood pipeline and other related pipelines will be subject to regulation by PHMSA, which will involve capital and operating costs for compliance-related equipment\nand operations. We have no reason to believe that these compliance costs will be material to our financial performance, but the significance of such costs will depend on future events\nand our ability to achieve and maintain compliance throughout the life of the Driftwood Project or related pipelines.\nNatural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968\nThe State of Louisiana also administers certain federal pipeline safety standards under the NGPSA, which requires certain pipelines to comply with safety standards in\nconstructing and operating the pipelines and subjects the pipelines to regular inspections. Failure to comply with the NGPSA may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and\ncriminal sanctions.\nOther Governmental Permits, Approvals and Authorizations\nThe construction and operation of the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline are subject to federal permits, orders, approvals and consultations required by other federal\nand state agencies, including DOT, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, USACE, U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Department of the\nInterior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the EPA and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The necessary permits required for construction have been obtained and will be\nrequired to be maintained for the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline. Similarly, additional permits, orders, approvals and consultations will be required for other related\npipelines.\nThree significant permits that apply to the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline are the USACE Section 404 of the CWA/Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act\nPermit, the CAA Title V Operating Permit and the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Permit, of which the latter two permits are issued by the Louisiana Department of\nEnvironmental Quality. Each of the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline has received its permit from the USACE, including a review and approval by the USACE of the\nfindings and conditions set forth in an Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision issued for the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline pursuant to the requirements\nof NEPA. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has issued the Prevention of Significant Deterioration permit, which is required to commence construction of the\nDriftwood terminal, as well as the Title V Operating Permit. These material approvals may be required for other related pipelines.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nOur operations are and will be subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources, the handling,\ngeneration, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes and other matters. These environmental laws and regulations, which can restrict or prohibit\nimpacts to the environment or the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment, will require significant expenditures for compliance, can\naffect the cost and output of operations, may impose substantial administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance and can result in substantial liabilities. The statutes,\nregulations and permit requirements imposed under environmental laws are modified frequently, sometimes retroactively. Such changes are difficult to predict or prepare for, and may\nimpose material costs for new permits, capital investment or operational limitations or changes.\nThe Biden Administration has issued a number of executive orders that direct federal agencies to take actions that may change regulations and guidance applicable to our\nbusiness.\nFor example, Executive Order 14008, “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,” 86 FR 7619 (January 27, 2021), establishes a policy “promoting the flow of capital\ntoward climate-aligned investments and away from high-carbon investments.” It also requires the heads of agencies to identify any fossil fuel subsidies provided by their respective\nagencies, and to seek to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies from the budget request for fiscal year 2022 and thereafter.\nExecutive Order 13990, “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis,” 86 FR 7037 (January 20, 2021) directs agencies\nto review regulations and policies adopted by the Trump Administration and to “confront the climate crisis.” It specifically directs the EPA to consider suspending, revising or\nrescinding certain regulations, including restrictions on emissions from the oil and gas sector. In addition, Executive Order\n8"

In addition,\nExecutive Order 13990 directs the White House Council on Environmental Quality to rescind draft guidance restricting the review of climate change issues in reviews under NEPA and\nto update regulations to strengthen climate change reviews. In November 2022, the EPA requested public comment on a technical report on the social cost of greenhouse gases and\nannounced that it was also conducting an external peer review of the report, which estimates a substantially higher social carbon cost than past EPA estimates. On February 9, 2023, the\npeer review panel was selected to review this technical report.\nRelatedly, multiple states have challenged the Biden Administration’s interim values for the social cost of greenhouse gases in the federal courts and these challenges remain\npending. Regulation and judicial challenges in these areas are evolving and we cannot predict their ultimate impact, but these issues could have an impact on the Company’s operations\nand financial condition.\nNEPA. NEPA and comparable state laws and regulations require that government agencies review the environmental impacts of proposed projects. On January 9, 2023, the\nCEQ published interim guidance for federal agencies on the consideration of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and climate change under NEPA and is seeking public comment\nthrough March 10, 2023. The impact on us of these and future developments in NEPA regulation and guidance is not determinable at this time, especially with respect to those aspects\nof our operations and development projects that may require future federal approvals.\nClean Air Act. The CAA and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources and impose various monitoring and reporting\nrequirements, among other requirements. The Driftwood Project and related pipelines include facilities and operations that are subject to the federal CAA and comparable state and\nlocal laws, including requirements to obtain pre-construction permits and operating permits. We may be required to incur capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment in\nconnection with maintaining or obtaining permits and approvals pursuant to the CAA and comparable state laws and regulations.\nIn November 2021, the EPA published a proposed rule, which it then supplemented with a November 2022 update, that would create significant new requirements and\nstandards designed to reduce air emissions (including methane and volatile organic compounds) from new and existing oil and gas operations, including oil and gas wells, controllers,\npumps, storage vessels, and compressor stations, through measures such as leak detection monitoring and repair and the elimination of flaring except under limited circumstances. The\nimpact of these proposed oil and gas regulations on the Driftwood Project and other related pipelines and any related costs and obligations are not determinable at this time.\nOn January 6, 2023, the EPA issued pre-publication proposed revisions to the primary (health-based) annual PM2.5 standard from its current level of 12.0 µg/m3 to a\nmaximum within the range of 9.0 to 10.0 µg/m3. The EPA will accept public comment on the proposed revisions for 60 days following the publication of the revisions in the Federal\nRegister. The impact of such revisions on the Driftwood Project and related pipelines cannot be predicted at this time.\nIn addition, under the Biden Administration, the EPA has released guidance documents intended to assist in the evaluation of environmental justice considerations in many\naspects of governmental decision making. Among other things, the guidance emphasizes a focus on advancing environmental justice goals in connection with federal permitting and\nregulatory programs like the Clean Air Act. The impact of this guidance on us is not determinable at this time.\nIn December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment\nbecause emissions of GHGs are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings provide the basis for the EPA to\nadopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. In June 2010, the EPA began regulating GHG emissions from stationary\nsources, including LNG terminals.\nAs discussed above, the Biden Administration has issued Executive Orders with respect to certain governmental actions related to climate change, and the EPA has\npromulgated, and may promulgate additional, regulations for sources of GHG emissions that could affect the oil and gas sector, and Congress or states may enact new GHG legislation,\nany of which could impose emission limits on the Driftwood Project or related pipelines or require us to implement additional pollution control technologies, pay fees related to GHG\nemissions or implement mitigation measures. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”). The IRA imposes a fee of up to\n$1,500 per metric ton of methane emitted above specified thresholds from onshore petroleum and natural gas production facilities, natural gas processing facilities, natural gas\ntransmission and compression facilities, and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting facilities, among other facilities. The fees will apply to methane emissions after\nJanuary 1, 2024. The scope and effects of any new laws or regulations are difficult to predict, and the impact of such laws or regulations on the Driftwood Project or related pipelines\ncannot be predicted at this time.\nCoastal Zone Management Act. Certain aspects of the Driftwood terminal are subject to the requirements of the CZMA. The CZMA is administered by the states (in\nLouisiana, by the Department of Natural Resources). This program is implemented to ensure that impacts to coastal areas are consistent with the intent of the CZMA to manage the\ncoastal areas.\n9"

      "text": "Certain facilities that are part of the Driftwood Project obtained permits for construction and operation in coastal areas pursuant to the requirements of the CZMA.\nClean Water Act. The Driftwood Project and related pipelines are subject to the CWA and analogous state and local laws. The CWA and analogous state and local laws\nregulate discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States or waters of the state, including discharges of wastewater and storm water runoff and discharges of dredged or fill\nmaterial into waters of the United States, as well as spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements. Permits must be obtained prior to discharging pollutants into state and\nfederal waters or dredging or filling wetland and coastal areas. The CWA is administered by the EPA, the USACE and the states. Additionally, the siting and construction of the\nDriftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline will impact jurisdictional wetlands, which would require appropriate federal, state and/or local permits and approval prior to impacting\nsuch wetlands. The authorizing agency may impose significant direct or indirect mitigation costs to compensate for regulated impacts to wetlands. Although the CWA permits required\nfor construction and operation of the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline have been obtained, other CWA permits may be required in connection with our projects that are under\ndevelopment and our future projects. The approval timeframe may also be longer than expected and could potentially affect project schedules.\nIn addition, in recent years, certain CWA regulatory programs, including the Section 404 wetlands permitting program, have been the subject of shifting agency interpretations\nand legal challenges, including in a case, Sackett v. EPA, currently pending before the Supreme Court of the United States. Most recently, on January 18, 2023, the EPA and USACE\npublished a new rule defining jurisdictional waters under the CWA. This new rule is set to become effective March 30, 2023, but has been challenged in judicial proceedings. Further\nregulatory changes or judicial decisions in this area could affect the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline or other related pipelines in ways that cannot be predicted at this time.\nFederal laws, including the CWA, require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil and produced water to prepare and implement spill\nprevention, control, countermeasure and response plans addressing the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) subjects owners and\noperators of facilities to strict and joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from oil spills, including the government’s response\ncosts. Spills subject to the OPA may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities. The Driftwood Project incorporates appropriate equipment and operational measures to\nreduce the potential for spills of oil and establish protocols for responding to spills, but oil spills remain an operational risk that could adversely affect our operations and result in\nadditional costs or fines or penalties.\nResource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal RCRA and comparable state requirements govern the generation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes\nand require corrective action for releases into the environment. In the event such wastes are generated or used in connection with our facilities, we will be subject to regulatory\nrequirements affecting the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of such wastes and could be required to perform corrective action measures to clean up releases of\nsuch wastes.\nWastes from oil and gas activities are currently excluded from certain regulatory programs under RCRA. In response to litigation by environmental groups over the EPA’s\nalleged failure to periodically review existing RCRA regulations, the EPA and certain environmental groups entered into a consent decree pursuant to which the EPA was required to\nundertake a review of whether changes to the existing regulations were necessary. In April 2019, the EPA issued a report concluding that such revisions were unnecessary. A loss of the\nexclusion from RCRA coverage for oil and gas-related wastes, including drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes in the future, could result in a significant increase in our\ncosts to manage and dispose of waste associated with our production operations.\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA, often referred to as Superfund, and comparable state statutes, impose\nliability that is generally joint and several and that is retroactive for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of\nthe original conduct, for the release of a “hazardous substance” (or under state law, other specified substances) into the environment. So-called potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”)\ninclude the current and certain past owners and operators of a facility where there has been a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance and persons who disposed of or\narranged for the disposal of, or transported hazardous substances found at a site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to\nthreats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRPs the cost of such action. Liability can arise from conditions on properties where operations are\nconducted, even under circumstances where such operations were performed by third parties and/or from conditions at disposal facilities where materials were sent. Our operations\ninvolve the use or handling of materials that include or may be classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA or regulated under similar state statutes. We may also be the owner\nor operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released and may be responsible for the investigation, management and disposal of soils or dredge spoils containing\nhazardous substances in connection with our operations.\nOil and natural gas exploration and production, and possibly other activities, have been conducted at some of our properties by previous owners and operators. Materials from\nthese operations remain on some of the properties and, in certain\n10"

In some instances, we have agreed to indemnify the sellers of producing properties from whom we have acquired reserves against certain liabilities\nfor environmental claims associated with the properties. Accordingly, we could incur material costs for remediation required under CERCLA or similar state statutes in the future.\nHydraulic Fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is commonly used to stimulate the production of crude oil and/or natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations. We plan to\nuse hydraulic fracturing extensively in our natural gas development operations. The process involves the injection of water, sand, and additives under pressure into a targeted\nsubsurface formation. The water and pressure create fractures in the rock formations, which are held open by the grains of sand, enabling the natural gas to more easily flow to the\nwellbore. The process is generally subject to regulation by state oil and natural gas commissions but is also subject to new and changing regulatory programs at the federal, state and\nlocal levels.\nIn February 2014, the EPA issued permitting guidance under the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) for the underground injection of liquids from hydraulically fractured\nwells and other wells where diesel is used. Depending upon how it is implemented, this guidance may create duplicative requirements in certain areas, further slow the permitting\nprocess in certain areas, increase the costs of operations, and result in expanded regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities related to the Driftwood Project.\nIn May 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) pursuant to which it collected extensive\ninformation on the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluid, as well as other health-related data, from chemical manufacturers and processors. If the EPA regulates hydraulic\nfracturing fluid under TSCA in the future, such regulation may increase the cost of our natural gas development operations and the feedstock for the Driftwood terminal.\nIn June 2016, the EPA finalized pretreatment standards for indirect discharges of wastewater from the oil and natural gas extraction industry. The regulation prohibits sending\nwastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works. Certain activities of our Business are subject to the\npretreatment standards, which means that we are required to use disposal methods that may require additional permits or cost more to implement than disposal at publicly-owned\ntreatment works.\nIn December 2016, the EPA released a report titled “Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources\nin the United States.” The report concluded that activities involved in hydraulic fracturing can have impacts on drinking water under certain circumstances. In addition, the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy has investigated practices that the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods.\nThese and similar studies, depending on their degree of development and the nature of results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA\nor other regulatory mechanisms. If the EPA proposes additional regulations of hydraulic fracturing in the future, it could impose additional emission limits and pollution control\ntechnology requirements, which could limit our operations and revenues and potentially increase our costs of gas production or acquisition.\nEndangered Species Act (“ESA”). Our operations may be restricted by requirements under the ESA. The ESA prohibits the harassment, harming or killing of certain protected\nspecies and destruction of protected habitats. Under the NEPA review process conducted by FERC, we have been and will be required to consult with federal agencies to determine\nlimitations on and mitigation measures applicable to activities that have the potential to result in harm to threatened or endangered species of plants, animals, fish and their designated\nhabitats. Although we have conducted studies and engaged in consultations with agencies in order to avoid harming protected species, inadvertent or incidental harm may occur in\nconnection with the construction or operation of our properties, including the Driftwood Project or related pipelines, which could result in fines or penalties. In addition, if threatened\nor endangered species are found on any part of our properties, including the sites of the Driftwood Project, related pipelines, or pipeline rights of way, then we may be required to\nimplement avoidance or mitigation measures that could limit our operations or impose additional costs.\nRegulation of Natural Gas Operations\nOur natural gas operations are subject to a number of additional laws, rules and regulations that require, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds\nand reports concerning operations. States, parishes and municipalities in which we operate may regulate, among other things:\n•\nthe location of new wells;\n•\nthe method of drilling, completing and operating wells;\n•\nthe surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;\n•\nthe plugging and abandoning of wells;\n•\nnotice to surface owners and other third parties; and\n11"

Some states, including Louisiana,\nallow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on the voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or\nunitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from\noil and natural gas wells and generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and require that oil and natural gas be produced in a prorated, equitable system. These laws and\nregulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, most states,\nand some local authorities, impose a production, ad valorem or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil and natural gas and minerals in place within their\njurisdictions. States do not generally regulate wellhead prices or engage in other, similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance they will not do so in the future.\nAnti-Corruption, Trade Control, and Tax Evasion Laws\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws in various jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act of\n2010 and other anti-corruption laws. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit our employees, directors, officers and agents from authorizing, offering, or providing improper\npayments or anything else of value to government officials or other covered persons to obtain or retain business or gain an improper business advantage. We face the risk that one of\nour employees or agents will offer, authorize, or provide something of value that could subject us to liability under the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot\npredict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered\nor interpreted.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of\nIndustry and Security, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and various non-U.S. government entities, including applicable export control regulations,\neconomic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements, currency exchange regulations, and transfer pricing regulations (collectively, “Trade Control laws”).\nWe are also subject to new U.K. corporate criminal offenses for failure to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion pursuant to the Criminal Finances Act 2017, which imposes\ncriminal liability on a company where it has failed to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion by a person associated with the company.\nWe have instituted policies, procedures and ongoing training of employees designed to ensure that we and our employees and agents comply with the FCPA, other anti-\ncorruption laws, Trade Control laws and the Criminal Finances Act 2017. However, there is no assurance that our efforts have been and will be completely effective in ensuring our\ncompliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws, the Trade\nControl laws or the Criminal Finances Act 2017, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which\ncould have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA, other\nanti-corruption laws, the Trade Control laws or the Criminal Finances Act 2017 by the U.S. or foreign authorities could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. U.S. or foreign authorities may also seek to hold us liable for successor liability for anti-corruption violations committed by companies we\nacquire or in which we invest (for example, by way of acquiring equity interests, participating as a joint venture partner, or acquiring assets).\nCompetition\nWe are subject to a high degree of competition in all aspects of our business. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business in General — Competition is\nintense in the energy industry and some of Tellurian’s competitors have greater financial, technological and other resources.”\nProduction & Transportation. The natural gas and oil business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves, the acquisition of natural gas and oil\nleases, equipment and personnel required to develop and produce reserves, and the gathering, transportation and marketing of natural gas and oil. Our competitors include national oil\ncompanies, major integrated natural gas and oil companies, other independent natural gas and oil companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial,\ncommercial, and individual consumers, such as operators of pipelines and other midstream facilities. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name\nrecognition, larger staffs and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we currently possess.\nLiquefaction.

Tellurian competes with a variety of companies in the global LNG market, including (i) integrated energy companies that market LNG from their own\nliquefaction facilities, (ii) trading houses and aggregators with LNG supply portfolios, and (iii) liquefaction plant operators that market equity volumes. Many of the companies with\nwhich we compete have greater name recognition, larger staffs, greater access to the LNG market and substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do.\nTitle to Properties\nWith respect to our natural gas producing properties, we believe that we hold good and defensible leasehold title to substantially all of our properties in accordance with\nstandards generally accepted in the industry. A preliminary title examination is conducted at the time the properties are acquired. Our natural gas properties are subject to royalty,\noverriding royalty, and other outstanding interests. We believe that we hold good title to our other properties, subject to customary burdens, liens, or encumbrances that we do not\nexpect to materially interfere with our use of the properties.\nMajor Customers\nWe do not have any major customers.\nFacilities\nCertain subsidiaries of Tellurian have entered into operating leases for office space in Houston, Texas, Washington, D.C. and London, United Kingdom. The tenors of the\nleases are five, eight and five years for Houston, Washington, D.C. and London, respectively.\nEmployees and Human Capital\nAs of December 31, 2022, Tellurian had 171 full-time employees worldwide. None of them are subject to collective bargaining arrangements. The Company’s workforce is\nprimarily located in Houston, Texas, and we have offices in Louisiana, Washington DC, London and Singapore. Many of our employees are originally from or have extensive\nexperience working in countries other than the United States. This reflects our overall strategy of building a natural gas business that is global in scope.\nWe plan to build, among other things, an LNG liquefaction facility that we believe is one of the largest energy infrastructure projects currently under development in the\nUnited States. Given the inherent challenges involved in the construction of a project of this type, in particular by a company that has limited current operations, our human resources\nstrategy focuses on the recruitment and retention of employees who have already established relevant expertise in the industry. The execution of this strategy has resulted in us\nassembling what we believe to be a premier management team in the global natural gas and LNG industry. A related aspect of our human resources strategy is that the compensation\nstructure for many of our employees is weighted towards incentive compensation that is designed to reward progress toward the development of our business, including in particular\nthe financing and construction of the Driftwood Project.\nJurisdiction and Year of Formation\nThe Company is a Delaware corporation originally formed in 1967 and formerly known as Magellan Petroleum Corporation.\nAvailable Information\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If any of such events should occur, our\nbusiness, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments.\nOur risk factors are grouped into the following categories:\n•\nRisks Relating to Financial Matters;\n•\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock;\n•\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Business;\n•\nRisks Relating to Our Natural Gas and Oil Operating Activities; and\n•\nRisks Relating to Our Business in General.\nRisks Relating to Financial Matters\nTellurian will be required to seek additional equity and/or debt financing in the future to complete the Driftwood Project and to grow its other operations, and may not be able to\nsecure such financing on acceptable terms, or at all.\nTellurian will be unable to generate any significant revenue from the Driftwood Project for multiple years, and expects cash flow from its other lines of business to be modest\nfor an extended period as it focuses on the development and growth of these businesses. Tellurian will, therefore, need substantial amounts of additional financing to execute its\nbusiness plan and to repay its indebtedness when necessary. There can be no assurance that Tellurian will be able to raise sufficient capital on acceptable terms, or at all. Tellurian’s\nability to raise financing, and the terms of that financing, will depend to a significant extent on factors outside of its control such as global market conditions. Interest rates rose\nsignificantly in 2022 in response to inflationary pressures in the U.S. and world economies, and rising interest rates generally make financing more difficult to obtain as well as more\nexpensive. If adequate financing is not available on satisfactory terms or at all, Tellurian may be required to delay, scale back or cancel the development of business opportunities, and\nthis could adversely affect its operations and financial condition to a significant extent. Tellurian intends to pursue a variety of potential financing transactions, including project\nfinance transactions and sales of equity and debt securities. We do not know whether, and to what extent, potential sources of financing will find the terms we propose acceptable. In\naddition, potential sources of financing may conclude that the terms of our commercial agreements for the sale of LNG are not attractive enough to justify an investment.\nDebt or preferred equity financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens or restrictions on Tellurian’s assets and covenants limiting or restricting our ability\nto take specific actions, such as paying dividends or making distributions, incurring additional debt, acquiring or disposing of assets and increasing expenses. Debt financing would\nalso be required to be repaid regardless of Tellurian’s operating results. Obtaining financing through additional issuances of common stock or other equity securities would impose\nfewer restrictions on our future operations but would be dilutive to the interests of existing stockholders.\nWe have a limited operating history and expect to incur losses for a significant period of time.\nWe have a limited operating history. Although Tellurian’s current directors, managers and officers have prior professional and industry experience, our business is in an early\nstage of development. Accordingly, the prior history, track record and historical financial information you may use to evaluate our prospects are limited.\nCompletion of construction of the Driftwood Project will require Tellurian to incur costs and expenses much greater than those it has incurred to date. The Company also\nexpects to devote substantial amounts of capital to the growth and development of its other operations. Tellurian expects that operating losses will increase substantially in 2023 and\nthereafter, and expects to continue to generate negative operating cash flows for the next several years.\nTellurian’s exposure to the performance and credit risks of its counterparties may adversely affect its operating results, liquidity and access to financing.\nOur operations involve our entering into various construction, purchase and sale, hedging, supply and other transactions with numerous third parties. In such arrangements, we\nwill be exposed to the performance and credit risks of our counterparties, including the risk that one or more counterparties fail to perform their obligations under the applicable\nagreement. Some of these risks may increase during periods of commodity price volatility. In some cases, we will be dependent on a single counterparty or a small group of\ncounterparties, all of whom may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. These risks include, but are not limited to, risks related to the construction of the\nDriftwood terminal discussed below in “ — Risks Relating to Our LNG Business — Tellurian will be dependent on third-party contractors for the successful completion of the\nDriftwood terminal, and these contractors may be unable to complete the Driftwood terminal.” Defaults by suppliers and other counterparties may adversely affect our operating\nresults, liquidity and access to financing.\n14"

      "text": "Our use of hedging arrangements may adversely affect our future operating results or liquidity.\nAs we continue to develop our LNG and natural gas marketing and natural gas operating activities, we may enter into commodity hedging arrangements in an effort to reduce\nour exposure to fluctuations in price and timing risk. Any hedging arrangements entered into would expose us to the risk of financial loss when (i) the counterparty to the hedging\ncontract defaults on its contractual obligations or (ii) there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual prices received.\nAlso, commodity derivative arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from a favorable change in the relevant commodity price. In addition, regulations\nissued by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the SEC and other federal agencies establishing regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market could adversely affect\nour ability to manage our price risks associated with our LNG and natural gas activity and therefore have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nFactors that could materially affect our future effective tax rates include but are not limited to:\n•\nchanges in the regulatory environment;\n•\nchanges in accounting and tax standards or practices;\n•\nchanges in U.S., state or foreign tax laws;\n•\nchanges in the composition of operating income by tax jurisdiction; and\n•\nour operating results before taxes.\nWe are also subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other tax authorities, including state revenue agencies and other foreign governments.\nWhile we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from examinations by the IRS and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our\nprovision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that the actual outcome resulting from these examinations will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and\noperating results. Additionally, the IRS and several foreign tax authorities have increasingly focused attention on intercompany transfer pricing with respect to sales of products and\nservices and the use of intangibles. Tax authorities could disagree with our cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. If we do not prevail in any\nsuch disagreements, our profitability may be affected.\nTellurian does not expect to generate sufficient cash to pay dividends until the completion of construction of the Driftwood Project.\nTellurian’s directly and indirectly held assets currently consist primarily of natural gas leaseholds and related upstream development assets, cash held for certain development\nand operating expenses, applications for permits from regulatory agencies relating to the Driftwood Project and certain real property related to that project. Tellurian’s cash flow, and\nconsequently its ability to distribute earnings, is solely dependent upon the cash flow its subsidiaries receive from the Driftwood Project and its other operations. Tellurian’s ability to\ncomplete the project, as discussed elsewhere in this section, is dependent upon its and its subsidiaries’ ability to obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals and raise the capital\nnecessary to fund the development of the project. We expect that cash flows from our operations will be reinvested in the business rather than used to fund dividends, that pursuing our\nstrategy will require substantial amounts of capital, and that the required capital will exceed cash flows from operations for a significant period.\nTellurian’s ability to pay dividends in the future is uncertain and will depend on a variety of factors, including limitations on the ability of it or its subsidiaries to pay dividends\nunder applicable law and/or the terms of debt or other agreements, and the judgment of the Board of Directors or other governing body of the relevant entity.\nWe may be unable to fulfill our obligations under our debt agreements.\nWe have issued senior notes as described in Note 10, Borrowings, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Our ability to generate cash flows\nfrom operations or obtain refinancing capital sufficient to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance and financial condition and\nthe availability of refinancing debt or equity capital, which will be affected by prevailing commodity prices and economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. Our inability to generate adequate cash flows from operations could adversely affect our ability to execute our overall business plan, and we could be\nrequired to sell assets, reduce our capital expenditures or seek refinancing debt or equity capital to satisfy the requirements of the debt agreements. These alternative measures may be\nunavailable or inadequate, in which case we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, and may themselves adversely affect our overall business strategy. In addition, the\nindenture governing our convertible notes\n15"

      "text": "contains covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and a minimum cash covenant, that could prevent us from pursuing certain business strategies\nor opportunities. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, amounts due under the notes could be accelerated. Further, the holder of our convertible notes may redeem up to\n$166 million of those notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on each of May 1, 2023 and May 1, 2024. The exercise of this redemption right could materially adversely affect\nour liquidity.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our efforts to reach a final investment decision with respect to the Driftwood Project.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic may have a variety of adverse effects on our business, including by depressing commodity prices and the\nmarket value of our securities. Prospects for the development and financing of the Driftwood Project are based in part on factors including global economic conditions that have been,\nand may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for shareholders to sell our common stock when desired or at\nattractive prices.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile, and we expect it to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. Adverse events could trigger a significant\ndecline in the trading price of our common stock, including, among others, failure to obtain necessary permits, unfavorable changes in commodity prices or commodity price\nexpectations, adverse regulatory developments, loss of a relationship with a partner, litigation, departures of key personnel, and failures to advance the Driftwood Project on the terms\nor within the time periods anticipated. Furthermore, general market conditions, including the level of, and fluctuations in, the trading prices of equity securities generally could affect\nthe price of our stock. The stock markets frequently experience price and volume volatility that affects many companies’ stock prices, often in ways unrelated to the operating\nperformance of those companies. These fluctuations may affect the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock during 2022 was as low as $1.54 per\nshare and as high as $6.54 per share.\nThe market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by us or our major shareholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market by us or any of our major shareholders, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause\nthe market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the sale of these shares in the public market, or the possibility of such sales, could impair our ability to raise capital\nthrough the sale of additional equity securities. Our insider trading policy permits our officers and directors, some of whom own substantial percentages of our outstanding common\nstock, to pledge shares of stock that they own as collateral for loans subject to certain requirements. Some of our officers and directors have pledged shares of stock in accordance with\nthis policy. Such pledges have resulted, and could result in the future, in large amounts of shares of our stock being sold in the market in a short period and corresponding declines in\nthe trading price of the common stock.\nIn addition, in the future, we may issue shares of our common stock, or securities convertible into our common stock, in connection with acquisitions of assets or businesses\nor for other purposes. Such issuances may result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could have an adverse effect on the market value of shares of our common stock,\ndepending on market conditions at the time, the terms of the issuance, and if applicable, the value of the business or assets acquired and our success in exploiting the properties or\nintegrating the businesses we acquire.\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Business\nVarious economic and political factors could negatively affect the development, construction and operation of LNG facilities, including the Driftwood terminal, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nCommercial development of an LNG facility takes a number of years, requires substantial capital investment and may be delayed by factors such as:\n•\nincreased construction costs;\n•\neconomic downturns, increases in interest rates or other events that may affect the availability of sufficient financing for LNG projects on commercially reasonable\nterms;\n•\ndecreases in the price of natural gas or LNG outside of the United States, which might decrease the expected returns relating to investments in LNG projects;\n16"

Cost estimates may be inaccurate and\nmay change due to various factors, such as cost overruns, change orders, delays in construction, legal and regulatory requirements, site issues, increased component and material costs,\nescalation of labor costs, labor disputes, changes in commodity prices, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased spending to maintain Tellurian’s construction schedule\nand other factors. For example, new or increased tariffs on materials needed in the construction process could materially increase construction costs, as could supply chain issues\naffecting long lead-time items. Our estimate of the cost of construction of the Driftwood terminal is based on the prices set forth in our LSTK EPC agreements with Bechtel and those\nprices are subject to adjustment by change orders, including for consideration of certain increased costs. Our failure to achieve our cost estimates could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our LNG facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas, this could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe will depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that will provide natural gas delivery options to our natural gas operations and our LNG facilities. If the\nconstruction of new or modified pipeline connections is not completed on schedule or any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas\ndue to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, our ability to meet our LNG sale and purchase agreement obligations and continue shipping natural gas from\nproducing operations or regions to end markets could be restricted, thereby reducing our revenues. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\noperating results, liquidity and prospects.\nTellurian’s ability to generate cash will depend upon it entering into contracts with third-party customers, the terms of those contracts and the performance of those customers\nunder those contracts.\nWe have entered into a commercial arrangement with a third-party customer for the sale of LNG from Phase I of the Driftwood Project. Our ability to generate revenue from\nthat contract will depend upon, among other factors, LNG prices and our ability to finance and complete the construction of the project. Tellurian’s business strategy may change\nregarding how and when the proposed Driftwood Project’s export capacity is marketed. Also, Tellurian’s business strategy may change due to an inability to enter into additional\nagreements with customers or based on a variety of factors, including the future price outlook, supply and demand of LNG, natural gas liquefaction capacity, and global regasification\ncapacity. If our efforts to market the proposed Driftwood Project and the LNG it will produce are not successful, Tellurian’s business, results of operations, financial condition and\nprospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to purchase, receive or produce sufficient natural gas to satisfy our delivery obligations under any LNG sale and purchase agreements, which could have an\nadverse effect on us.\nUnder LNG sale and purchase agreements with our customers, we may be required to make available to them a specified amount of LNG at specified times. However, we\nmay not be able to acquire or produce sufficient quantities of natural gas or LNG to satisfy those obligations, which may provide affected customers with the right to terminate their\nLNG sale and purchase agreements. Our failure to purchase, receive or produce sufficient quantities of natural gas or LNG in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nThe construction and operation of the Driftwood Project and related pipelines remain subject to ongoing compliance obligations and further approvals, and some approvals may\nbe subject to further conditions, review and/or revocation.\nThe design, construction and operation of LNG export terminals is a highly regulated activity. The approval of FERC under Section 3 of the NGA, as well as several other\nmaterial governmental and regulatory approvals and permits, is required to construct and operate an LNG terminal. Such approvals and authorizations are often subject to ongoing\nconditions imposed by regulatory agencies, and additional approval and permit requirements may be imposed. Tellurian and its affiliates will be\n17"

Although all the major permits required for construction and operation of the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline have been obtained, we must still satisfy various\nconditions of our FERC permits during the construction process. Additionally, numerous permits and approvals will be required in connection with other assets, including our upstream\noperations and other related pipelines. Certain environmental groups have opposed our efforts to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to grow our operations pursuant to our\nstrategy.\n    There is no assurance that Tellurian will obtain and maintain these governmental permits, approvals and authorizations, and failure to obtain and maintain any of these permits,\napprovals or authorizations could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nTellurian will be dependent on third-party contractors for the successful completion of the Driftwood terminal, and these contractors may be unable to complete the Driftwood\nterminal.\nThe construction of the Driftwood terminal is expected to take several years, will be confined to a limited geographic area and could be subject to delays, cost overruns, labor\ndisputes and other factors that could adversely affect financial performance or impair Tellurian’s ability to execute its proposed business plan. Timely and cost-effective completion of\nthe Driftwood terminal in compliance with agreed-upon specifications will be highly dependent upon the performance of Bechtel and other third-party contractors pursuant to their\nagreements. However, Tellurian has not yet entered into definitive agreements with all of the contractors, advisors and consultants necessary for the development and construction of\nthe Driftwood terminal. Tellurian may not be able to successfully enter into such construction contracts on terms or at prices that are acceptable to it.\nFurther, faulty construction that does not conform to Tellurian’s design and quality standards may have an adverse effect on Tellurian’s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and prospects. For example, improper equipment installation may lead to a shortened life of Tellurian’s equipment, increased operations and maintenance costs or a\nreduced availability or production capacity of the affected facility. The ability of Tellurian’s third-party contractors to perform successfully under any agreements to be entered into is\ndependent on a number of factors, including force majeure events and such contractors’ ability to:\n•\ndesign, engineer and receive critical components and equipment necessary for the Driftwood terminal to operate in accordance with specifications and address any\nstart-up and operational issues that may arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations;\n•\nattract, develop and retain skilled personnel, engage and retain third-party subcontractors, and address any labor issues that may arise;\n•\npost required construction bonds and comply with the terms thereof, and maintain their own financial condition, including adequate working capital;\n•\nadhere to any warranties that the contractors provide in their EPC contracts; and\n•\nrespond to difficulties such as equipment failure, delivery delays, schedule changes and failure to perform by subcontractors, some of which are beyond their control,\nand manage the construction process generally, including engaging and retaining third-party contractors, coordinating with other contractors and regulatory agencies\nand dealing with inclement weather conditions.\nFurthermore, Tellurian may have disagreements with its third-party contractors about different elements of the construction process, which could lead to the assertion of rights\nand remedies under the related contracts, resulting in a contractor’s unwillingness to perform further work on the relevant project. The risk of disagreements with contractors and other\nconstruction issues such as increased costs and delays may be exacerbated by inflation, supply chain disruptions and other market conditions. Tellurian may also face difficulties in\ncommissioning a newly constructed facility. Any significant delays in the development of the Driftwood terminal could materially and adversely affect Tellurian’s business, results of\noperations, financial condition and prospects. The construction of the Driftwood pipeline or related pipelines will be required for the long-term operations of the Driftwood terminal\nand will be subject to similar risks.   \nTellurian’s construction and operations activities are subject to a number of development risks, operational hazards, regulatory approvals and other risks, which could cause cost\noverruns and delays and could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nSiting, development and construction of the Driftwood Project and related pipelines will be subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any construction project\nresulting from numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n•\ndifficulties or delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, sufficient equity or debt financing on reasonable terms;\n18"

Any delay in completion of the Driftwood Project may also cause a delay in the receipt of revenues projected from the Driftwood Project or cause a loss of one or more\ncustomers. As a result, any significant construction delay, whatever the cause, could have a material adverse effect on Tellurian’s business, results of operations, financial condition,\nliquidity and prospects. Similar risks may affect the construction of other facilities and projects we elect to pursue.\nCyclical or other changes in the demand for and price of LNG and natural gas may adversely affect Tellurian’s LNG business and the performance of our customers and could\nlead to the reduced development of LNG projects worldwide.\nTellurian’s plans and expectations regarding its business and the development of domestic LNG facilities and projects are generally based on assumptions about the future\nprice of natural gas and LNG and the conditions of the global natural gas and LNG markets. Natural gas and LNG prices have been, and are likely to remain in the future, volatile and\nsubject to wide fluctuations that are difficult to predict. Such fluctuations may be caused by various factors, including, but not limited to, one or more of the following:\n•\ncompetitive liquefaction capacity in North America;\n•\ninsufficient or oversupply of natural gas liquefaction or receiving capacity worldwide;\n•\ninsufficient or oversupply of LNG tanker capacity;\n•\nweather conditions;\n•\nchanges in demand for natural gas, including as a result of disruptive events such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic;\n•\nincreased natural gas production deliverable by pipelines, which could suppress demand for LNG;\n•\ndecreased oil and natural gas exploration activities, which may decrease the production of natural gas;\n•\ncost improvements that allow competitors to offer LNG regasification services or provide natural gas liquefaction capabilities at reduced prices;\n•\nchanges in supplies of, and prices for, alternative energy sources such as coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy, which may reduce the demand for\nnatural gas;\n•\nchanges in regulatory, tax or other governmental policies regarding imported or exported LNG, natural gas or alternative energy sources, which may reduce the\ndemand for imported or exported LNG and/or natural gas;\n•\npolitical conditions in natural gas producing regions; and\n•\ncyclical trends in general business and economic conditions that cause changes in the demand for natural gas.\n19"

The\nprofitability of the LNG SPA we have entered into will depend in part on the relationship between the costs we incur in producing or purchasing natural gas and the then-current index\nprices when sales occur. An adverse change in that relationship, whether resulting from an increase in our costs, a decline in the index prices or both, could make sales under the\nagreements less profitable or could require us to sell at a loss. Similarly, part of our business involves the trading of LNG cargos from time to time. LNG trading involves risks,\nincluding the risk that commodity price changes will result in us selling cargos at a loss. These risks have increased in recent periods as higher commodity prices have resulted in\ncargos becoming generally more expensive, therefore increasing our exposure to potential losses.\nTechnological innovation may render Tellurian’s anticipated competitive advantage or its processes obsolete.\nTellurian’s success will depend on its ability to create and maintain a competitive position in the natural gas liquefaction industry. In particular, although Tellurian plans to\nconstruct the Driftwood terminal using proven technologies that it believes provide it with certain advantages, Tellurian does not have any exclusive rights to any of the technologies\nthat it will be utilizing. In addition, the technology Tellurian anticipates using in the Driftwood Project may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by legal or regulatory requirements,\ntechnological advances, more efficient and cost-effective processes or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of its competitors or others, which could materially and\nadversely affect Tellurian’s business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nFailure of exported LNG to be a competitive source of energy for international markets could adversely affect our customers and could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOperations of the Driftwood Project will be dependent upon our ability to deliver LNG supplies from the U.S., which is primarily dependent upon LNG being a competitive\nsource of energy internationally. The success of our business plan is dependent, in part, on the extent to which LNG can, for significant periods and in significant volumes, be supplied\nfrom North America and delivered to international markets at a lower cost than the cost of alternative energy sources. Through the use of improved exploration technologies, additional\nsources of natural gas may be discovered outside the U.S., which could increase the available supply of natural gas outside the U.S. and could result in natural gas in those markets\nbeing available at a lower cost than that of LNG exported to those markets.\nFactors which may negatively affect potential demand for LNG from our liquefaction projects are diverse and include, among others:\n•\nincreases in worldwide LNG production capacity and availability of LNG for market supply;\n•\nincreases in demand for LNG but at levels below those required to maintain current price equilibrium with respect to supply;\n•\nincreases in the cost to supply natural gas feedstock to our liquefaction project;\n•\ndecreases in the cost of competing sources of natural gas or alternative sources of energy such as coal, heavy fuel oil, diesel, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar;\n•\ndecreases in the price of non-U.S. LNG, including decreases in price as a result of contracts indexed to lower oil prices;\n•\nincreases in capacity and utilization of nuclear power and related facilities;\n•\nincreases in the cost of LNG shipping; and\n•\ndisplacement of LNG by pipeline natural gas or alternative fuels in locations where access to these energy sources is not currently available.\nPolitical instability in foreign countries that import natural gas, or strained relations between such countries and the U.S., may also impede the willingness or ability of LNG\nsuppliers, purchasers and merchants in such countries to import LNG from the U.S. Furthermore, some foreign purchasers of LNG may have economic or other reasons to obtain their\nLNG from non-U.S. markets or our competitors’ liquefaction facilities in the U.S.\nAs a result of these and other factors, LNG may not be a competitive source of energy internationally. The failure of LNG to be a competitive supply alternative to local\nnatural gas, oil and other alternative energy sources in markets accessible to our customers could adversely affect the ability of our customers to deliver LNG from the U.S. on a\ncommercial basis. Any significant impediment to the ability to deliver LNG from the U.S. generally, or from the Driftwood Project specifically, could\n20"

Failure to comply with these regulations and laws could result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal\nsanctions.\nThese regulations and laws, which include the CAA, the Oil Pollution Act, the CWA and RCRA, and analogous state and local laws and regulations, will restrict, prohibit or\notherwise regulate the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with the construction and operation of our facilities.\nThese laws and regulations, including NEPA, will require and have required us to obtain and maintain permits with respect to our facilities, prepare environmental impact assessments,\nprovide governmental authorities with access to our facilities for inspection and provide reports related to compliance. Federal and state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or\nthe lawfulness of the original conduct, for the release of certain types or quantities of hazardous substances into the environment. Violation of these laws and regulations could lead to\nsubstantial liabilities, fines and penalties, the denial or revocation of permits necessary for our operations, governmental orders to shut down our facilities or capital expenditures\nrelated to pollution control equipment or remediation measures that could have a material adverse effect on Tellurian’s business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and\nprospects.\nAs the owner and the operator of the Driftwood Project and other related assets we could be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances released\ninto the environment and for damage to natural resources, whether caused by us or our contractors or existing at the time construction commences.

Each of the applicable regulatory requirements and limitations is subject to change, either through new regulations enacted on the federal, state or local level,\nor by new or modified regulations that may be implemented under existing law. The nature and effects of these changes in laws, rules, regulations and permits may be unpredictable\nand may have material effects on our business. Future legislation and regulations, such as those relating to the transportation and security of LNG exported from our proposed LNG\nfacilities through the Calcasieu Ship Channel, could cause additional expenditures, restrictions and delays in connection with the proposed LNG facilities and their construction, the\nextent of which cannot be predicted and which may require Tellurian to limit substantially, delay or cease operations in some circumstances. Revised, reinterpreted or additional laws\nand regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating costs and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on Tellurian’s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nOur operations will be subject to significant risks and hazards, one or more of which may create significant liabilities and losses that could have a material adverse effect on\nTellurian’s business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nWe will face numerous risks in developing and conducting our operations. For example, the plan of operations for the proposed Driftwood Project and related assets is subject\nto the inherent risks associated with LNG, pipeline and upstream operations, including explosions, pollution, leakage or release of toxic substances, fires, hurricanes and other adverse\nweather conditions, leakage of hydrocarbons, and other hazards, each of which could result in significant delays in commencement or interruptions of operations and/or result in\ndamage to or destruction of the proposed Driftwood Project, related pipelines, or upstream assets, or damage to persons and property. In addition, operations at the proposed Driftwood\nProject, related pipelines, upstream assets, and vessels or facilities of third parties on which Tellurian’s operations are dependent could face possible risks associated with acts of\naggression or terrorism.\nHurricanes have damaged coastal and inland areas located in the Gulf Coast area, resulting in disruption and damage to certain LNG terminals located in the area. Future\nstorms and related storm activity and collateral effects, or other disasters such as explosions, fires, floods or accidents, could result in damage to, or interruption of operations at, the\nDriftwood terminal or related infrastructure, as well as delays or cost increases in the construction and the development of the Driftwood terminal or other facilities. Storms, disasters\nand accidents could also damage or interrupt the activities of vessels that we or third parties operate in connection with our LNG business. Changes in the global climate may have\nsignificant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and rising sea levels. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our\ncoastal operations.\nOur LNG business will face other types of risks and liabilities as well. For instance, our LNG marketing activities expose us to possible financial losses, including the risk of\nlosses resulting from adverse changes in the index prices upon which contracts for the purchase and sale of LNG cargos are based. Our LNG marketing activities are also subject to\nvarious domestic and international regulatory and foreign currency risks.\nTellurian does not, nor does it intend to, maintain insurance against all of these risks and losses, and many risks are not insurable. Tellurian may not be able to maintain\ndesired or required insurance in the future at rates that it considers reasonable. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material\nadverse effect on Tellurian’s business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Natural Gas and Oil Operating Activities\nAcquisitions of natural gas and oil properties are subject to the uncertainties of evaluating reserves and potential liabilities, including environmental uncertainties.\nWe expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of natural gas and oil properties from time to time. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. These factors include reserves, development potential, future commodity prices, operating costs, title issues, and potential environmental and other\nliabilities. Such assessments are inexact, and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In connection with our assessments, we perform due diligence that we believe is generally\nconsistent with industry practices.\nHowever, our due diligence activities are not likely to permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not\ninspect every well prior to an acquisition, and our ability to evaluate undeveloped acreage is inherently imprecise. Even when we inspect a well, we may not always discover structural,\nsubsurface,\n22"

In addition, we may acquire\nacreage without any warranty of title except as to claims made by, through or under the transferor.\nWhen we acquire properties, we will generally have potential exposure to liabilities and costs for environmental and other problems existing on the acquired properties, and\nthese liabilities may exceed our estimates. We may not be entitled to contractual indemnification associated with acquired properties. We may acquire interests in properties on an “as\nis” basis with limited or no remedies for breaches of representations and warranties.\nTherefore, we could incur significant unknown liabilities, including environmental liabilities or losses due to title defects, in connection with acquisitions for which we have\nlimited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage. In addition, the acquisition of undeveloped acreage is subject to many inherent risks, and we may not be able to realize\nefficiently, or at all, the assumed or expected economic benefits of acreage that we acquire.\nIn addition, acquiring additional natural gas and oil properties, or businesses that own or operate such properties, when attractive opportunities arise is a significant component\nof our strategy, and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to negotiate mutually\nacceptable terms with the seller, finance the acquisition or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. It may be difficult to agree on the economic terms of a transaction, as a potential\nseller may be unwilling to accept a price that we believe to be appropriately reflective of prevailing economic conditions. If we are unable to complete suitable acquisitions, it will be\nmore difficult to pursue our overall strategy.\nNatural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time may have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our natural gas or oil\noperating activities.\nThe revenues, operating results and profitability of our natural gas or oil operating activities will depend significantly on the prices we receive for the natural gas or oil we\nsell. We will require substantial expenditures to replace reserves, sustain production and fund our business plans. Low natural gas or oil prices can negatively affect the amount of cash\navailable for acquisitions and capital expenditures and our ability to raise additional capital and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flow and\nreserves. In addition, low natural gas or oil prices may result in write-downs of our natural gas or oil properties, such as the $81.1 million impairment charge we incurred in 2020.\nConversely, any substantial or extended increase in the price of natural gas would adversely affect the competitiveness of LNG as a source of energy (as discussed above in “ — Risks\nRelating to Our LNG Business — Failure of exported LNG to be a competitive source of energy for international markets could adversely affect our customers and could materially\nand adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects”. Part of our strategy involves adjusting the level of our natural\ngas development activities based on our judgment as to the most cost-effective manner in which to source natural gas for the Driftwood terminal. In some circumstances, making these\nadjustments may involve costs. For example, a decrease in our activities may result in the expiration of leases or an increase in costs on a per-unit basis.\nHistorically, the markets for natural gas and oil have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in natural gas or oil prices may result from\nrelatively minor changes in the supply of or demand for natural gas or oil, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control. The volatility of the energy markets makes\nit extremely difficult to predict future natural gas or oil price movements, and we will be unable to fully hedge our exposure to natural gas or oil prices.\nSignificant capital expenditures will be required to grow our natural gas or oil operating activities in accordance with our plans.\nOur planned development and acquisition activities will require substantial capital expenditures. We intend to fund our capital expenditures for our natural gas and oil\noperating activities through cash on hand and financing transactions that may include public or private equity or debt offerings or borrowings under additional debt agreements. Our\nability to generate operating cash flow in the future will be subject to a number of risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, the price of natural gas or oil,\nour success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed in this section. If we are unable to fund our capital expenditures for natural gas or oil\noperating activities as planned, we could experience a curtailment of our development activity and a decline in our natural gas or oil production, and that could affect our ability to\npursue our overall strategy.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nSome of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to\ninfluence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital\nexpenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their\ncontractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. In addition, a third-party operator could\n23"

For\nour non-operated properties, we will be dependent on the operator for regulatory compliance and for the management of these risks.\nThese risks could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses by reducing production from wells, causing wells to be shut in or otherwise negatively impacting\nour projected economic performance. If any of these risks occurs, we could sustain substantial losses as a result of:\n•\ninjury or loss of life;\n•\nsevere damage to or destruction of property, natural resources or equipment;\n•\npollution or other environmental damage;\n•\nfacility or equipment malfunctions and equipment failures or accidents;\n•\nclean-up responsibilities;\n•\nregulatory investigations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties; and\n•\ninjunctions resulting in limitation or suspension of operations.\nAny of these events could expose us to liabilities, monetary penalties or interruptions in our business operations. In addition, certain of these risks are greater for us than for\nmany of our competitors in that some of the natural gas we produce has a high sulphur content (sometimes referred to as “sour” gas), which increases its corrosiveness and the risk of\nan accidental release of hydrogen sulfide gas, exposure to which can be fatal. We may not maintain insurance against such risks, and some risks are not insurable. Even when we are\ninsured, our insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities. Also, in the future, we may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase.\nThe occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured may expose us to liabilities.\nOur drilling efforts may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns and our reserve estimates are based on assumptions that may not be accurate.\nDrilling for natural gas and oil may involve unprofitable efforts from wells that are either unproductive or productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to\ncover drilling, completion, operating and other costs. In addition, even a commercial well may have production that is less, or costs that are greater, than we projected. The cost of\ndrilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property. Drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or\ncanceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions, equipment failures or accidents, shortages of equipment or personnel, environmental issues and for other reasons. Natural gas\nand oil reserve engineering requires estimates of underground accumulations of hydrocarbons and assumptions concerning future prices, production rates and operating and\ndevelopment costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect. Our\nestimates of proved reserves are determined based in part on costs at the date of the estimate. Any significant variance from these costs could greatly affect our estimates of reserves. At\nDecember 31, 2022, approximately 51% of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflected our plans to make significant capital\nexpenditures to convert our PUDs into proved developed reserves. The estimated development costs may not be accurate, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not\nbe as estimated. If we choose not to develop PUDs, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our\nreported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC’s reserve reporting rules, PUDs generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of\nthe date of booking, and we may therefore be required to reclassify to probable or possible any PUDs that are not developed within this five-year time frame.\n24"

These laws and regulations govern the following,\namong other things:\n•\nconduct of drilling, completion, production and midstream activities;\n•\namounts and types of emissions and discharges;\n•\ngeneration, management, and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials;\n•\nreclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites; and\n•\nremediation of contaminated sites.\nIn addition, these laws and regulations may result in substantial liabilities for our failure to comply or for any contamination resulting from our operations, including the\nassessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the\noccurrence of delays in the development of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations change frequently, and these changes are difficult to predict or anticipate. Future environmental laws and regulations imposing further\nrestrictions on the emission of pollutants into the air, discharges into state or U.S. waters, wastewater disposal and hydraulic fracturing, or the designation of previously unprotected\nspecies as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate, may negatively impact our natural gas or oil production. We cannot predict the actions that future regulation will require\nor prohibit, but our business and operations could be subject to increased operating and compliance costs if certain regulatory proposals are adopted. In addition, such regulations may\nhave an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nFederal, state or local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nLaws or regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations are proposed from\ntime to time at the federal, state and local levels. Regulatory bodies and others from time to time assess, among other things, the risks of groundwater contamination and earthquakes\ncaused by hydraulic fracturing and other exploration and production activities. Depending on the outcome of these assessments, federal and state legislatures and agencies may seek to\nfurther regulate or even ban such activities, as some state and local governments have already done. We cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations\napplicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. If additional levels of regulation or\npermitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations, our business and operations could be subject to delays, increased operating and compliance costs and process\nprohibitions. Among other things, this could adversely affect the cost to produce natural gas, either by us or by third-party suppliers, and therefore LNG, and this could adversely affect\nthe competitiveness of LNG relative to other sources of energy.\nWe expect to drill the locations we acquire over a multi-year period, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of drilling.\nOur management team has identified certain well locations on our natural gas properties. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties,\nincluding natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations,\ngathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these\nfactors, we do not know if the well locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas from these or any other potential locations.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and services could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans within budgeted\namounts and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field and technical personnel to conduct our operations can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with hydrocarbon prices. The\nprice of services and equipment may increase in the future and availability may decrease.\nIn addition, it is possible that oil prices could increase without a corresponding increase in natural gas prices, which could lead to increased demand and prices for equipment,\nfacilities and personnel without an increase in the price at which we\n25"

Capital constraints and public opposition to\nprojects could limit the construction of new infrastructure by us and third parties.

Such an event could reduce\nour production or result in other adverse effects on our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Business in General\nWe are pursuing a strategy of participating in multiple aspects of the natural gas business, which exposes us to risks.\nWe plan to develop, own and operate a global natural gas business and to deliver natural gas to customers worldwide. We may not be successful in executing our strategy in\nthe near future, or at all. Our management will be required to understand and manage a diverse set of business opportunities, which may distract their focus and make it difficult to be\nsuccessful in increasing value for shareholders.\nTellurian will be subject to risks related to doing business in, and having counterparties based in, foreign countries.\nTellurian may engage in operations or make substantial commitments and investments, or enter into agreements with counterparties, located outside the U.S., which would\nexpose Tellurian to political, governmental, and economic instability, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and corruption risk.\nAny disruption caused by these factors could harm Tellurian’s business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects. Risks associated with operations,\ncommitments and investments outside of the U.S. include but are not limited to risks of:\n•\ncurrency fluctuations;\n•\nwar or terrorist attack;\n•\nexpropriation or nationalization of assets;\n•\nrenegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;\n•\nchanging political conditions;\n•\nchanging laws and policies affecting trade, taxation, and investment;\n•\nmultiple taxation due to different tax structures;\n•\ncompliance with laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, and with U.S. laws and regulations related to foreign operations;\n•\ngeneral hazards associated with the assertion of sovereignty over areas in which operations are conducted; and\n•\nthe unexpected credit rating downgrade of countries in which Tellurian’s LNG customers are based.\nBecause Tellurian’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, any of the operations conducted outside the U.S. or denominated in foreign currencies would face additional risks of\nfluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. In addition, Tellurian would be subject to the impact of foreign currency\nfluctuations and exchange rate changes on its financial reports when translating the value of its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses from operations outside of the U.S. into U.S.\ndollars at then-applicable exchange rates. These translations could result in changes to the results of operations from period to period.\nPotential legislative and regulatory actions addressing climate change, public views about climate change and the physical effects of climate change could significantly impact us.\nIn recent years, various federal and state governments and regional organizations have enacted or proposed new legislation and regulations governing or restricting the\nemission of GHGs, including GHG emissions from oil and natural gas production equipment and facilities. At the federal level, for example, the EPA has issued regulations that require\nGHG emissions reporting for the Driftwood Project and related operations and proposed new regulations regarding methane emissions from our operations.

The potential increase in our\noperating costs could include new or increased costs to obtain permits, operate and maintain our equipment and facilities, install new emission controls on our equipment and facilities,\nacquire allowances to authorize our GHG emissions, pay taxes related to our GHG emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program. Even without additional federal\nlegislation or regulation of GHG emissions, states and other governmental authorities may impose these requirements either directly or indirectly. For example, many states and other\ngovernmental authorities have set specific targets for future GHG reductions or created renewable portfolio standards that require the procurement of certain amounts of renewable\nenergy.\nMany scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as\nhigher sea levels, increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, and other climatic events. Such effects could adversely affect our facilities and operations, and have an\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, adverse weather events may accelerate changes in laws and regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions,\nwhich could result in declining demand for natural gas and LNG, and could adversely affect our business generally. In addition, many customers are focusing more on sustainability\nand the environmental impacts of operations of companies. An inability to respond to potential customer demands with respect to these issues could have an impact on our financial\nresults. Furthermore, some governmental or business entities have set voluntary carbon emissions targets or are otherwise subject to regulatory limits on their carbon emissions. Any of\nthese developments could result in less demand for our products and, in turn, affect our financial results.\nFor additional information on recent regulatory changes relating to climate change, please refer to Item 1, Governmental Regulations.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.\nTellurian is subject to extensive federal, state and local health and safety regulations and laws. Health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our\nbusiness. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in personal harm or injury, penalties for non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations or litigation, and a failure\nthat results in a significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities. Such a failure could generate public concern and have a corresponding impact\non our reputation and our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies and local communities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial\ncondition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nA terrorist attack or military incident could result in delays in, or cancellation of, construction or closure of our facilities or other disruption to our business.\nA terrorist or military incident could disrupt our business. For example, an incident involving an LNG carrier or LNG facility may result in delays in, or cancellation of,\nconstruction of new LNG facilities, including our proposed LNG facilities, which would increase our costs and decrease our cash flows. A terrorist incident may also result in the\ntemporary or permanent closure of Tellurian facilities or operations, which could increase costs and decrease cash flows, depending on the duration of the closure. Our operations could\nalso become subject to increased governmental scrutiny that may result in additional security measures at a significant incremental cost. In addition, the threat of terrorism and the\nimpact of military campaigns may lead to continued volatility in prices for natural gas or oil that could adversely affect Tellurian’s business and customers, including by impairing the\nability of Tellurian’s suppliers or customers to satisfy their respective obligations under Tellurian’s commercial agreements.\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used in our business may adversely impact our operations.\nWe depend on digital technology in many aspects of our business, including the processing and recording of financial and operating data, analysis of information, and\ncommunications with our employees and third parties. Cyber-attacks on our systems and those of third-party vendors and other counterparties occur frequently and have grown in\nsophistication. A successful cyber-attack on us or a vendor or other counterparty could have a variety of adverse consequences, including theft of proprietary or commercially sensitive\ninformation, data corruption, interruption in communications, disruptions to our existing or planned activities or transactions, and damage to third parties, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on us. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our\nprotective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks.\n27"

Should such persons be\nunable to perform their duties on behalf of Tellurian, or should Tellurian be unable to retain or attract other members of management, Tellurian’s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition, liquidity and prospects could be materially impacted.\nAdditionally, we are dependent upon an available labor pool of skilled employees. We will compete with other energy companies and other employers to attract and retain\nqualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to construct and operate our facilities and to provide our customers with the highest quality service. A shortage of\nskilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and\ncould require an increase in the wage and benefits packages that we offer, or increases in the amounts we are obligated to pay our contractors, thereby increasing our operating costs.\nAny increase in our operating costs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nCompetition is intense in the energy industry and some of Tellurian’s competitors have greater financial, technological and other resources.\nTellurian plans to operate in various aspects of the natural gas and oil business and will face intense competition in each area. Depending on the area of operations,\ncompetition may come from independent, technology-driven companies, large, established companies and others.\nFor example, many competing companies have secured access to, or are pursuing the development or acquisition of, LNG facilities to serve the North American natural gas\nmarket, including other proposed liquefaction facilities in North America. Tellurian may face competition from major energy companies and others in pursuing its proposed business\nstrategy to provide liquefaction and export products and services at its proposed Driftwood terminal. In addition, competitors have developed and are developing additional LNG\nterminals in other markets, which will also compete with our proposed LNG facilities.\nAs another example, our business will face competition in, among other things, buying and selling reserves and leases and obtaining goods and services needed to operate\nproperties and market natural gas and oil. Competitors include multinational oil companies, independent production companies and individual producers and operators.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger staffs and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than\nTellurian currently possesses. The superior resources that some of these competitors have available for deployment could allow them to compete successfully against Tellurian, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on Tellurian’s business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nITEM 1B.

(“Tellurian,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a Houston-based company that is developing and plans to operate a portfolio of\nnatural gas, LNG marketing, and infrastructure assets that includes an LNG terminal facility (the “Driftwood terminal”), an associated pipeline (the “Driftwood pipeline”), other\nrelated pipelines, and upstream natural gas assets (collectively referred to as the “Business”). The Driftwood terminal and the Driftwood pipeline are collectively referred to as the\n“Driftwood Project.” As of December 31, 2022, our upstream natural gas assets consist of 27,689 net acres and interests in 143 producing wells located in the Haynesville Shale trend\nof northern Louisiana. Our Business may be developed in phases.\nAs part of our execution strategy, which includes increasing our asset base, we will consider various commercial arrangements with third parties across the natural gas value\nchain. We are also pursuing activities such as direct sales of LNG to global counterparties, trading of LNG, the acquisition of additional upstream acreage and drilling of new wells on\nour existing or newly acquired upstream acreage. We remain focused on the financing and construction of the Driftwood Project and related pipelines while managing our upstream\nassets.\nWe manage and report our operations in three reportable segments. The Upstream segment is organized and operates to produce, gather, and deliver natural gas and to acquire\nand develop natural gas assets. The Midstream segment is organized to develop, construct and operate LNG terminals and pipelines. The Marketing & Trading segment is organized\nand operates to purchase and sell natural gas produced primarily by the Upstream segment, market the Driftwood terminal’s LNG production capacity and trade LNG.\nWe continue to evaluate the scope and other aspects of our Business in light of the evolving economic environment, dynamics of the global political landscape, needs of\npotential counterparties and other factors. How we execute our Business will be based on a variety of factors, including the results of our continuing analysis, changing business\nconditions and market feedback.\nOverview of Significant Events\nLimited Notice to Proceed\nOn March 24, 2022, the Company issued a limited notice to proceed to Bechtel Energy Inc., formerly known as Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc. (“Bechtel”), under our\nLSTK EPC agreement for Phase 1 of the Driftwood terminal dated as of November 10, 2017 (the “Phase 1 EPC Agreement”). The Company commenced construction of Phase 1 of the\nDriftwood terminal on April 4, 2022.\nSenior Secured Convertible Notes due 2025\nOn June 3, 2022, we issued and sold $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Secured Convertible Notes due May 1, 2025 (the “Convertible Notes”). Net\nproceeds from the Convertible Notes were approximately $488.7 million after deducting fees and expenses.\nUpstream Asset Acquisition\nOn August 18, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of certain natural gas assets in the Haynesville Shale basin. The purchase price of $125.0 million was subject to\ncustomary adjustments totaling approximately $8.8 million, for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $133.8 million.\nEnvironmental, Social, Governance Practices\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into a pledge with the National Forest Foundation on a five-year plan for reforestation and other forest\nmanagement projects totaling $25.0 million across the United States. In 2022, the Company supported the planting of more than one million trees on 1,441 acres across the United\nStates and bolstered nursery capacity by 1 million seedlings.\nUpstream Natural Gas Drilling Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we put in production 13 operated Haynesville wells and participated in four non-operated Haynesville wells that were put in\nproduction.\n31"

Our current capital resources consist of approximately\n$474.2 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 on a consolidated basis. We currently maintain an at-the-market equity offering program pursuant to which we\nmay sell our common stock from time to time. As of the date of this filing, we have availability to raise aggregate gross sales proceeds of $500.0 million under this at-the-market equity\noffering program.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had total indebtedness of approximately $557.7 million, of which approximately $166.7 million is subject to redemption at the sole discretion of\nholders of the Convertible Notes on May 1, 2023. The holders of the Convertible Notes may also redeem up to an additional $166.7 million on May 1, 2024. We also had contractual\nobligations associated with our finance and operating leases totaling $215.8 million, of which $7.7 million is scheduled to be paid within the next twelve months.\nThe Company has sufficient cash on hand and available liquidity to satisfy its obligations and fund its working capital needs for at least twelve months following the date of\nissuance of the consolidated financial statements.

The\ndecrease in our consolidated Net loss was partially offset by an overall increase in disbursements in the normal course of business.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by approximately $507.7 million compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was\nprimarily due to increased spending on natural gas acquisition and development activities of approximately $344.8 million in the current period, as compared to approximately $32.4\nmillion in the prior period. This increase was also due to the funding of Driftwood Project construction activities of approximately $175.8 million and Driftwood Project land\npurchases and land improvements of approximately $23.5 million in the current period.\nSee Note 4, Property, plant and equipment, of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our investing activities.\nCash provided by financing activities increased by approximately $444.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. This\nincrease was primarily due to higher net proceeds from borrowing transactions of approximately $436.0 million in the current period as compared to the same period of 2021 and the\nabsence of principal repayments of borrowings of approximately $119.7 million which were completed during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was partially offset by\nan overall decrease in net proceeds from equity issuances of $108.1 million in the current period as compared to the prior period.\nSee Note 10, Borrowings and Note 12, Stockholders’ Equity, of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our financing activities.\n32"

      "text": "Capital Development Activities\nThe activities we have proposed will require significant amounts of capital and are subject to completion risks and delays. We have received all regulatory approvals for the\nconstruction of Phase 1 of the Driftwood terminal and, as a result, our business success will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to obtain the funding necessary to construct\nassets on a commercially viable basis and to finance the costs of staffing, operating and expanding our company during that process. In March 2022, we issued a limited notice to\nproceed to Bechtel under our Phase 1 EPC Agreement and commenced the construction of Phase 1 of the Driftwood terminal in April 2022.\nWe currently estimate the total cost of the Driftwood Project as well as related pipelines to be approximately $25.0 billion, including owners’ costs, transaction costs and\ncontingencies but excluding interest costs incurred during construction and other financing costs. The proposed Driftwood terminal will have a liquefaction capacity of up to\napproximately 27.6 Mtpa and will be situated on approximately 1,200 acres in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. The proposed Driftwood terminal will include up to 20 liquefaction Trains,\nthree full containment LNG storage tanks and three marine berths.\nOur strategy involves acquiring additional natural gas properties, including properties in the Haynesville shale basin. We intend to pursue potential acquisitions of such assets,\nor public or private companies that own such assets. We expect to use stock, cash on hand, or cash raised in financing transactions to complete an acquisition of this type.\nWe anticipate funding our more immediate liquidity requirements for the construction of the Driftwood terminal, natural gas activities, and general and administrative\nexpenses through the use of cash on hand, proceeds from operations, and proceeds from completed and future issuances of securities by us. Investments in the construction of the\nDriftwood terminal and natural gas development are and will continue to be significant, but the size of those investments will depend on, among other things, commodity prices,\nDriftwood Project financing developments and other liquidity considerations, and our continuing analysis of strategic risks and opportunities. Consistent with our overall financing\nstrategy, the Company has considered, and in some cases discussed with investors, various potential financing transactions, including issuances of debt, equity and equity-linked\nsecurities or similar transactions, to support its capital requirements. The Company will continue to evaluate its cash needs and business outlook, and it may execute one or more\ntransactions of this type in the future.\n33"

      "text": "Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this\nreport. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions we believe to be reasonable according to current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We considered the following to be our most critical accounting estimates\nthat involve significant judgment:\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\nWhen there are indicators that our proved natural gas properties carrying value may not be recoverable, we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows at a\ndepreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on our estimates of (and\nassumptions regarding) future natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the\nunamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the income approach in accordance with GAAP. Estimates of\nundiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment, and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain. The impairment review includes cash flows\nfrom proved developed and undeveloped reserves, including any development expenditures necessary to achieve that production. Additionally, when probable and possible reserves\nexist, an appropriate risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment calculation. In addition, such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change\nin the future.\nProved reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and condensate that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in\nfuture years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used\nthroughout our financial statements. For example, because we use the units-of-production method to deplete our natural gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly\nimpact our DD&A expense. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Finally, these reserves are the basis for\nour supplemental natural gas disclosures. See Item 1 and 2 — Our Business and Properties for additional information on our estimate of proved reserves.\nShare-Based Compensation    \nShare-based compensation transactions are measured based on the grant-date estimated fair value. For awards containing only service conditions or performance conditions\ndeemed probable of occurring, the fair value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. We recognize compensation cost for awards with\nperformance conditions if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. For awards where the performance or market condition is not\nconsidered probable, compensation cost is not recognized until the performance or market condition becomes probable. We reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period\nfor awards with performance conditions and adjust compensation cost based on our probability assessment. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nWe do not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial\nStatements or related disclosures.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe primary market risk relating to our financial instruments is the volatility in market prices for our natural gas production. We use financial instruments to reduce cash flow\nvariability due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas. The market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale of the production that is financially\nprotected. Refer to Note 7, Financial Instruments, of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details about our financial instruments and\ntheir fair value. To quantify the sensitivity of the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments to changes in underlying commodity prices, management modeled a 10% increase\nand decrease in the commodity price for natural gas prices, as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2022\n10% Increase\n10% Decrease\nNatural Gas Financial Instruments\n$\n10,463 \n$\n7,711 \n$\n13,446 \n36"

      "text": "REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Tellurian Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tellurian Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated\nstatements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n\"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to\nthe audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nProved Natural Gas Properties and Depletion – Natural Gas Reserves – Refer to Note 2 and 4 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s proved natural gas properties are depleted using the units-of-production method based upon natural gas reserves. The development of the Company’s natural gas\nreserve quantities requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The Company engages an independent reservoir engineer, management’s specialist, to estimate\nnatural gas quantities using generally accepted methods, calculation procedures and engineering data. Changes in assumptions or engineering data could have a significant impact on\nthe amount of depletion. Proved natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation were $320.6 million as of December 31, 2022, and depletion expense was $43.8 million for the\nyear then ended.\nGiven the significant judgments made by management and management’s specialist, performing audit procedures to evaluate the Company’s natural gas reserve quantities, including\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions related to the five-year development rule, natural gas prices, and capital expenditures requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an\nincreased extent of effort.\n38"

(“Tellurian,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a Houston-based company that is developing and plans to operate a portfolio of\nnatural gas, LNG marketing, and infrastructure assets that includes an LNG terminal facility (the “Driftwood terminal”), an associated pipeline (the “Driftwood pipeline”), other\nrelated pipelines, and upstream natural gas assets (collectively referred to as the “Business”).\nThe terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Tellurian” and the “Company” as used in this report refer collectively to Tellurian Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context suggests otherwise.\nThese terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any separate legal entity associated with Tellurian Inc.\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Tellurian Inc. and its\nwholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to conform prior period information to the current presentation. The reclassifications did not have a material effect on our\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nLiquidity\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal\ncourse of business as well as the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. As of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have generated losses and negative\ncash flows from operations, and have an accumulated deficit. We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues that is sufficient to cover our future operating costs and\nobligations as they become due during the twelve months following the issuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company has sufficient cash on hand and available liquidity to satisfy its obligations and fund its working capital needs for at least twelve months following the date of\nissuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has the ability to generate additional proceeds from various other potential financing transactions. We remain focused\non the financing and construction of the Driftwood Project and related pipelines while managing our upstream assets.\nSegments\nSegment information is prepared on the same basis that our Chief Executive Officer, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker, uses to manage the segments, evaluate\nfinancial results and make key operating decisions. We identified the Upstream, Midstream and Marketing & Trading components as the Company’s operating segments. These\noperating segments represent the Company’s reportable segments. The remainder of our business is presented as “Corporate,” and consists of corporate costs and intersegment\neliminations.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Management evaluates its estimates and related assumptions on a regular basis. Changes in facts and circumstances or\nadditional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates.\nFair Value\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The\nCompany uses three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets\nor liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that\nare not observable in the market.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor the sale of natural gas, we consider the delivery of each unit (MMBtu) to be a separate performance obligation that is satisfied upon delivery to the designated sales point\nand therefore is recognized at a point in time. These contracts are either fixed price contracts or contracts with a fixed differential to an index price, both of which are deemed fixed\nconsideration that is allocated to each performance obligation and represents the relative standalone selling price basis.\n44"

      "text": "TELLURIAN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEach LNG cargo, in its entirety, is deemed to be a single performance obligation due to each molecule of LNG being distinct and substantially the same and therefore meeting\nthe criteria for the transfer of a series of distinct goods. Accordingly, LNG sales are recognized at a point in time when the LNG has completed discharging to the customer. These are\ncontracts with a fixed differential to an index price, which is deemed fixed consideration that is allocated to each performance obligation and represents the relative standalone selling\nprice basis. These LNG sales are recorded on a gross basis and reported in “LNG sales” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nPurchases and sales of LNG inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and\nrecorded on a net basis and reported in “LNG sales” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For such LNG sales, we require payment within 10 days from delivery. We exclude\nall taxes from the measurement of the transaction price.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company’s receivables consist primarily of trade receivables from natural gas sales and joint interest billings due from owners on properties the Company operates. The\nmajority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less. The Company generally has the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover non-payment of joint\ninterest billings for receivables due from joint interest owners. The Company’s historical credit losses have been de minimis and are expected to remain so in the future assuming no\nsubstantial changes to the business or creditworthiness of the Company’s counterparties.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to\nwithdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements are recorded in Non-current restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value of cash, cash\nequivalents and restricted cash approximates their fair value.\nConcentration of Cash\nWe maintain cash balances and restricted cash at financial institutions, which may, at times, be in excess of federally insured levels. We have not incurred losses related to\nthese balances to date.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to cash flow variability from commodity price risk. Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and included in our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities, depending on the derivative position and the expected timing of settlement, unless they satisfy the criteria for and we elect the\nnormal purchases and sales exception.\nWe have not elected and do not apply hedge accounting for our derivative instruments; therefore, all changes in fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments are\nrecognized within Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Settlements of derivative instruments are reported as a component of cash flows from operations in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nNatural gas development and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs incurred to acquire a property (whether proved\nor unproved) are capitalized when incurred. Costs to develop proved reserves are capitalized and our natural gas reserves are depleted using the units-of-production method.\nFixed assets are recorded at cost. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment, excluding land, using the straight-line depreciation method over the estimated useful life of\nthe asset. Upon retirement or other disposition of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed, and the resulting gains or losses are\nrecorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nManagement tests property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment might not be\nrecoverable. The carrying values of our proved natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. If there is an indication that the carrying amount of our proved natural gas properties may not be recoverable, we compare the estimated expected undiscounted future\ncash flows from our natural gas properties to the carrying values of those properties. Proved properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future undiscounted cash\nflows are written down to fair value.\n45"

      "text": "TELLURIAN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLeases\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and subsequent amendments thereto (“ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019 using the\noptional transition approach to apply the standard at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019 with no retrospective adjustments to prior periods. We elected the transition package of\npractical expedients to carry-forward prior conclusions related to lease identification and classification for existing leases, combine lease and non-lease components of an arrangement\nfor all classes of our leased assets and omit short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less from recognition on the balance sheet.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases are recognized as either finance or operating leases on our Consolidated Balance Sheets by\nrecording a lease liability representing the obligation to make future lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Refer\nto Note 17 - Leases for operating and finance right-of-use assets and lease liabilities classification within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the absence of a readily determinable\nimplicitly interest rate, we discount our expected future lease payments using our incremental borrowing rate. Options to renew a lease are included in the lease term and recognized as\npart of the right-of-use asset and lease liability, only to the extent they are reasonably certain to be exercised.\nLease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense for finance leases is recognized as the sum of the\namortization of the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis and the interest on lease liabilities over the lease term.\nAccounting for LNG Development Activities\nAs we have been in the preliminary stage of developing the Driftwood terminal, substantially all the costs related to such activities have been expensed. These costs primarily\ninclude professional fees associated with FEED studies and complying with FERC for authorization to construct our terminal and other required permitting for the Driftwood Project.\nCosts incurred in connection with a project to develop the Driftwood terminal shall generally be treated as development expenses until the project has reached the notice-to-\nproceed state (“NTP State”) and the following criteria (the “NTP Criteria”) have been met: (i) the necessary regulatory permits have been obtained, (ii) financing for the project has\nbeen secured and (iii) management has committed to commence construction.\nIn addition, certain costs incurred prior to achieving the NTP State will be capitalized although the NTP Criteria have not been met. Costs to be capitalized prior to achieving\nthe NTP State include land purchase costs, land improvement costs, costs associated with preparing the facility for use, direct payroll and payroll benefit-related costs and any fixed\nstructure construction costs (fence, storage areas, drainage, etc.). Furthermore, activities directly associated with detailed engineering and/or facility designs shall be capitalized.\nInterest is capitalized in connection with the construction of major facilities. All amounts capitalized are periodically assessed for impairment and may be impaired if indicators are\npresent.\nPrior to reaching the NTP State, costs incurred to complete construction activities necessary to proceed under our LSTK EPC agreement with Bechtel are capitalized as\nconstruction in progress when the following criteria are met: (i) costs incurred are directly identifiable, (ii) necessary regulatory permits are secured, (iii) funding for the scope of work\nis available, and (iv) construction activities are creditable under the LSTK EPC agreement.\nPrior to reaching the NTP State, costs incurred to complete construction activities necessary to develop the Driftwood pipeline and other related pipelines are capitalized as\nconstruction in progress when the following criteria are met: (i) costs incurred are directly identifiable, (ii) necessary regulatory permits are secured, and (iii) funding for the scope of\nwork is available.\nDebt\nDiscounts, fees and expenses incurred with the issuance of debt are amortized over the term of the debt. These amounts are presented as a reduction of our indebtedness on the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 10, Borrowings, for additional details about our loans.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe have awarded share-based compensation in the form of stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options to employees, directors and outside consultants.\nShare-based compensation transactions are measured based on the grant-date estimated fair value.

We recognize forfeitures as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences\nof events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the financial\nstatement and tax basis of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be realized or settled. The effect of a change in\ntax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider current and\nhistorical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. If\nwe determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we will make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset\nvaluation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nPost employment benefits\nThe Company provides cash and other termination benefits pursuant to ongoing benefit arrangements to its employees in connection with a qualifying termination of their\nemployment. The cost of providing post employment benefits is recognized when the obligation is probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated.\nNet Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\nloss per share reflects potential dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased by the\nnumber of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and were dilutive.\nNOTE 3 — PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\n    Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\nPrepaid expenses\n$\n2,174 \n$\n605 \nDeposits\n172 \n2,268 \nRestricted cash\n9,375 \n— \nDerivative asset, net - current (Note 7)\n10,463 \n8,693 \nOther current assets\n1,171 \n1,386 \nTotal prepaid expenses and other current assets\n$\n23,355 \n$\n12,952 \nDeposits\nMargin deposits posted with a third-party financial institution related to our financial instrument contracts were approximately $0.1  million and $2.1  million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash as of December 31, 2022 consists of approximately $9.4 million held in escrow under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement for the acquisition of\ncertain natural gas assets in the Haynesville Shale.

(“Bechtel”), for Phase 1 of the Driftwood terminal. On March 24, 2022, the Company issued a limited notice to\nproceed (“LNTP”) to Bechtel under the Phase 1 EPC Agreement and commenced construction of Phase 1 of the Driftwood terminal on April 4, 2022. As the Company commenced\nconstruction activities, Deferred engineering costs and Permitting costs of approximately $110.0 million and $13.4 million, respectively, were transferred to construction in progress as\nof March 31, 2022.

Land purchase options held by the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2022 are related to the Driftwood pipeline.\nPermitting Costs\nPermitting costs primarily represent the purchase of wetland credits in connection with our permit application to the USACE in 2017, which was supplemented in 2018. The\npermit was issued on May 3, 2019 (the “Permit”). These wetland credits were transferred to construction in progress upon issuing the limited notice to proceed to Bechtel in March\n2022. See Note 4, Property, Plant and Equipment, for further information. The purchase of these wetland credits was a condition of the Permit in accordance with the Clean Water Act\nand the Rivers and Harbors Act, which requires us to mitigate the potential impact to Louisiana wetlands that might be caused by the construction of the Driftwood Project.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, represents the cash collateralization of letters of credit associated with finance leases.\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Entities\nOn February 24, 2022, the Company purchased 1.5 million ordinary shares of an unaffiliated entity that provides renewable energy services.

This investment does not provide the Company with a controlling financial interest in or significant influence over the operating or financial decisions\nof the unaffiliated entity. The Company’s investment was recorded at cost.\nNote Receivable\nThe Company issued an amended and restated $6.6 million promissory note due June 14, 2024 (the “Promissory Note”) to an unaffiliated entity (the “Borrower”) engaged in\nthe development of infrastructure projects in the energy industry. The Promissory Note is collateralized by a secondary interest in the Borrower’s rights to certain land lease\nagreements. The Promissory Note bears interest at a rate of 6.00%, which will be capitalized into the outstanding principal balance annually.\nNOTE 7 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nNatural Gas Financial Instruments\nThe primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to cash flow variability from commodity price risk due to fluctuations in\ncommodity prices. The Company uses natural gas financial futures and option contracts to economically hedge the commodity price risks associated with a portion of our expected\nnatural gas production. The Company’s open positions as of December 31, 2022 had notional volumes of approximately 9.8 Bcf, with maturities extending through October 2023.\n49"

At any time after “Substantial Completion” of “Project 1,” each as defined in and\npursuant to the LSTK EPC Agreement for the Driftwood LNG Phase 1 Liquefaction Facility, dated as of November 10, 2017, or at any time after March 21, 2028, we have the right to\ncause all of the Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis. The Preferred Stock has been excluded from the computation of diluted loss\nper share because including it in the computation would have been antidilutive for the periods presented.\nNOTE 13 — 2020 SEVERANCE AND REORGANIZATION\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we implemented a cost reduction and reorganization plan due to the sharp decline in oil and natural gas prices as well as the negative\neconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We satisfied all amounts owed to former employees and incurred approximately $6.4 million of severance and reorganization charges\nduring the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEmployee Retention Plan\nIn July 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an employee retention incentive plan (the “Employee Retention Plan”) aggregating $12.0 million. The Employee\nRetention Plan was designed to vest in four equal installments upon the attainment of a ten-day average closing price of the Company’s common stock above $2.25, $3.25, $4.25 and\n$5.25 (the “Stock Performance Targets”). During the year ended December 31, 2021, three of the four installments vested and we recognized approximately $7.9 million in retention\ncharges within General and administrative expenses and Development expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, of which $3.6 million was paid during 2022. The plan\nexpired on March 31, 2022, and the fourth installment did not vest, as the final Stock Performance Target was not attained.\nNOTE 14 — SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe have granted restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, “Restricted Stock”), as well as unrestricted stock and stock options, to employees, directors and\noutside consultants under the Tellurian Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended (the “2016 Plan”), and the Amended and Restated Tellurian Investments Inc.\n2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Legacy Plan”). The maximum number of shares of Tellurian common stock authorized for issuance under the 2016 Plan is 40 million shares of\ncommon stock, and no further awards can be made under the Legacy Plan.\nFor the years ended December  31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, Tellurian recognized approximately $3.6 million, $6.0 million and $2.7 million, respectively, of share-based\ncompensation expense related to all share-based awards. As of December 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation expense, based on the grant date fair value, for all share-based awards\ntotaled approximately $179.7 million.\nRestricted Stock    \nAs of  December  31, 2022, we had approximately  27.4 million  shares of primarily performance-based Restricted Stock outstanding, of which\napproximately 15.7 million shares will vest entirely based upon an affirmative FID by the Company’s\n54"

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.    \nThere were no stock options exercised during any of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Further, the approximately 11.0 million stock options outstanding\nhave been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share because including them in the computation would have been antidilutive for the periods presented.\nNOTE 15 — INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM\nOn November 18, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of the Tellurian Incentive Compensation Program (the “Incentive Compensation Program”\nor “ICP”). The ICP allows the Company to award short-term and long-term performance and service-based incentive compensation to full-time employees of the Company. ICP awards\nmay be earned with respect to each calendar year and are determined based on guidelines established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, as administrator of\nthe ICP.\nShort-term incentive awards\nShort-term incentive (“STI”) awards are payable annually in cash at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. Compensation expense for STI awards is recognized\nover the performance period when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recognized\napproximately $15.7 million and $26.2 million, respectively, in compensation expenses for STI awards.\nLong-term incentive awards\nLong-term incentive (“LTI”) awards under the ICP were granted in January 2022 in the form of “tracking units,” at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors (the\n“2021 LTI Award”). Each such tracking unit has a value equal to one share of Tellurian common stock and entitles the grantee to receive, upon vesting, a cash payment equal to the\nclosing price of our common stock on the trading day prior to the vesting date. These tracking units will vest in three equal tranches at grant date, and the first and second anniversaries\nof the grant date. Non-vested tracking unit awards as of December 31, 2022, and awards granted during the period were as follows:\nNumber of Tracking Units\n(in thousands)\nPrice per Tracking Unit\nBalance at January 1, 2022\n— \n— \nGranted\n19,332 \n$\n3.09 \nVested\n(6,444)\n3.38 \nForfeited\n(169)\n3.40 \nUnvested balance at December 31, 2022\n12,719 \n$\n1.68 \nWe recognize compensation expense for awards with graded vesting schedules over the requisite service periods for each separately vesting portion of the award as if each\naward was in substance multiple awards. Compensation expense for the first tranche of the 2021 LTI Award that vested at the grant date was recognized over the performance period\nwhen it was probable that the performance condition was achieved. Compensation expense for the second and third tranches of the 2021 LTI Award is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the requisite service periods. Compensation expense for unvested tracking units is subsequently adjusted each reporting period to reflect the estimated payout levels based\non changes in the Company’s stock price and actual forfeitures. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $19.9 million in compensation expenses for LTI\nawards that have been earned over the 2021 performance period.\nAs of December 31, 2022, no tracking units for LTI awards had been granted under the ICP for the December 31, 2022 fiscal period. For the year ended December 31, 2022,\nwe recognized approximately $10.3 million in compensation expenses for LTI awards that have been earned over the 2022 performance period.\n56"

Approximately $495.9 million of these NOLs have an indefinite carryforward period. All other NOLs will expire between 2036 and 2040.\nDue to our historical losses and other available evidence related to our ability to generate taxable income, we have established a valuation allowance to fully offset our federal,\nstate and international deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. We will continue to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets in the future. The increase in the\nvaluation allowance was approximately $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn addition, we experienced a Section 382 ownership change in April 2017. An analysis of the annual limitation on the utilization of our NOLs was performed in accordance\nwith IRC Section 382. It was determined that IRC Section 382 will not materially limit the use of our NOLs over the carryover period. We will continue to monitor trading activity in\nour shares which could cause an additional ownership change. If the Company experiences a Section 382 ownership change, it could further affect our ability to utilize our existing\nNOL carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company determined that it has no uncertain tax positions, interest or penalties as defined within ASC 740-10. The Company does not have\nunrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the total unrecognized benefits will significantly increase within the next 12 months.\nWe are subject to tax in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Federal and state tax returns filed with each jurisdiction remain open to examination under the\nnormal three-year statute of limitations.\nPursuant to ASC 740-30-25-17, the Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities associated with outside basis differences on investments in foreign subsidiaries unless the\ndifference is considered essentially permanent in duration. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not recorded any deferred taxes on unremitted earnings as the Company has no\nundistributed earnings and profits. If circumstances change in the foreseeable future and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings and profits will not be\nreinvested indefinitely, or will be remitted in the foreseeable future, a deferred tax liability will be recorded for some or all of the outside basis difference.\n58"

The Company also\ncontinued to increase its natural gas presence in the Haynesville Shale basin in northern Louisiana through the acquisition of mineral rights and natural gas drilling and marketing\nactivities. The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) determined to place additional emphasis on operating cash flows generated by our upstream and natural gas\nmarketing business activities. Consequently, we identified the Upstream, Midstream and Marketing & Trading components as the Company’s operating segments. The Company’s\nprior period information was retrospectively revised to reflect this change in reportable segments.\nThese functions have been defined as the operating segments of the Company because (1) they are engaged in business activities from which revenues are recognized and\nexpenses are incurred, (2) their operating results are regularly reviewed by the Company’s CODM to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its\nperformance, and (3) they are segments for which discrete financial information is available.\nFactors used to identify these operating segments are based on the nature of the business activities that are undertaken by each component. The Upstream segment is\norganized and operates to produce, gather and deliver natural gas and to acquire and develop natural gas assets. The Midstream segment is organized to develop, construct and operate\nLNG terminals and pipelines. The Marketing & Trading segment is organized and operates to purchase and sell natural gas produced primarily by the Upstream segment, market the\nDriftwood terminal’s LNG production capacity and trade LNG. These operating segments represent the Company’s reportable segments. The remainder of our business is presented as\n“Corporate,” and consists of corporate costs and intersegment eliminations. The Company’s CODM does not currently assess segment performance or allocate resources based on a\nmeasure of total assets. Accordingly, a total asset measure has not been provided for segment disclosure.\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nUpstream\nMidstream\nMarketing &\nTrading\nCorporate\nConsolida\nRevenues from external customers \n$\n15,993 \n$\n— \n$\n375,933 \n$\n— \n$\n39\nIntersegment revenues (purchases) \n254,984 \n(1,760)\n(241,229)\n(11,995)\nSegment operating income (loss) \n130,663 \n(80,626)\n(31,192)\n(36,618)\n(1\nInterest expense, net\n— \n(1,751)\n(454)\n(11,655)\n(1\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net\n— \n— \n— \n— \nOther income (loss), net\n3,770 \n— \n(22,912)\n964 \n(1\nConsolidated loss before tax\n$\n(4\n(1)\n(2) (3)\n(4)\n61"

      "text": "TELLURIAN INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nTable V — Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Natural Gas Reserves\nASC 932 prescribes guidelines for computing a standardized measure of future net cash flows and changes therein relating to estimated proved reserves. Tellurian has\nfollowed these guidelines, which are briefly discussed below.\nFuture cash inflows and future production and development costs as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were determined by applying the average of the first-day-of-the-\nmonth prices for the 12 months of the year and year-end costs to the estimated quantities of natural gas and condensate to be produced. Actual future prices and costs may be materially\nhigher or lower than the prices and costs used. For each year, estimates are made of quantities of proved reserves and the future periods during which they are expected to be produced\nbased on the continuation of the economic conditions applied for that year. Estimated future income taxes are computed using current statutory income tax rates, including\nconsideration of the current tax basis of the properties and related carryforwards, giving effect to permanent differences and tax credits. The resulting future net cash flows are reduced\nto present value amounts by applying a 10% annual discount factor.\nThe assumptions used to compute the standardized measure are those prescribed by the FASB and do not necessarily reflect our expectations of actual revenue to be derived\nfrom those reserves or their present worth. The limitations inherent in the reserve quantity estimation process, as discussed previously, are equally applicable to the standardized\nmeasure computations since these estimates reflect the valuation process.\nThe following summary sets forth our future net cash flows relating to proved natural gas and condensate reserves based on the standardized measure (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nFuture cash inflows\n$\n2,441,930 \n$\n945,651 \n$\n132,563 \nFuture production costs\n(341,925)\n(133,909)\n(34,624)\nFuture development costs\n(360,107)\n(211,836)\n(71,557)\nFuture income tax provisions\n(257,908)\n(54,401)\n— \nFuture net cash flows\n1,481,990 \n545,505 \n26,382 \nLess effect of a 10% discount factor\n(445,686)\n(181,302)\n(19,497)\nStandardized measure of discounted future net cash flows\n$\n1,036,304 \n$\n364,203 \n$\n6,885 \n66"

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and\nthat receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 22, 2023\n69"

This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to these documents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue 800,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 100,000,000 shares\nof preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. As of February 7, 2023, 563,518,417 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and 6,123,782 Series C Preferred\nShares were issued and outstanding. The rights of the holders of our common stock and Series C Preferred Shares are governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the\n“DGCL”), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including the certificate of designations governing the Series C Preferred Shares, and our amended and\nrestated by-laws.\nCommon Stock\nVoting Rights\nHolders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Cumulative voting in the election of directors\nis not permitted. Under our amended and restated by-laws, unless otherwise provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the DGCL, the rules or\nregulations of any stock exchange applicable to us, or any law or regulation applicable to us or our securities with respect to a specified action, matters to be voted on by\nstockholders are generally decided by a majority of the votes cast, except that contested elections of directors will be decided by a plurality vote. Our amended and restated by-\nlaws provide that the presence at a stockholders’ meeting of one-third of the voting power of our outstanding stock entitled to vote at the meeting will constitute a quorum.\nDividend and Distribution Rights\nSubject to the provisions of any outstanding series of preferred stock, the holders of outstanding shares of our common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if\ndeclared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. As a Delaware corporation, we may pay dividends out of surplus or, if there is no\nsurplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which a dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of our\naffairs, subject to the provisions of any outstanding series of preferred stock, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to receive ratably our net assets available to the\nstockholders.\nPreemptive, Conversion and Redemption Rights\nHolders of our outstanding common stock have no conversion or redemption rights. In addition, holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights under the\nDGCL. To the extent that additional shares of our common stock may be issued in the future, the relative interests of the then-existing stockholders may be diluted."

Each such\nseries of preferred stock will consist of the number of shares and will have the powers, designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional and other rights, if any, or\nthe qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, if any, determined by resolution of our board of directors, and may include, among others, dividend rights, liquidation\nrights, voting rights, conversion rights and redemption rights.\nSeries C Convertible Preferred Stock\nVoting Rights\nHolders of the Series C Preferred Shares are entitled to one vote for each Series C Preferred Share held on matters submitted to a vote of common stockholders.\nConversion\nHolders of the Series C Preferred Shares may convert all or any portion of such shares for shares of Tellurian common stock on a one-for-one basis. At any time after\n“Substantial Completion” of “Project 1,” each as defined in and pursuant to the Lump Sum Turnkey Agreement for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction of the\nDriftwood LNG Phase 1 Liquefaction Facility, dated as of November 10, 2017, by and between Driftwood LNG LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a subsidiary of\nTellurian, and Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc.

The conversion ratio will be subject to customary\nanti-dilution adjustments.\nDividends\nThe Series C Preferred Shares do not have dividend rights. Tellurian will be prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock so long as the Series C Preferred\nShares remain outstanding.\nLiquidation\nIn the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of Tellurian (a “Liquidation Event”), after payment or provision for payment of the debts and\nother liabilities of Tellurian, holders of the Series C Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive the greater of (i) an amount in cash equal to $8.16489 per share and (ii) the\namount that would be received by the holders of the Series C Preferred Shares had such holders converted those shares into Tellurian common stock immediately prior to the\nLiquidation Event.\nPriority\nSo long as any Series C Preferred Shares remain outstanding, Tellurian may not, without the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the Series C Preferred\nShares, among other things, authorize the issuance of any class of shares that is pari passu with or senior to the Series C Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends or the\ndistribution of assets following a Liquidation Event.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws also contain provisions that we describe in the following paragraphs, which\nmay delay, defer, discourage, or prevent a change in control of us, the removal of our existing management or directors, or an offer by a potential acquirer to our\n2"

This ability makes it possible\nfor our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences designated by the board that could have\nthe effect of impeding the success of any attempt to change control of us;\n•\nestablish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or other business to be\nbrought before meetings of our stockholders. These procedures provide that notice of stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to our corporate\nsecretary prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 90\ndays, and not more than 120 days, prior to the first anniversary of the prior year’s annual meeting (or, in the case of a special meeting, not less than 90 days or\nmore than 120 days prior to the date of the meeting). Our amended and restated by-laws specify the information that must be included in a stockholder’s notice\nand other requirements that must be met. These requirements may prevent stockholders from bringing matters before the stockholders at an annual or special\nmeeting;\n•\nprovide that stockholders may not act by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the action, and the taking of such action by written consent, has been\napproved in advance by the board of directors;\n•\nprovide that stockholders are not permitted to call special meetings of stockholders. Only our chairman of the board, president, and the board of directors are\npermitted to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n•\nprovide that our board of directors may alter, amend, or repeal our by-laws or approve new by-laws without further stockholder approval, and provide that a\nstockholder amendment to the by-laws requires a favorable vote of two-thirds of the voting power of all outstanding voting stock.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law\nWe are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a\n“business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless certain approvals are\nobtained.\nSection  203 defines a “business combination” to include a merger, asset sale, stock issuance or other transaction in which the interested stockholder receives a\nfinancial benefit that is not shared pro rata with other stockholders. Section 203 generally defines an “interested stockholder” as a person who, together with affiliates and\nassociates, owns 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock. Under Section 203, a business combination between us and an interested stockholder is subject to the three-\nyear moratorium unless:\n•\nour board of directors approved in advance either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;\n•\nupon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our\nvoting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding, for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding, shares owned by\npersons who are directors and also officers and employee stock plans in which\n3"

We refer herein to the $56,500,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes issued in the original offering as the “Initial Notes.”\nOn December 17, 2021, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. pursuant to which we were permitted to issue, from time\nto time, up to an aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 of Notes by means of an “at the market offering.” The Notes offered through our at the market offering are\n“Additional Notes” under the Indenture and have the same terms as (except for the price to public, the issue date and, if applicable, the initial interest accrual date and the initial\ninterest payment date), form a single series of debt securities with, and have the same CUSIP number and are fungible with, the Initial Notes or any other Additional Notes\nimmediately upon issuance, including for purposes of notices, consents, waivers, amendments and any other action permitted under the Indenture. In January 2022, we sold\napproximately $1.2 million aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes pursuant to the “at the market offering.” The Company has not sold any Additional Notes pursuant\nto the “at the market offering” since January 2022. The At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, dated as of December 17, 2021, by and between Tellurian and B. Riley Securities,\nInc. was terminated on December 29, 2022.\nAs of February 7, 2023, approximately $57.7 million aggregate principal amount of Notes were outstanding.\nListing\nThe Notes are listed for trading on the NYSE American under the symbol “TELZ.”\nMaturity\nThe Notes will mature on November 30, 2028, unless redeemed prior to maturity.\n4"

We completed our evaluation on or about the date of this letter. It is our understanding that the\nproved reserves estimated in this report constitute all of the proved reserves owned by Tellurian. The estimates in this report have been prepared in accordance\nwith the definitions and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, with the exception of the exclusion of future income taxes,\nconform to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas. Definitions are presented immediately following this\nletter. This report has been prepared for Tellurian's use in filing with the SEC; in our opinion the assumptions, data, methods, and procedures used in the\npreparation of this report are appropriate for such purpose.\nWe estimate the gross (100 percent) gas reserves and the net gas reserves and future net revenue to the Tellurian interest in these properties, as of\nDecember 31, 2022, to be:\nGas Reserves (MMCF)\nFuture Net Revenue (M$)\nGross\nPresent Worth\nCategory\n(100%)\nNet\nTotal\nat 10%\nProved Developed Producing\n500,180.5\n165,026.7\n747,104.5\n571,070.1\nProved Developed Non-Producing\n225,905.8\n53,355.3\n234,863.5\n162,824.8\nProved Undeveloped\n443,497.7\n226,511.2\n757,929.3\n457,018.2\nTotal Proved\n1,169,584.0\n444,893.3\n1,739,897.5\n1,190,913.7\nTotals may not add because of rounding.\nGas volumes are expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at standard temperature and pressure bases. These properties have never produced commercial\nvolumes of condensate.\nReserves categorization conveys the relative degree of certainty; reserves subcategorization is based on development and production status. As requested,\nprobable and possible reserves that exist for these properties have not been included. The estimates of reserves and future revenue included herein have not\nbeen adjusted for risk. This report does not include any value that could be attributed to interests in undeveloped acreage beyond those tracts for which\nundeveloped reserves have been estimated.\nGross revenue is Tellurian's share of the gross (100 percent) revenue from the properties prior to any deductions. Future net revenue is after deductions for\nTellurian's share of production taxes, ad valorem taxes, capital costs, abandonment costs, and operating expenses but before consideration of any income\ntaxes. The future net revenue has been discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent to determine its present worth, which is shown to indicate the effect of time\non the value of money. Future net revenue presented in this report, whether discounted or undiscounted, should not be construed as being the fair market value\nof the properties.\nGas prices used in this report are based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period\nJanuary through December 2022. The average Henry Hub spot price of $6.357 per MMBTU is adjusted for energy content, transportation fees, and market\ndifferentials. The fees"

The average adjusted gas price weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties is $5.489 per MCF.\nOperating costs used in this report are based on operating expense records of Tellurian and the previous interest owners of certain recently acquired properties,\nas provided by Tellurian. These costs include the per-well overhead expenses allowed under joint operating agreements along with estimates of costs to be\nincurred at and below the district and field levels. Operating costs have been divided into project-level costs, per-well costs, and per-unit-of-production costs.\nHeadquarters general and administrative overhead expenses of Tellurian are included to the extent that they are covered under joint operating agreements for\nthe operated properties. Operating costs are not escalated for inflation.\nCapital costs used in this report were provided by Tellurian and are based on authorizations for expenditure and actual costs from recent activity. Capital costs\nare included as required for workovers, new development wells, and production equipment. Based on our understanding of future development plans, a review\nof the records provided to us, and our knowledge of similar properties, we regard these estimated capital costs to be reasonable. Abandonment costs used in\nthis report are Tellurian's estimates of the costs to abandon the wells and production facilities, net of any salvage value. Capital costs and abandonment costs\nare not escalated for inflation.\nFor the purposes of this report, we did not perform any field inspection of the properties, nor did we examine the mechanical operation or condition of the wells\nand facilities. We have not investigated possible environmental liability related to the properties; therefore, our estimates do not include any costs due to such\npossible liability.\nWe have made no investigation of potential volume and value imbalances resulting from overdelivery or underdelivery to the Tellurian interest. Therefore, our\nestimates of reserves and future revenue do not include adjustments for the settlement of any such imbalances; our projections are based on Tellurian receiving\nits net revenue interest share of estimated future gross production.\nThe reserves shown in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as exact quantities. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas\nwhich, by analysis of engineering and geoscience data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible; probable and possible\nreserves are those additional reserves which are sequentially less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. Estimates of reserves may increase or\ndecrease as a result of market conditions, future operations, changes in regulations, or actual reservoir performance. In addition to the primary economic\nassumptions discussed herein, our estimates are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, that the properties will be developed consistent\nwith current development plans as provided to us by Tellurian, that the properties will be operated in a prudent manner, that no governmental regulations or\ncontrols will be put in place that would impact the ability of the interest owner to recover the reserves, and that our projections of future production will prove\nconsistent with actual performance. If the reserves are recovered, the revenues therefrom and the costs related thereto could be more or less than the\nestimated amounts. Because of governmental policies and uncertainties of supply and demand, the sales rates, prices received for the reserves, and costs\nincurred in recovering such reserves may vary from assumptions made while preparing this report.\nFor the purposes of this report, we used technical and economic data including, but not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data,\nproduction data, historical price and cost information, and property ownership interests. The reserves in this report have been estimated using deterministic\nmethods; these estimates have been prepared in accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information\npromulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE Standards). We used standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methods,\nincluding performance analysis and analogy, that we considered to be appropriate and necessary to categorize and estimate reserves in accordance with SEC\ndefinitions and regulations. A substantial portion of these reserves are for undeveloped locations; such reserves are based on analogy to properties with similar\ngeologic and reservoir characteristics. As in all aspects of oil and gas evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of engineering and\ngeoscience data; therefore, our conclusions necessarily represent only informed professional judgment.\nThe data used in our estimates were obtained from Tellurian, public data sources, and the nonconfidential files of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI)\nand were accepted as accurate. Supporting work data are on file in our office. We have not examined the titles to the properties or independently confirmed the\nactual degree or type of interest owned. The technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates presented herein meet the requirements\nregarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Standards.

Also included is supplemental information from\n(1) the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management System approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, (2) the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive\nActivities—Oil and Gas, and (3) the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations.\n(1) Acquisition of properties. Costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire a property, including costs of lease bonuses and options to purchase or lease properties, the\nportion of costs applicable to minerals when land including mineral rights is purchased in fee, brokers' fees, recording fees, legal costs, and other costs incurred in acquiring\nproperties.\n(2) Analogous reservoir. Analogous reservoirs, as used in resources assessments, have similar rock and fluid properties, reservoir conditions (depth, temperature, and pressure)\nand drive mechanisms, but are typically at a more advanced stage of development than the reservoir of interest and thus may provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of\nmore limited data and estimation of recovery. When used to support proved reserves, an \"analogous reservoir\" refers to a reservoir that shares the following characteristics with\nthe reservoir of interest:\n(i)    Same geological formation (but not necessarily in pressure communication with the reservoir of interest);\n(ii)    Same environment of deposition;\n(iii)    Similar geological structure; and\n(iv)    Same drive mechanism.\nInstruction to paragraph (a)(2): Reservoir properties must, in the aggregate, be no more favorable in the analog than in the reservoir of interest.\n(3) Bitumen. Bitumen, sometimes referred to as natural bitumen, is petroleum in a solid or semi-solid state in natural deposits with a viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise\nmeasured at original temperature in the deposit and atmospheric pressure, on a gas free basis. In its natural state it usually contains sulfur, metals, and other non-hydrocarbons.\n(4) Condensate. Condensate is a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure, but that, when produced, is in the\nliquid phase at surface pressure and temperature.\n(5) Deterministic estimate. The method of estimating reserves or resources is called deterministic when a single value for each parameter (from the geoscience, engineering, or\neconomic data) in the reserves calculation is used in the reserves estimation procedure.\n(6) Developed oil and gas reserves. Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:\n(i)    Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a\nnew well; and\n(ii)    Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.\nSupplemental definitions from the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management System:\nDeveloped Producing Reserves – Expected quantities to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the effective date of the estimate. Improved\nrecovery Reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.\nDeveloped Non-Producing Reserves – Shut-in and behind-pipe Reserves. Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from (1) completion intervals that are open at the\ntime of the estimate but which have not yet started producing, (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections, or (3) wells not capable of production\nfor mechanical reasons. Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells that will require additional completion work or future re-completion\nbefore start of production with minor cost to access these reserves. In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of\ndrilling a new well.\n(7) Development costs. Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and gas. More specifically,\ndevelopment costs, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of development activities, are costs incurred to:\n(i)    Gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling, including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining specific development drilling sites, clearing\nground, draining, road building, and relocating public roads, gas lines, and power lines, to the extent necessary in developing the proved reserves.\n(ii)    Drill and equip development wells, development-type stratigraphic test wells, and service wells, including the costs of platforms and of well equipment such as\ncasing, tubing, pumping equipment, and the wellhead assembly.\n(iii)    Acquire, construct, and install production facilities such as lease flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters, manifolds, measuring devices, and production storage\ntanks, natural gas cycling and processing plants, and central utility and waste disposal systems.\n(iv)    Provide improved recovery systems.\n(8) Development project. A development project is the means by which petroleum resources are brought to the status of economically producible. As examples, the development\nof a single reservoir or field, an incremental development in a\n    Definitions - Page 1 of 6"

A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.\n(10) Economically producible. The term economically producible, as it relates to a resource, means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected\nto exceed, the costs of the operation. The value of the products that generate revenue shall be determined at the terminal point of oil and gas producing activities as defined in\nparagraph (a)(16) of this section.\n(11) Estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). Estimated ultimate recovery is the sum of reserves remaining as of a given date and cumulative production as of that date.\n(12) Exploration costs. Costs incurred in identifying areas that may warrant examination and in examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects of containing oil\nand gas reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells. Exploration costs may be incurred both before acquiring the related\nproperty (sometimes referred to in part as prospecting costs) and after acquiring the property. Principal types of exploration costs, which include depreciation and applicable\noperating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration activities, are:\n(i)        Costs of topographical, geographical and geophysical studies, rights of access to properties to conduct those studies, and salaries and other expenses of\ngeologists, geophysical crews, and others conducting those studies. Collectively, these are sometimes referred to as geological and geophysical or \"G&G\" costs.\n(ii)    Costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties, such as delay rentals, ad valorem taxes on properties, legal costs for title defense, and the maintenance of\nland and lease records.\n(iii)    Dry hole contributions and bottom hole contributions.\n(iv)    Costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells.\n(v)    Costs of drilling exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells.\n(13) Exploratory well. An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir.\nGenerally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well, or a stratigraphic test well as those items are defined in this section.\n(14) Extension well. An extension well is a well drilled to extend the limits of a known reservoir.\n(15) Field. An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic\ncondition. There may be two or more reservoirs in a field which are separated vertically by intervening impervious strata, or laterally by local geologic barriers, or by both.\nReservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or adjacent fields may be treated as a single or common operational field. The geological terms \"structural feature\" and\n\"stratigraphic condition\" are intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the broader terms of basins, trends, provinces, plays, areas-of-interest, etc.\n(16) Oil and gas producing activities.\n(i)    Oil and gas producing activities include:\n(A)    The search for crude oil, including condensate and natural gas liquids, or natural gas (\"oil and gas\") in their natural states and original locations;\n(B)    The acquisition of property rights or properties for the purpose of further exploration or for the purpose of removing the oil or gas from such properties;\n(C)    The construction, drilling, and production activities necessary to retrieve oil and gas from their natural reservoirs, including the acquisition, construction,\ninstallation, and maintenance of field gathering and storage systems, such as:\n(1)    Lifting the oil and gas to the surface; and\n(2)    Gathering, treating, and field processing (as in the case of processing gas to extract liquid hydrocarbons); and\n(D)    Extraction of saleable hydrocarbons, in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state, from oil sands, shale, coalbeds, or other nonrenewable natural resources which\nare intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, and activities undertaken with a view to such extraction.\nInstruction 1 to paragraph (a)(16)(i): The oil and gas production function shall be regarded as ending at a \"terminal point\", which is the outlet valve on the lease or field\nstorage tank. If unusual physical or operational circumstances exist, it may be appropriate to regard the terminal point for the production function as:\na.    The first point at which oil, gas, or gas liquids, natural or synthetic, are delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a refinery, or a marine terminal; and\nb.    In the case of natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, if those natural resources are delivered to a purchaser prior to upgrading,\nthe first point at which the natural resources are delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a refinery, a marine terminal, or a facility which upgrades such\nnatural resources into synthetic oil or gas.\nInstruction 2 to paragraph (a)(16)(i): For purposes of this paragraph (a)(16), the term saleable hydrocarbons means hydrocarbons that are saleable in the state in which the\nhydrocarbons are delivered.\n    Definitions - Page 2 of 6"

Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.\n(i)    When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus\npossible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10% probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed\nthe proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates.\n(ii)    Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively\nless certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial\nproduction from the reservoir by a defined project.\n(iii)    Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities\nassumed for probable reserves.\n(iv)        The proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and commercial\ninterpretations within the reservoir or subject project that are clearly documented, including comparisons to results in successful similar projects.\n(v)    Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that\nmay be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been\npenetrated by a wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be\nassigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir.\n(vi)        Pursuant to paragraph (a)(22)(iii) of this section, where direct observation has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an\nassociated gas cap, proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the HKO only if the higher contact can be\nestablished with reasonable certainty through reliable technology. Portions of the reservoir that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as\nprobable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties and pressure gradient interpretations.\n(18) Probable reserves. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are\nas likely as not to be recovered.\n(i)    When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable\nreserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus\nprobable reserves estimates.\n(ii)    Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain,\neven if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas\nthat are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir.\n(iii)        Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than\nassumed for proved reserves.\n(iv)    See also guidelines in paragraphs (a)(17)(iv) and (a)(17)(vi) of this section.\n(19) Probabilistic estimate. The method of estimation of reserves or resources is called probabilistic when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each unknown\nparameter (from the geoscience and engineering data) is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of occurrence.\n(20) Production costs.\n(i)    Costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and\nfacilities and other costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and facilities. They become part of the cost of oil and gas produced.\nExamples of production costs (sometimes called lifting costs) are:\n(A)    Costs of labor to operate the wells and related equipment and facilities.\n(B)    Repairs and maintenance.\n(C)    Materials, supplies, and fuel consumed and supplies utilized in operating the wells and related equipment and facilities.\n(D)    Property taxes and insurance applicable to proved properties and wells and related equipment and facilities.\n(E)    Severance taxes.\n    Definitions - Page 3 of 6"

Depreciation, depletion, and amortization of capitalized acquisition, exploration, and development\ncosts are not production costs but also become part of the cost of oil and gas produced along with production (lifting) costs identified above.\n(21) Proved area. The part of a property to which proved reserves have been specifically attributed.\n(22) Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with\nreasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and\ngovernment regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of\nwhether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably\ncertain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.\n(i)    The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:\n(A)    The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and\n(B)    Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible\noil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.\n(ii)    In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless\ngeoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.\n(iii)    Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil\nreserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish\nthe higher contact with reasonable certainty.\n(iv)    Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the\nproved classification when:\n(A)    Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an\ninstalled program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the\nengineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and\n(B)    The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.\n(v)    Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price\nduring the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-\nmonth price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.\n(23) Proved properties. Properties with proved reserves.\n(24) Reasonable certainty. If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic\nmethods are used, there should be at least a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the\nquantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and\neconomic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.\n(25) Reliable technology. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated\nto provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.\n(26) Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of\ndevelopment projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a\nrevenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.\nNote to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and\nevaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e.,\nabsence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered\naccumulations).\n    Definitions - Page 4 of 6"

These shall be computed by applying prices used in estimating the entity's proved oil and gas reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves.\nFuture price changes shall be considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year-end.\n    b.    Future development and production costs. These costs shall be computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and\ngas reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. If estimated development expenditures are\nsignificant, they shall be presented separately from estimated production costs.\n    c.    Future income tax expenses. These expenses shall be computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already\nlegislated, to the future pretax net cash flows relating to the entity's proved oil and gas reserves, less the tax basis of the properties involved. The future income tax\nexpenses shall give effect to tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the entity's proved oil and gas reserves.\n    d.    Future net cash flows. These amounts are the result of subtracting future development and production costs and future income tax expenses from future cash inflows.\n    e.    Discount. This amount shall be derived from using a discount rate of 10 percent a year to reflect the timing of the future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas\nreserves.\n    f.    Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. This amount is the future net cash flows less the computed discount.\n(27) Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water\nbarriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs.\n(28) Resources. Resources are quantities of oil and gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. A portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable,\nand another portion may be considered to be unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations.\n(29) Service well. A well drilled or completed for the purpose of supporting production in an existing field. Specific purposes of service wells include gas injection, water injection,\nsteam injection, air injection, salt-water disposal, water supply for injection, observation, or injection for in-situ combustion.\n(30) Stratigraphic test well. A stratigraphic test well is a drilling effort, geologically directed, to obtain information pertaining to a specific geologic condition. Such wells customarily\nare drilled without the intent of being completed for hydrocarbon production. The classification also includes tests identified as core tests and all types of expendable holes\nrelated to hydrocarbon exploration. Stratigraphic tests are classified as \"exploratory type\" if not drilled in a known area or \"development type\" if drilled in a known area.\n(31) Undeveloped oil and gas reserves. Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage,\nor from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n(i)    Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless\nevidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.\n(ii)    Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled\nwithin five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.\n    Definitions - Page 5 of 6"

      "text": "DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS\nRESERVES\nAdapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a)\nFrom the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (October 26, 2009):\nAlthough several types of projects — such as constructing offshore platforms and development in urban areas, remote locations or environmentally sensitive locations — by\ntheir nature customarily take a longer time to develop and therefore often do justify longer time periods, this determination must always take into consideration all of the facts\nand circumstances. No particular type of project per se justifies a longer time period, and any extension beyond five years should be the exception, and not the rule.\nFactors that a company should consider in determining whether or not circumstances justify recognizing reserves even though development may extend past five years include,\nbut are not limited to, the following:\n        The company's level of ongoing significant development activities in the area to be developed (for example, drilling only the minimum number of wells necessary to\nmaintain the lease generally would not constitute significant development activities);\n        The company's historical record at completing development of comparable long-term projects;\n        The amount of time in which the company has maintained the leases, or booked the reserves, without significant development activities;\n        The extent to which the company has followed a previously adopted development plan (for example, if a company has changed its development plan several times without\ntaking significant steps to implement any of those plans, recognizing proved undeveloped reserves typically would not be appropriate); and\n        The extent to which delays in development are caused by external factors related to the physical operating environment (for example, restrictions on development on\nFederal lands, but not obtaining government permits), rather than by internal factors (for example, shifting resources to develop properties with higher priority).\n(iii)    Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved\nrecovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as\ndefined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.\n(32) Unproved properties.
