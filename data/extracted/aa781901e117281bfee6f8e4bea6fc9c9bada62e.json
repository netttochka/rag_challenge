      "text": "2021 has been a transformative year for the AA and one which positions the business well for success. \nI was invited to chair the Board of Basing Topco Limited (Topco Board), the AA investment company \ncontrolled by Warburg Pincus and TowerBrook Capital Partners that acquired the AA, early in the \nfinancial year having been attracted by the AA’s rich heritage, skilled workforce and critical role it \nplays across the UK. In short, the AA is an iconic brand and it is an honour to take the role of chair. \nIt is no secret that for a long time the AA laboured under too \nmuch debt. Pleasingly, the privatisation of the business, with the \nreduction in debt this enabled, has meant that the business is \nnow able to build on its leading positions and invest and operate \nwith far greater freedom.\nAs Chair my role is clear, working alongside the Topco Board to \nprovide governance and oversight of the Executive management \nteam as they focus on ensuring that the AA goes from strength \nto strength and delivers on its significant potential. To do that, \nthere continues to be an intense focus on strategy based around \na framework approach in the context of the industry and societal \ntrends ahead in the short, medium and longer term. Following \nthe smooth ownership transition and with the benefit of the \nvery constructive and collaborative relationship that has \nalready grown up between the Topco Board, the Executive \nmanagement team and the new owners, the AA is well placed.\nTo ensure the right balance of skills, I am pleased that we have \nrecently appointed Kory Sorenson to join us on the Topco Board. \nKory is an experienced non-executive director and brings \nspecific expertise across the insurance industry through her \ntime with both Aviva and more recently, Phoenix Group. During \nthe year we have also launched Topco Board committees in \nrespect of Remuneration and Nominations, and Audit and Risk \nand spent significant time debating and establishing Board \nReserved Matters. Through all of these measures and a \ncontinued focus on regulatory discipline and customer outcomes, \nI am confident we have embedded an appropriate governance \nculture that complements the business. Furthermore, through \nthe adoption of the Wates Principles on Corporate Governance, \nwe have set a benchmark to continue to develop our governance. \nFor more information about the corporate governance \narrangements at the AA, please refer to the Directors’ Report \non page 52.\nThe Topco Board is fully aware of the AA’s rich history in \nsupporting the wider community and all drivers, and the new \nTopco Board continues to back that approach. For example, \nthis year the AA continued its support of the NHS by providing \nsignage for NHS community vaccination centres. \nOur progress would not be possible without the work of our \npeople. This has unfortunately been another year when \nCOVID-19 impacted the way we work and created incredibly \nchallenging circumstances for many. Throughout this period, \nthe priority has been to ensure that our people are safe and can \nfulfil the important role they play across the UK. I am proud to \nsay that every challenge we have come up against has been \novercome, and this is down to the hard work of our colleagues \nand the ability of this business, as it has proven again and again \nover its rich history, to be agile and deliver. \nThere is no higher recognition of the AA’s standing than the \nindependent ratings we received from organisations such as \nconsumer champion Which? and the growth in members. This \nhas taken strong management both at our Executive level and \nall the teams that support them and a drive from all colleagues \nto adapt to deliver.\nCHAIR’S STATEMENT \nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  5\n4  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nI would like to thank all our \ncolleagues for going above \nand beyond this year, for their \nresilience in challenging \nperiods and their dedication \nto our members, this is why \nthe AA has led for so long, and \nwhy it will continue to do so.”\nRick Haythornthwaite\nChair"

      "text": "environment. During this period, we have also facilitated a \nsmooth transition to meet the GIPP requirements by January \n2022, have further strengthened our direct to consumer and \ncross selling activities and have further expanded footprint and \ncapability in our insurance underwriter. The introduction of GIPP \nis one of the most significant changes to pricing within the UK \ninsurance industry and has resulted in a challenging trading \nenvironment, which has been widely reported on. As we look \nahead, and not withstanding the near-term disruption, we \nremain confident in the quality of our insurance business.\nA strong foundation from which to build \nIn March 2021 we entered into new ownership with the \nacquisition of the AA by Warburg Pincus and TowerBrook Capital \nPartners. The change in ownership resulted in a significant \nequity injection of £378m of which a section was used to pay \ndown debt and allowed us to refinance other tranches of our \nremaining debt at a more attractive and sustainable level.\nThis has allowed us both to increase our investment in the future \nof the AA whilst at the same time continuing on a deleveraging \ntrajectory: investment of £77m capital expenditure has gone \ninto core re-platforming, new digital propositions and upgrades \nto our data and operational infrastructure. It was pleasing to see \nfurther growth in usage of our app, which enables our customers \nto access a range of services from the AA whilst delivering an \nenhanced customer experience. \nThe Group continues to generate strong operating cashflows \nand coupled with lower interest costs going forwards following \nthe significant repayment of debt noted above we expect to see \nstronger net cash flows going forwards. After the impact of the \nacquisition and refinancings in the current year, our net debt \ndecreased from £2,605m to £2,261m. \nIn addition, new ownership and leadership, combined with the \nstrength of the brand and strategic vision, have allowed us to \nattract top talent from the market across a number of disciplines \nwith more than 20 senior external and internal appointments to \nour senior management team in the year. Our team is highly \nmotivated, and we have a clear plan to ensure the AA delivers \non its significant potential, which I outline below. \nA clear strategy for the future\nWhilst we already offer a market-leading proposition to our \nmembers, we are acutely aware of the need for continued \nevolution and modernisation of the AA to ensure that our \noffering meets the changing needs of our members. The AA \nhas a strong track record of demonstrating its agility and \nadaptability and as we look ahead under our new ownership, \nwe have outlined three strategy horizons.\n›\t Horizon 1: Optimising the core, modernising the AA to \ndrive growth and profitability in the core business\n›\t Horizon 2: Extending the business to develop new \npropositions and services to future proof the business\n›\t Horizon 3: Monetising innovation to develop new revenue \nstreams in the emerging automotive value chain\nHorizon 1: Optimising the core\nThe current Horizon 1 activity focuses on the most critical \n2–3-year value levers to deliver membership and revenue \ngrowth and better efficiency. Our digital investment is targeted \nat continuously improving customer journeys, app usage and \ncustomer engagement, with some marked improvements in \nsales journey conversion rates and online breakdown reporting \nalready evident. \nIn the rapidly evolving electrification arena, we already \nsupport electric vehicle (EV) drivers through a variety of \ninnovative approaches such as Smart Care which offers \nservice, maintenance and repair for EVs, EV specific driver \ntraining via AA Driving School and Drivetech, and new EV \nleasing propositions via Smart Lease. We have the largest EV \ntrained patrol workforce in Europe with innovations such as our \naward-winning Freewheeling Hub. We insure EVs including their \ncables and are the first UK breakdown organisation to target \nmarketing specifically at EV drivers. In our B2B business we \noffer customer support to seven leading Charge Post Operators.\nOur multi-year investment in new core platforms in both \nRoadside and Insurance will allow us to broaden our product \nand propositions, provide improved agility and support \ncustomer retention and customer value management. \n2\t Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Non-GAAP) measures explained on page 18\n3\t Personal members have been restated, see page 16\nAs I look back at my first year as CEO of the AA, I am proud of how the business has performed and \ndelivered for customers despite the continued pressures of COVID-19 and a challenging external \nenvironment. This is in no small part down to the hard work of our colleagues who pride themselves \non going above and beyond for our members. The AA is an iconic brand which has a proud history \nand I am confident to say that the best is yet to come. \nI would like to highlight some of the many achievements of 2021 and outline why we are so excited \nfor the future.\n1\t\nNon-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Non-GAAP) measures explained on page 18\nDelivering unrivalled service for our members\nLike 2020, 2021 was another year when we had to manage \nchallenges presented by the pandemic and I am pleased to say \nthat our business has yet again overcome the obstacles this \nhas presented admirably. There is no stronger evidence for this \nthan being granted Which? Recommended Provider for the \nfourth consecutive year, with neither of our direct competitors \nbeing awarded this accolade once over that period. The 5 stars \nawarded for the ‘knowledge and courtesy’ of our patrols once \nagain demonstrates the strength of our offering.\nAt the heart of this lies our focus on service excellence \ndelivered through our people at unrivalled scale in the UK market. \nWe are the leading national provider of roadside assistance \nservices with c.40% market share of the UK consumer market \nand c.50% of the business-to-business market. We have around \n2,500 dedicated patrols, more than any other competitor, and \nattend c.8,000 breakdowns per day with an industry leading \naverage arrival time of 50 mins. \nA year of strong performance under \nnew ownership\nAlongside a strong operational performance, the first year of \nnew ownership has been focused on restoring the business to \ngrowth and laying the foundation for the future. We are proud \nto have delivered growth in membership, revenue and Trading \nEBITDA1 across the Group, demonstrating highly resilient and \nrecurring revenues, and the strong operating cash flow \ngeneration that are core characteristics of our business. \nReturn to growth in Roadside \nIn our Roadside business, we delivered growth in both revenue \nand Trading EBITDA1, with margin remaining strong and growth \nin both business and individual membership. This performance \nwas achieved despite a fundamental shift in driving patterns \ncaused by the pandemic, with reduced commuting and \nincreased longer drives for domestic staycations. Our business \nproved responsive to these changes and managed to secure \nimportant new business-to-business contract wins, now \namounting to a c.62% market share of bank business-to-\nbusiness-to-consumer (B2B2C) and 53% of Original Equipment \nManufacturer (OEM) new car volumes.\nThe platform from which we build is a strong one. We have a \nbrand which is synonymous with excellent service and a loyal \ncustomer base who appreciate the differentiated service we \noffer, which is demonstrated in our Roadside retention rate \nincreasing to 81% under the new basis of calculation for paid \npersonal membership. See page 21.\nA year of change in Insurance \nContinuing the trends outlined at the half year, the wider \ninsurance environment has remained fluid, with the effects of \nthe pandemic and the new General Insurance Pricing Practices \n(GIPP) creating a unique combination of challenges. Having \ndelivered strong growth in the first half of the year, we evolved \nour stance in the second half of the year by balancing growth \nand profitability and ensuring robust underwriting disciplines \nin our underwriter in light of a particularly competitive pricing \nCEO’S STATEMENT \nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  7\n6  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022\nHIGHLIGHTS\nRevenue\n£989m\n(2021: £967m)\nTrading EBITDA margin\n35%\n(2021: 35%)\nTrading EBITDA2\n£345m\n(2021: £341m)\nBreakdowns attended\n3.07m\n(2021: 3.01m)\nPaid personal members\n3.177m\n(2021: 3.111m)3\nBusiness customers\n8.8m\n(2021: 8.7m)"

The market has grown \nin value to £1.76bn in 2021, representing \nan increase of 10% since 2016. The market \nhowever remains mature and increasingly \ncompetitive. The sector is dominated by \nthree major players, of which the AA is the \nlargest. Our competitive advantage is based \non quality of service, brand consideration \nand distribution platform as well as digital \ncapability. New trends are emerging which \nthe AA is well placed to take advantage of \ngiven our leading market position, our \ntechnology and developing connected car \npropositions. The AA is the market leader \nwith c.40% of the consumer market, \nfollowed by RAC and Green Flag.\nHOW WE MEASURE THE  \nVALUE WE CREATE ›››\nConsumer Roadside Assistance fees \nare principally paid through annual or \nmonthly subscriptions. Subject to \nidentifying customer needs, additional \nrevenue is available from cross-selling \n(selling other services) or up-selling \n(selling higher value products and \nservices) following a breakdown.\nMANAGING OUR \nRISKS EFFECTIVELY ›››\nRoadside Assistance is a discretionary \nproduct for consumers; however, our \nsales process is regulated as it is bought \nby consumers as insurance.

In the fleet market, the AA is market \nleader and has a range of smaller competitors \nwho compete primarily on price.\nHOW WE MEASURE THE  \nVALUE WE CREATE ›››\nThe AA and BSM driving schools’ revenue \nderives from franchise fees from instructors \nfor use of branded cars and the AA’s digital \nbooking system. The cars are funded by the \nAA under a lease arrangement. We also \nprovide training for driving instructors. \nIn relation to the Drivetech business, our \ndriver training services are delivered under \nlong-term service contracts.\nMANAGING OUR \nRISKS EFFECTIVELY ›››\nWe actively manage our risks through \nour Risk Management Framework which \ncovers the following areas:\n›\t Customer satisfaction levels\n›\t Competition from lower \npriced competitors\n›\t Information security, cyber-crime \nand data management\nWHAT WE DO ››› INSURANCE\nOur customers (Consumers, SMEs, OEMs, Fleet managers and Financial Institutions) are at the heart of our business model. \nOur business model spans the motoring lifecycle from roadside assistance and motor & home insurance to accident management, \nservice, maintenance & repair through Prestige and learning to drive with the Driving School. Data science and a digital customer \nexperience are fundamental to each business area, and the proposition is underpinned by a service culture and long-term focus. \nAs our customer base grows, we have access to a greater quantity of data from which we can generate improved customer insight \nto enhance our proposition, further growing customer numbers. Additional data also improves efficiency and grows customer value. \nWe differentiate ourselves from our competitors by our leading brand and market position, excellent standards of service, strategic \ninvestments in our digital proposition and by training and developing the best people. \nBroking\nThe AA’s insurance broking business \nserves both personal members and \nnon-members selling motor and home \ninsurance. These policies are underwritten \nby a panel of underwriters, including the \nAA’s in-house underwriter.\nHOW WE COMPETE ›››\nThe market competes largely on the price \nof premiums. This is particularly true of the \n82% of motor insurance sales which are \nthrough price comparison websites (PCWs). \nWhile our brand consideration is ranked \nhigh in motor insurance, price dominates, \nand we have turned around our motor \npolicy book as a result of our improved \nprice competitiveness. \nIn home insurance, PCWs are less \ndominant, in part because home \nspecifications vary more, and home \ninsurance is less expensive than motor \nwhich reduces the rate of attrition. \nWe currently have a growing share in the \nmotor and home insurance markets with \nplans to accelerate growth through the \nsuccessful execution of our strategy.\nHOW WE MEASURE THE  \nVALUE WE CREATE ›››\nAs an insurance broker, the AA acts as \nan intermediary between those seeking \ninsurance cover and the insurance \nunderwriters. The AA has the ability to \nearn commission on new business sales \nand renewing policies as well as income \nfrom add-ons and premium finance.\nMANAGING OUR \nRISKS EFFECTIVELY ›››\nBroking is regulated by the FCA. \nWe manage our risk through our Risk \nManagement Framework which covers: \n›\t Customer satisfaction levels and good \ncustomer outcomes\n›\t Changes to the regulatory and \ntax environment\n›\t Information security, cyber-crime \nand data management\nUnderwriting\nThe AA’s in-house underwriter launched \nmotor policies in January 2016 followed by \nhome policies in August 2016. As part of \nthe AA Group, we utilise our extensive \nproprietary data as appropriate to hone \nour pricing. This enables us to price more \ncompetitively which supports the broker’s \nability to win more business.\nHOW WE COMPETE ›››\nUnderwriters compete primarily on price. \nThe CORs in this underwriting market are \njust under 100% (thus earning single digit \nmargins) and the integrated model \nmeans that our underwriter drives our \nhigher broker volumes which generate \nbetter margins.\nHOW WE MEASURE THE  \nVALUE WE CREATE ›››\nThe underwriter retains 20% of gross \nwritten premiums after coinsurance and \nreinsurance. The in-house underwriter \nis required to maintain certain levels of \nsolvency capital and as at 31 January 2022 \nthe solvency coverage headroom is 86% \nover required levels.\nMANAGING OUR \nRISKS EFFECTIVELY ›››\nUnderwriting is carried out by a Gibraltar \ncompany within the Group and is regulated \nby the Gibraltar Financial Services \nCommission (GFSC).

We have seen increasing overall membership \nand Trading EBITDA as well as positive operating cash flow generation. \nWe have confidence in continued Trading EBITDA growth and \ncash flow generation building on the positive momentum \nfrom this year. The change in ownership of the Group has \nbeen a positive step change for the AA’s future enabling \nboth a reduction in leverage and a rebalanced capital \nstructure providing a long-term sustainable amount of \nleverage to support investment in our successful future.”\nTom Mackay\nChief Financial Officer\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nDuring the period we have continued to demonstrate our highly resilient and recurring \nrevenues as well as our strong operating cash flow generation that are the core \ncharacteristics of our business.\nWe have seen a return to growth despite the continued challenges of COVID-19 and \nare really pleased to see increasing overall membership figures. Improvement in our \ntop line revenue of 2% has been the driver for the year-on-year improvement seen in \nTrading EBITDA. \nThe change in ownership of the Group has been a positive step change for the AA’s \nfuture enabling both a reduction in leverage and a rebalanced capital structure \nproviding a long-term sustainable amount of leverage to support future investment \nin our successful future. Our new owners have injected equity of £378m contributing \nto a reduction in net debt from 7.6x Trading EBITDA at 31 January 2021 to 6.6x at \n31 January 2022. \nBuilding on the positive momentum from this year, we have confidence in continued \nTrading EBITDA growth and positive cash flow. Underpinned by our improved capital \nstructure, we will make significant investments in both our core roadside and insurance \nplatforms as well as our back office to build an AA of the future.\nGroup Revenue \n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\nRoadside \n822\n799\nInsurance \n167\n168\nRevenue\n989\n967\nGroup revenue was £989m, up 2% compared to last year (2021: £967m), despite the continued challenges of COVID-19.\nROADSIDE\nOur core Roadside business delivered significant top line growth \nwith revenue up 3% from £799m to £822m driven by the \nincrease in new business volumes seen in both business-to-\nconsumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) and continued \nrecovery of our developing businesses. \nBusiness-to-consumer\nDuring the year, we revised the basis of the paid personal \nmembership holding to exclude ancillary holdings. Under this \nnew basis, the paid membership holding increased by 2.1% to \n3.177m (2021: 3.111m). Under the old basis, paid membership \nincreased by 2.7% to 3.253m (2021: 3.168m). Given the impact \nof the pandemic over the last two years, we were very pleased \nto see the paid personal membership base increase under both \nmeasures. The revised basis has been used in our measure of \nretention which increased to 81% (2021: 80%) on the new basis \ncompared to 80% (2021: 78%) on the old basis. This improvement \nin our performance was supported by our market-leading \nservice at the roadside and through our contact centres. \nAs lockdowns were relifted at the start of the year, the paid \nmembership base increased by 1.5% in H1 underpinned by the \n‘Tukker’ above the line marketing campaign, which ran for a \nnumber of months. In H2, membership continued to grow by a \nfurther 0.6% reflecting the unwinding of the impact of COVID-19 \non new business volumes seen in the prior year. \nAverage income per paid personal member has also been \nrecalculated using the new paid membership basis and increased \nin the year by £2 to £169 (2021: £167) reflecting the impact of \ninflation partly offset by strong new business growth but at \nlower-than-average transaction values. On the old basis income \nper member increased by £2 to £165 (2021: £163). \nBusiness-to-business\nWe successfully retained or extended all our major core \nroadside contracts this year, including JLR, Lotus, VWG, Ford, \nSuzuki, Arval, Rivus, LeasePlan, Hertz, Zenith, DAS and Admiral. \nIn addition, we acquired new breakdown assistance business \nfrom Smart, Innovation Automotive, Bugatti, GKL Leasing and \nScottish Water via new contract wins, as well as several new \ninsurance contracts with Tempcover, Marshmallow, Kudo \nand Riverside.\nTotal business customers rose to 8.8m (2021: 8.7m) following \nour successful new business wins in the year. In addition, we \ncontinued to see growth in our holdings from our insurance \npartnerships offset with a continued and anticipated decline \nin the number of AVAs with our banking partners. Overall \nincome for B2B grew slightly reflecting the benefit of higher \npay-for-use income from the breakdowns we serviced and the \nadditional services that we provided in supporting our motor \nmanufacturing partners. \nThe sea change in EV adoption across the UK was a catalyst for \nthe expansion of our EV Charge Post Operator (CPO) customer \nservice operation, bringing support to new partners including \nLiberty Charge, EB Charging and Instavolt, and taking our total \nportfolio of CPOs to nine, with implementation of more new \ncontracts scheduled for 2022. On the customer service front \nwe were also appointed to provide contact centre and retention \nservices for Toyota GB from March 2022 for their extended \nroadside programme.\nIn March 2021, we announced the award of a new five-year \ncontract with Nationwide through which we will provide \nNationwide’s FlexPlus customers with our award-winning \nroadside assistance services, which they will be able to access \nfully through digital channels, including the AA app. \nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  21\n20  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

We also expanded our portfolio of SME trade \npartnerships, bringing four new buying groups on board over \nthe course of the year.\nExternally, our market-leading approach to EV and alternative \nfuels was strengthened by our participation in the COP26 EV \nRally of Scotland, and our partnership with the EV Café. We also \ncollaborated on thought leadership with a number of key B2B \ninfluencers in the EV space. The success of our game-changing \nFree Wheeling Hub, allowing electric vehicles to be towed safely, \nwas recognised by industry innovation awards from Fleet News \nand Green Fleet and we were also recognised with awards for \nFleet Partnership and exceptional Customer Service within the \nFleet and Leasing sector.\nCustomer service and operations\nWhich? have reported that manufacturer programmes provided \nby the AA occupy the top 9 slots for serving motor manufacturers’ \ncustomers, with Lexus, Toyota and Honda all gaining \n‘Recommended Provider’ status.

As a result of this \nvolume increase, overall pay-for-use income was up compared \nto last year. Ancillary sales including battery sales were lower \nthan last year following the spike in members and customers \nexperiencing flat batteries in the prior year due to their cars not \nbeing driven during the initial lockdown.\nWe have continued to improve our customer journey through \na focused effort on making digital breakdown frictionless so \nthat more of our personal membership breakdowns can be \nreported online.\nDeveloping businesses\nFY22 saw encouraging recovery from the impact of COVID-19 \nin the prior year. \nSmart Care volumes grew strongly over prior year as we \ncontinued with a programme of web-based marketing offers, \nenhancements to the digital journey and further developing the \nlinks with the wider AA, increasing the volume of jobs being \npassed to the garage network from patrols. \nOur B2B segment saw SMR volume growth with retention of \nexisting key accounts and four new accounts added in year \ngiving us visibility of further B2B growth in the year ahead.\nWe have also continued to make good progress with our \nproduct development plans across our markets, including \nsupporting our AA Cars business with the fulfilment of Service \nPlan SMR work and further development of our B2B downtime \nmanagement proposition. \nOur Driving Schools and Drivetech businesses were significantly \nimpacted by COVID-19 last year and we saw a strong recovery \nin FY22. \nDriving Schools benefitted from pent up demand for driving \nlessons following the easing of lockdown restrictions. \nOur BSM VR product won Best Product at the Intelligent \nInstructor Awards and the Driving School fleet has also been \nnominated for most improved fleet, by the Fleet Awards.\nIn response to COVID-19 last year, Drivetech was the first to \nprovide comprehensive online speed awareness courses as \nan alternative to class-based learning. As more people took \nto the road in the current year, police referral volumes for \ncourses grew.\nINSURANCE\nThe Insurance division faced a tough economic environment \nwith significant market premium deflation in FY22 resulting in a \nhighly competitive new business market. Market volatility was \nalso heightened by the implementation of the FCA’s new General \nInsurance Pricing Practices (GIPP) rules which we successfully \nimplemented on 1 January 2022. Overall insurance revenue \ndecreased slightly to £167m (FY21: £168m). Revenue growth \nwas achieved in our in-house underwriter, Accident Assist and \nAA Cars businesses but was offset by lower motor new business \ncommissions as seen across the sector.\nInsurance Broking and other services \nRevenue decreased principally due to the impact of lower \nmotor new business commissions despite an improved trading \nenvironment for AA Cars following the impact of COVID-19 in \nthe prior year.\nThe motor policy book reduced slightly by 2% to 1,027,000 \npolicies (2021: 1,052,000) and the home book grew by 1% to \n896,000 (2021: 889,000), a resilient performance in an \nuncertain market reflecting the strength of both our brand \nand our in-house underwriter, AA Underwriting Insurance \nCompany Limited (AAUICL). During the year we continued to \nmake improvements in our customer journey which helped to \ndeliver consistent and healthy cross-sell conversions into our \nRoadside business. The continued investment in our brand \nand improvements to our digital journeys have also received \nexternal recognition. AA topped the Insurance category in the \nSavanta Top 100 Most Loved Financial Services Brands 2021 \nand our motor insurance product was voted winner in the \n2022 Consumer Intelligence awards for Customer Trust and \nRecommendation by Customers. \nIn January 2022 we were awarded the Feefo Platinum Trusted \nService award for the second year in a row. Feefo gives Platinum \nTrusted Service awards to businesses that have achieved the \nFeefo Gold standard for three consecutive years or more. It is \na highly valued badge of approval, as it is based purely on \ngenuine, verified, customer feedback about excellent service.\nThroughout 2021, AA Insurance has been investing in improving \noutcomes for customers in conjunction with preparation for the \nrequirements of the FCA’s GIPP rules and whilst continuing to \ndrive new business volumes in a highly price competitive motor \nmarket. With retail motor insurance rates at the lowest point for \nmany years, we have invested in commission reductions on both \nnew and renewing business to support our volume aspirations. \nThis combined with supporting our customers through the \nCOVID-19 pandemic with a reduction in administrative and \nprocessing fees led to the average income per motor and home \npolicy for our broker falling to £47 (2021: £59). However, due \nto growth in income from our in-house underwriter and other \ninsurance businesses, total average income per insurance \npolicy remained stable at £78 (2021: £78).\nRenewal rates have increased with volume and value being \noptimised through targeted commission reductions. \nAccident Assist, our in-house claims management proposition \nlaunched in FY21, is performing well from a volume and margin \nperspective. Accident Assist services are actively marketed to \nour B2C membership base with improving take-up as \nawareness increases. \nWe continue to have a strong relationship with our partner \nBank of Ireland UK, however growth of our Financial Services \nbusiness has been curtailed by our competitors aggressively \nchasing lend volume. \nAA Cars, our online used cars and vans platform, recovered well \nfollowing the significantly low demand and discounting required \nin the prior year as a result of COVID-19. Volumes of vehicle \ninspections and car finance applications and conversions \nincreased in the period as a result. \nInsurance Underwriting\nOur Insurance Underwriting business continued to grow profits \nin the year.\nThe in-house underwriter business remains well capitalised under \nthe Solvency II capital requirements. As at 31 January 2022, the \nsolvency coverage headroom was 86% over requirement and can \nbe funded from the profits and liquid assets of the underwriter.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED\nStrategic Report\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  23\n22  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

This was predominately attributable to the pension \npast service cost discussed above and the £60m increase in adjusting operating items due to the acquisition transaction expenses \nincurred in the year (see below). In addition, there was a £6m increase in amortisation and depreciation which continues to reflect \nthe historic and ongoing investments in IT and an £11m impairment of property, plant and equipment, see note 12. \nTransaction fees and expenses\nAs part of the acquisition of the Group, both the Group and Basing Bidco Limited (“Bidco”), AA Limited’s new immediate parent entity, \nincurred transaction fees and expenses in an aggregate amount of c.£90m of which £10m were refinancing costs relating to issuance \nof the Class B3 Notes and have been capitalised. Given the significant ongoing benefit to the Group as a result of the significant \ndeleveraging, the Directors agreed that the Group would meet a substantial proportion of the transaction fees. £64m of transaction \nfees were incurred in the period and expensed as adjusting operating items (see note 5) in addition to the £16m expensed in the \nprior year. Bidco made a further equity injection of £17m towards these costs, with the remainder met using cash from the Group. \nShare schemes\nIn accordance with the terms of the Scheme of Arrangement by which the acquisition of the Group was affected, the Group’s ESIP \nand PSP share schemes vested to differing extents on 8 March 2021 and the relevant underlying share awards were subsequently \npurchased by Bidco.

This reflected a strong recovery \nfollowing the impact of COVID-19 last year and was despite the tough economic environment seen in Insurance. \nRoadside Trading EBITDA increased 4% with favourable trading performance in B2C and Driving Schools partially offset by higher \ngaraging spend due to the higher number of breakdowns and investment in brand marketing. \nInsurance Trading EBITDA fell by 10% to £55m (FY21: £61m), with the Insurance Trading EBITDA margin slightly down from 36% to \n33% again due to the lower motor new business commissions. Looking forward we expect market pricing volatility throughout the \nfirst half of FY23 but a steady return to normal levels of claims frequency and general claims inflation will inevitably lead to increasing \nmarket prices. \nTrading EBITDA margin was stable at 35% (2021: 35%), with resilient Roadside Trading EBITDA margins offsetting the anticipated \nreduction in Insurance Trading margins due to the impact of lower motor new business commissions noted above.\nReconciliation of Trading EBITDA to operating profit\nTrading EBITDA is a performance measure required under the terms of our debt documents and is used for calculating our debt \ncovenants. The Group also shows Trading EBITDA as a measure of underlying trading performance.

This is a highly technical matter that has involved a detailed legal analysis to determine whether any additional \nliabilities needed to be recognised by the Group. The legal analysis was completed and the approach required to address this matter \nwas agreed between the Group and the AAUK pension scheme Trustee on 26 November 2021, crystalising the recognition of a \npension past service cost of £26m and corresponding increase to the pension liability.

      "text": "The change in ownership has been highly beneficial for the Group. The total investment made by AA Limited shareholders as part \nof the acquisition of the Group was £596m, which includes the £218m acquisition price. Of the £378m equity injection, £361m has \nbeen invested in deleveraging to pay down debt held within the AA Intermediate Co Limited group. The combination of reduced debt \nrequirements and substantially improved market pricing has resulted in significant improvements in interest costs for the Group. \nThe reduced pressure on financing costs provides the group with the operational freedom to drive the business forward, to better \nserve its customers and capitalise on its considerable strengths. The committed, long-term owners of the AA Limited group are \nexpected to support the growth of the business and to invest in critical areas such as IT transformation which in turn, will generate \nnew and better opportunities for customers.\nNet finance costs decreased by £24m to £142m (2021: £166m) due to lower external borrowings costs and lower adjusting finance \ncosts. External borrowing costs reduced mainly as a result of the refinancing of the £570m Class B2 Notes at an interest rate of \n6.5% in March 2021 which were repaid using the £280m proceeds from the Class B3 Notes issued in January 2021 and £261m \nequity contribution from Bidco. Adjusting finance costs reduced from £20m to £5m as the prior year included the costs of an early \nrepayment premium related to the repayment of A5 Notes and £14m write off of issue fees.\nProfit before tax\nOn account of the transaction fees and pension past service cost outlined above, profit before tax in the year fell to a loss of £23m \n(2021: profit of £52m).\nTaxation\nThe tax charge for the year decreased by £8m to £4m (2021: tax charge of £12m) reflecting the loss before tax offset by several \nadjustments most notably relating to an adjustment for Corporate Interest Restriction and in relation to the transaction fees and \nexpenses described above. The tax charge consisted of a current tax charge of £14m (2021: £14m) and a deferred tax credit of \n£10m (2021: credit of £2m). The effective tax rate was (17.4%) (2021: 23.1%), see note 9. \nProfit after tax \nWe made a loss after tax of £27m (2021: profit of £40m) reflecting the transaction fees associated with the acquisition and debt \nfinancing arrangements of the Group and the pension past service cost noted above. \nAssets held for sale\nDuring the year, the Topco Board approved the sale of two properties. Purchasers for both properties have been identified and legal \nterms are being negotiated. The sales are expected to complete within 10 months of the year end. The properties have been presented \nas assets held for sale in the statement of financial position and have been remeasured to the lower of carrying amount and fair value \nless cost to sell, which has resulted in an impairment of £11m included within administrative expenses in the income statement.\nPension liabilities\nThe AAUK pension scheme was in surplus as at 31 January 2022. The significant movement since 31 January 2021 was mainly due \nto an increase in corporate bond yields over the period, which drive the discount rate and an increase in assets due to higher-than-\nexpected asset returns, partially offset by an increase in future inflation expectations. It also incorporates a £13m gain resulting from \nthe incorporation of the inter-valuation experience for the AAPMP, as well as the impact of Barber equalisation for the UK Scheme \nwhich has been recognised as a one-off past service cost as noted above. \nIn February 2020, the triennial actuarial review was completed for the AAUK pension scheme as at 31 March 2019. The agreed \nrecovery plan with the pension trustees aims to eliminate the technical provisions deficit by July 2025. The Group has committed \nto paying an additional (above the Asset-Backed Funding scheme payments) £10m per annum from April 2020 to March 2021, \n£11m per annum from April 2021 to March 2022 and £12m per annum from April 2022 to July 2025. \nFollowing closure of the CARE section of the AAUK pension scheme in March 2020, transitional arrangements were agreed with all \nemployees costing c.£11m over three years starting from 1 April 2020. Following closure of the AAUK scheme to future accrual, the \nongoing volatility from accrual costs has been removed but future volatility of deficit costs does remain. The impact of COVID-19 \non the global financial markets has meant higher fluctuation of the funding level in the AAUK scheme, albeit partially mitigated by \nthe de-risked investment strategy and high levels of hedging. Therefore, the contributions required from the Group could increase \nfollowing completion of the 2022 triennial valuation. \nCash flow and liquidity\nFree cash flow\n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\nTrading EBITDA\n345\n341\nWorking capital and provisions excluding adjusting operating items\n(8)\n(8)\nPension deficit reduction contributions\n(27)\n(25)\nOther items\n–\n(1)\nCash flow from continuing operating activities before taxation,  \nadjusting operating items and capital expenditure\n310\n307\nTax paid\n(10)\n(15)\nCapital expenditure including capital and interest payments on leases  \nless proceeds from sale of fixed assets\n(102)\n(93)\nOperating free cash flow after capital expenditure\n198\n199\nInterest on borrowings \n(123)\n(137)\nFinancial investments\n(10)\n–\nAcquisition of own shares\n–\n(2)\nAcquisitions, disposals and investment in joint ventures\n(1)\n(4)\nOperating free cash flow before adjusting operating items\n64\n56\nAdjusting operating Items\n(86)\n(16)\nFree cash flow\n(22)\n40\nPurchase of Bonds/Debt refinancing activities\n(429)\n(14)\nEquity contribution\n378\n–\nNet (decrease) / increase in cash and cash equivalents \n(73)\n26\nWe remain well within our financial covenants, have good levels of liquidity and continue to generate positive operating cash flow. \nWe saw a free cash outflow in the current year of £22m (2021: £40m inflow) before the costs of purchasing bonds, refinancing and \nequity contributions. The outflow was predominately due to the one-off transaction fees and expenses incurred following the \nacquisition and deleveraging of the Group. \nWorking capital and provisions excluding adjusting operating items was an outflow of £8m in the current year and prior year. The \noutflow was due to timing of cash receipts and lower insurance broker volumes around the year end, which impacted the working \ncapital position. \nCapital expenditure was up £13m at £77m (FY21: £64m) as projects delayed in FY21 due to COVID-19 were able to gain momentum in \nFY22. Investment has gone into core re-platforming, new digital propositions and upgrades to our data and operational infrastructure.\nPension deficit reduction payments of £27m (2021: £25m) were in line with the agreement made with the Pension Trustees in \nFebruary 2020. \nWe are required to hold segregated funds as ‘restricted cash’ to satisfy requirements governing our regulated businesses, including \nthe Insurance Underwriting business. These restricted cash balances have decreased to £29m (2021: £40m) as we have increased \ninvestment in highly rated bonds (see note 18). \nInterest cover is calculated as the ratio of Trading EBITDA to total ongoing cash finance costs (see note 29) and was 2.7x (2021: 2.5x).\nCapital management \nFollowing the delisting of the Group in March 2021, capital is represented by our net debt position. As at 31 January 2022, net debt \nwas £2.3bn, a reduction of £0.3bn compared to the prior year. \nThe Directors aim to reduce both the amount of net debt and the cost of servicing it over time through the successful delivery of our \nstrategy as well as a proactive approach to managing our debt. We continue to have significant headroom in respect of our covenants \nand in addition to the Senior Term Facility the Group has a Working Capital Facility available of £56m, of which £46m is available for \ncash drawings and remained undrawn at 31 January 2022.\nAs part of our commitment to proactively manage our debt and with the support of our new owners, following the acquisition of the \nGroup in March 2021, the proceeds of the £280m Class B3 Notes issued in January 2021 were released from escrow and combined \nwith an equity contribution of £261m from Bidco in order to prepay and redeem the Class B2 Notes. In addition, £29m aggregate \nprincipal amount of Class B2 Notes which were held by AA Limited were surrendered for cancellation. As a result, all £570m \nof outstanding Class B2 Notes were redeemed as part of this refinancing. The Group also entered into a new £150m Senior Term \nFacility which it drew down immediately and used, in combination with £50m of cash, to refinance its existing £200m Senior \nTerm Facility. Alongside this, the Group agreed a new £160m Liquidity Facility which remains undrawn and cancelled its existing \nLiquidity Facility of £165m.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED\nStrategic Report\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  27\n26  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "Subsequently, on 21 July 2021 the Group issued £270m of Class A9 Notes at an interest rate of 3.25%. The proceeds of this issue \nwere used on 1 November 2021, along with a further equity contribution of £100m from Bidco, to repay the £372m of outstanding \nClass A5 Notes. \nBidco provided a further equity contribution of £17m towards the transaction fees incurred by the Group. \nThe pricing for both the Class B3 and Class A9 Notes was at a substantially lower rate than our previous expectation prior to the \nacquisition of the Group and gives us the confidence that we can accelerate our plans for growth and continue reducing our leverage.\nOn 20 July 2021, S&P Global Ratings reaffirmed the credit rating of the Group’s Class A Notes at BBB- and the Class B3 Notes at B+.\nOur leverage ratio significantly reduced to 6.6x at 31 January 2022 compared to 7.6x in the prior year representing a positive shift \ntowards a rebalanced capital structure. \nIn light of the Group’s continued positive performance, the Group intends to continue to proactively manage its capital structure \nsubject to market conditions. \nCapital structure as at 31 January 2022 \nExpected \nmaturity date\nInterest rate\n%\nPrincipal\n£m\nSenior Term Facility\n10 March 2026\n3.31\n150\nClass A2 Notes\n31 July 2025\n6.27\n500\nClass A6 Notes\n31 July 2023\n2.75\n250\nClass A7 Notes\n31 July 2024\n4.88\n550\nClass A8 Notes\n31 July 2027\n5.50\n325\nClass A9 Notes\n31 July 2028\n3.25\n270\nClass B3 Notes\n31 January 2026\n6.50\n280\nTotal loan notes\n4.94\n2,325\nLease liabilities\n48\nCash and cash equivalents\n(112)\nTotal net debt / capital\n2,261\nThe weighted average interest rate for all borrowings of 4.94% has been calculated using the effective interest rate and carrying \nvalues as at 31 January 2022.\nThe majority of the Groups borrowings are long-term in nature, with no borrowings due within 12 months from the date of signing \nof these financial statements. It remains a key assumption of the Directors that the Group continues to have ready access to public \ndebt markets to enable these borrowings to be refinanced in due course. \nIn July 2021, the Group completed a highly successful refinancing of its outstanding A5 notes, issuing £270m of A9 notes at a coupon \nof 3.25% with a 7x oversubscribed order book. The Group will continue to seek to refinance its maturities within good time of their \nscheduled maturities. It is expected that market conditions in the coming months will be more challenging than in the past with \nsignificant macroeconomic concerns around interest rates and inflation as well as substantial geopolitical risk. However, despite \nthese concerns, the Group still expects to be able to access markets at a suitable time and refinance its debt at affordable prices.\nAt the date of approval of these financial statements and considering each of these points along with the projected cash flows for \na period of one year from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, the Directors have concluded that they \nhave confidence that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue trading for this period and will be able to secure financing so \nas to be able to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due. \nThe Company continues to evaluate the optimal refinancing strategy of its debt maturities and coupon payments, including the \nA Notes, B Notes and Senior Term Facility. Early redemption of the Class A Notes would result in make-whole interest penalties up \nto the expected maturity date, except the Class A6, Class A7, Class A8, and Class A9 Notes which can be settled without penalty \nwithin two months, three months, six months and six months respectively of the expected maturity date. The Class B3 Notes would \nattract a make-whole payment if they were to be redeemed before 31 January 2023, thereafter any voluntary repayment would be \nmade at a fixed premium until 31 January 2025 after which there would be no premium to pay on redemption.\nOur going concern assessment shown on page 71, highlights our cash generative nature, our ability to service the interest obligations \non our debt and the risks associated with refinancing.\nThe Group remains committed to the proactive management of its capital structure and will continue to assess all options as we go \nthrough FY23.\nNet debt \nWithin the Group there is a Whole Business Securitisation (WBS) structure. All of the Class A Notes within the WBS are secured by \nfirst ranking security in respect of the undertakings and assets of AA Intermediate Co Limited (a subsidiary of the Company) and its \nsubsidiaries. The Class A facility security over the AA Intermediate Co Limited group’s assets ranks ahead of the Class B3 Notes. \nThe Class B3 Notes have first ranking security over the assets of the immediate parent undertaking of the AA Intermediate Co Limited \ngroup, AA Mid Co Limited. Thus cash held by the AA Intermediate group is ring-fenced within the WBS.

The levels of risk are \narticulated through a series of risk appetite statements, and we monitor ourselves closely against the \nstatements through our risk governance and our risk management framework. Further information \nabout the corporate governance arrangements for the AA is set out in the Chair’s Statement on \npage 4 and the Directors’ Report on pages 52-57. \nRisk Governance\nThe AA operates a three lines of defence model to ensure that its \nrisks and opportunities are identified, assessed, monitored and \nmanaged in line with its stated risk appetite.\nThe three lines of defence model can be summarised as follows:\n›\t First line of defence: the business units that run the business, \nthey are accountable for the day to day management of the \nAA, which includes identifying and managing their risks;\n›\t Second line of defence: the AA’s Group Risk and Compliance \nfunction, they are accountable for providing oversight, \nchallenge and advice to the first line; and\n›\t Third line of defence: the AA’s Internal Audit function, they \nare accountable for providing assurance to the business by \nperforming independent reviews about the first and second \nlines of defence. \nRisk management framework \nThe AA’s risk management framework aims to ensure that:\n›\t risks are made visible;\n›\t risks are discussed and understood; \n›\t risks are owned and managed;\n›\t appropriate action is taken;\n›\t risks are used for opportunities; and\n›\t we learn from our risk-taking.\nThe risk management framework is comprised of the five pillars set out below.\nRisk culture and governance\nThe processes and structures to demonstrate to the Topco Board that effective risk \nmanagement, oversight and assurance is being undertaken for all key risks faced by \nthe AA.\nStrategy and objectives\nThe process to ensure that risk is considered as part of strategy and objectives, including \nthe direction it sets for taking, avoiding and considering opportunity from risk. \nRisk identification and prioritisation\nA set of key risk categories to identify where the AA has, or is likely to have, \nmaterial risk exposures and the activities we perform to prioritise our actions.\nRisk management and controls\nA set of processes to review and assess the risk and control environment. Risks are \nassessed on an inherent (no controls), residual (with controls) and target basis to help \nsenior management understand and manage their risk exposures. The AA will be \nundertaking a comprehensive review of its controls in 2022 as part of its continuous \nimprovement of the risk management framework.\nRisk reporting and communication\nThe information and reporting in place to support senior management in discharging \ntheir risk management accountabilities effectively and to help them make informed, \nrisk-based decisions. \nOwn Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA)\nThe AA has an in-house underwriter in Gibraltar who are subject to Solvency II compliance. As such, they operate a defined set of \ncapital management processes to ensure its solvency and liquidity needs are met on a current and forward-looking basis. Results \nof the ORSA are presented to the underwriter’s Board and the conclusions of the assessment are used to inform strategic \ndecision-making.\nPrincipal Risks and Opportunities\nPrincipal risks and opportunities are defined as the risks and opportunities that are likely to have a material impact on the AA’s \nbusiness strategy.\nThe principal risks faced by the AA over the last year are summarised in the table below. We monitor and assess these risks very \nclosely to ensure they are managed appropriately and effectively.\nCUSTOMER RISK\nThe risk that the AA fails to constantly \nmonitor, manage and develop the \ninteraction between our agents and \ncustomers to ensure fair treatment \nand good outcomes\nRisk trend\n\nPotential impact\nFinancial services products and services are continually evolving in the market and \nas customer needs are changing, there is a risk that products do not perform as \ncustomers expect and that they no longer deliver appropriate customer outcomes.\nMitigation\nThe AA has a robust product governance framework in place to ensure that it continually \nreviews and adapts the products and services it offers to ensure customers receive fair \ntreatment and good outcomes.\nOPERATIONAL RESILIENCE \nThe risk of failure to adequately \nprepare, respond and recover from \ndisruptive events or stress scenarios \nleading to disruptions to internal and \nexternal services provided by the AA\nRisk trend\n\nPotential impact\nDisruptive events can have a severe impact on our ability to deliver the products and \nservices we offer to our customers. 2021 saw a continuation of home working and \nintermittent disruption to businesses following the effects of the global pandemic. \nIn addition, supply chain disruption impacted the availability of HGV drivers and fuel.\nMitigation\nThe AA has an effective homeworking infrastructure in place to mitigate the disruption \nof the global pandemic for office-based services. To address driver shortages, we \nadapted our recruitment and retention strategy, which included the introduction of \ntraining and apprenticeship initiatives. We also have processes in place to continually \nassess external events that may affect our operational resilience.\nCYBER SECURITY\nThe risk of failure to detect fraudulent \nor unauthorised modification of IT \nresources, physical or virtual theft of \nassets and events that compromise \nbusiness critical data\nRisk trend\n \n \nPotential impact\nCyber attacks are becoming more and more sophisticated and businesses are becoming \nincreasingly vulnerable to cyber threats due to their reliance on IT infrastructure. \nMitigation\nThe AA has a clearly defined cyber security strategy and it invests significant resources \nin controls that enable it to prevent, identify, detect and correct potential cyber-related \nissues. In addition, the AA benchmarks its security controls against the Standard for \nInformation Security (ISO27001) and an annual review of the effectiveness of these \ncontrols is performed by an independent third party.\nINSURANCE RISK \nThe risk that we have higher claims \ncosts than anticipated or that market \nconditions impact our commercials\nRisk trend\n\nPotential impact\nThe UK continued to experience market volatility in 2021 due to COVID-19 and Brexit. \nThere are risks of higher than expected claims frequency, higher average cost per claim \nor catastrophic claims. \nMitigation\nThe AA has an agile pricing methodology that enables it to adapt to movement in the \nmarket. Underwriting guidelines are used to ensure that claims frequency and costs \nremain within expected levels. The AA also has a robust reinsurance programme in place \nto ensure that it can meet its future liabilities. The reinsurance structure using coinsurance \nand quota share proportionately reduces the AA’s risk. Excess of loss and catastrophe \nreinsurance is also used to protect against costly individual claims and events.\nStrategic Report\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  33\n32  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

Credit rating, stakeholder management, financial market conditions and interest \nrates are all important factors. The position has become more favourable since the \nchange of ownership, although financing costs are expected to increase as a result of \nrising interest rates as the economy sees higher levels of inflation.\nMitigation\nSince the change of ownership, shareholders have injected £361m of new equity for the \npurpose of reducing debt. This has reduced refinancing costs for the debt that remains \nso that the AA has a sustainable financing structure. This has also supported the credit \nrating profile. The AA continues to monitor financial markets and pricing and cultivates \nrelationships with credit rating agencies and bond investors. It seeks to refinance bonds \nwell ahead of their maturity dates. The AA also has good levels of available cash as well \nas a Working Capital Facility of £56m, of which £46m is available for cash drawings.\nREGULATORY RISK\nThe risk of failing to comply \nwith regulatory changes, obtain \nthe required authorisations/ \nlicencing and meet reporting \nrequirements imposed by \nrelevant regulatory authorities\nRisk trend\n\nPotential impact\n2021 was a period of substantial regulatory change as general insurance firms prepared \nthemselves for complying with the package of remedies set out under the FCA’s General \nInsurance Pricing Practices rules, and note that there are a number of other significant \nregulatory changes on the horizon. Transformation linked to Regulatory change, \nalongside our strategic transformation ambitions presents a heightened risks around \nability to implement change effectively and inline with regulatory requirements. \nMitigation\nThe AA has effective processes in place to proactively identify incoming regulatory \nchange and in doing so, it was able to mobilise a programme to prepare for the required \nchanges and ensure its systems and processes were updated ahead of the pricing \npractices rules coming into force. \nWe have also started to look ahead to a new set of proposals coming into force in 2023 \n(Consumer Duty) that require a fundamental shift in mindsets across the financial services \nindustry. We will be mobilising a programme of work from early 2022 to ensure we \nremain well-positioned to support changes that will drive the highest standards of \nbehaviour and support for retail consumers. We are also working to implement a \nfinancial reporting standard (IFRS 17) which we need to apply for our FY24 reporting \nand that requires accounting, system and operational changes. \nWe manage risks around conflict, and execution of regulatory change programmes \nthrough our transformation governance processes.\nHEALTH AND SAFETY RISK\nThe risk we are unable to \nmaintain the safety of our \nworkforce and customers\nRisk trend\n\nPotential impact\nVehicles breaking down at the roadside is inherently dangerous and it is absolutely vital \nthat we continue to maintain a safe environment for our members and for our workforce. \nMitigation\nThe AA has a robust and externally audited integrated health, safety and environmental \n(HS&E) management system, as well as local arrangements where appropriate. \nWe regularly review all our HS&E risks to ensure that our control environment remains \nstrong and effective. \nWe have a dedicated team of health and safety advisers who are all members of the \nInstitution of Occupational Safety and Health – we deploy best practice internally \nand externally. \nMonitoring and oversight of the management of our HSE risks is strong, with performance \nreviewed at our executive risk committee and Board meetings.\nWe are an active member of SURVIVE, the industry group working towards improving \nsafety for those working at the roadside and we have an external expert chair of our core \nHealth and Safety Committee, to ensure good governance and independent scrutiny. \nRisk Trend key:\n\t Risk exposure has increased\n\t Risk exposure has reduced\n\t Risk exposure remained the same\nEmerging Risks\nIn addition to monitoring the risks currently faced by the AA, we \nidentify risks and opportunities on the horizon i.e. the risks and \nopportunities that could have a material impact on the AA in \nthe future but where the timescale and/or impact due to the \nnature of the risks remains uncertain.\nThe monitoring and management of emerging risks is a key part \nof the AA’s strategic risk management process since the risks \nand opportunities can lead to changes in business strategy or \noperational ways of working that support the AA in it delivering \nlong-term value to members, customers, employees and sponsors.\nEmerging risks are identified using a PESTLE analysis, which \ncategorises the risks into six high level themes:\nRisk type\nExamples\nPolitical\n›\t Current tax policy or future tax policy \n›\t Monetary policy\n›\t Stability of Government\nEconomic \n›\t Economic growth\n›\t Interest rates or exchange rates\n›\t Inflation\nSocial\n›\t Health and safety consciousness\n›\t Consumer behaviour \n›\t Brand and image\nTechnology\n›\t Competing technology development\n›\t Vehicle automation\n›\t Artificial intelligence\nLegal \n›\t Regulatory change\n›\t Consumer laws\n›\t Advertising laws\nEnvironmental \n›\t Climate change \n›\t Governance\n›\t Energy availability and cost\nWe report on our emerging risks to our executive risk committee \nand relevant Group company Boards.

We actively strive to enhance both the \nphysical and mental wellbeing of our people and ensure that our \npeople and those within our care get home safely every day. \nThe AA continued to drive its safety-first approach with a specific \nfocus to get everyone home safely every day. This year saw a \npositive performance with key milestones outlined below: \n›\t Awarded The Royal Society for the \nPrevention of Accidents (RoSPA) Gold \naward for demonstrating high health and \nsafety standards\n›\t Continued to lead the campaign to improve \nthe safety of ‘smart’ motorways\n›\t We had fewer Accidents/Incidents in 2021 than 2020 despite \nthe number of cases worked on increasing. The number of \naccidents/incidents has decreased by 28% since 2019\n›\t Near miss reporting increased (>111%: 2021 and >33%: 2020) \nwhich enables the proactive management of identified issues\n›\t We recorded Accident Incidence rates, Lost Time Incident \nFrequency rates and RIDDOR incidence rates to enable \nexternal benchmarking\n\t› We had a lower Accident Incidence Rate (AIR) in 2021 \nthan in 2020 \n\t› We had a similar Lost Time Incidence Rate in 2021 and \n2020 with only one more time loss incident recorded\n\t› We calculated a blended industry-based target to best match \nour activities from an indoor and outdoor perspective. In both \nareas we performed notably better than our industry target\n›\t The number of total RIDDOR reports was higher in 2021 than \nin 2020 however was an improvement on previous years\n›\t The number of days lost due to incidents increased in 2021 \n(>23%) . This will be a focus area for improvement in 2022\n›\t We maintained our record of zero fatalities\nThe AA has invested in protective controls from the outset of the \npandemic and continued to go above and beyond to protect its \npeople, its members and the wider community this year. The \nGroup has continued to implement robust COVID-19 controls in \n2021 to ensure our people have appropriately safe workplaces \nand our members can safely receive the services they require.\n2021 continued to be an unusual year due to COVID-19. Whilst \nlast year’s health and safety performance was inevitably \nimpacted positively by a reduction and change in workload \nand the increase in homeworking, there was also an intensified \nfocus on our safe working practices. As such, exceeding or \nmeeting 2020 performance standards in 2021 was hoped for \nbut not guaranteed. The AA has however has largely met this \nchallenge and is satisfied with its performance in 2021. We will \ncontinue to strive to improve and will ensure safety is at the \nheart of decision making for our people, our members, and the \nwider community.\nEnvironmental performance \nEnvironmental impact remains important to the AA, and we will \nbe publishing a separate Environmental, Social and \nGovernance (ESG) report by July 2022 to discuss our activities \nin more detail and our future direction. As a result, for our \nAnnual Report and Accounts we will only be reporting on \napplicable statutory environmental requirements. The ESG \nreport will contain additional supporting information about the \nactivities undertaken but also future direction.\nStreamlined Energy & Carbon Reporting (SECR)\nClimate change represents one of the greatest challenges \nfacing our planet. At the AA, we are committed to supporting the \ntransition to a low-carbon economy to meet the science-based \nrecommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange (IPCC). Our emissions are generated across the AA’s \noperations, including at sites, by vehicles and through \ncolleague travel.\nThe AA’s goal is to conduct current and future business \noperations in a sustainable manner which helps create a better \nfuture for the environment. Our largest environmental impact \nfrom our direct operations comes from our fleet and buildings. \nTherefore, the Group has established the following emission \nreduction targets:\n›\t Buildings – Maintain 2019/20 (AR20) levels of consumption \n(metric: emissions per square foot)\n›\t Operational Fleet – Achieve 5% reduction in overall road \noperations fuel use (litres) compared to 2019/20 (AR20) \nlevels of consumption.\n1\t\nAn amendment to last year’s ARA should be noted. The updated figures for AR21 Total carbon emissions can be found in table four: total carbon emissions on page 39. The amendment did \nnot result in a material difference but resulted in a worse performance than previously reported.\nThis report contains the entire Greenhouse Gas inventory for \nAR22, for all the areas of our business where we have \noperational control. It includes the data from this financial year \nand, for the sake of comparison, data from the previous \nfinancial years AR21 and AR20, which is also our baseline year \nfor our Corporate and Signs locations. \nIn AR22, the AA Limited had a carbon footprint comprised of \nScope 1, 2 and (limited) 3 of 35,872 tCO2e using a location-based \napproach. This is an increase of 307 tCO2e compared to AR211 \nand has primarily been driven by an increase in gas emissions \n(scope 1) generated to maintain a standard temperature whilst \nensuring 100% fresh air in our premises throughout this year. \nThis decision was actively made to ensure a safe working \nenvironment for our people during COVID-19. We have achieved \na decrease of 7,601 tCO2e (-17%) against base year (AR20). \nWe continue our development of operational and company car \nfleet options to optimise available and suitable lower carbon \nalternatives. In addition, we will review deployment options and \nmobilise suitable options to reduce our fleet emissions and \npurchase electricity from Renewable Energy Guarantees of \nOrigin (REGO) assured renewable sources for our buildings. \nMethodology\nTo comply with Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting \n(SECR), the AA has reported on all the emission sources required \nunder The Companies (Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability \nPartnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018. \nPreviously we reported as the AA plc, so comparison years of \nAR20 and AR21 now reflect emissions from sites under our \noperational control as the AA Limited (i.e. ability to influence, \nmanage and track energy use and/or emissions from an \noperation). Our emissions have been calculated in line with the \nGHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard \n(revised edition). We calculated our Scope 2 emissions using \na dual reporting approach, publishing both a location-based \nfootprint (using regional average grid-mix), and a market-based \nfootprint (determined from suppliers’ standard fuel mix). Emission \nfactors are provided by suppliers when feasible to cover REGO \nor conventional supplies. Where this is not available, UK Residual \nMix by the Association of Issuing Bodes (AIB, 2021) factors have \nbeen used. \nIt should be noted that some data which had previously been \ndisclosed in the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts may differ \nto the data declared in this report. Where improvements have \nbeen made to our reporting process, and where able, these \nhave retrospectively been applied to historical data. \nReported emissions align with our financial year and in line with \nSECR requirements, the emissions in scope are based on an \noperational control boundary. \nThe AA undertakes third party verification to independently verify \nthe accuracy, completeness and consistency of GHG emissions \ndata (operational control scope only) against ISO 14064-1 and \nISO 14064-3. The AR20 (our baseline), AR21 and AR22 data \nhave been independently assured by a third party. \nFor our detailed GHG inventory and verification statement \nplease visit www.theaacorporate.com/esg\nStatement from the Independent \nHealth and Safety Chair\nThe independent chair concluded that Health, \nSafety & Environment (HS&E) within the AA is \n‘sector leading and well-structured that fulfils \nits statutory objectives effectively’.\nMuch work had been done within the \nHS&E arena to:\n›\t Formulate colleague competence through \nreview of the structured training and \ncompliance of that training\n›\t Review of the wellbeing program and \ndelivery at a time of a global pandemic\n›\t Held flexible reviews of safe working for \nfront-line colleagues and customers \nthroughout the pandemic\nStrategic Report\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  37\n36  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

We expect all our people to learn and grow and are committed \nto making sure they have access to learning solutions to keep pace with the changing needs of our customers and our business. \nWe recognise that the foundation of effective development is on the job experience, coaching and mentoring and therefore we \nintroduced a new Leadership Essentials curriculum in 2021/22 to support our leaders in the foundations of effective leadership. In \naddition, we introduced a new leadership capability framework and 360 feedback process. \nOur people accessed over 100,000 hours of learning in 2021/22, equating to over two days of learning per person. We invested in \nonline resources and virtual delivery to ensure we could continue to support our people. \nWe continue to onboard entry talent and 120 apprentices completed their programmes with 90% achieving a distinction. We also \nintroduced a new apprenticeship programme to develop HGV drivers. The AA has 205 apprentices and we use apprenticeships to \nprovide professional development to our existing people. Over 70% of our apprentices are internal and we provide entry level to \npost-graduate level qualifications. We also have gender diverse apprentices with almost an equal split of males and females. \nAttracting Talent \nIn an increasingly tough talent market, we have continued to attract great talent to the AA. For example, by introducing remote \nworking to attract diverse and geographically dispersed talent. This has proved very successful. \nWe have trained our hiring managers in recruitment skills and have updated and enhanced our selection tools to ensure our leaders \nare reflecting our AA values and behaviours. \nRespect for human rights \nThe AA respects human rights and it is committed to safe operations throughout its supply chain and has a zero-tolerance policy \ntowards modern slavery or violation of human rights.

      "text": "S172(1) STATEMENT\nOur Directors make decisions with our stakeholders, and the long-term, in mind\nSection 172 of the Companies Act 2006 (Section 172) requires company directors to act in the way that they consider, in good faith, \nwould be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members, as a whole.\nIn this s172(1) statement, the term ‘Director’ refers to the two statutory directors of AA Limited (the Directors). The Directors’ aim is \nto make sure that their decisions follow a consistent process, by considering the Company’s strategic priorities while working within \na governance framework for key decision-making that takes into account all relevant stakeholders and balances their various interests. \nThe Directors have considered the need to act fairly between stakeholders and continue to maintain high standards of business \nconduct. Nevertheless, the Directors acknowledge that stakeholder interests may conflict with each other and that not every decision \ncan result in a positive outcome for all stakeholders.\nThe table below sets out how the Directors had regard to the matters set out in s172(1) (a) to (f) of the Companies Act 2006 when \nperforming their duties in respect of the AA (the Company). \nSection 172(1) \nDecisions/considerations \n(a) \u0007the likely consequence of any \ndecision in the long term\nThe Directors play an active role in the development of the Company’s strategy and \ntake into account external factors, including the impact to stakeholders and wider \nsociety and the long-term consequences, when making decisions. \nFurther details can be found in the stakeholder engagement section on pages 44 and \n45 and the Risk Management Framework on page 32.\n(b) \u0007the interests of the \ncompany’s colleagues \nThe Directors recognise that delivery of the AA’s purpose, strategy and long-term \nsustainable growth requires strong employee engagement. Management keeps \nemployees informed of the Company’s plans, vision, purpose and culture through \nvarious events, video blogs and briefings. \nFollowing their appointment during the year, the new CEO and Group Executive \nCommittee were introduced to colleagues across the business and since then, the \nCEO has published a weekly vlog to all employees to keep in touch. The Directors \nhave also measured employee engagement and culture through a number of short \n‘pulse’ surveys and an annual engagement survey. The results of these surveys have \nbeen shared with colleagues and the Directors and senior management have \ndeveloped action plans to respond to this input. \nFurther details can be found in the stakeholder engagement section on pages 44 \nand 45 and the Directors’ Report on pages 55 and 56.\n( c) \u0007the need to foster the company’s \nbusiness relationships with \nsuppliers, customers and others\nThe Directors recognise the importance of the Company developing strong \nrelationships with all its stakeholders and actively seeks opportunities to understand \nthese interests and have effective interaction with its key stakeholders. \nA great example of this is our participation in the SURVIVE Group for roadside safety \nand the connected and autonomous vehicle working group. The Directors have also \nsupported various initiatives in respect of zero emission vehicles and electric vehicles \nand the accessibility of electric vehicle charging points for disabled drivers. \nFurther details can be found in the stakeholder engagement section on pages 44 \nand 45.\n(d) \u0007the impact of the company’s \noperations on the community \nand the environment\nThe Directors understand that ensuring the Company’s operations have a positive \nimpact on the community and environment is of strategic importance. That is why the \nCompany continued to fund the AA Charitable Trust for Road Safety and the \nEnvironment so that it could continue its work on the protection of human life and \nhealth on UK roads, including the launch of a major campaign regarding safety on \nrural roads. \nFurther details can be found in the stakeholder engagement section on pages 44 and \n45 and the health, safety and environmental performance report on pages 36 and 37.\nSection 172(1) \nDecisions/considerations \n(e) \u0007the desirability of the company \nmaintaining a reputation for high \nstandards of business conduct\nThe Directors believe that managing its reputation for high standards of business \nconduct is a key priority. The Directors ensure that an appropriate framework, including \nrelevant policies and codes of conduct, is in place to support this. The Directors are \nmade aware of any issues that may have a material impact on the Company’s reputation \nand operations. \nIn particular, all employees are required to complete mandatory e-learning training, and \nthis includes the AA Code, financial crime, conduct risk and anti-bribery and corruption. \nThe Directors are kept up to date with the completion rates of mandatory training \namongst colleagues via monthly updates. In addition, there are policies in respect of \nthese areas and they are available to all employees via an internal policy library which \nhas been through a comprehensive review process during the year, led by a new \npolicy committee.\nFurther details can be found in the Directors’ Report on page 55.\n(f) \u0007the need to act fairly as between \nthe Company’s owners\nThe Company engages positively with its shareholders and other investors\nSpecifically, the Directors have regular contact with the Company’s two principal \nshareholders and maintains contact with other investors through regular corporate \nreporting on its website and through the accessibility of an Investor Relations function. \nFurther details can be found in the stakeholder engagement section on pages 44 and \n45 and the Directors’ Report on page 55.\nKey stakeholders\nThe Board continuously monitors the AA’s key stakeholders to ensure due consideration is given to all relevant stakeholders in the \ncontext of principal decisions. During the year, the following key stakeholders were identified:\n›\t Our people\n›\t Communities and societies\n›\t Government and regulators\n›\t Industry (including the supply chain)\n›\t Investors\n›\t Customers\nRead more about our engagement with key stakeholders, and our approach to each of the groups mentioned above, on pages 44 \nand 45.\nStrategic Report\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  47\n46  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

Management control of the AA is exercised by the \nTopco Board. Jakob Pfaudler is a director of both the AA and \nTopco boards, so he has a central role in board discussions \nand decision-making about the strategic direction of the AA. \nThe Company’s financial activities are aligned with Topco and \nthe governance structures in respect of Topco apply equally to \nits subsidiaries, including the Company. However, the Directors \nrecognise that from time to time there may be a divergence \nbetween the Company’s stakeholders and Topco stakeholders \nand in such circumstances, they act accordingly in discharging \ntheir duties.

The model distinguishes between \nfunctions that have prime responsibility for identifying, owning and managing risks \n(first line), oversight and control functions (second line) and functions providing \nindependent assurance (third line). All three lines of defence have specific tasks in \nthe internal control governance framework\nTo support this model, the AA has risk policies, defined risk appetites for key risks, \nrisk oversight committees, and clearly documented accountabilities and responsibilities \nfrom the business, through to the management\nThere is an internal control framework with appropriate risk management systems \nin place, which helps to identify emerging and established risks by the Group and \nits stakeholders\nThe AA’s Risk Management Framework Policy requires all areas of the business to \nmaintain a risk register, which must be reviewed at a minimum, on a quarterly basis \nRead more about risk management on pages 32-35\n5.

The Walker \nGuidelines also require disclosure about the main trends and \nfactors likely to affect the future development, performance \nand position of the AA’s business, which are included in ‘Our \nBusiness Model’ and ‘Financial Review’ sections of the Strategic \nReport on pages 12-15 and pages 20-30. \nAuditor information\nThe auditor of the Company is PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. \nInternal controls over financial reporting\nThe Topco Audit and Risk Committee monitors the effectiveness \nof the Group’s risk management framework and internal financial \ncontrols. It should be noted that the Group’s risk management \nsystems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk \nof failure to achieve business objectives and they can only \nprovide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material \nmisstatement or loss. The Topco Audit and Risk Committee \nreceives copies of relevant internal audit plans and reports in \naddition to finance updates and risk reports from the Chief \nRisk Officer. The Head of Internal Audit and Group Financial \nController attend all Committee meetings, the chair of the \nCommittee regularly meets with the Chief Risk Officer and \nHead of Internal Audit.\nDirectors’ indemnities and insurance\nThe Company maintains appropriate directors’ and officers’ \nliability insurance cover. The Company also grants indemnities to \neach of its Directors to the extent permitted by law. Qualifying \nthird-party indemnity provisions (as defined by Section 234 of \nthe Act) were in force during the year ended 31 January 2022 \nand remain in force, in relation to certain losses and liabilities \nwhich the Directors may incur to third parties in the course of \nacting as Directors, of the Group. \nEmployee engagement\nWe remain committed to employee engagement throughout \nthe business. Employees are kept updated on the AA’s strategy \nand progress through regular communication emails and updates \non the AA’s intranet page. Further details of our workforce \nengagement and our people can be found on page 42. There \nare clear and transparent policies in place for employees to \nraise concerns about misconduct and unethical practices at the \nAA, which include but are not limited to: Whistleblowing Policy, \nConflicts of Interest Policy, and Anti-Bribery and Allowable Gifts, \nHospitality and Donations Policy. \nThe Board believes that a shared vision and organisational culture \nacross the organisation inform the management’s decision \nmaking. This is supported by regular employee engagement \nsurveys, which address and monitor how well the \norganisational culture and values between senior management \nand their colleagues are aligned. \nThe latest employee engagement survey, held in November 2021, \nhad a response rate of 81% and an employee engagement score \nof 61%. Read more about how the Board has engaged with our \npeople in the stakeholder engagement summary on page 44.\nEmployees with disabilities \nThe AA is proud of our policy that people with any disability \nshould have full and fair consideration for all vacancies. \nDuring the year, we continued to demonstrate our commitment \nto interviewing those people with disabilities who fulfil the \nminimum criteria and we endeavour to retain employees in the \nworkforce if they become disabled during employment. \nGoing concern \nThe Group’s operations are highly cash generative with a large \nproportion of its revenues coming from recurring transactions. \nThe significant customer loyalty demonstrated by high renewal \nrates and lengthy customer tenure underpins this and, in addition \nto the cash balances at the reporting date, the Group has agreed \nundrawn credit facilities. The majority of the Group’s borrowings \nare long term in nature, with no borrowings due within 12 months \nfrom the date of signing of these financial statements. For the \nGroup’s longer-term viability, it remains a key assumption of the \nDirectors that the Group continues to have ready access to public \ndebt markets to enable these borrowings to be refinanced in \ndue course.\nIn July 2021, the Group completed a highly successful refinancing \nof its outstanding A5 notes, issuing £270m of A9 notes at a \ncoupon of 3.25% with a 7x oversubscribed order book. The Group \nwill continue to seek to refinance its maturities within good time \nof their scheduled maturities, including the refinancing of £250m \nof A6 notes which are due to mature in July 2023. It is expected \nthat market conditions in the coming months will be more \nchallenging than in the past with significant macroeconomic \nconcerns around interest rates and inflation as well as substantial \ngeopolitical risk. However, despite these concerns, the Group \nstill expects to be able to access markets at a suitable time and \nrefinance its debt at affordable prices.\nThe Directors have reviewed projected cash flows for a period \nof one year from the date of signing these financial statements \nand have concluded that the Group has sufficient funds to \ncontinue trading for this period and the foreseeable future. \nTherefore, the financial statements have been prepared using \nthe going concern basis.\nPolitical donations and expenditure\nNo political donations were made during the year ended \n31 January 2022 (2021: £nil). The AA has a policy of not making \ndonations to political organisations or independent election \ncandidates or incurring political expenditure anywhere in the \nworld as defined by relevant legislation. \nSuppliers’ payment policy \nIt is the Company’s policy to develop and maintain key commercial \nrelationships with its suppliers and to obtain mutually agreeable \npayment terms. For the full year ended 31 January 2022, the \naverage time taken to pay invoices was 18.08 days. Further \ninformation can be obtained from the Government’s payment \npractice reporting portal. \nThe Directors’ Report has been approved by the Board on \n12 April 2022 and signed on its behalf by: \nJakob Pfaudler \nChief Executive Officer \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED\nDirectors’ responsibilities statement \nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report \nand the financial statements in accordance with applicable law \nand regulation.\nCompany law requires the Directors to prepare financial \nstatements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors \nhave prepared the Group financial statements in accordance \nwith UK-adopted international accounting standards and the \ncompany financial statements in accordance with United \nKingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United \nKingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced \nDisclosure Framework”, and applicable law).\nUnder company law, the Directors must not approve the \nfinancial statements unless they are satisfied that they give \na true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and \nCompany and of the profit or loss of the Group and Company \nfor that period. In preparing the financial statements, the \nDirectors are required to:\n›\t select suitable accounting policies and then apply \nthem consistently;\n›\t state whether applicable UK-adopted international accounting \nstandards have been followed for the Group financial \nstatements and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, \ncomprising FRS 101, have been followed for the Company \nfinancial statements, subject to any material departures \ndisclosed and explained in the financial statements;\n›\t make judgements and accounting estimates that are \nreasonable and prudent;\n›\t prepare the financial statements on the going concern \nbasis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group \nand Company will continue in business.\nThe Directors are responsible for safeguarding the assets of the \nGroup and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for \nthe prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nThe Directors are also responsible for keeping adequate \naccounting records that are sufficient to show and explain \nthe Group and Company’s transactions and disclose with \nreasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the \nGroup and Company and enable them to ensure that the \nfinancial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity \nof the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom \ngoverning the preparation and dissemination of financial \nstatements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\nDirectors’ confirmations\nIn the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ \nReport is approved: \n›\t so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit \ninformation of which the Group’s and Company’s auditors \nare unaware; and \n›\t they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken \nas a Director in order to make themselves aware of any \nrelevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s \nand Company’s auditors are aware of that information.\nThe Directors’ Responsibilities Statement was approved by the \nBoard on 12 April 2022 and signed on its behalf by: \nJakob Pfaudler \nChief Executive Officer \nGovernance Report\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  57\n56  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

We believe that the audit \nevidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to \nprovide a basis for our opinion.\nIndependence\nWe remained independent of the Group in accordance with \nthe ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the \nfinancial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical \nStandard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities \nin accordance with these requirements.\nOur audit approach\nOverview\nAudit scope\n›\t We conducted audit testing over seven components.\n›\t Four components were subject to an audit of their complete \nfinancial information.\n›\t Specific audit procedures were performed on certain balances \nand transactions in respect of a further three components.\n›\t We obtained coverage of 91% of revenue. \nKey audit matters\n›\t Recognition of revenue in respect of the personal roadside \nbusiness (Group)\n›\t Valuation of post-retirement benefit obligations (Group)\n›\t Valuation of insurance technical provisions (Group)\n›\t Goodwill impairment assessment (Group)\n›\t Investment in subsidiaries impairment assessment (Company)\nMateriality\n›\t Overall Group materiality: £8.0m (2021: £8.5m) based \non approximately 2.5% of adjusted Trading EBITDA \n(2021: approximately 4% of Operating Profit).\n›\t Overall Company materiality: £7.5m (2021: £3.0m) based \non approximately 1% (2021: 1%) of Total Assets, but for the \npurposes of the audit of the Group financial statements, \nwe limited the Company materiality to £3.0m.\n›\t Performance materiality: £6.0m (2021: £6.3m) (Group) and \n£5.6m (2021: £2.25m) (Company).\nThe scope of our audit\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality \nand assessed the risks of material misstatement in the \nfinancial statements.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ \nprofessional judgement, were of most significance in the audit \nof the financial statements of the current period and include the \nmost significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether \nor not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those \nwhich had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the \nallocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of \nthe engagement team. These matters, and any comments we \nmake on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed \nin the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, \nand in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a \nseparate opinion on these matters.\nThis is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\nCOVID-19 (Group and Company), which was a key audit matter \nlast year, is no longer included because of the reduced risk \nof material misstatement of the financial statements as a \nconsequence of COVID-19. Otherwise, the key audit matters \nbelow are consistent with last year.\nKey audit matter\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\nRecognition of revenue in respect  \nof the personal roadside business (Group)\n \nRefer to Note 1.3(m) to the financial statements for the Directors’ \ndisclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements and \nestimates, and Note 2 to the financial statements.\nThe Group has recognised revenue of £480m in respect of the insured \npersonal roadside business. \nThere are known issues with the underlying policy management systems \nused in the insured personal roadside business and the way in which \nthey account for revenue. A set of manual corrections are made each \nmonth, along with a series of standing provisions and other \nadjustments, to appropriately account for revenue. \nWe focused on whether revenue from these policies was correctly \nrecognised, and whether the corrections and standing provisions and \nother adjustments made are complete. Given the known issues, there \nis an increased completeness risk that there are undetected errors in \nthe policy management system calculations. There is also an increased \nrisk of error where manual corrections are made. \nWe evaluated the relevant IT systems and related internal controls; \nhowever, we concluded that we would not rely on the controls over \nfinancial reporting and we performed only substantive procedures in \nthis area. \nFor a sample of insured personal roadside contracts, we performed \ndetailed testing of revenue transactions including agreeing to the \nunderlying contracts, recalculating the revenue and deferred revenue \nrecognised based on transactional data and contractual terms, and \nagreement to cash receipt. We performed detailed testing of the \ndeferred revenue balances at period end to underlying contracts and \nrecalculated the deferred revenue balance.\nWe reviewed management’s reconciliations of the revenue to be \nrecognised as generated by the policy management systems to the \nrevenue actually recognised in the general ledger, and tested a sample \nof the specific manual corrections, standing provisions and other \nadjustments posted by management to correct the known system \nerrors as well as obtaining a full understanding of each of these. \nWe performed substantive testing procedures over the completeness \nof the monthly corrections, standing provisions and other adjustments \nthrough the following procedures: sample testing policies and tracing \nthrough any identified differences to the corresponding correction, \nprovision or other adjustment made, obtaining an understanding of all \npolicy types and ways of policy set up and the corresponding \naccounting entries for each of these, and understood the nature of \ncomplaints through review of the complaints log to understand \nwhether these could be indicative of further unidentified issues.\nWe found no material misstatements from our testing.\nValuation of post-retirement benefit obligations (Group)\n \nRefer to Notes 1.3(l) and 1.3(u) to the financial statements for the \nDirectors’ disclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements \nand estimates, and Note 26 to the financial statements.\nThe Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes, the most \nsignificant of which is the AA UK Pension Scheme (AA UK), which \ncombined have a total net defined benefit pension surplus of £130m, \ncomprising gross assets of £2,666m and gross liabilities of £2,536m.\nValuation of the liabilities requires significant levels of judgement \nand technical expertise in determining the appropriate assumptions \nto measure it. Changes in assumptions (including discount rate, \nmortality, inflation and pension increases) can have a material impact \non the calculation of the liabilities either individually or in combination. \nThe Directors used independent actuaries to prepare the year end \nvaluation under International Accounting Standard 19, ‘Employee \nbenefits’ (“IAS 19”). \nValuation of the scheme assets requires judgement, due to the nature \nof certain complex and illiquid assets held, for which there are no \nquoted prices available. Of the total asset value held, the majority do \nnot have a quoted price available. Prices are obtained directly from \nthe relevant investment managers who apply judgement in valuing \nthose assets. In addition, the bulk annuity policies held are valued \nusing actuarial assumptions.\nThe recognition of the surplus this year involves judgement \nsurrounding the criteria of IAS 19. We focused on the reasonableness \nof the assumptions used in the calculation of the AAUK defined \nbenefit liability, the valuation of assets held by the AAUK scheme, \nthe disclosure of post-retirement benefit scheme obligations and the \nsurplus recognition criteria.\nWe involved our specialists in our assessment of the reasonableness \nof actuarial assumptions and the overall pension liability calculations \nby comparing the assumptions, including the discount rate and \ninflation rate, mortality and pension increases, to benchmark ranges, \nperforming sensitivity analysis, checking whether methods have been \nconsistently applied and are reasonable and assessing the impact of \nthe assumptions in combination with one another. We agreed that the \njudgements taken by the Directors were reasonable. \nWe obtained external confirmations to test the existence of pension \nassets as at 31 January 2022. In order to test the valuation of the complex \nassets, we obtained a range of supporting evidence as available, \nincluding recent transaction prices, audited fund financial statements \nand fund controls reports, to assess whether the net asset value \nprovided was reliable and appropriate. In respect of the bulk annuity \npolicies held, we utilised our actuarial specialists to test the valuation \nof the assets and performed testing of the insured members to data \nprovided by both the scheme actuary and the administrator.\nWe reviewed the disclosure of post-retirement scheme obligations and \nthe criteria for recognition of the pension surplus against the \nrequirements of IAS 19. We were satisfied with the nature and extent of \nthe disclosures provided and that the conditions for recognition of the \nsurplus were appropriate against the criteria in IAS 19. \nWe found no material misstatements from our testing.\nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  61\n60  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "Key audit matter\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\nValuation of insurance technical provisions (Group)\n \nRefer to Notes 1.3(n) and 1.3(u) to the financial statements for the \nDirectors’ disclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements \nand estimates and Note 24 to the financial statements.\nThe Group financial statements include liabilities for the estimated cost \nof settling general insurance claims. The insurance technical provisions \ncontain both the outstanding claims provisions of £60m and the \nprovisions for incurred but not reported claims of £17m. \nThe estimation of insurance contract liabilities involves a significant \ndegree of judgement. The liabilities are based upon management’s \nbest estimate of the ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled \nat the year end, whether reported or not, together with the related \nclaims handling costs.\nThe Directors focused on this area due to the significance of these \nliabilities to the Group’s Statement of Financial Position and because \nof the inherent uncertainties present when estimating future \nclaims development.\nWe focused, in particular, on:\n›\t The methodologies and assumptions used in estimating the \noutstanding claims provisions for general insurance products, \nin particular for those claims such as personal injury, which can \ntake a long time to settle and where the amounts concerned can \nbe large; and\n›\t Whether the Directors’ provision for incurred but not reported claims, \nwhich has been determined with the assistance of an external actuarial \nexpert, has been prepared appropriately, including whether any trends \nin the underlying claims experience were appropriately reflected.\nOur work to address the valuation of the insurance technical provisions \nwas supported by our internal non-life actuarial specialists. \nWe targeted the largest outstanding claims and evaluated the \nmethodology and assumptions used by the Directors to estimate the \nmost judgemental components of each claim. We obtained supporting \ndocumentation for the most significant elements of the claims. \nGiven the relatively early stages of development of these large claims, \nwe utilised our in-house claims handling specialists to ensure that \nappropriate factors had been taken into account when estimating the \nexpected cost of settlement. We agreed that the judgements taken by \nthe Directors were reasonable.\nWe performed independent actuarial projections of the reserve \nrequirements as at 31 December 2021, rolling forward our estimates to \nthe year end. These projections were carried out at varying degrees of \ngranularity, including claim type and policy type projections, which were \nsubsequently aggregated in order to produce our independent view. \nWe tested, on a sample basis, the completeness and accuracy of the \nunderlying source data on which our actuarial projections are based to \nsupporting documentation. \nWithin the booked reserve recognised in the financial statements, there \nis a management loading on top of the actuarial best estimate which \nrepresents a margin for uncertainty. We challenged the Directors on the \nlevel of margin held as it falls towards the higher end of our reasonable \nrange. We corroborated the explanations received to our industry \nknowledge of the various uncertainties within the market at the current \ntime, such as claims inflation, as well as considering the margin in the \ncontext of the maturity of the business and relevant peers. \nWe concluded that the year end insurance technical provisions are \nreasonable based on the independent projections performed and our \nassessment of the potential uncertainty present, and that they are \nconsistent with financial reporting requirements and industry \naccepted practice.\nGoodwill impairment assessment (Group)\n \nRefer to Notes 1.3(i) and 1.3(u) to the financial statements for the \nDirectors’ disclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements \nand estimates, and Notes 10 and 27 to the financial statements.\nThe goodwill balance of £1,170m is subject to an annual \nimpairment review. \nThe Directors analyse discounted cash flows at the cash generating \nunit (CGU) level to calculate the value in use for each CGU. Cash flow \nforecasts are an area of particular focus given the judgements relating \nto future growth and discount rate assumptions. \nNo impairment charge has been recorded by the Directors against the \ngoodwill balance in the current financial year. The risk that we focused \non in the audit is that the goodwill balance may have been impaired in \nvalue and this has not been recognised.\nFor all CGUs, we checked the cash flow forecasts used by the Directors \nin the assessment of goodwill impairment were consistent with the \napproved five year plans, and considered the reasonableness of \nassumptions in relation to recent trading, including roadside membership \nrates and the number of motor and home insurance policies sold. We \nalso challenged the extent to which climate change considerations had \nbeen reflected, as appropriate, in the cash flow forecasts.\nWe focused additional work upon the AA Cars and Drivetech CGU’s (with \nreasonable but more limited headroom). For certain assumptions \nwhich underpinned their forecast performance, including the speed of \nrecovery of the used vehicles sales market and the resumption of police \nspeed awareness courses, we assessed these for reasonableness \nagainst market data, if available, and other internal management data \nwhere appropriate.\nWe also evaluated the historical accuracy of the cash flow forecasts for \nthese businesses. We found that the forecasts have been completed \non a basis consistent with prior years and were an appropriate basis \nupon which the Directors could base their conclusions.\nWe tested the Directors’ assumptions in the forecasts for long-term \ngrowth rates (by comparing them to economic forecasts); and the \ndiscount rate (by engaging our valuation experts to assess the cost of \ncapital for the Company and comparable organisations). We found the \nassumptions to be consistent and in line with our expectations based \non industry benchmarks. \nWe obtained and tested the Directors’ sensitivity calculations over \nall their CGUs and agreed with their conclusion that there was no \nreasonable possible change that would give rise to an impairment or \nto enhanced disclosure.\nKey audit matter\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\nInvestment in subsidiaries impairment assessment (Company)\nRefer to Notes 1.3(b), 1.3(d) and 2 to the Company financial \nstatements.\nPrior to the reversal of impairment of £210m, the Company held \ninvestments in subsidiaries of £506m representing the AA Insurance \nHoldings Limited group (the underwriting business) and AA Mid Co \nLimited (which owns the rest of the Group).\nIn the previous two financial years, impairments totalling £688m were \nrecognised following the Directors’ assessments of the appropriateness \nof the investment in subsidiary carrying values in light of the Group’s \ndecreasing market capitalisation and the takeover offer for the Company, \naccepted by shareholders.\nDuring the year to 31 January 2022, there was an increase in investments \nin subsidiaries of £366m, principally as a result of a capital contribution \nof £361m made to AA Mid Co Limited following completion of the \ntakeover by the Consortium.\nIn light of the additional equity injected by the Consortium on takeover, \nand as a result of the successful refinancing of the B3 notes and the A9 \nnotes in the year, the Directors prepared a set of ‘dividend distribution’ \nforecasts to reflect the cash flows available for distribution to the \nCompany from the Group’s subsidiaries. These incorporated interest \nand tax cash flows in addition to the enterprise value cash flows used \nin support of the goodwill impairment assessment, reflecting that the \nGroup’s debt materially is held in those subsidiaries. These cash flows \nwere then discounted at an equity discount rate. Having referred to the \nrequirements of International Accounting Standard 36, ‘Impairment of \nAssets’ (“IAS 36”), the Directors were satisfied it was appropriate to \nrecognise the reversal of £210m of past impairment charges.\nWe evaluated the appropriateness of the ‘dividend distribution’ \nmodel prepared.\nWe evaluated the Directors’ impairment assessment of the investment \nin subsidiaries’ carrying value by agreeing amounts to supporting \ndocumentation and checking calculations. This leveraged the Directors’ \ncalculations for the Group goodwill impairment assessment referred \nto above. \nWe evaluated the assumptions with regard to anticipated interest flows \nas debt is refinanced over the coming years and the basis for calculating \ntax cash flows. We found these to be reasonable and, in relation to \ninterest flows, supported by current market rates. \nWith the support of our valuation experts, we evaluated the Directors’ \ndetermination of the equity discount rate and found this to be reasonable.\nWe considered the requirements of IAS 36 when assessing the \nappropriateness of the reversal of past impairment charges and, \nbased on our testing, we did not identify any material misstatements. \nWe agreed with the Directors’ conclusion that the reversal of £210m \nof past impairment charges was supportable.\nHow we tailored the audit scope\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements \nas a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry \nin which they operate.\nAA Limited has two operating segments. Within these segments there are around 51 reporting units, of which the following are \nconsidered financially significant: Automobile Association Developments Limited and Automobile Association Insurance Services \nLimited. Two further reporting units were subject to an audit of their complete financial information due to their nature: AA Limited \nand AA Bond Co Limited. In addition, three reporting units were in scope for specific audit procedures, being AA Corporation Limited, \nAA Underwriting Insurance Company Limited and AA Senior Co Limited. These three components were selected based on the \ncontribution of each to specific financial statement line items, including: intangible assets, operating and accrued expenses, staff \ncosts and prepayments; revenue, insurance technical reserves and related accounts; and borrowings and external interest expense \nrespectively. These, together with the procedures performed at the Group level, including auditing the consolidation and financial \nstatement disclosures, taxation, pension scheme balances and asset impairment assessments, gave us the evidence we needed for \nour opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Having undertaken certain procedures to understand the accounting processes \nand controls at the Group, we determined it was appropriate to perform a wholly substantive audit for the reporting units in scope. \nAll audit procedures were performed by the Group engagement team, with no component auditors involved. Due to restrictions \nimposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the audit was predominantly performed remotely and, although we met face-to-face with \nmanagement where possible, we also communicated via regular telephone and video calls.\nThe Company is principally a holding company and there are no branches or other locations to be considered when scoping the audit.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT continued\nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  63\n62  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "Materiality\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. \nThese, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of \nour audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, \nboth individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n \nFinancial statements – Group\nFinancial statements – Company\nOverall \nmateriality\n£8.0m (2021: £8.5m).\n£7.5m (2021: £3.0m).\nHow we \ndetermined it\nApproximately 2.5% of adjusted Trading EBITDA \n(2021: approximately 4% of Operating Profit)\n1% (2021: 1%) of Total Assets, but for the purposes of the audit of the \nGroup financial statements, we limited the Company materiality to £3.0m\nRationale for \nbenchmark \napplied\nEBITDA, which is a common performance \nmeasure for PE backed companies, reflects the \nfact that this is typically the most relevant measure \nof profitability. Based on the benchmarks used in \nthe Annual Report, Trading EBITDA is the primary \nmeasure used by the shareholders and other \nusers of the financial statements in assessing the \nperformance of the Group, and that by adjusting \nthis to exclude certain items (such as the pension \nservice charge adjustment, the share-based \npayments charge and the impairment of \ninvestments in joint ventures), it provides a clearer \nview of the performance of the underlying business.\nWe believe that total assets is the appropriate measure as the Company \nis a non-profit oriented entity. In the current year, overall materiality has \nbeen reduced to £3.0m, for the purposes of the audit of the Group \nfinancial statements, to ensure the Company did not have a higher \nmateriality than the overall Group materiality allocation.\nFor each component in the scope of our Group audit, we \nallocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group \nmateriality. The range of materiality allocated across components \nwas £3.0m to £7.6m. Certain components were audited to a \nlocal statutory audit materiality that was also less than our \noverall Group materiality.\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately \nlow level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected \nand undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. \nSpecifically, we use performance materiality in determining \nthe scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing \nof account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, \nfor example in determining sample sizes. Our performance \nmateriality was 75% (2021: 75%) of overall materiality, amounting \nto £6.0m (2021: £6.3m) for the Group financial statements and \n£5.6m (2021: £2.25m) for the Company financial statements.\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a \nnumber of factors – the history of misstatements, risk \nassessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of \ncontrols, and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our \nnormal range was appropriate.\nWe agreed with those charged with governance that we would \nreport to them misstatements identified during our audit above \n£0.4m (Group and Company audits) (2021: £0.5m) as well as \nmisstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted \nreporting for qualitative reasons.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified \nany material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, \nindividually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the \nGroup's and the Company’s ability to continue as a going \nconcern for a period of at least twelve months from when the \nfinancial statements are authorised for issue.\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that \nthe Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in \nthe preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be \npredicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group's \nand the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors \nwith respect to going concern are described in the relevant \nsections of this report.\nReporting on other information\nThe other information comprises all of the information in the \nAnnual Report other than the financial statements and our \nauditors’ report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the \nother information. Our opinion on the financial statements does \nnot cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not \nexpress an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise \nexplicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our \nresponsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, \nconsider whether the other information is materially inconsistent \nwith the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in \nthe audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. \nIf we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material \nmisstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude \nwhether there is a material misstatement of the financial \nstatements or a material misstatement of the other information. \nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that \nthere is a material misstatement of this other information, we are \nrequired to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on \nthese responsibilities.\nWith respect to the Strategic Report and Directors' Report, \nwe also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK \nCompanies Act 2006 have been included.\nBased on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the \nCompanies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions \nand matters as described below.\nStrategic Report and Directors' Report\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the \naudit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors' \nReport for the year ended 31 January 2022 is consistent with \nthe financial statements and has been prepared in accordance \nwith applicable legal requirements.\nIn light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and \nCompany and their environment obtained in the course of the \naudit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the \nStrategic Report and Directors' Report.\nResponsibilities for the financial statements \nand the audit\nResponsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements\nAs explained more fully in the Directors' responsibilities \nstatement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of \nthe financial statements in accordance with the applicable \nframework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair \nview. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control \nas they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of \nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, \nwhether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible \nfor assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue \nas a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to \ngoing concern and using the going concern basis of accounting \nunless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the \nCompany or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative \nbut to do so.\nAuditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the \nfinancial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether \nthe financial statements as a whole are free from material \nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an \nauditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance \nis a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit \nconducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise \nfrom fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or \nin the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence \nthe economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these \nfinancial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance \nwith laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our \nresponsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements \nin respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which \nour procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including \nfraud, is detailed below.\nBased on our understanding of the Group and industry, \nwe identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with \nlaws and regulations related to breaches of UK regulatory \nrequirements, such as those governed by the Financial \nConduct Authority (“FCA”), and unethical and prohibited \nbusiness practices, and we considered the extent to which \nnon-compliance might have a material effect on the financial \nstatements. We also considered those laws and regulations \nthat have a direct impact on the financial statements such as \nthe Companies Act 2006 and tax legislation. We evaluated \nmanagement’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent \nmanipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of \noverride of controls), and determined that the principal risks \nwere related to posting inappropriate journal entries to increase \nrevenue or profit and the potential for management bias in \naccounting estimates. Audit procedures performed by the \nengagement team included:\n›\t Discussion with management, internal audit, internal \ncompliance, internal legal counsel and enquiries of the \nGroup’s legal advisors, including consideration of known \nor suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and \nregulations, and fraud.\n›\t Reviewing correspondence between the Group and the \nFCAin relation to compliance with laws and regulations, \nand considering the matters identified in light of our \nunderstanding of the sector.\n›\t Challenging significant accounting assumptions and \njudgements individually and collectively for indications of \nmanagement bias, in particular in relation to the valuation of \npost-retirement benefit obligations, general insurance claims \nliabilities, subsidiary investment and goodwill impairment \nassessments, as described further in the Key audit matters \nabove and Business to Business revenue accruals.\n›\t Designing risk filters to search for journal entries, such as \nthose posted with unusual account combinations or posted \nby members of senior management with a financial reporting \noversight role, and testing those journals highlighted (if any).\n›\t Incorporating elements of unpredictability into the audit \nprocedures performed.\n›\t Reviewing the disclosures in the Annual Report and financial \nstatements against the specific legal requirements, for example \nwithin the Directors' Report.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT continued\nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  65\n64  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

We are less likely to become aware of instances of \nnon-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely \nrelated to events and transactions reflected in the financial \nstatements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement \ndue to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting \nfrom error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, \nfor example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or \nthrough collusion.\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of \ncertain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing \ntechniques.

AA Limited is a private company, limited by shares, \nand is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, UK. \nPrior to de-listing on 10 March 2021, the Company’s ordinary \nshare capital was listed on the London Stock Exchange.\nThese statements and the prior year comparatives have been \npresented to the nearest £million.\n1.2\t Basis of preparation\nThe Group has prepared these statements in accordance with \nUK-adopted international accounting standards and with the \nrequirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to \ncompanies reporting under those standards.\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared \nunder the historic cost convention as modified by the \nmeasurement of derivatives and liabilities for contingent \nconsideration in business combinations at fair value.\na)\t Going concern\nThe Group’s operations are highly cash generative with a large \nproportion of its revenues coming from recurring transactions. \nThe significant customer loyalty demonstrated by high renewal \nrates and lengthy customer tenure underpins this and, in addition \nto the cash balances at the reporting date, the Group has agreed \nundrawn credit facilities. The majority of the Group’s borrowings \nare long term in nature, with no borrowings due within 12 months \nfrom the date of signing of these financial statements. For the \nGroup’s longer-term viability, it remains a key assumption of the \nDirectors that the Group continues to have ready access to public \ndebt markets to enable these borrowings to be refinanced in \ndue course. \nIn July 2021, the Group completed a highly successful refinancing \nof its outstanding A5 notes, issuing £270m of A9 notes at a \ncoupon of 3.25% with a 7x oversubscribed order book. The \nGroup will continue to seek to refinance its maturities within good \ntime of their scheduled maturities, including the refinancing of \n£250m of A6 notes which are due to mature in July 2023. It is \nexpected that market conditions in the coming months will be \nmore challenging than in the past with significant macroeconomic \nconcerns around interest rates and inflation as well as substantial \ngeopolitical risk. However, despite these concerns, the Group \nstill expects to be able to access markets at a suitable time and \nrefinance its debt at affordable prices.\nThe Directors have reviewed projected cash flows for a period \nof one year from the date of signing these financial statements \nand have concluded that the Group has sufficient funds to \ncontinue trading for this period and the foreseeable future. \nTherefore, the financial statements have been prepared using \nthe going concern basis. \nb)\t\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial \nstatements of the Company and entities controlled by the \nCompany (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the \nCompany has rights to variable returns from its involvement \nwith the entity and has the ability to influence those returns \nthrough its power over the entity.\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the \nyear are included in the consolidated income statement from \nthe effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of \ndisposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are \nmade to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the \naccounting policies into line with those used by the Group. All \nintra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are \neliminated on consolidation.\n1.3\t Accounting policies\nThe accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise \nstated, been applied consistently to all years presented in these \nconsolidated financial statements.\na)\t\nInterests in joint ventures and associates\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to \nexercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, \nthrough participating in the financial and operating policy \ndecisions of the entity. Joint ventures are joint arrangements \nwhereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement \nhave rights to the net assets of the arrangement. \nThe results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures and associates \nare incorporated in these financial statements using the equity \nmethod of accounting. Investments in joint ventures and \nassociates are carried in the Group statement of financial \nposition at cost, including direct acquisition costs, as adjusted \nby post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net \nassets less any impairment losses. \nb)\t\nForeign currencies\nThese financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, \nwhich is the currency of the primary economic environment in \nwhich the Group operates. \nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency of \neach consolidated undertaking are recorded at rates of exchange \nprevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets \nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated \ninto the respective functional currency at rates of exchange \nruling at the statement of financial position date. Gains and \nlosses arising on the translation of assets and liabilities are \ntaken to the income statement.\nc)\t\nBusiness combinations and goodwill\nAll business combinations are accounted for by applying the \nacquisition method. \nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with \nthe issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the \nconsideration paid over the Group’s interest in the fair value of \nthe identified assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of \nacquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost less \naccumulated impairment losses. \nAny contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair \nvalue at the acquisition date, and subsequent changes to the \nfair value of the contingent consideration are taken to the \nincome statement. \nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  71\n70  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

The cost of intangible assets \nacquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the \ndate of acquisition.\nFollowing initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost \nless any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. \nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a straight-line \nbasis over their estimated useful economic lives. The only \nintangible assets with finite lives held by the Group are customer \nrelationships, software and development costs. Customer \nrelationships are amortised over 10 years and software and \ndevelopment costs over 5 years. \ne)\t\nSoftware and development costs\nSoftware development expenditures on an individual \nproject are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group \ncan demonstrate:\n›\t The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so \nthat it will be available for use or sale\n›\t Its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset\n›\t How the asset will generate future economic benefits\n›\t The availability of resources to complete the asset\n›\t The ability to measure reliably the expenditure \nduring development\nFollowing initial recognition of the development expenditure as \nan asset, the cost model is applied. The asset is carried at cost \nless any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. \nAmortisation of the asset begins when development is complete \nand the asset is available for use. It is amortised on a straight-line \nbasis over its useful life of three to five years. \nSoftware-as-a-Service arrangements are service contracts \nproviding the Group with the right to access the cloud \nprovider’s application software over the contract period. Costs \nincurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing fees to \nobtain access to the cloud provider’s application software, are \nrecognised as operating expenses. Some of the costs incurred \nrelate to the development of software code that enhances or \nmodifies, or creates additional capability to existing systems \nand meets the definition of, and the recognition criteria for, an \nintangible asset. These costs are recognised as intangible \nsoftware assets and amortised over the useful life of the software \non a straight-line basis.\nf)\t\nProperty, plant and equipment\nLand and buildings held for use in the production of goods and \nthe provision of services or for administrative purposes are stated \nin the statement of financial position at cost or fair value for \nassets acquired in a business combination less any subsequent \naccumulated depreciation and impairment losses. If relevant \nconditions are met, borrowing costs are capitalised. \nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated \ndepreciation and impairment losses. Such costs include costs \ndirectly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as \nintended. The cost of property, plant and equipment less their \nexpected residual value is depreciated in equal instalments over \ntheir useful economic lives. In assessing residual values and \nasset lives consideration have been given to the impact of climate \nchange. These lives are as follows:\nBuildings\n50 years\nRelated fittings\n3 – 20 years\nLeasehold properties\nover the period of the lease\nPlant, vehicles and other equipment 3 – 10 years\nProperty, plant and equipment shall be classified as held-for-sale \nif its carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction \nrather than through continuing use. Assets meeting the criteria \nof held-for-sale are transferred to held-for-sale at the lower of \ncarrying value or fair value less costs to sell at the point at which \nthe criteria are met. \ng)\t\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. \nCosts include all costs incurred in bringing each product to its \npresent location and condition. Net realisable value is based on \nestimated selling price less any further costs expected to be \nincurred to completion and disposal.\nh)\t\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the \nGroup’s statement of financial position when the Group \nbecomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. \nThey are classified according to the substance of the \ncontractual arrangements entered into. The Group recognises \nloss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on relevant \nfinancial assets.\nTrade receivables\nTrade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods or \nservices performed in the ordinary course of business. They are \ngenerally due for settlement within 30 days and are therefore \nall classified as current. Trade receivables are recognised at fair \nvalue and are subsequently held at amortised cost. The Group \napplies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring ECLs which \nuses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.\nTrade payables \nTrade payables are not interest bearing and are recognised at \nfair value and are subsequently held at amortised cost.\nCash and cash equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call \ndeposits with an original maturity less than three months. \nRestricted cash is cash which is subject to contractual or \nregulatory restrictions.\nDebt instruments\nDebt is initially recognised in the statement of financial position \nat fair value less transaction costs incurred directly in connection \nwith the issue of the instrument. Debt issue fees in respect of \nthe instrument, including premiums and discounts on issue, are \ncapitalised at inception and charged to the income statement \nover the term of the instrument using the effective interest \nmethod. Remaining issue costs on debt are written off to the \nincome statement when the debt is extinguished.\nAn exchange with an existing lender of debt instruments with \nsubstantially different terms, or a substantial modification of the \nterms of an existing financial liability or a part of it, is accounted \nfor as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the \nrecognition of a new financial liability. If an exchange of debt \ninstruments or modification of terms is accounted for as an \nextinguishment, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as \npart of the gain or loss on the extinguishment. If the exchange or \nmodification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs \nor fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and \nare amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability.\nEquity instruments (share capital issued by the Group)\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual \ninterest in the assets of the Group after deducting all its liabilities. \nEquity instruments are recognised at the fair value of proceeds \nreceived less direct issue costs. \nDerivative financial instruments\nThe Group’s capital structure exposes it to the financial risk \nof changes in interest rates and fuel prices. The Group uses \ninterest rate and fuel swap contracts to hedge these exposures. \nDerivative financial instruments are recorded in the statement \nof financial position at fair value. The fair value of derivative \nfinancial instruments is determined by reference to market \nvalues for similar financial instruments. The gain or loss on \nremeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the \nincome statement unless they qualify for hedge accounting as \ndescribed below. \nFinancial Investments\nThe Group classifies its financial investments as financial assets \nat fair value through profit or loss. These investments are \ninitially recorded at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, \nthese investments are re-measured at fair value at each \nreporting date. Fair value adjustments and realised gains and \nlosses are recognised in the profit and loss account. \nCash flow hedges\nWhere a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge \nof the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or \na highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any \ngain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised \ndirectly in the cash flow hedge reserve. Any ineffective portion of \nthe hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.\nIn the same period or periods during which the hedged expected \nfuture cash flows affect profit or loss, the associated cumulative \ngain or loss on the hedged forecast transaction is removed from \nequity and recognised in the income statement.\nWhen the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or \nexercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge \nrelationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected \nto occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in \nequity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy \nwhen the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no \nlonger expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain \nor loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income \nstatement immediately.\ni)\t\nImpairment of assets\nThe carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other \nthan inventories, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine \nwhether there is any indication of impairment. If any such \nindication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is \nestimated. In addition, goodwill and intangible assets not yet \navailable for use are tested for impairment annually.\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be \ntested individually are grouped together into the smallest group \nof assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that \nare largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or \ngroups of assets (the cash-generating units or ‘CGUs’). The \ngoodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to \nCGUs so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects \nthe lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal \nreporting purposes. \nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its \nvalue in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value \nin use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their \npresent value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current \nmarket assessments of the time value of money and the risks \nspecific to the asset.\nAn impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an \nasset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. \nImpairment losses are recognised in the income statement. \nImpairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated \nfirst to reduce the carrying amount of any allocated goodwill \nand then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets on \na pro rata basis.\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In \nrespect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there \nhas been a change in the estimates used to determine the \nrecoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to \nthe extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed \nthe carrying amount that would have been determined, net \nof depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had \nbeen recognised.\nj)\t\nLeases\nLease liabilities\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the \nremaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee’s \nincremental borrowing rate. \nMeasurement of right-of-use assets\nThe associated right-of-use assets for leases are initially \nmeasured at cost, being the initial lease liability plus any direct \ninitial costs and an estimate of end of life costs, adjusted by the \namount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to \nthat lease recognised in the statement of financial position.\nSubsequently the right-of-use assets are depreciated over their \nlease terms. Useful economic lives of leased assets are reviewed \nfor appropriateness on a continuous basis including in relation \nto climate change impacts such as electric vehicles.\nFor property leases, where a decision has been made prior to \nthe year end to permanently vacate the property, the right-of-use \nasset is impaired to the extent that the value cannot be recovered \nthrough rental or other income expected to be received up to \nthe estimated date of final disposal.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n1\t\nBasis of preparation and accounting policies continued\n1.3\t Accounting policies continued\nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  73\n72  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "k)\t\nProvisions and contingent liabilities\nA provision is required when the Group has a present legal or \nconstructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is \nprobable that settlement will be required of an amount that can \nbe reliably estimated.\nProvisions are discounted where the impact is material. Material \ncontingent liabilities are disclosed unless the likelihood of \ntransfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent assets are \nonly disclosed if an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\nProvisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the \nGroup has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has \nbeen communicated to affected parties. \nl)\t\nRetirement benefit obligation\nThe Group’s position in respect of defined benefit pension plans \nis calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that \nemployees have earned in return for their service in the current \nand prior years; that benefit is discounted to determine its \npresent value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) \nis deducted. The Group determines the net interest on the net \ndefined benefit liability for the year by applying the discount \nrate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the \nbeginning of the year to the net defined benefit liability.\nThe discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on bonds \nthat have a credit rating of at least AA, with maturity dates \napproximating the terms of the Group’s obligations, and that \nare denominated in the currency in which the benefits are \nexpected to be paid.\nRemeasurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise \nactuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets \n(excluding interest). The Group recognises them immediately in \nother comprehensive income and all other expenses related to \ndefined benefit plans in administrative and marketing expenses \nin the income statement.\nWhen the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is \ncurtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to past \nservice by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is \nrecognised immediately in the income statement when the plan \namendment or curtailment occurs.\nThe calculation of the defined benefit obligations is performed \nby a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. \nWhen the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the \nrecognised asset is limited to the present value of benefits \navailable in the form of any future refunds from the plan or \nreductions in future contributions and takes into account the \nadverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.\nFor defined contribution schemes, the amounts recognised in \nthe income statement are the contributions payable in the year.\nm)\t Revenue recognition\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration \nreceivable less any discounts and excluding value added tax \nand other sales related taxes.\nRoadside membership subscriptions and premiums receivable \non underwritten insurance products are apportioned on a time \nbasis over the period where the Group is liable for risk cover as \nthe relevant performance obligations are settled over time, with \nthe Group acting as principal. The unrecognised element of \nsubscriptions and premiums receivable, relating to future periods, \nis held within liabilities as deferred income and provision for \nunearned premium. \nCommission income from insurers external to the Group is \nrecognised at the commencement of the period of risk on a \npoint in time basis, with the Group acting as agent in this \nrelationship. Commission income for policies underwritten by \nthe Group is deferred and recognised over the period of risk, \nwith the Group acting as principal in this relationship.\nWhere customers choose to pay by instalments, the Group \ncharges interest based on the principal outstanding and \ndisclosed interest rate and recognises this income over the \ncourse of the loan. \nFees receivable on franchise agreements with driving instructors \nare recognised as revenue over time across the term of the \nfranchise agreements. This includes fees receivable under the \nfranchise agreement in respect of provision of tuition vehicles, \nwhich is not considered to be a sub-lease arrangement. The \nGroup acts as principal in this relationship.\nCommission income receivable from the sale and related \nmarketing and administrative services of financial products, \nsuch as that earned through the partnership with the Bank of \nIreland, is recognised on a point in time basis at the point of \nthe provision of the service, with the Group acting as agent in \nthis relationship. Fixed income, fixed rebates and profit share \nrelating to the provision of these services are recognised in \nrevenue over time in line with the profile of expected lending \nover the contract term.\nFor all other revenue, this income is recognised on a point in \ntime basis at the point of delivery of goods or on the provision \nof service, or over time where the service is provided over more \nthan one day. This includes work which has not yet been fully \ninvoiced, provided that it is considered to be fully recoverable.\nn)\t\nInsurance contracts\nAn insurance contract is a contract under which insurance risk \nis transferred to the issuer of the contract by another party. \nIn the roadside segment, the Group accepts insurance risk \nfrom its customers under roadside recovery service contracts \nby agreeing to provide services whose frequency and cost is \nuncertain. Claims and expenses arising from these contracts \nare recognised in profit or loss as incurred, broker acquisition \ncosts are deferred. The Group also has insurance risk within \nthe insurance underwriting segment on insurance products \nunderwritten by the Group. \nAt the statement of financial position date, a liability adequacy \ntest is performed to ensure the adequacy of the insurance \ncontract liabilities. In performing these tests, current estimates \nof future cash outflows arising under insurance contracts are \nconsidered and compared with the carrying amount of deferred \nincome, provision for unearned premiums and other insurance \ncontract liabilities. Any deficiency is immediately recognised in \nthe income statement and an additional liability is established. \nThe estimation of the ultimate liability from claims made under \ninsurance contracts for breakdown recovery is not considered \nto be one of the Group’s most critical accounting estimates. \nThis is because there is a very short period of time between the \nreceipt of a claim, e.g. a breakdown, and the settling of that claim. \nConsequently, there are no significant provisions for unsettled \nclaims costs in respect of the roadside assistance services.\nThe provision for outstanding claims relating to products with \ninsurance risk within the insurance underwriting segment is set \non an individual claim basis and is based on the ultimate cost of \nall claims notified but not settled, less amounts already paid by \nthe reporting date, together with a provision for related claims \nhandling costs. The provision also includes the estimated cost \nof claims incurred but not reported (‘IBNR’) at the statement of \nfinancial position date, which is set using statistical methods. \nBoth outstanding claims and IBNR are not discounted for the \ntime value of money. \nThe amount of any anticipated reinsurance, salvage or \nsubrogation recoveries is separately identified and reported \nwithin trade and other receivables and insurance contract \nliabilities respectively. Differences between the provisions at the \nreporting date and settlements and provisions in the following \nyear are recognised in the income statement as they arise. \nReinsurance\nThe Group undertakes a programme of reinsurance in respect \nof the policies which it underwrites. Outward reinsurance \npremiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as \nthe related inward insurance premiums and are included as a \ndeduction from earned premium, and therefore as a reduction \nin revenue. The amount of any anticipated reinsurance \nrecoveries is treated as a reduction in claims costs.\nThe Group had in the year coinsurance arrangements in \nrespect of certain policies that it underwrites. Premiums and \nclaims in respect of coinsured policies are shown net of the \ncoinsurer’s share.\no)\t\nInsurance aggregator fees\nInsurance aggregator fees are the costs related to the \nacquisition of customers from insurance comparison websites. \nThese costs are expensed to the income statement in full at the \ncommencement of the insurance policy except where the risk \nis underwritten by the Group in which case aggregator fees are \ninitially deferred then expensed over the duration of the policy. \nThese costs are presented in the income statement within \nadministrative and marketing expenses.\np)\t\nAdjusting operating items \nAdjusting operating items are events or transactions that fall \nwithin the operating activities of the Group and which, by virtue \nof their size or incidence, have been disclosed in order to \nimprove a reader’s understanding of the financial statements. \nIn addition, occasionally there are events or transactions that \nfall below operating profit that are one-off in nature and items \nwithin operating profit that relate to transactions that do not \nform part of the ongoing segment performance and which, by \nvirtue of their size or incidence, have been separately disclosed \nin the financial statements. \nq)\t Finance income and costs\nFinance costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on \nlease liabilities recognised in profit or loss using the effective \ninterest method, amortisation of debt issue fees, unwinding of \nthe discount on provisions (including the net defined benefit \nobligations) and debt issue fees written off. \nFinance income comprises net finance income from defined \nbenefit pension schemes and movement in interest rate swaps.\nr)\t\nTaxation\nTax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and \ndeferred tax. \nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the \ntaxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or \nsubstantively enacted at the statement of financial position date, \nand any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years.\nDeferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the \ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting \npurposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The \nfollowing temporary differences are not provided for: the initial \nrecognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or \nliabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other \nthan in a business combination; and differences relating to \ninvestments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably \nnot reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred \ntax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or \nsettlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using \ntax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of \nfinancial position date.\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is \nprobable that future taxable profits will be available against \nwhich the temporary difference can be utilised. The carrying \namount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of \nfinancial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no \nlonger probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available \nto allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\ns)\t\nSegmental analysis\nThe Group reports its operations using the segments that are \nreported for management purposes. Segments are based on \nbusiness operations because this is where Group risk and \nreturn is focused.\nt)\t\nShare-based payments\nThe Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share-based \npayment compensation plans for employees. \nShare-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives \ngoods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments \nare accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment \ntransactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are \nobtained by the Group.\nThe grant date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment \nawards granted to employees is recognised as an employee \ncost, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period \nthat the employees become unconditionally entitled to the \nawards. The fair value of the awards granted is measured using \na valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions \nupon which the awards were granted. The amount recognised \nas an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards \nfor which the related service and non-market vesting conditions \nare expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately \nrecognised as an expense is based on the number of awards \nthat do meet the related service and non-market performance \nconditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards \nwith market vested and non-vesting conditions, the grant date \nfair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect \nsuch conditions and there is no true up for differences between \nexpected and actual outcomes. On change of control, if vesting \ndate is brought forward, the share based payment charge and \nincrease in equity for the remainder of the vesting term will be \naccelerated and recognised as at that date (see note 35).\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n1\t\nBasis of preparation and accounting policies continued\n1.3\t Accounting policies continued\nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  75\n74  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

The \nfair value of the amount payable to employees is recognised as \nan expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the \nperiod in which the employees become unconditionally entitled \nto payment. The liability is remeasured at each statement of \nfinancial position date and at settlement date. Any changes in \nthe fair value of the liability are recognised as an employee cost \nin the income statement.\nu)\t\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nEstimates are evaluated continually and are based on historical \nexperience and other factors, including expectations of future \nevents that are believed to be reasonable under the \ncircumstances. The Group makes estimates and assumptions \nabout the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by \ndefinition, seldom equal the related actual results. \nManagement has exercised judgement in applying the Group’s \naccounting policies and in making critical estimates. The \nunderlying assumptions on which these judgements are based \nare reviewed on an ongoing basis and include the selection of \nassumptions in relation to the retirement benefit obligation and \nassumptions for future growth of cash flows to support the \nvalue in use calculations for the goodwill impairment review.\nThe principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant \nrisk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts \nof assets and liabilities within the next financial year are \ndiscussed below:\nRetirement benefit obligation\nThe Group’s retirement benefit obligation, which is actuarially \nassessed each period, is based on key assumptions including \nreturn on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates, inflation, \nfuture salary and pension costs. These assumptions may be \ndifferent to the actual outcome (see note 26 for sensitivity analysis).\nIn the current year, the AAUK defined benefit pension scheme is \nin a surplus position. There is judgement around the recognition \nof a surplus which has been considered by management. The \ndefined benefit pension scheme surplus has been recognised \nas the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of the \nsurplus assuming the gradual settlement of AAUK scheme \nliabilities over time until all members have left the scheme. \nInsurance technical provisions\nThe Group’s insurance technical provisions, which are presented \non a gross asset and liability basis, are an estimate of the expected \nultimate cost of claims as at the statement of financial position \ndate and the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to the \nGroup. Due to the level of reinsurance the results for the year \nare not subject to significant risk of misstatement caused by \nchanges to the assumptions in the next 12 months. The estimation \nof these claims is based on actuarial projection methodologies \nwhich incorporate analysis of historic patterns on a peril-by-peril \nbasis to make assumptions about the development of incurred \nclaims and an additional loading over the actuarial best estimate \nis made, which represents a margin for uncertainty. It can take \na significant period of time before the ultimate cost of claims \ncan be established with certainty, and the final outcome may \nbe better or worse than that provided (see note 24).\nIntangibles\nThe Group has significant software development programmes \nand there is judgement in relation to which programmes and \ncosts to capitalise under IAS 38. Additionally, there is an \nestimate in respect of the future usage period of software on \nwhich the Group bases the useful economic life of related assets. \nA reduction in the useful economic life of Customer relationships \nand Software of 1 year would result in an increase in the \namortisation charge by 10% and 25% respectively (see note 10). \nThe following are other principal estimates and assumptions \nmade by the Group, but which management believes do not have \na significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying \namounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:\nGoodwill \nThe Group tests goodwill for impairment annually. The \nrecoverable amounts of CGUs have been determined based \non value in use calculations which require the use of estimates \n(see note 27). Management has prepared discounted cash flows \nbased on the latest strategic plan. The value in use calculation \nis most sensitive to assumptions in growth and discount rate, \nand cash flows incorporate the latest business-led assumptions \nincluding contract wins, sales volumes and investment \nrequirements including an assessment of the impact of \nclimate change. \nShare-based payments\nThe Group has issued a number of share-based payment awards \nto employees which are measured at fair value. Calculating the \nshare-based payment charge for the year involves estimating \nthe number of awards expected to vest, which in turn involves \nestimating the number of expected leavers over the vesting \nperiod and the extent to which non-market-based performance \nconditions will be met. Determining the fair value of an award with \na market-based performance condition also involves factoring \nin the impact of the expected volatility of the share price.\nLeases\nThe Group recognises lease liabilities in relation to leases, \nmeasured at the present value of the minimum lease payments, \ndiscounted using the discount rate implicit in the lease, or, where \nthis is not available, the corresponding incremental borrowing \nrate as at the date of inception of the lease. Management’s \napproach to determining the incremental borrowing rate for a \nright-of-use asset involves using data provided by the Group’s \nexternal advisers on the rate of interest that the Group would \nhave to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar \nsecurity, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar \nvalue to the relevant right-of-use asset.\n2\t Segmental information and revenue disaggregation\nThe Group has two key segments – Roadside and Insurance. These segments are consistent with the way in which information is \npresented to the chief operating decision maker. Head Office costs have been allocated to these two key segments as these costs \nprincipally directly support the operations of these segments. Head Office costs are predominately allocated on a percentage of \nrevenue basis. \nThe two reportable operating segments are as follows:\n›\t Roadside: This segment is the largest part of the AA business. The AA provides a nationwide service, sending patrols out to \nmembers stranded at the side of the road, repairing their vehicles where possible and getting them back on their way quickly \nand safely. In addition, this segment includes the AA and BSM driving schools, Drivetech which provides driver training and \neducative programmes, and our Prestige business which provides service, maintenance and repair services.\n›\t Insurance: This segment includes the insurance brokerage activities of the AA, primarily in arranging motor and home insurance \nfor customers and its intermediary financial services business. This segment also includes the insurance underwriting and \nreinsurance activities of the AA, as well as AA Cars which sells used vehicles. \n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\nRevenue\nRoadside \n822\n799\nInsurance \n167\n168\nRevenue\n989\n967\nTrading EBITDA\nRoadside \n290\n280\nInsurance\n55\n61\nTrading EBITDA\n345\n341\nShare-based payments (see note 35)\n(5)\n(4)\nPension service charge adjustment (see note 3)\n(4)\n(5)\nAmortisation and depreciation (see notes 10, 12, 13)\n(99)\n(93)\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment (see note 12)\n(11)\n–\nPension past service cost (see note 26)\n(26)\n–\nOperating profit before adjusting operating items\n200\n239\nAdjusting operating items (see note 5)\n(81)\n(21)\nOperating profit\n119\n218\nNet finance costs (see notes 6 and 7)\n(142)\n(166)\n(Loss)/profit before tax\n(23)\n52\nAll segments operate principally in the UK.

It also excludes the effects of share-based payments, defined benefit pension service charge \nadjustments, pension past service costs, amortisation and depreciation. \nThese specific adjustments are made between the GAAP measure of operating profit and the non-GAAP measure of Trading EBITDA \nbecause Trading EBITDA is a performance measure required and clearly defined under the terms of our debt documents and is used \nfor calculating our debt covenants. Given the significance of the Group debt, Trading EBITDA is a key measure for our bondholders \nand therefore management. In addition, the Group shows Trading EBITDA to enable stakeholders and management to more easily \nand consistently track the underlying operational performance of the Group and its business segments.\n4\t Operating profit\nOperating profit is stated after charging:\n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\nAmortisation of owned intangible assets (see note 10)\n61\n55\nDepreciation of owned tangible fixed assets (see note 12)\n14\n12\nDepreciation of right-of-use assets (see note 13)\n24\n26\n99\n93\n5\t Adjusting operating items \n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\nTransaction fees related to the acquisition and debt financing arrangements\n64\n16\nStrategic review projects\n13\n2\nClosure costs of the CARE section of the AAUK pension scheme  \nand the transitional agreement made with employees in that scheme\n5\n5\nEmergency IT expenditure incurred setting up home working due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n–\n4\nGovernment furlough support in respect of COVID-19\n–\n(7)\nOther adjusting operating items \n(1)\n1\nTotal adjusting operating items\n81\n21\nIn the current year, strategic review projects included the cost of consultancy and restructuring of the executive team. Other \nadjusting operating items comprise mainly of £2m profit on sale of fixed assets, partly offset by £1m impairment of investments in \njoint ventures. \nIn the prior year, other adjusting operating items comprised a £2m loss on disposal of subsidiaries, £1m of additional property \ndilapidations costs and a £1m impairment of investments in joint ventures offset by a £2m release of a provision for conduct and \nregulatory costs and a £1m profit on disposal of non-current assets. \nIn the prior year incremental costs directly attributable to COVID-19 and the credit received from government furlough support were \nincluded within adjusting operating items. The trading effects from COVID-19 were reflected within Trading EBITDA.\nCosts from the current year refinancings were directly attributable to the issue and repayment of loan notes and have therefore been \nincluded either in finance costs or in borrowings as debt issue fees (see notes 6 and 21).\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n2\t Segmental information and revenue disaggregation continued\nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  79\n78  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

This increase was \nsubstantively enacted in May 2021 and has therefore been reflected in the measurement of deferred tax as at 31 January 2022. \nThe effect of the tax rate increase has been a deferred tax credit of £7m.\nDeferred tax balances have been measured according to the substantively enacted rates applicable to the periods in which they \nare scheduled to reverse.\nThe Group has carried forward tax losses which arose in the UK of £12m (deferred tax equivalent £2m) (2021: £22m tax losses, \ndeferred tax equivalent £4m) that are available indefinitely for offsetting against future taxable profits of the companies in which \nthe losses arose. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses and the majority of these are expected to \nreverse within 12 months. A further £1m (2021: £1m) deferred tax asset relating to other tax losses has not been recognised due to \nthe uncertainty of the availability of suitable future profits to enable recovery. The group has carried forward interest expenses of \n£58m (deferred tax equivalent £14m, 2021: £10m, deferred tax equivalent £2m). This potential deferred tax asset has not been \nrecognised due to uncertainty over whether the group will be able to access these amounts in future periods. Due to the \nrequirements of the UK's Corporate Interest Restriction rules, the existence of deferred tax liabilities within the group do not \nsupport the recognition of this asset. \nThe effective tax rate is (17.4)% which differs from the standard rate of corporation tax. This rate is as a result of the benefit of the \nrate change differences being more than offset by the impact of one-off disallowable costs incurred in respect of the acquisition of \nthe Group’s shares and the impact of the carried forward interest expenses.\n10\t Goodwill and other intangible assets\nGoodwill\n£m\nCustomer \nrelationships\n£m\nSoftware\n£m\nTotal\n£m\nCost \nAt 1 February 2020\n1,197\n11\n301\n1,509\nAdditions\n–\n–\n57\n57\nReclassifications\n–\n–\n(2)\n(2)\nDisposals\n–\n–\n(46)\n(46)\nAt 31 January 2021\n1,197\n11\n310\n1,518\nAdditions\n–\n–\n59\n59\nDisposals\n–\n–\n(21)\n(21)\nAt 31 January 2022\n1,197\n11\n348\n1,556\nAccumulated amortisation and impairment\nAt 1 February 2020\n27\n1\n127\n155\nAmortisation\n–\n1\n54\n55\nDisposals\n–\n–\n(45)\n(45)\nAt 31 January 2021\n27\n2\n136\n165\nAmortisation\n–\n1\n60\n61\nDisposals\n–\n–\n(20)\n(20)\nAt 31 January 2022\n27\n3\n176\n206\nNet book value \nAt 31 January 2022\n1,170\n8\n172\n1,350\nAt 31 January 2021\n1,170\n9\n174\n1,353\nWithin software, £22m (2021: £17m) relates to assets under construction which are not amortised.\nSoftware additions comprise £16m (2021: £12m) in relation to internally developed assets and £43m (2021: £45m) in relation to \nseparately acquired assets. \nAmortisation costs are included within administrative and marketing expenses in the income statement.\nAn annual impairment review has been performed over the goodwill balance, see note 27 for details. \n11\t Business combinations\nAcquisitions during the year ended 31 January 2022\nThere were no acquisitions during the year ended 31 January 2022.\nAcquisitions during the year ended 31 January 2021\nThere were no acquisitions during the year ended 31 January 2021.\nDisposals during the year ended 31 January 2022\nThere were no disposals during the year ended 31 January 2022.\nDisposals during the year ended 31 January 2021\nOn 21 May 2020, the Group completed the sale of the entire share capital of AA Reinsurance Company Limited, AA Underwriting \nLimited and Automobile Association Underwriting Services Limited for cash consideration of £6m.

      "text": "On 10 March 2021, the Group refinanced its Senior Term Facility. The new £150m Senior Term Facility was drawn down immediately \nand used, in combination with £50m of cash, to refinance the existing £200m Senior Term Facility. £1m of facility arrangement fees \nwere capitalised for the Senior Term Facility. The Group also agreed a new £56m Working Capital Facility, of which £46m is available \nfor cash drawings and remains undrawn, and cancelled its existing Working Capital Facility of £60m. In addition, the Group agreed \na new £160m Liquidity Facility which remains undrawn, and cancelled its existing Liquidity Facility of £165m. As a result of refinancing \nthese facilities, £1m of issue fees were written off.\nIn accordance with the terms of the acquisition, Basing BidCo Limited stated its intention to provide an additional £100m of funds to \nbe used, together with an issue by the Group of £270m in new Class A9 Notes, to redeem in full the £372m of Class A5 Notes. On \n21 July 2021, the Group issued £270m of Class A9 Notes at an interest rate of 3.25%. £4m of new issue premium associated with \nthe issue of the Class A9 Notes was capitalised. The proceeds of these notes were held in escrow until 1 November 2021 when they \nwere released and used, along with the further equity injection of £100m, to redeem the £372m of outstanding Class A5 Notes.\nFollowing the extinguishment of the Class A5 Notes, £1m of associated unamortised fees were written off.\nIn order to show the Group net borrowings, the notes and the issue costs have been offset. Issue costs are shown net of any premium \non the issue of borrowings. Interest rate swaps are recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value at the year end. \nAll of the Class A Notes are secured by first ranking security in respect of the undertakings and assets of AA Intermediate Co Limited \nand its subsidiaries. The Class A facility security over the AA Intermediate Co Limited group’s assets ranks ahead of the Class B3 \nNotes. The Class B3 Notes have first ranking security over the assets of the immediate parent undertaking of the AA Intermediate \nCo Limited group, AA Mid Co Limited. AA Mid Co Limited can only pay a dividend when certain Net Debt to Trading EBITDA and \ncash flow criteria are met. \nAny voluntary early repayments of the Class A Notes would incur a make-whole payment of all interest due to expected maturity \ndate, except the Class A6, Class A7, Class A8, and Class A9 Notes which can be settled without penalty within, two months, three \nmonths, six months and six months respectively of the expected maturity date. The Class B3 Notes would attract a make-whole \npayment if they were to be redeemed before 31 January 2023, thereafter any voluntary repayment would be made at a fixed \npremium until 31 January 2025 after which there would be no premium to pay on redemption.\nAll of the Group loan notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange. \nIn order to comply with the requirements of the Class A Notes, the Group is required to maintain the Class A free cash flow to debt \nservice ratio in excess of 1.35x. The actual Class A free cash flow to debt service ratio as at 31 January 2022 was 3.1x (2021: 2.5x). \nFollowing redemption of the Group’s Class B2 Notes on 10 March 2021, the Group no longer has to comply with any Class B free \ncash flow to debt service ratio requirements.\nThe Class A Notes only permit the release of cash providing the Senior Leverage ratio after payment is less than 5.5x and providing \nthere is sufficient excess cash flow to cover the payment. The actual Senior Leverage ratio as at 31 January 2022 was 6.2x (2021: \n6.5x). The Class B Notes restrictions only permit the release of cash providing the Fixed Charge Coverage ratio after payment is more \nthan 2:1 and providing that the aggregate payments do not exceed 50% of the accumulated consolidated net income. The actual \nFixed Charge Coverage ratio as at 31 January 2022 was 2.7x (2021: 2.4x). \nThe Class A and Class B Notes therefore place restrictions on the Group’s ability to upstream cash from the key trading companies \nto pay external dividends and finance activities unconstrained by the restrictions embedded in the debts.\nOn 20 July 2021, S&P Global Ratings reaffirmed the credit rating of the Group’s Class A Notes at BBB- and the Class B2 Notes at B+. \n22\tDerivative financial instruments\n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\nCurrent\nInterest rate swap\n–\n(1)\nNon-current\nForward fuel contracts\n1\n(1)\nInterest rate swap\n5\n–\n6\n(2)\nThe forward fuel contract is shown and settled on a net basis.

These sums are mainly expected to be paid out over the next 9 years; \nhowever, it will take 34 years to fully pay out all amounts provided for. The provision has been calculated at a risk free rate.\nOther provisions include a £2m provision (2021: £nil) in relation to a warranty for vehicle part replacements and £8m (2021: £7m) \nrelating to self-funded insurance liabilities, where the Group provides for the cost of certain claims made against it, for example \nmotor vehicle accident damage and employer liability claims. These sums are mainly expected to be paid out over the next 5 years; \nhowever, it can take up to 30 years for employer liability claims to pay out in full.\nIn the prior year other provisions also included £1m for anticipated redress costs. The Group identified that there had been limited \ninstances whereby consumer renewal pricing needed to realign with regulatory requirements. The Group has subsequently released \nthis provision. \nContingent Liabilities\nLitigation – update on Mr Mackenzie’s claim\nAs reported previously, the former Executive Chairman, Bob Mackenzie, who was dismissed for gross misconduct on 1 August 2017, \nhad on 6 March 2018 issued a claim for substantial damages against AA Limited, its subsidiary (Automobile Association Developments \nLimited) (together, ‘the Companies’) and personally against a number of their former directors and the former Company Secretary.\nIn November 2018, Mr Mackenzie’s claim against all the directors and a former Company Secretary was dismissed in full and he was \nordered to pay their costs to be assessed by the Court if not agreed. The majority of Mr Mackenzie’s claim arises from his exclusion \nfrom a share option scheme which, in any event, lapsed for all participants without any payment in June 2019. However, Mr Mackenzie \nhas now issued an amended claim which includes a new claim for personal injury allegedly suffered as a result of stress arising from \nhis role as CEO and Chairman. The Companies have filed a full defence in relation to Mr Mackenzie’s amended claim. After further \ndiscussion with external counsel the Companies decided to apply for a strike-out application in relation to the entirety of Mr Mackenzie’s \nclaims against them. This application was filed in May 2020 and the strike out hearing was held in March 2021. The strike out \napplication was successful on all counts and all of Mr Mackenzie’s claims, bar his wrongful dismissal claim which was not part of \nthe strike-out application, were dismissed. However, as a result Mr Mackenzie has now lodged an application to the Court of Appeal \nfor leave to appeal the strike-out application judgement and Mr Mackenzie’s application is expected to be heard by the Court of \nAppeal in May 2022. The Board assumes for the purpose of these financial statements that should Mr Mackenzie be successful in \nappealing the strike-out application decision then he will proceed with the claim against the Companies but maintains that it is not \nnecessary for the Group to make a financial provision as it expects the defence will prevail. \nFrom time to time the Group is subject to other claims and potential litigation. At the time of these financial statements, the Directors \ndo not consider any such claims and litigation to have anything other than a remote risk of resulting in any material liability to the Group.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n21\t Borrowings continued\nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  89\n88  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The AAUK \nscheme has a closed final salary section and a Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) section which itself was closed on 31 March \n2020 following consultation with affected employees. All future pensions build-up from 1 April 2020 in the UK is now on a defined \ncontribution basis. The CARE section provided for benefits to accrue on an average salary basis. During the 2017 financial year and \nfollowing the sale of the Irish business by the Group, AA Corporation Limited, a UK subsidiary of the Group, became the sponsor of \nthe AAI scheme. The Group also operates an unfunded post-retirement Private Medical Plan (AAPMP), which is treated as a defined \nbenefit scheme and is not open to new entrants.\nThe AAUK scheme is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is currently composed of member-nominated and Company-\nnominated directors. The AAI scheme is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is currently composed of Company-nominated \ndirectors of which some are also members of the scheme. For both pension schemes the Company-nominated directors include an \nindependent director whom the trustee board directors have nominated as Chairman. The Trustee of each scheme is responsible \nfor paying members’ benefits and for investing scheme assets, which are legally separate from the Group.\nThe AAUK and AAI schemes are subject to full actuarial valuations every three years using assumptions agreed between the trustee \nof each scheme and the Group. The purpose of this valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that the pension scheme has \nsufficient assets available to meet the future payment of benefits to scheme members.\nThe valuation of liabilities for funding purposes differs from the valuation for accounting purposes, mainly due to the different \nassumptions used and changes in market conditions between different valuation dates. For funding valuation purposes, the \nassumptions used to value the liabilities are agreed between the trustee and the Group with the discount rate, for example, being \nbased on a bond yield plus a margin based on the assumed rate of return on scheme assets. For accounting valuation purposes, \nthe assumptions used to value the liabilities are determined in accordance with IAS 19, with the discount rate, for example, being \nbased on high-quality (AA rated) corporate bonds.\nThe valuations have been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the schemes which have been updated where appropriate \nto 31 January 2022 by independent qualified actuaries.\nThe amounts recognised in the statement of financial position are as follows:\nAs at 31 January 2022\nAAUK\n£m\nAAI\n£m\nAAPMP\n£m\nTotal\n£m\nPresent value of the defined benefit obligation in respect of pension plans\n(2,453)\n(51)\n(32)\n(2,536)\nFair value of plan assets\n2,617\n49\n–\n2,666\nSurplus/(deficit)\n164\n(2)\n(32)\n130\nAs at 31 January 2021\nAAUK\n£m\nAAI\n£m\nAAPMP\n£m\nTotal\n£m\nPresent value of the defined benefit obligation in respect of pension plans\n(2,713)\n(60)\n(46)\n(2,819)\nFair value of plan assets\n2,580\n51\n–\n2,631\nDeficit\n(133)\n(9)\n(46)\n(188)\nThe overall deficit of £188m as at 31 January 2021 has moved to a surplus of £130m as at 31 January 2022, which represents a change \nof £318m over the year. This is largely the result of an increase in corporate bond yields over the period, which drive the discount rate, \nand an increase in assets due to higher-than-expected asset returns, partially offset by an increase in future inflation expectations. \nIt also incorporates a £13m gain resulting from the incorporation of the inter-valuation experience for the AAPMP, as well as the impact \nof Barber equalisation for the UK Scheme. \nThe Group recognised a one-off past service cost of £26m as a result of a legal review of the method of ‘Barber’ equalisation \nimplemented for the AAUK scheme.\nLeading counsel was engaged jointly by the Group and AAUK scheme Trustee to provide a legal opinion in respect of the method of \nequalisation used to date. Following receipt of that opinion on 26 November 2021 the Group and the AAUK scheme Trustee agreed \nto administer the AAUK scheme as per the opinion, crystalising the recognition of the one-off past service cost. These facts and \ncircumstances were not present at the previous year end and so no liability was recognised in the prior year.\nIn November 2013, the Group implemented an asset-backed funding scheme which remains in place. The asset-backed funding \nscheme provides a long-term deficit reduction plan where the Group makes an annual deficit reduction contribution of £14m \nincreasing annually with inflation, until October 2038 or until the AAUK scheme funding deficit is removed if earlier, secured on the \nGroup’s brands.\nIn February 2020, the actuarial triennial review for the AAUK pension scheme was completed as at 31 March 2019. This resulted in \na significant reduction to the technical provisions deficit of 64% from £366m as at 31 March 2016 to £131m. Under the previous 2016 \nvaluation, the recovery plan extended through to 2038 in respect of the Asset-Backed Funding element and to 2026 in respect of \nthe Additional Funding element. A new recovery plan was put in place and agreed with the Trustee which assumes that the scheme’s \ntechnical deficit will be fully repaid by July 2025, which is one year earlier than previously planned in terms of the Additional Funding \nelement and 13 years earlier in terms of the Asset-Backed Funding element. To do this, the Group has committed to paying an \nadditional (above the Asset-Backed Funding scheme payments) £10m per annum from April 2020 to March 2021, £11m per annum \nfrom April 2021 to March 2022 and £12m per annum from April 2022 to July 2025. From 1 February 2020, the trustee has also met \nits own costs of running the scheme.\nConsultation on the closure of the CARE section of the AAUK pension scheme commenced on 18 January 2020 through employee \nrepresentatives and concluded on 18 March 2020. The Group had proposed that, from 1 April 2020, all future pension accrual \nwould be on a defined contribution basis. Following a review of the feedback received during consultation, the Group confirmed \non 27 March 2020 that the proposals were going to be implemented on a modified basis and future pension accrual would be on a \ndefined contribution basis for all UK employees with transitional arrangements which will cost c. £11m over three years starting \nfrom 1 April 2020. Closure of the scheme has curtailed the ongoing build-up of defined benefit risk for the Group.\nThe agreed transitional arrangements provide a valuable enhanced Group pension contribution over a three-year period commencing \n1 April 2020 available to all members who make a contribution of at least 4% of pensionable salary per year. Further enhancements \nto the Group pension contribution are also available during the transitional period to members willing to make higher contributions. \nFollowing agreement of the 31 March 2019 triennial valuation in February 2020, as well as conclusion of the consultation on closure \nof the AAUK scheme to future accrual, the Group gained much clearer visibility over short-term pension costs lasting at least to the \nend of FY23 (where finalisation of the 31 March 2022 triennial valuation would reasonably be expected). The ongoing volatility from \naccrual costs has been removed but future volatility of deficit costs does remain. The impact of COVID-19 and other events on the \nglobal financial markets has meant higher fluctuation of the funding level in the AAUK scheme, albeit mitigated by the de-risked \ninvestment strategy and high levels of hedging. Therefore, there is a risk that the contributions required from the Group could \nincrease following the 2022 triennial valuation.\nUsing an inflation assumption of 3.6% and a discount rate assumption of 2.3%, the present value of the future deficit reduction \ncontributions has been calculated. These contributions remain due until such a time as another recovery plan is put in place, \ndespite the IAS19 surplus position shown as at 31 January 2022. The Group notes that it would have an unconditional right to a \nrefund of the surplus assuming the gradual settlement of AAUK scheme liabilities over time until all members have left the scheme. \nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  93\n92  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

Some of the pooled funds themselves are not listed on any publicly traded exchange and \nare therefore described as unquoted except where we are aware of a specific look-through to allow part of the assets within the \nfund to be described as quoted. \nOf the £2,261m assets without a quoted market price at 31 January 2022, £485m is in relation to the buy-in policies held by the \nscheme. Under IAS 19, the fair value of the insurance policies is deemed to be the present value of the related defined benefit \nobligations. Hence a key area of judgement is the assumptions used to derive the value of the corresponding obligations.\nApproximately £29m of unquoted assets allocated to private equity and £13m of unquoted assets allocated to property have been \nmeasured at amortised cost rather than fair value.\nThe fair value of the AAI scheme assets and the return on those assets were as follows:\n2022\n2021\nAssets with \na quoted \nmarket price\n£m\nAssets without \na quoted \nmarket price\n£m\nAssets with \na quoted \nmarket price\n£m\nAssets without a \nquoted market \nprice\n£m\nEquities\n8\n–\n12\n–\nBonds/gilts\n27\n–\n25\n–\nProperty\n–\n6\n–\n6\nHedge funds\n8\n–\n8\n–\nTotal AA Ireland scheme assets\n43\n6\n45\n6\nActual return on AA Ireland plan assets\n2\n2\nInvestment strategy\nThe AAUK scheme trustee determines its investment strategy after taking advice from a professional investment adviser. The AAUK \nscheme’s investment strategy has been set following an asset/liability review which considered a wide range of investment \nopportunities available to the scheme and how they might perform in combination. Other factors were also taken into account such \nas the strength of the employer covenant, the long-term nature of the liabilities and the funding plan agreed with the employer.\nThe AAUK scheme trustee aims to achieve the scheme’s investment objectives through investing in a diversified portfolio of growth \nassets which, over the long term, are expected to grow in value by more than low-risk assets like cash and gilts. This is done within \na broad liability driven investing framework that also uses such cash and gilts in a capital efficient way. In combination, this efficiently \ncaptures the trustee risk tolerances and return objectives relative to the scheme’s liabilities. A number of investment managers are \nappointed to promote diversification by assets, organisation and investment style.\nTo diversify sources of return and risk, the AAUK scheme invests in many asset classes and strategies, including equities, bonds \nand property funds which primarily rely on the upward direction of the underlying markets for returns, and also hedge funds which \nalso invest in asset classes like equities, bonds and currencies, but in such a way that relies more on the skill of the investment \nmanager to add returns while hedging against downward market moves. \nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n26\tPensions continued\nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  97\n96  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

For 2022, the assumptions used were in line with the SAPS (S3) series mortality tables with scheme-specific \nadjustments (2021 – SAPS (S3) series with scheme-specific adjustments) with future improvements in line with the CMI_2020 model \nwith a 1.25% long-term rate of improvement and a 2020 experience weighting of 10% (2021 – CMI_2019 model with a 1.25% long-term \nrate of improvement). The AAI scheme mortality assumptions are set using standard tables with scheme-specific adjustments. \nThe AA schemes’ overall assumptions are that an active male retiring in normal health currently aged 60 will live on average for a \nfurther 25 years (2021: 25 years) and an active female retiring in normal health currently aged 60 will live on average for a further \n28 years (2021: 28 years).\nSensitivity analysis\nReasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, \nwould have affected the defined benefit liability by the amounts shown below:\nFor the year ended 31 January 2022\nAAUK\n£m\nAAI\n£m\nAAPMP\n£m\nIncrease of 0.25% in discount rate\n117\n2\n1\nIncrease of 0.25% in RPI and CPI\n(91)\n(1)\n–\nIncrease of 0.25% in CPI only\n(37)\n(1)\n–\nIncrease of 1% in medical claims inflation\n–\n–\n(4)\nIncrease of one year of life expectancy\n\t\n(95)\n(2)\n–\nAn equivalent decrease in the assumptions at 31 January 2022 would have had a broadly equal but opposite effect on the amounts \nshown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant. The amounts shown above are the effects of changing the \nassumptions on the gross defined benefit liability, rather than on the net deficit. The de-risked investment strategy, the two insured \nannuity policies and high levels of hedging reduce the sensitivities of changing these assumptions on the net surplus considerably.\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 January 2022 is around 20 years.\nPension scheme risks\nThe AAUK and AAI schemes have exposure to a number of risks because of the investments they make in following their investment \nstrategy. Investment objectives and risk limits are implemented through the investment management agreements in place with the \nschemes’ investment managers and monitored by the trustees of each scheme through regular reviews of the investment portfolios. \nIn addition, under guidance from their investment advisers, the trustees of each scheme monitor estimates of key risks on an ongoing \nbasis such as those shown below. A number of measures are taken to mitigate these risks where possible.\nCredit risk – This is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge \nan obligation. This risk mainly relates to the schemes’ bonds and is mitigated by carrying out due diligence and investing only in \nbond funds which are well diversified in terms of credit instrument, region, credit rating and issuer of the underlying bond assets. \nTo reduce risk further, the underlying bond assets within a fund are ring-fenced, and the scheme diversifies across a number of \nbond funds. \nCurrency risk – The scheme is subject to currency risk because some of the scheme’s investments are in overseas markets. \nThe trustee hedges some of this currency risk by investing in investment funds which hold currency derivatives to protect against \nadverse fluctuations in the relative value of its portfolio positions as a result of changes in currency exchange rates.\nMarket price risk – This is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial asset such as equities will fluctuate because \nof changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate, inflation or currency risk), whether those changes are \ncaused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial instruments \ntraded in the market. The scheme manages this exposure to overall price movements by constructing a diverse portfolio of \ninvestments across various markets and investment managers.\nFinancial derivatives risk – The AAUK scheme does not directly hold any financial derivatives but instead invests in investment funds \nwhich hold the derivatives required to hedge the scheme’s interest rate, inflation and currency risks. The scheme also permits some \nof the investment managers to use derivative instruments if these are being used to contribute to a reduction of risks or facilitate \nefficient portfolio management of their funds. The main risks associated with financial derivatives include: losses may exceed the \ninitial margin; counterparty risk where the other party defaults on the contract; and liquidity risk where it may be difficult to close out \na contract prior to expiry. These risks are managed by monitoring of investment managers to ensure that they use reasonable levels \nof market exposure relative to initial margin and positions are fully collateralised on a daily basis with secure cash or gilts collateral. \nThe AAUK scheme aims to hedge the majority of both the interest rate risk and inflation risk (of the non-insured liabilities on the \nscheme-specific self-sufficiency measure) as part of a policy to reduce financial risks. As at 31 January 2022, the scheme had \nhedged around 80% of interest rate and inflation risk (of the non-insured liabilities on the scheme-specific self-sufficiency measure). \nHedging levels fluctuate regularly as market conditions evolve and the scheme trustees, along with their advisers, closely monitor \nthese fluctuations. Where changes are needed to the level of hedging, the scheme trustees effect this, in consultation with the \nGroup, with consideration to prevailing pricing and risk appetite. \nBulk annuity policies\nThe AAUK scheme holds two bulk annuity policies with a total fair value of £485m as at 31 January 2022. The bulk annuity policy \npurchased in August 2018 insured all the benefits payable under the scheme in respect of 2,510 pensioner and dependant members, \nwhile the bulk annuity policy purchased in September 2019 insured all the benefits payable under the scheme in respect of a further \n1,790 pensioner and dependant members.\nThe Trustee has invested in such policies as the scheme will see all financial and demographic risks exactly matched for the covered \nmembers. The annuity policies were purchased in the name of the trustee and therefore remain assets of the AAUK scheme. Under \nIAS 19, these policies are considered to be qualifying insurance policies which exactly match the amount and timing of certain benefits \npayable under the scheme. The fair value of the insurance policies is therefore deemed to be the present value of the related \ndefined benefit obligations.\nThe bulk annuity policies mean that the AAUK scheme has hedged the associated longevity risks on c.20% of the scheme’s \nIAS 19 liabilities. \nWhile risks remain, the hedging strategy noted above, including the bulk annuity purchases, is important in controlling the Group’s \nexposure to future increases in the deficit.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n26\tPensions continued\nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  99\n98  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

CGUs represent the smallest group of assets that independently generate cash flow and whose \ncash flow is largely independent of the cash flows generated by other assets.\nThe carrying value of goodwill by CGU is as follows:\n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\nRoadside Assistance \n874\n874\nInsurance Services\n240\n240\nAA Cars\n25\n25\nDrivetech\n31\n31\n1,170\n1,170\nThe Group has performed impairment testing at 31 January 2022 and 31 January 2021. The impairment test compares the recoverable \namount of the CGU with its carrying value.\nThe recoverable amount of each CGU has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from the \nGroup’s five-year plan up to 31 January 2026, and a 2% growth expectation in the subsequent year. For the purposes of the \nimpairment test, terminal values have been calculated using a 2% growth assumption (2021: 2%). Cash flows have been discounted \nat a pre-tax rate reflecting the time value of money and the risk specific to these cash flows. This has been determined as a pre-tax \nrate of 10.2% (2021: 7.7%). The equivalent post-tax rate was 7.7% (2021: 7.0%).\nThe cash flow projections are forecast using historical trends overlaid with business-led assumptions such as contract wins, sales \nvolumes, prices and capex investment requirements including into climate change, together with operational KPIs such as number of \npersonal members, number of business customers, insurance policies in force, renewal rates and average repair times. These allow \nthe business to forecast profits, working capital and capital expenditure requirements.\nThe value in use calculation used is most sensitive to the assumptions used for growth and the discount rate. Accordingly, stress \ntesting has been performed on these key assumptions as part of the impairment test to further inform the consideration of whether \nany impairment is evident. From the results of this stress testing it was concluded that no reasonably foreseeable change in the key \nassumptions would result in the recoverable amount being less than the carrying amount for any of the CGUs.\nGoodwill was not impaired for any of the above CGUs in either the current or prior financial year. \n28\tFinancial assets and financial liabilities\nThe carrying amounts of all financial assets and financial liabilities by class are as follows:\nFinancial assets \t\n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\nDerivative financial instruments (see note 22)\n6\n–\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit and loss\nShares and other variable-yield securities and units in unit trusts – at fair value (see note 16)\n10\n–\nFinancial assets at amortised cost\nLoans to related parties\n4\n4\nCash and cash equivalents (see note 18)\n112\n185\nTrade receivables (see note 17)\n159\n162\nProceeds of Class B3 Notes issuance held in escrow (see note 20)\n–\n280\nReinsurers’ share of insurance liabilities (see note 17)\n115\n86\nContract assets and other receivables (see note 17)\n28\n26\nTotal financial assets\n434\n743\nLoans to related parties comprise £4m of 5% fixed rate loan notes issued from AA Media Limited to the Group, redeemable at par \non 29 March 2024.

Assumptions and market observable inputs used in valuation techniques include interest rates. \nThe objective of using valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value that reflects the price of the financial instrument at each year \nend at which the asset or liability would have been exchanged by market participants acting at arm’s length. \nObservable inputs are those that have been seen either from counterparties or from market pricing sources and are publicly available. \nThe use of these depends upon the liquidity of the relevant market. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group \nuses observable inputs as much as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the \ninputs used in the valuation as follows:\nLevel 1 – Quoted market prices in an actively traded market for identical assets or liabilities. These are the most reliable. \nLevel 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities. These include valuation \nmodels used to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows and may be employed either when no active market \nexists or when there are quoted prices available for similar instruments in active markets. The models incorporate various inputs \nincluding interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying instrument. \nLevel 3 – Inputs for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data.\nIf the inputs used to measure the fair values of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value \nhierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level as the lowest input that is significant to \nthe entire measurements. \nThe fair values are periodically reviewed by the Group Treasury function. The following tables provide the quantitative fair value \nhierarchy of the Group’s fuel and interest rate swaps, loan notes and financial investments.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  101\n100  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

The main purpose of these financial \nliabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group’s principal financial assets include deposits with financial institutions, money \nmarket funds and trade receivables. \nThe Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and insurance risk. The Group’s senior management oversees the \nmanagement of these risks, supported by the Group Treasury function. The Group Treasury function ensures that the Group’s \nfinancial risks are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed \nin accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives. All derivative activities are for risk management purposes and are carried \nout by the Group Treasury function. It is the Group’s policy not to trade in derivatives for speculative purposes.\nThe Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.\nMarket risk\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in prices set \nby the market. The key market risk that the Group is exposed to is interest rate risk. The Group has policies and limits approved by the \nBoard for managing the interest rate risk exposure. The Group’s policy is to fully hedge all of its exposure to variable interest rates. \nThe Group therefore takes out interest rate swaps to the value of its variable rate instruments. \nThe Group seeks to manage the impact of variable fuel prices through managing its procurement contracts with suppliers and by \nhedging the indexed element of diesel costs using Contracts for Difference. The Group has currently hedged 100% of forecast \ndiesel usage for the year ended 31 January 2023 and c.50% of forecast usage for the year ended 31 January 2024.\nThe interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments is as follows:\n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\nFixed rate instruments\nFinancial assets\n4\n284\nFinancial liabilities \n(2,204)\n(2,844)\nNet exposure to fixed rate instruments\n(2,200)\n(2,560)\nVariable rate instruments\nFinancial assets\n10\n–\nFinancial liabilities \n(150)\n(200)\nNet exposure to variable rate instruments\n(140)\n(200)\nSensitivity of fixed-rate instruments \nThe Group does not account for any fixed-rate financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and does not \nuse derivative instruments in fair value hedges. Consequently, having regard to fixed rate instruments, a change in market interest \nrates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss. \nSensitivity of variable rate instruments\nAn increase of 50 basis points in interest rates at 31 January 2022 would have increased equity by £nil (2021: £nil) and would have \nhad no impact on profit or cash because the variable rate on the Senior Term Facility, which was drawn during the current year, is \nhedged by an interest rate swap.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to \na financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to its financial assets, outstanding derivatives and trade and other \nreceivables. The Group assesses its counterparty exposure in relation to the investment of surplus cash and undrawn credit facilities. \nThe Group primarily uses published credit ratings to assess counterparty strength and therefore to define the credit limit for each \ncounterparty, in accordance with approved treasury policies.\nThe credit risk for the Group is limited as payment from customers is generally required before services are provided. \nCredit risk in relation to deposits and derivative counterparties is managed by the Group Treasury function in accordance with the \nGroup’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each \ncounterparty. The limits are set to mitigate financial loss through any potential counterparty failure. \nThe Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the statement of financial position at each reporting date is the \ncarrying amount except for derivative financial instruments. The Group’s maximum exposure for financial derivative instruments is \nnoted under liquidity risk. \nThe ageing analysis of trade receivables is as follows:\nTotal\n£m\nCurrent\n£m\n< 30 days\n£m\n30-60 days\n£m\n60+ days\n£m\n2022\n159\n143\n9\n6\n1\n2021\n162\n144\n6\n5\n7\nThe movements in the provision for the collective impairment of receivables are as follows:\n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\nAt 1 February\n4\n2\nCharge for the year\n2\n3\nUtilised \n(2)\n(1)\nAt 31 January \n4\n4\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n28\tFinancial assets and financial liabilities continued\nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  103\n102  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"

      "text": "Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group either does not have available sufficient financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations \nas they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to evaluate current and \nexpected liquidity requirements to ensure that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash and headroom on its working capital facilities. \nThe table below analyses the maturity of the Group’s financial liabilities on a contractual undiscounted cash flow basis and includes \nany associated debt service costs.

Estimates have to be made both for the \nexpected cost of claims reported at the reporting date and for the expected cost of claims incurred but not yet reported (‘IBNR’).\nThis balance is net of subrogation and salvage balances expected to be received from third party insurers. These amounts are \nestimated based on the value of the respective claim and the judgement of the claims handler.\nIn calculating the estimated cost of unpaid claims, a number of standard actuarial claims projection techniques are used to develop \nstatistical analysis of historic experience and market data. Based on their insurance industry experience, management also include \nan allowance for uncertainty given the relatively immature book of business.\nThe estimation of IBNR is generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than the estimation of the cost of settling claims already \nnotified, for which more information about the claim is generally available. Most claims are reported soon after the event, but in \nsome cases, it can be longer.\nOverall exposure is reduced by the extensive use of reinsurance contracts with approximately 80% of risk ceded through quota share \ncontracts to multiple reinsurance partners. There is further reduction to risk; Motor contracts by an Excess of Loss reinsurance \nprogramme to limit large losses to £1.0m and Household by a Catastrophe reinsurance programme limiting each event to £9.5m.\nCapital management\nAs noted in the Financial Review on pages 27-28, the Group considered its capital to be a combination of Net Debt and equity until \nthe de-listing on 10 March 2021. \n2022 \n£m\n2021\n£m\nTotal Net Debt\n2,261\n2,605\nEquity (valued at close on 31 January)\n–\n217\nTotal capital\n2,261\n2,822\nThe Group’s objectives when managing capital are:\n›\t to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and \nbenefits for other stakeholders \n›\t to put service, innovation and data at the heart of the AA \n›\t to deliver targeted and strategic investment in our people, our products, our systems and operations \n›\t to reduce Group borrowings and associated interest costs\nThe relative priorities of these objectives are discussed on pages 7-8 and pages 27-28. \nThe Group monitors capital using Net Debt to Trading EBITDA ratios.

The charge for the year ended 31 January 2022 was £nil. \nAt 31 January 2022, 30,089,992 shares had been issued under this plan with a fair value of 5.3p each. \nThe fair value of the shares were calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Key inputs to the model were as follows:\n›\t Equity value – Based on Basing TopCo Limited equity value of £601m\n›\t Expected term – Vesting date of March 2026 has been assumed\n›\t Exercise price – Based on equity value of Basing TopCo Limited taking into account the ratchet mechanism inbuilt to the plan \n›\t Volatility – 30% has been used following the review of a broad set of quoted comparators\n›\t Risk free rate – 0.59% based on UK Government bond rates for 5 year period as at first grant date \n36\tAccounting standards, amendments and interpretations\nNew accounting standards, amendments and interpretations adopted in the year\nThe Group did not identify any new accounting standards coming into effect in the current year with a material impact on the \nfinancial statements.\nNew accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted\nA number of new standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued and will be effective for financial years beginning \nafter 1 February 2022 but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements. These are set out below (effective dates \nare UK effective dates). \n›\t A number of narrow-scope amendments to IFRS 3, IAS 16, IAS 37 and some annual improvements on IFRS 1, IFRS 9, IAS 41 and \nIFRS 16 (effective 1 January 2022)\n›\t Amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’ on classification of liabilities (effective date to be confirmed)\n›\t Narrow scope amendments to IAS 1, Practice statement 2 and IAS 8 (effective date 1 January 2023)\n›\t Amendment to IAS 12 – deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction (effective date 1 January 2023)\n›\t IFRS 17, ‘Insurance contracts’ as amended in December 2021 (effective date 1 January 2023)\nIFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance contracts, providing consistent principles for all aspects of accounting for insurance contracts, \nimpacting recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the standard. \nThe Group is currently undergoing an impact assessment with regard to IFRS 17, with implementation due for the year ending \n31 January 2024. This is expected to have a material impact on the Group and comparative figures will be restated. \nThe Group did not identify any new accounting standards coming into effect in the financial year ending 31 January 2023 with an \nexpected material impact on the financial statements.\n37\tAssets classified as held for sale\nDuring the year, the directors agreed the sale of two properties. Purchasers for both properties have been identified and legal terms \nare being negotiated. The sales are expected to complete within 10 months of the year end. The assets have been remeasured to the \nlower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell which has resulted in an impairment of £9m included within administrative \nexpenses in the income statement. \nThe assets classified as held for sale were:\n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m\nProperty, plant and equipment – property 1 \n5\n–\nProperty, plant and equipment – property 2\n3\n–\nTotal\n8\n–\n38\tEvents after the reporting period\nRenewal of Liquidity Facility\nOn 25 January 2022, the Group renewed, under the same terms, the £160m Liquidity Facility.

      "text": "1\t\nPresentation of financial statements and Company accounting policies\n1.1\t Presentation of financial statements \nAA Limited (‘the Company’) is a private company, limited by \nshares, incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, UK. \nPrior to de-listing on 10 March 2021, the Company’s ordinary \nshares were traded on the London Stock Exchange. The address \nof the Company’s registered office is Fanum House, Basing View, \nBasingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 4EA.\nThese financial statements were prepared in accordance with \nFinancial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework \n(FRS 101) and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements \nare prepared under the historical cost convention and on a \ngoing concern basis. See also note 1.2(a) of the consolidated \nfinancial statements. \nNo income statement is presented by the Company as permitted \nby Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe accounting policies which follow set out those policies \nwhich apply in preparing the financial statements for the year \nended 31 January 2022. The financial statements are prepared \nin sterling and are rounded to the nearest million pounds (£m).\n1.2\t Basis of preparation\nThe Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure \nexemptions under FRS 101:\n›\t IAS 1 paragraph 10(d) (statement of cash flows)\n›\t IAS 1 paragraph 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS)\n›\t IAS 1 paragraph 38A (requirement for minimum of two \nprimary statements, including cash flow statements)\n›\t IAS 1 paragraph 111 (cash flow statement information) \n›\t IAS 1 paragraphs 134-136 (capital management disclosures)\n›\t Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, ‘Share-\nbased payment’\n›\t IAS 7, ‘Statement of cash flows’\n›\t IAS 8 paragraphs 30 and 31\n›\t The requirements in IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’ to \ndisclose related party transactions entered into between \ntwo or more members of a group\n›\t IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’\nThe Company did not identify any new accounting standards \ncoming into effect in the financial year ending 31 January 2023 \nwith an expected material impact on the financial statements.\n1.3\t Accounting policies\nThe accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise \nstated, been applied consistently to all years presented in these \nfinancial statements.\na)\t\nForeign currencies \nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling \nat the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the \ntransaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract. \nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies \nare retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement \nof financial position date or if appropriate at the forward contract \nrate. All differences are taken to the income statement.\nb)\t\nInvestments in subsidiaries\nInvestments in subsidiaries are held at cost less impairment. \nThe cost of share-based payments settled by the Company in \nrespect of employees of its subsidiaries are accounted for as a \ncapital contribution and are therefore reflected as an addition \nto the cost of the investments in subsidiaries.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s assets are reviewed \nfor impairment when events or changes in circumstances \nindicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not \nbe recoverable. If any such indication exists, the asset’s \nrecoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is \nrecognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its \nincome-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. \nImpairment losses are recognised in the income statement \nunless they arise on a previously revalued fixed asset.\nThe recoverable amount of fixed assets is the greater of their fair \nvalue less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, \nthe expected future cash flows are discounted to their present \nvalue using a discount rate that reflects current market \nassessments of the rate of return expected on an investment of \nequal risk. For an asset that does not generate largely independent \nincome streams, the recoverable amount is determined for the \nincome-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\nc)\t\nFinancial instruments \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the \nCompany’s statement of financial position when the Company \nbecomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. \nThey are classified according to the substance of the contractual \narrangements entered into. The Company recognises loss \nallowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on relevant \nfinancial assets.\nd)\t Critical accounting estimates and judgements \nEstimates are evaluated continually and are based on historical \nexperience and other factors, including expectations of future \nevents that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. \nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions about the future. \nThe resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom \nequal the related actual results. The following are principal \nestimates and assumptions made by the Company.\nManagement has exercised judgement in applying the Group’s \naccounting policies and in making critical estimates. The \nunderlying assumptions on which these judgements are based \nare reviewed on an ongoing basis and include the assumptions \nfor future growth of cash flows to support the value in use \ncalculations for the investment impairment review.\nInvestments\nThe Group tests the investment balances for impairment \nannually. The recoverable amounts of the investments have \nbeen determined based on value in use calculations which \nrequire the use of estimates. Management has prepared \ndiscounted cash flow forecasts based on the latest strategic \nplan. For the purposes of the impairment test, terminal values \nare calculated using a growth assumption and cash flows are \ndiscounted at a pre-tax rate reflecting the time value of money \nand the risk specific to these cash flows. In assessing the \nspecific method of calculating the value in use, a specific \njudgement has been made regarding the use of the ‘dividend \ndistribution model’ which is explained in Note 2.\nThe cash flow projections are forecast using historical trends \noverlaid with business-led assumptions such as contract wins, \nsales volumes, and prices, together with operational KPIs such as \nnumber of personal members, number of business customers, \ninsurance policies in force, renewal rates and average repair \ntimes, along with an assessment of the impact of climate change, \n(however future government or industry wider changes could \nreduce the present forecasts). These allow the business to \nforecast profits, working capital and capital expenditure \nrequirements. (see note 2 for details). \nDue to the previous impairments booked, as the equity \ninvestments are carried at the higher of fair value less costs to \nsell and value in use, there is a risk that subsequent changes in \nthe assumptions individually or in combination in the next 12 \nmonths could give rise to a material adjustment to the carrying \nvalue of the equity investment, and this represents the \nestimation uncertainty, details of the sensitivity are given in \nNote 2.\n2\t Investments in subsidiaries \n2022\n£m\n2021\n£m \nAt 1 February\n140\n532\nAdditions\n361\n–\nCharge for the share incentive schemes\n5\n3\nDisposal of subsidiary AA Reinsurance Company Limited\n–\n(1)\nImpairment reversal/(charge)\n210\n(394)\nAt 31 January\n716\n140\nIn the year end 31 January 2022, there was an increase in \ninvestments in subsidiaries of £576m. This was due to additions \nin relation to a capital contribution of £361m from AA Limited to \nAA Mid Co Limited, one of the Company’s direct subsidiaries, \na charge of £5m relating to the Group’s equity settled share \nschemes (see note 35 of the Group financial statements) and \nan impairment reversal of £210m, discussed further below.\nThe Company has performed impairment testing at 31 January \n2022 to compare the recoverable amount of the investments \nin subsidiaries to their carrying value. The Company has two \ndirectly held subsidiaries, AA Insurance Holdings Limited which \nowns the Group’s underwriting business and AA Mid Co Limited \nwhich owns the rest of the Group.\nThe impairment test was principally performed on the cash \nflow projections of the underlying AA Mid Co Limited group. \nThe recoverable amount of the investment was determined based \non a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from \nthe Group’s five-year plan. For the year ended 31 January 2022, \nthe Company used the five-year plan, adjusted for expected \nchanges, covering the four years up to 31 January 2026 and a 2% \nexpectation of growth in the subsequent year. For the purposes \nof the impairment test, terminal values have been calculated using \na 2% (2021: 2%) inflationary growth assumption in perpetuity \nbased on the IMF’s UK long-term growth rate. \nUsing an enterprise value model which deducts net debt as at \n31 January 2022, cash flows were discounted at a pre-tax rate \nreflecting the time value of money and the risk specific to \nthese cash flows. This was determined as a pre-tax rate of \n10.2% (2021: 7.7%). The result of this impairment test was \nthat there was a significant amount of headroom and therefore \nno indicators of impairment in the value of investments in \nsubsidiaries were identified.\nHowever, given the short period of time between the acquisition \nof the Group and the year end, management deemed it \nappropriate and prudent to also conduct the impairment \nassessment using a ‘dividend distribution’ model which was used \nin the years ended 31 January 2021 and 31 January 2020, due \nto the short-term risks specific to the Group and industry. This \nmodel assesses the cash flows available to the parent company \nfrom its investment in subsidiaries. This model uses the cash \nflow projections of the underlying investments including cash \noutflows relating to financing costs (i.e. interest) and taxation, a \ndeparture from the traditional value in use model described \nin IAS 36. Using both a discount rate based on the post-tax \nweighted average cost of capital (7.7%), and a more prudent \nbasis, being the cost of equity (19.1%), there was a significant \namount of headroom and therefore no indicators of impairment \nin the value of the investments. \nIAS 36 permits the reversal of impairment losses when there \nhave been favourable events or changes in circumstances \nsince the loss was recognised. Following the acquisition of the \nGroup in March 2021 and the subsequent equity injection of \n£378m, combined with successful refinancing of the B2 and \nA5 notes, management consider that the short term risks faced \nin the years ending 31 January 2021 and 31 January 2020 have \nnow been, in part, removed. However given the short time period \nlapsed between acquisition and the year end, the more prudent \ndividend distribution model using the estimated cost of equity \nof 19.1% as the discount rate, has been deemed the appropriate \nmeasure of value in use as at 31 January 2022. This has resulted \nin reversal of impairment of £210m in the current year.\nIf the cashflow forecasts were to change by +/-1% the extent \nof the impairment reversal in the year would have increased/\nreduced by £7m respectively and if the equity discount rate \nwere to change by +/-1% the extent of the impairment reversal \nin the year would have reduced/increased by £44m.\nAs the business continues to grow and cashflows and cost of \nequity improve further, management will continue to assess \nwhether there is a basis for further impairment reversal in \nthe future.\nNOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFinancial Statements\nAA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022  113\n112  AA Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2022"
