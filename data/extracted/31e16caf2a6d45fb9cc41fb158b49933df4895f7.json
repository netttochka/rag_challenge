      "text": "PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10017 \nT: (646) 471 3000,www.pwc.com/us\nReport of Independent Auditors\nTo the Board of Directors of Odyssey Group Holdings, Inc.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Odyssey Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries \n(the \"Company\"), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related \nconsolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for the years \nthen ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\").\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial \nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the \nyears then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (US \nGAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the \nConsolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet \nour other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe \nthat the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\nResponsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, \nimplementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated \nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or \nevents, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going \nconcern for one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued.\nAuditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free \nfrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. \nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with US GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not \ndetecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve \ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are \nconsidered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the \njudgment made by a reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements."

      "text": "2\nIn performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we:\n●\nExercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n●\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to \nfraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include \nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial \nstatements.\n●\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are \nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the \nCompany's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.\n●\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting \nestimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial \nstatements.\n●\nConclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise \nsubstantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope \nand timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the \naudit.\nOther Matters\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the information about incurred and \npaid claims development that precedes the current reporting period and the historical claims payout percentages included \nin Note 6 from page 32 to 39 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the \nresponsibility of management and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Financial \nAccounting Board (FASB) who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial \nstatements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to \nthe required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of \nAmerica, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the \ninformation for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other \nknowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any \nassurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an \nopinion or provide any assurance.\nNew York, New York April 4, 2023"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n(a) Basis of Presentation.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with \naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements \ninclude the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates \nand assumptions that could differ materially from actual results affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues \nand expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  The Company considers its accounting policies that are \nmost dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions as critical accounting estimates, which are defined as \nestimates that are both: i) important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and ii) \nrequire the Company to exercise significant judgment.  These estimates, by necessity, are based on assumptions about \nnumerous factors.\nThe Company reviews its critical accounting estimates and assumptions on a quarterly basis, including: the valuation of \nthe reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses; analysis of the recoverability of deferred income tax assets; and \nvaluation of the investment portfolio, including a review for other-than-temporary declines in estimated fair value and the \npricing of level 3 securities.\nCertain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. \n(b) Investments.  The majority of the Company’s investments in fixed income securities and common stocks are \ncategorized as “held for trading” and are recorded at their estimated fair value based on quoted market prices (see Note 3).  \nMost investments in common stocks of affiliates are carried at the Company’s proportionate share of the equity of those \naffiliates. Short-term investments, which are classified as “held for trading” and which have a maturity of one year or less \nfrom the date of purchase, are carried at fair value. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with \nan original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include certificates of deposits totaling \n$46.2m and $22.4m as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Investments in limited partnerships, investment funds, \nmortgage loans, collateral loans, affiliate loans, real estate and contingent considerations have been reported in other \ninvested assets. Other invested assets also include accounts relating to the Company’s unqualified benefit plans and certain \nderivative securities, all of which are carried at fair value. The Company routinely evaluates the carrying value of its \ninvestments in common stocks of affiliates and in partnerships and investment funds. In the case of limited partnerships and \ninvestment funds, the carrying value is generally established based on the net valuation criteria as determined by the \nmanagers of the investments. Such valuations could differ significantly from the values that would have been available had \nmarkets existed for the securities. Investment transactions are recorded on their trade date, with balances pending \nsettlement reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets or other liabilities.\nInvestment income, which is reported net of applicable investment expenses, is recorded as earned. Realized \ninvestment gains or losses are determined based on average cost. The Company records, in investment income, its \nproportionate share of income or loss, including realized gains or losses, for those securities for which the equity method of \naccounting is utilized, which include most common stocks of affiliates, limited partnerships and investment funds. Due to the \ntiming of when financial information is reported by equity investees and received by the Company, results attributable to \nthese investments are generally reported by the Company on a one month or one quarter lag. Unrealized appreciation and \ndepreciation related to trading securities is recorded as realized investment gains or losses in the consolidated statements of \noperations.\nThe net amount of unrealized appreciation or depreciation on the Company’s available for sale investments, net of \napplicable deferred income taxes, is reflected in shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. A decline \nin the fair value of an available for sale investment below its cost or amortized cost that is deemed other-than-temporary is \nrecorded as a realized investment loss in the consolidated statements of operations, resulting in a new cost or amortized cost \nbasis for the investment. Other-than-temporary declines in the carrying values of investments recorded in accordance with \nthe equity method of accounting are recorded in net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations."

Reinsurance assumed premiums written and related costs are based upon reports received \nfrom ceding companies. When reinsurance assumed premiums written have not been reported by the ceding company they \nare estimated, at the individual contract level, based on historical patterns and experience from the ceding company and \njudgment of the Company. Subsequent adjustments to premiums written, based on actual results or revised estimates from \nthe ceding company, are recorded in the period in which they become known. Reinsurance assumed premiums written \nrelated to proportional treaty business are established on a basis that is consistent with the coverage periods under the terms \nof the underlying insurance contracts. Reinsurance assumed premiums written related to excess of loss and facultative \nreinsurance business are recorded over the coverage term of the contracts, which is generally one year. Unearned premium \nreserves are established for the portion of reinsurance assumed premiums written that are to be recognized over the \nremaining contract period. Unearned premium reserves related to proportional treaty contracts are computed based on \nreports received from ceding companies, which show premiums written but not yet earned. Premium adjustments made over \nthe life of the contract are recognized as earned premiums based on the applicable contract period. Insurance premiums \nwritten are based upon the effective date of the underlying policy and are generally earned on a pro rata basis over the policy \nperiod, which is usually one year. A reserve for uncollectible premiums is established when deemed necessary. The Company \nhas established a reserve for potentially uncollectible premium receivable balances of $3.8m and $10.3m as of December 31, \n2022 and 2021, respectively, which has been netted against premiums receivable.\nThe cost of reinsurance purchased by the Company (reinsurance premiums ceded) is reported as prepaid reinsurance \npremiums and amortized over the contract period in proportion to the amount of reinsurance protection provided; unearned \npremiums are included in recoverables from reinsurers on the consolidated balance sheets. The ultimate amount of \npremiums, including adjustments, is recognized as premiums ceded, and amortized over the applicable contract period. \nPremiums earned are reported net of reinsurance ceded premiums earned in the consolidated statements of operations. \nAmounts paid by the Company for retroactive reinsurance that meet the conditions for reinsurance accounting are reported \nas reinsurance receivables to the extent those amounts do not exceed the associated liabilities. If the liabilities exceed the \namounts paid, reinsurance receivables are increased to reflect the difference, and the resulting gain is deferred and amortized \nover the estimated settlement period. If the amounts paid for retroactive reinsurance exceed the liabilities, the related \nliabilities are increased or the reinsurance receivable is reduced, or both, at the time the reinsurance contract is effective, \nand the excess is charged to net income. Changes in the estimated amount of liabilities relating to the underlying reinsured \ncontracts are recognized in net income in the period of the changes. Assumed and ceded reinstatement premiums represent \nadditional premiums related to reinsurance coverages, principally catastrophe excess of loss contracts, which are paid when \nthe incurred loss limits have been utilized under the reinsurance contract and such limits are reinstated. Premiums written \nand earned premiums related to a loss event are estimated and accrued as earned. The accrual is adjusted based upon any \nchange to the ultimate losses incurred under the contract.\nLeasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the leases. All of the Company’s leasing revenue is \ngenerated from operating leases. Assets held for leases consist of land and buildings with estimated useful lives of 30 to 39 \nyears and are valued at $279.6m.\n(d) Deferred Acquisition Costs.  Acquisition costs, which are reported net of costs recovered under ceded contracts, \nconsist of commissions and brokerage expenses incurred on insurance and reinsurance business written, and premium taxes \non direct insurance written, and are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. \nCommission adjustments are accrued based on changes in premiums and losses recorded by the Company in the period in \nwhich they become known. Deferred acquisition costs are limited to their estimated realizable value based on the related \nunearned premium, which considers anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses and estimated remaining costs of \nservicing the business, all based on historical experience. The realizable value of the Company’s deferred acquisition costs is \ndetermined without consideration of investment income.\nIncluded in acquisition costs in the consolidated statements of operations are amortized deferred acquisition costs of \n$1,105.5m and $769.8m for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively."

The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets as required by GAAP. A \npurchase price paid that is in excess of net assets arising from a business combination is recorded as an asset (“goodwill”) \nand is not amortized. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset. Intangible \nassets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets are analyzed for impairment on an annual \nbasis to determine if the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the goodwill or intangible asset is impaired, it is written \ndown to its realizable value with a corresponding expense reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. For the \nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company did not impair any goodwill or intangible assets. \nThe following table reflects the carrying amount of goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives and intangible assets \nwith finite lives as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nIntangible Assets\nGoodwill\nIndefinite Lives\nFinite Lives\nTotal\nBalance, January 1, 2021\n$\n52.3\n$\n5.8\n$\n15.1\n$\n73.2\nAcquired during 2021\n—\n—\n5.7\n5.7\nAmortization during 2021\n—\n—\n(6.7)\n(6.7)\nBalance, December 31, 2021\n52.3\n5.8\n14.1\n72.2\nAcquired during 2022\n—\n—\n1.3\n1.3\nAmortization during 2022\n—\n—\n(6.8)\n(6.8)\nBalance, December 31, 2022\n$\n52.3\n$\n5.8\n$\n8.6\n$\n66.7\nThe following table provides the estimated amortization expense related to intangible assets for the succeeding years:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028 and \nthereafter\nAmortization of intangible \nassets\n$\n5.4\n$\n1.9\n$\n0.9\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\nf) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.  Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses represent reserves for the \nestimated amounts that the Company is obligated to pay for reported and unreported claims and related loss adjustment \nexpenses incurred under its contracts of insurance and reinsurance. The estimates are based on assumptions related to the \nultimate cost to settle such claims. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for reinsurance contracts \nthan for direct insurance policies due to the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance contracts \nand the necessary reliance on ceding companies for information regarding reported claims. As a result, there can be no \nassurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed amounts reserved, with a resulting adverse effect on the Company.\nThe reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the Company’s evaluations of reported \nclaims and individual case estimates received from ceding companies for reinsurance business or the estimates advised by \nthe Company’s claims adjusters for insurance business. The Company utilizes generally accepted actuarial methodologies to \ndetermine reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses based on historical experience and other estimates. The reserves \nare reviewed continually during the year and changes in estimates for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reflected as \nexpenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that the changes are identified. Reinsurance recoverables \non unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are reported as assets. A reserve for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables \nis established based on an evaluation of each reinsurer or retrocessionaire and historical experience. The Company uses \ntabular reserving for workers’ compensation indemnity loss reserves, which are considered to be fixed and determinable, \nand discounts such reserves using an interest rate of 3.5% and the Life Table for Total Population: United States, 2009."

The Company may enter into assumed and ceded reinsurance contracts that contain \ncertain loss limiting provisions and, as a result, do not meet the risk transfer provisions of GAAP. These contracts are deemed \nas either transferring only significant timing risk or only significant underwriting risk or transferring neither significant timing \nnor underwriting risk and are accounted for using the deposit accounting method, under which revenues and expenses from \nreinsurance contracts are not recognized as written premium and incurred losses. Instead, the profits or losses from these \ncontracts are recognized net, as other income or other expense, over the contract or contractual settlement periods. \nFor such contracts, the Company initially records the amount of consideration paid as a deposit asset or received as a \ndeposit liability. Revenue or expense is recognized over the term of the contract, with any deferred amount recorded as a \ncomponent of assets or liabilities until such time it is earned. The ultimate asset or liability under these contracts is estimated, \nand the asset or liability initially established, which represents the consideration transferred, is increased or decreased over \nthe term of the contract. The change during the period is recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, \nwith increases and decreases in the ultimate asset or liability shown in other expense, net.  As of December 31, 2022 and \n2021, the Company had reflected $2.1m and $1.6m, for December 31, 2022 and 2021, in other assets and $0.0m and $0.2m, \nfor December 31, 2022 and 2021, in other liabilities, related to deposit contracts. In cases where cedants retain the \nconsideration on a funds held basis, the Company records those assets in other assets, and records the related investment \nincome on the assets in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations as investment income.\n(h) Income Taxes. The Company records deferred income taxes to provide for the net tax effect of temporary \ndifferences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and their \ntax bases. Such differences relate principally to deferred acquisition costs, unearned premiums, unpaid losses and loss \nadjustment expenses, investments and tax credits. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when the \nCompany believes it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of deferred taxes will not be realized. As of December 31, \n2021, the Company had determined that it is more likely than not that its foreign tax credit carryovers (“FTC”) would not be \nutilized prior to expiration and a valuation allowance of $39.1m was recorded against the FTC deferred tax asset. Due to \nincreased foreign sourced income during 2022 and the expectation that such income would continue in future years, this \nallowance was released in 2022. The Company has elected to recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with \nuncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision. \n(i) Derivatives.  The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage against potential adverse changes in the value \nof its assets and liabilities. Derivatives include total return swaps, interest rate swaps, forward currency contracts, U.S. \nTreasury bond forward contracts, CPI-linked derivative contracts, credit default swaps, call options, put options, warrants and \nother equity and credit derivatives. In addition, the Company holds options on certain securities within its fixed income \nportfolio that allow the Company to extend the maturity date on fixed income securities or convert fixed income securities \nto equity securities. The Company categorizes these investments as trading securities, and, except as noted below with \nrespect to certain Crop-related products and derivative instruments purchased and sold to hedge the Company's exposure \nto such Crop-related products, changes in fair value are recorded as realized investment gains or losses in the consolidated \nstatements of operations. All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance \nsheets and are measured at their fair value. Gains or losses from changes in the derivative values are reported based on how \nthe derivative is used and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. Except as noted below, for derivative instruments that \ndo not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are included in realized investment gains and losses in the \nconsolidated statements of operations. Margin balances required by counterparties in support of derivative positions are \nincluded in fixed income securities and short-term investments.\nThe Company has accounted for certain U.S. Crop-related products that do not qualify as insurance contracts and \nrelated reinsurance on such contracts as derivative instruments, reflecting the fair value of such instruments as either other \nassets or other liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet, depending upon the position of each instrument as of each \nreporting date. The Company has hedged its net exposure to losses from these contracts using put options and collars \nacquired at or near the initial issuance date of the contracts, reflecting the fair value of such instruments as either other \nassets or other liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet, depending upon the position of such hedging instruments as of \neach reporting date. Changes in fair value for both the hedged contracts and the hedging instruments are reflected in loss \nand loss adjustment expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. \n(j) Foreign Currency.  Foreign currency transaction gains or losses resulting from a change in exchange rates between \nthe currency in which a transaction is denominated, or the original currency, and the functional currency are reflected in the \nconsolidated statements of operations in the period in which they occur. The Company translates the financial statements of \nits foreign subsidiaries and branches that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars by translating \nbalance sheet accounts at the balance sheet date exchange rate and income statement accounts at the rate at which the"

The Company reflects awards of restricted common stock of Fairfax to employees \nas a reduction to additional paid-in-capital when the shares are purchased. The award value is amortized through \ncompensation expense over the related vesting periods.\n(l) Claims Payments.  Payments of claims by the Company, as reinsurer, to a broker on behalf of a reinsured company \nare recorded in the Company’s financial statements as paid losses at the time the cash is disbursed and are treated as paid \nto the reinsured.  Premiums due to the Company from the reinsured are recorded as receivables from the reinsured until the \ncash is received by the Company, either directly from the reinsured or from the broker.\n(m) Funds Held Balances.  “Funds held under reinsurance contracts” represents amounts due to reinsurers arising from \nthe Company’s receipt of a deposit from a reinsurer, or the withholding of a portion of the premiums due, in accordance with \ncontractual terms, as a guarantee that the reinsurer will meet its loss and other obligations. Interest generally accrues on \nwithheld funds in accordance with contract terms. “Funds held by reinsured” represents amount due from a ceding company \nthat withholds, in accordance with the contractual terms, a portion of the premium due the Company as a guarantee that \nthe Company will meet its loss and other obligations.\n(n) Fixed Assets.  Fixed assets, with a net book value of $110.9m and $106.2m as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively, are recorded at amortized cost and are included in other assets. Depreciation and amortization are generally \ncomputed on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:\nLeasehold improvements\n10 years or term of lease, if shorter\nElectronic data processing equipment and furniture\n5 years\nPersonal computers and software\n3 years\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $30.2m and $27.5m, \nrespectively."

Amounts are accrued for the resolution of claims that have either been asserted or are \ndeemed probable of assertion if, in the opinion of the Company, it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the \namount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.  In many cases it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been \nincurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until years after the contingency arises, in which \ncase no accrual is made until that time. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no contingent liabilities have been recorded (see \nNote 11).\n(p) Recent Accounting Pronouncements.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) is the organization \nresponsible for establishing and improving GAAP. \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,” which provides for the recognition \nand measurement at the reporting date of all expected credit losses for financial assets that are not accounted for at fair \nvalue through net income, including investments in available-for-sale debt securities and loans, premiums receivable and \nreinsurance recoverable. The updated guidance amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model for available-\nfor-sale debt securities by requiring the recognition of impairments relating to credit losses through an allowance account \nand limits the amount of credit loss to the difference between a security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value. This guidance \nalso applies a new current expected credit loss model for determining credit-related impairments for financial instruments \nmeasured at amortized cost. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which deferred the effective date of ASU \n2016-13 to 2023 (with early adoption permitted), and ASU 2019-11, which amended and clarified certain guidance contained \nin ASU 2016-13. The Company evaluated the effect this standard will have on its consolidated financial statement and \ndetermined the impact to be insignificant.   \nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU 2019-12 provides \nthe simplification of existing guidance for income taxes, including the removal of certain exceptions related to the recognition \nof deferred tax liabilities on foreign subsidiaries. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 effective in 2022 as required; the \nadoption did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. \nThe Company has determined that all recently issued guidance and pronouncements, other than those directly \nreferenced above, are either not applicable or are immaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n(q) Equity Method Investments Valuation and Changes Misstatement.  The Company has concluded that, as a result of \nthe misapplication of accounting guidance for the accounting of equity method investments, the carrying value and the \nchanges in value related to certain of the Company's investments were misstated as presented in its financial statements for \n2021. \nThe effect of the misstatements were such that December 31, 2021 common stocks, at equity, were understated by \n$53.7m, shareholders' equity was understated by $42.4 million (including the overstatement of  accumulated other \ncomprehensive loss net of deferred income taxes by $52.1m and retained earnings by $9.7m), deferred tax assets were \noverstated by $11.3m, net income was overstated by $10.5m (net of tax) and other comprehensive income was understated \nby $7.0m. These misstatements were corrected in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, \n2022.\nThe Company performed both a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the materiality of the adjustments and \nconcluded that the effects were not material to the Company's financial position or results of operations within the 2021 \nannual consolidated financial statements or for the 2022 annual consolidated financial statements in which they were \nadjusted. \n(r) Subsequent Events.  The Company has evaluated the significance of events occurring subsequent to December 31, \n2022 with respect to disclosing the nature and expected impact of such events as of April 4, 2023, the date these \nconsolidated financial statements were available to be issued."

Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company accounts for a significant portion of its financial instruments at fair value as required by GAAP.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are measured and classified in a \nthree-level hierarchy for disclosure purposes based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to \nmeasure fair values.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets \nor liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). When the inputs used to measure fair value fall \nwithin different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the \nlowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Gains and losses for assets and liabilities \ncategorized within the Level 3 table below, therefore, may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both \nobservable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable inputs (Level 3). Financial assets and liabilities recorded in the \nconsolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\nLevel 1 financial instruments are financial assets and liabilities for which the values are based on unadjusted quoted \nprices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access.  Market price data \ngenerally is obtained from exchange markets.  The Company does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments.  The \nmajority of the Company’s Level 1 investments are common stocks that are actively traded in a public market and short-term \ninvestments and cash equivalents, for which the cost basis approximates fair value.\nLevel 2 financial instruments are financial assets and liabilities for which the values are based on quoted prices in \nmarkets that are not active, or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of \nthe asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following:\na)\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\nb)\nQuoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets;\nc)\nPricing models, the inputs for which are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and\nd)\nPricing models, the inputs for which are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data \nthrough correlation or other means, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2 include government and \ncorporate fixed income securities, which are priced using publicly traded over-the-counter prices and broker-dealer quotes. \nObservable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads and bids are available for \nthese investments.  Also included in Level 2 are inactively traded convertible corporate debentures that are valued using a \npricing model that includes observable inputs such as credit spreads and discount rates in the calculation.\nLevel 3 financial instruments are financial assets and liabilities for which the values are based on prices or valuation \ntechniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These \nmeasurements include circumstances in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.  In certain cases, \nthe inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, the level in the \nfair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant \nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.  Therefore, these inputs reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the \nmethodology and valuation techniques that a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no securities were transferred into or out of Level 3. \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company purchased $262.8m and $142.7m, respectively, of \ninvestments that are classified as Level 3.  As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company held $586.6m and $571.9m, \nrespectively, of investments that are classified as Level 3.  Level 3 investments include CPI-linked derivative contracts, and \ncertain loans, bonds, preferred stocks and common stocks."

Changes in the observability of \nvaluation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities. Reclassifications impacting Level 3 of \nthe fair value hierarchy are generally reported as transfers in or out of the Level 3 category as of the beginning of the period \nin which the reclassifications occur. The Company has determined, after carefully considering the impact of recent economic \nconditions and liquidity in the credit markets on the Company’s portfolio, that it should not re-classify any of its investments \nfrom Level 1 or Level 2 to Level 3 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.  There were no transfers of securities \nbetween Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \nThe Company is responsible for determining the fair value of its investment portfolio by utilizing market driven fair \nvalue measurements obtained from active markets, where available, by considering other observable and unobservable \ninputs and by employing valuation techniques that make use of current market data.

These assets may \ninclude equity-method investments, mortgage loans and investments in real estate. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the \nCompany did not carry any equity method investments, mortgage loans, or investments in real estate at fair value.\nThe Company purchases investments in mortgage loans in the normal course of its business. The carrying value of \nmortgage loans are at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value, was $740.7m and $569.9m at December 31, 2022 \nand 2021, respectively. Mortgage loans are considered to be Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy. Mortgage loans are \nvalued using the market approach and discounted cash flow method. By increasing (decreasing) the credit spreads applied at \nDecember 31, 2022 by 100 basis points, the fair value of the mortgage loans would not change significantly primarily due to \nthe short term nature of these instruments. \nFair Value Option\nThe fair value option (“FVO”) allows companies to irrevocably elect fair value as the initial and subsequent \nmeasurement attribute for certain financial assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities for which \nthe election is made are recognized in net income as they occur. The FVO election is permitted on an instrument-by-\ninstrument basis at initial recognition of an asset or liability or upon the occurrence of an event that gives rise to a new basis \nof accounting for that instrument.\nThe Company owns Classes A, C, E, G, H, I, J, K and Q common shares of HWIC Asia Fund (“HWIC Asia”), which is 100% \nowned by Fairfax and of which the Company owns 34.5% as of December 31, 2022. At the time of the purchase of each class \nof shares, the Company elected the FVO for these investments, as HWIC Asia is a multi-class investment company that reports \nits investments at fair value and provides a NAV on a monthly basis.\nThe Company owns shares of HWIC QIAIF Value Opportunities Fund (\"HWIC VOF\"), shares in HWIC QIAIF Property Fund \nI (\"HWIC PFI\") and shares in HWIC QIAIF Property Fund II (“HWIC PF2”), which are each 100% owned by Fairfax and of which \nthe Company owns 2.8%, 24.1% and 29.8%, respectively. At the time of purchase of the HWIC VOF and the HWIC PFI \ninvestments, the Company elected the FVO for these investments, as they are investment companies that report investments \nat fair value and provide a NAV on a monthly basis.\nThe carrying values of the Company’s investment in the various HWIC Asia, HWIC VOF and HWIC PFI and HWIC PF2 \ncommon share issues as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, which are included in common stocks at fair value on the balance \nsheet, and the changes in fair value for each issue for the years then ended, are summarized below:\nHWIC\nHWIC\nHWIC\nHWIC\nHWIC\nHWIC\nHWIC\nHWIC\nHWIC\nAsia\nAsia\nAsia\nAsia\nAsia\nAsia\nAsia\nAsia\nAsia\nHWIC\nHWIC\nHWIC\nClass A\nClass C\nClass E\nClass G\nClass H\nClass I\nClass J\nClass K\nClass Q\nVOF\nPFI\nPF2\nTotal\nFair value as of\n  January 1, 2021\n$\n2.9\n$\n7.8\n$\n0.1\n$\n69.4\n$\n67.8\n$\n—\n$ 43.4\n$ 24.4\n$\n20.3\n$\n5.8\n$\n13.8\n$\n53.2\n$\n308.9\nPurchases/ (Sales)\n(2.3)\n—\n8.1\n1.2\n—\n—\n—\n60.6\n—\n0.1\n—\n—\n67.7\nChange in fair value\n1.5\n(2.0)\n(0.1)\n(5.0)\n26.0\n—\n(3.6)\n(17.7)\n(1.6)\n0.9\n(1.0)\n(2.3)\n(4.9)\nCurrency translation\n       adjustment\n—\n—\n(0.1)\n—\n—\n—\n—\n(0.1)\n—\n(0.4)\n—\n(0.3)\n(0.9)\nFair value as of\n  December 31, 2021\n2.1\n5.8\n8.0\n65.6\n93.8\n—\n39.8\n67.2\n18.7\n6.4\n12.8\n50.6\n370.8\nPurchases/ (Sales)\n—\n—\n(7.2)\n—\n—\n20.0\n—\n6.5\n—\n—\n—\n—\n19.3\nChange in fair value\n(0.4)\n(0.9)\n(0.1)\n(5.6)\n(29.5)\n2.7\n(2.6)\n18.1\n(0.5)\n0.7\n0.6\n5.6\n(11.9)\nCurrency translation\n       adjustment\n—\n—\n(0.7)\n—\n(0.2)\n—\n(1.3)\n(1.1)\n(1.0)\n(0.5)\n(1.4)\n(6.0)\n(12.2)\nFair value as of\n  December 31, 2022\n$\n1.7\n$\n4.9\n$\n—\n$\n60.0\n$\n64.1\n$\n22.7\n$ 35.9\n$ 90.7\n$\n17.2\n$\n6.6\n$\n12.0\n$\n50.2\n$\n366.0\nThe Company did not elect the FVO for its other affiliated investments, as these affiliated investments were ultimately \n100% owned by Fairfax and its subsidiaries, and fair values were deemed to be not readily obtainable.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the Company has not elected the FVO for any of its liabilities."

The \ncommon stock total return swaps, which are carried at fair value, are recorded in other invested assets or other liabilities \nbased on the positive or negative value of the underlying contracts as of the financial statement date.  Changes in the fair \nvalue of common stock total return swaps are recorded as realized investment gains or losses in the consolidated statements \nof operations in the period in which they occur.\nTo reduce its exposure to interest rate risk, the Company holds forward contracts to sell long dated U.S. Treasury bonds. \nThese contracts have an average term to maturity of less than one year and may be renewed at market rates.

Changes in the unrealized fair \nvalue of the contracts are recorded as realized gains or losses on investments in the Company’s consolidated statements of \noperations with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the derivative asset.  In the event of a sale, expiration \nor early settlement of one of the Company’s CPI-linked derivative contracts, the Company would receive the fair value of that \ncontract on the date of the transaction.  The Company’s maximum potential cash loss is limited to the premiums already paid \nto enter into the derivative contracts."

Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nEstimates of reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which relate to loss events that have occurred \non or before the balance sheet date, are contingent on many assumptions that may or may not occur in the future. The \nestimates reflect assumptions regarding initial expectations of losses and patterns of loss reporting, both for claims with \nhigher frequency and lower severity as well as for claims with lower frequency and higher severity associated with individual \nlarge loss events, such as earthquakes, windstorms, and floods. The eventual outcome of these loss events may be different \nfrom the assumptions underlying the Company’s reserve estimates. When the business environment and loss trends diverge \nfrom expected trends, the Company may have to adjust its reserves accordingly, potentially resulting in adverse or favorable \neffects to the Company’s financial results. The Company believes that the recorded estimate represents the best estimate of \nunpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based on the information available as of December 31, 2022. The estimate is \nreviewed on a quarterly basis and the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the amounts provided, for which any \nadjustments will be reflected in the periods in which they become known.\nThe Company’s estimate of ultimate loss is determined based on a review of the results of several commonly accepted \nactuarial projection methodologies incorporating the quantitative and qualitative information described above. The specific \nmethodologies the Company utilizes in its loss reserve review process include, but may not be limited to (i) incurred and paid \nloss development methods, (ii) incurred and paid Bornhuetter Ferguson (“BF”) methods and (iii) loss ratio methods. The \nincurred and paid loss development methods utilize loss development patterns derived from historical loss emergence trends"

These methods assume that the ratio of losses \nin one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant in the future. Loss ratio methods multiply expected loss ratios, \nderived from aggregated analyses of internally developed pricing trends, by earned premium to determine ultimate loss. The \nincurred and paid BF methods are a blend of the loss development and loss ratio methods. These methods utilize both loss \ndevelopment patterns, as well as expected loss ratios, to determine ultimate loss. When using the BF methods, the initial \ntreaty year ultimate loss is based predominantly on expected loss ratios. As loss experience matures, the estimate of ultimate \nloss using this methodology is based predominantly on loss development patterns. The Company generally does not utilize \nmethodologies that are dependent on claim counts reported, claim counts settled or claim counts open. Due to the nature \nof the Company’s business, this information is not routinely provided for every treaty/program. Consequently, actuarial \nmethods utilizing this information generally cannot be relied upon by the Company in its loss reserve estimation process. As \na result, for much of the Company’s business, the separate analysis of frequency and severity of loss activity underlying overall \nloss emergence trends is not practical. Generally, the Company relies on BF and loss ratio methods for estimating ultimate \nloss liabilities for more recent treaty years. These methodologies, at least in part, apply a loss ratio, determined from \naggregated analyses of internally developed pricing trends across reserve cells, to premium earned on that business. \nAdjustments to premium estimates generate appropriate adjustments to ultimate loss estimates in the quarter in which they \noccur, using the BF and loss ratio methods. To estimate losses for more mature treaty years, the Company generally relies on \nthe incurred loss development methodology, which does not rely on premium estimates. In addition, the Company may use \nother methods to estimate liabilities for specific types of claims. For property catastrophe losses, the Company may utilize \nvendor catastrophe models to estimate ultimate loss soon after a loss occurs, where loss information is not yet reported to \nthe Company from cedants/insureds. Incurred but not reported reserves are determined by subtracting the total of paid loss \nand case reserves, including additional case reserves, from ultimate loss.\nThe Company completes comprehensive loss reserve reviews, which include a reassessment of loss development and \nexpected loss ratio assumptions, on an annual basis. The Company completed this year’s annual review in the fourth quarter \nof 2022. The results of these reviews are reflected in the period in which they are completed. Quarterly, the Company \ncompares actual loss emergence to expectations established by the comprehensive loss reserve review process. In the event \nthat loss trends diverge from expected trends, the Company may have to adjust its reserves for losses and loss adjustment \nexpenses (“LAE”) accordingly. Any adjustments will be reflected in the periods in which they become known, potentially \nresulting in adverse or favorable effects to our financial results. The Company believes that the recorded estimate represents \nthe best estimate of unpaid losses and LAE based on the information available at December 31, 2022. The Company’s most \nsignificant assumptions underlying its estimate of losses and LAE reserves are as follows: (i) that historical loss emergence \ntrends are indicative of future loss development trends; (ii) that internally developed pricing trends provide a reasonable \nbasis for determining loss ratio expectations for recent underwriting years; and (iii) that no provision is made for extraordinary \nfuture emergence of new classes of loss or types of loss that are not sufficiently represented in its historical database or that \nare not yet quantifiable if not in its database."

The increase in current year paid losses and loss adjustment expenses for \nthe year ended December 31, 2022 was principally due increased payments on U.S. Property Insurance and U.S. Property \nReinsurance lines of business. The increases in paid losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, \n2021 was principally due to increased payments on current year catastrophe losses. \nThe effects of exchange rate changes on net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses resulted in decreases of \n$152.1m and $109.5m for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were attributable to Non-U.S. \nReinsurance and Non-U.S. Insurance lines business.\nCeded unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses were $1,208.9m and $1,059.4m as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively. The increase in ceded unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 was \nprincipally attributable to U.S. Casualty Insurance business. The increase in ceded unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses \nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 was principally attributable to Insurance business, largely offset by reduction in ceded \nproperty catastrophe reserves. \nThe Company uses tabular reserving for workers’ compensation indemnity loss reserves, which are considered to be \nfixed and determinable, and discounts such reserves using an interest rate of 3.5%.  Workers’ compensation indemnity loss \nreserves have been discounted using the Life Table for Total Population: United States, 2009. Reserves reported at the \ndiscounted value were $42.9m and $44.6m as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of case reserve \ndiscount was $13.0m and $13.6m as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The amount of incurred but not reported \nreserve discount was $17.0m and $17.2m as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company is not materially exposed to asbestos and environmentally-related liabilities and does not establish a \nspecific reserve for such exposures.\n7. Reinsurance and Retrocessions\nThe Company utilizes reinsurance and retrocessional agreements to reduce and spread the risk of loss on its insurance \nand reinsurance business and to limit exposure to multiple claims arising from a single occurrence. The Company is subject \nto accumulation risk with respect to catastrophic events involving multiple treaties, facultative certificates and insurance \npolicies. To protect against these risks, the Company purchases catastrophe excess of loss protection. The retention, the level \nof capacity purchased, the geographical scope of the coverage and the costs vary from year to year. Additionally, the Company \npurchases specific protections related to the insurance business underwritten in both the U.S. and abroad.\nThere is credit risk with respect to reinsurance, which would result in the Company recording a charge to earnings in \nthe event that such reinsuring companies are unable, at some later date, to meet their obligations under the reinsurance \nagreements in force.

(“Fairfax (US)”).  The method of allocation \namong the companies is subject to a written agreement.

The Act included a \nminimum base erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) on certain payments to foreign affiliates and a US tax on foreign earnings \nfor certain global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\"). The Company has evaluated the accounting policy election related \nto the BEAT and GILTI provisions and has concluded both will be treated as period costs.

During 2019 the Internal Revenue Service \n(“IRS”) issued final regulations and Revenue Procedure 2019-31 resulting in a $2.0m increase to the initial computation.

Both provisions are effective in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. Based upon \nprojected adjusted financial statement income for 2023, the Company (or the controlled group of corporations of which the \nCompany is a member) has determined that the average \"adjusted financial statement income\" is above the thresholds \nrequired to perform the CAMT calculation for the 2023 tax year. The impact of the alternative minimum tax, if any, will vary \nfrom year to year based on the relationship of the Company's financial statement income to the Company's taxable income. \nThe Company paid federal and foreign income taxes of $67.9m and $5.4m for the years ended December 31, 2022 and \n2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a net current tax payable of $18.3m, which included $1.6m \npayable to Fairfax (US) and a net payable of $16.7m to and from various foreign governments.

Effective for tax years 2019 and \nprior, the Company participated in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”). Under CAP, the IRS begins their \nexamination of the tax year before the income tax return is filed. The goal of CAP is to expedite the exam process and reduce \nthe level of uncertainty regarding a taxpayer’s filing positions by examining significant transactions and events as they occur. \nThe IRS did not propose any material adjustments as part of the Company’s previous examinations. Effective for tax year 2020 \nand later, the IRS changed requirements for continued participation in CAP, the Company no longer participates in the \nprogram, and will be subject to the normal IRS audit selection process.  Income tax returns filed with various state and foreign \njurisdictions remain open to examination in accordance with individual statutes.\nThe Company has elected to recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of \nthe income tax provision. The Company does not have any material unrecognized tax benefits and has not recognized any \naccrued interest or penalties associated with uncertain tax positions.\nFor federal income tax return purposes, the Company has FTC carryovers of $9.9m, of which $9.9m expire in 2031.\nWhen necessary, valuation allowances are established to reduce the deferred tax assets to amounts that are “more \nlikely than not” to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all available evidence \nfor each tax jurisdiction, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax \nplanning strategies. The Company assessed the realization of its FTC carryovers based on currently enacted U.S. and foreign \ntax laws and determined that it is “more likely than not” that most of the FTC carryovers related to foreign branch income \nwill not be utilized prior to expiration. For the year ended December 31, 2022, a valuation allowance of $39.1m against the \nFTC carryovers was released and is included in the Company’s 2022 effective tax rate reconciliation as change in valuation \nallowance. The total valuation allowance of as of December 31, 2022 is $0. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered \nrealizable, however, could change if future taxable income during the carryforward period differs from current estimates. \n11. Commitments and Contingencies\n(a)\nContingencies\nThe Company participates in Lloyd’s through its 100% ownership of the capital provider for Newline Syndicate (1218), \nfor which the Company directly or indirectly provides 100% of the capacity. The results of Newline Syndicate (1218) are \nconsolidated in the financial statements of the Company. In support of Newline Syndicate (1218)’s capacity at Lloyd’s, the \nCompany has pledged securities and cash with a fair value of $378.1m as of December 31, 2022 in a deposit trust account in \nfavor of the Society and Council of Lloyd’s. The securities may be substituted with other securities at the discretion of the \nCompany, subject to approval by Lloyd’s. The securities are carried at fair value and are included in investments and cash in \nthe Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on the securities is included in investment income. The pledge \nof assets in support of Newline Syndicate (1218) provides the Company with the ability to participate in writing business \nthrough Lloyd’s, which remains an important part of the Company’s business. The pledged assets effectively secure the \ncontingent obligations of Newline Syndicate (1218) should it not meet its obligations. The Company’s contingent liability to \nthe Society and Council of Lloyd’s is limited to the aggregate amount of the pledged assets. The Company has the ability to \nremove funds at Lloyd’s annually, subject to certain minimum amounts required to support outstanding liabilities as \ndetermined under risk-based capital models and approved by Lloyd’s. The funds used to support outstanding liabilities are \nadjusted annually and the obligations of the Company to support these liabilities will continue until they are settled or the \nliabilities are reinsured by a third party approved by Lloyd’s. The Company expects to continue to actively operate Newline \nSyndicate (1218) and support its requirements at Lloyd’s, and the Company believes that Newline Syndicate (1218) maintains \nsufficient liquidity and financial resources to support its ultimate liabilities, and the Company does not anticipate that the \npledged assets will be utilized."

The guarantee was made to enable TIG to access ORC’s financial strength \nratings, subsidiary of Fairfax, and capital resources for securing the APH Contract. ORC’s maximum exposure in connection \nwith this guarantee is $350.0m. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s estimated exposure under the guarantee is $14.9m, \nbased on TIG’s loss reserves for the APH Contract at December 31, 2022.

Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend \nrates by one percentage point in each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the service \nand interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2022 by $3.6m \nand $0.2m, respectively.\nOther Plans\nThe Company also maintains a defined contribution profit sharing plan for all eligible employees. Each year, the Board \nof Directors may authorize payment of an amount equal to a percentage of each participant’s basic annual earnings based \non the results of the Company for that year. These amounts are credited to the employees’ accounts maintained by a third \nparty, which has contracted to provide benefits under the plan. No additional discretionary  contributions were authorized \nfor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \nThe Company maintains a qualified deferred compensation plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986, as amended. Employees may contribute up to 50% of base salary on a pre-tax basis, subject to annual maximum \ncontributions set by law ($22.5 thousand in 2023 plus an additional $7.5 thousand if an employee is age 50 or older). The \nCompany contributes an amount equal to 100% of each employee’s pre-tax contribution up to certain limits. The maximum \nmatching contribution is 4.0% of annual base salary, with certain government-mandated restrictions on contributions to \nhighly compensated employees. The Company also maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to allow for \ncontributions in excess of qualified plan limitations. The Company’s contributions to both of these plans, which totaled $4.5m \nand $3.7m for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are included primarily in other underwriting \nexpenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAll employees in the United States hired on or after August 1, 2011 are eligible for an annual profit sharing contribution, \nsubject to the profit sharing plan limitations. The Company makes this contribution regardless of whether or not elective \ndeferrals were made during the year.  The profit sharing contribution is paid each January and uses the prior year’s 401(k) \ncompensation (base pay, short-term disability earnings and any overtime earnings) to determine the actual contribution for \neach employee. These profit sharing contributions are calculated as a percentage of earnings at the end of each year and \nallocated to participant accounts in January of the following year, with contribution percentages based upon each employee’s \nyears of service as follows:\nYears of Service\nPercent\nLess than or equal to 5 years\n6%\nMore than 5 years but less than or equal to 15\n7%\nMore than 15 years\n8%\nThe profit sharing contribution amounts vest based upon the following vesting schedule:\nYears of Service\nPercent\nLess than 2 years\n0%\n2 years but less than 3\n20%\n3 years but less than 4\n40%\n4 years but less than 5\n60%\n5 years but less than 6\n80%\n6 years or more\n100%"

Stock-Based Compensation Plans\nFairfax Restricted Share Plan and Share Option Plan\nIn 1999, Fairfax established the Fairfax Financial 1999 Restricted Share Plan (the “Fairfax Restricted Share Plan”) and \nthe Share Option Plan (the “Option Plan”) (collectively, the “Fairfax Plans”), in which the Company participates.  The Fairfax \nPlans generally provide officers, key employees and directors who were employed by or provided services to the Company \nwith awards of restricted shares or stock options (with a grant price of zero) of Fairfax common stock (collectively, “Restricted \nShare Awards”).  The Restricted Share Awards generally vest over five years.  The Company had 593,691 Restricted Share \nAwards outstanding as of December 31, 2022.\nThe fair value of the Restricted Share Awards is estimated on the date of grant based on the market price of Fairfax’s \nstock and is amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the related vesting periods.  The Company \npurchases Fairfax common stock on the open market to cover the grant of a Restricted Share Award and reflects such \npurchase as a reduction in the Company’s additional paid-in capital.  As of December 31, 2022, there was $55.9m of \nunrecognized compensation cost related to unvested Restricted Share Awards granted from the Fairfax Plans that was netted \nagainst additional paid-in capital, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average vesting period of \n2.2 years. The total fair values of the Restricted Share Awards granted for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were \n$29.6m and $27.6m, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate fair value of the Restricted Share Awards \noutstanding was $284.5m. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized expense related to \nthe Fairfax Plans of $24.4m and $23.1m, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes activity for the Fairfax Plans for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nShares /\nOptions\nWeighted-\nAverage Value\nat Grant Date\nAwards outstanding as of December 31, 2021\n600,940\n$\n393.55\nGranted\n62,772\n471.39\nVested\n(33,341)\n428.55\nForfeited\n(6,229)\n438.43\nUnallocated\n(30,451)\n469.54\nAwards outstanding as of December 31, 2022\n593,691\n$\n392.42\nVested and exercisable as of December 31, 2022\n22,036\n$\n460.13\nEmployee Share Purchase Plans\nUnder the terms of the Odyssey Re Holdings Corp. (Non-Qualified) 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the “2010 \nESPP”), eligible employees are given the election to purchase Fairfax common shares in an amount up to 10% of their annual \nbase salary. The Company matches these contributions by purchasing, on the employee’s behalf, a number of Fairfax’s \ncommon shares equal in value to 30% of the employee’s contribution. In the event that the Company achieves a net combined \nratio in any calendar year that is less than the lesser of i) 100% or ii) the average of the reported net combined ratios of the \nten (10) most recent calendar years prior to the current calendar year, additional shares are purchased by the Company for \nthe employee’s benefit, in an amount equal in value to 20% of the employee’s contribution during that year. During the year \nended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased 18,044 Fairfax common shares on behalf of employees pursuant to the \n2010 ESPP, at an average purchase price of $514.24. The compensation expense recognized by the Company for purchases \nof Fairfax’s common shares under the 2010 ESPP was $1.9m and $2.0m for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively."
