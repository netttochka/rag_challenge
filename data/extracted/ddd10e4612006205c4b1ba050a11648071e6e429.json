Our vision is to build a company for the new era and the \npast twelve months have seen us consolidate and integrate \nacross what has become our foundational platform. \nBrave Bison operates across four business pillars:  \nBrave Bison Performance is a digital media advertising \npractice. We plan and buy media on platforms such as \nGoogle, Meta, TikTok, Amazon and YouTube. All of our \nwork is focused on helping our customers drive conversion \nmetrics such sales, downloads and subscriptions. Customers \ninclude New Balance, Curry’s and Asus.\nBrave Bison Commerce is a digital commerce practice. We \nprovide technology services to help customers design and \nbuild next generation ecommerce platforms. Our teams use \nthe latest MACH technology from partners such as Salesforce, \nAdobe, SAP and BigCommerce to design, launch, upgrade and \nsupport best-in-class ecommerce systems. Customers include \nViking Direct, MKM Building Supplies and Muller.\nBrave Bison Social & Influencer (re-branded to Social \nChain as of February 2023) is a social media advertising \npractice. We create content for customers on social media \nplatforms and work with influencers to make and distribute \ncontent. This creative approach ensures that content is \nnative to the platform, leading to higher engagements from \naudiences. Customers include Panasonic, Vodafone, WWF \nand Rapyd.\nBrave Bison Media Network is a portfolio of channels \nacross YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram. \nThese channels generate over 1 billion monthly views, and \nthe advertising inventory from each channel is sold through \nonline advertising exchanges. Popular channels include The \nHook, PGA Tour, US Open and Link Up TV. \nWhilst each of our business pillars is led by a Managing \nDirector and supported by department heads, the Brave Bison \nplatform is one of connection and collaboration. We have \nworked hard over the past year to ensure that, despite our \nfour centres of excellence, we operate as one company, with a \nshared vision that aligns across each of our business pillars. \nYear in Review\n2022 was a strong year for Brave Bison. During the period \nrevenue grew by 46% to almost £32m, gross profit more \nthan doubled to just under £17m and the company \ngenerated adjusted EBITDA of over £3m, a YoY increase of \n71%. At year end our balance sheet remained strong with \nnet cash of over £6m, after having completed our third \nacquisition since Theo, Philippa and I joined the company \nmid 2020.  \nDuring the period the Leadership Team maintained a sharp \noperational focus. We completed the integration of four \nbusinesses, made our third acquisition, and relaunched an \nenhanced value and service proposition under a refreshed \nBrave Bison brand. This integrated and connected approach \nhas already proven its ability to attract new customers \nand allow for effective cross selling across our four \nbusiness units. \nBest Response Media (BRM) was acquired during the \nperiod and integrated into Brave Bison Commerce. Until \nthe acquisition, our efforts at Brave Bison Commerce were \nfocused on three major enterprise ecommerce platforms: \nSAP, Salesforce and BigCommerce. Through the acquisition \nof BRM, we are now able to offer services on Adobe \nCommerce Cloud, a ubiquitous platform that has grown \nfrom strength-to-strength in recent years. Furthermore, \nwe acquired a highly experienced and flexible resource \nbase in Mansoura, Egypt, as well as Tier 1 customers \nincluding NatWest.\nBrave Bison is headquartered in London, but the business \noperates across the world. We have staff in 11 countries and \nalmost a quarter of our team works remotely. Furthermore, \nover 50% of our staff work on a hybrid basis, often choosing \nto come into the office between one and three days per \nweek. This new way of working is an important part of our \nstrategy moving forward and is telling of the digital age \nwe are leaning into as a business. Our hybrid and remote \nworkforce enables us to hire more quickly, cheaply and \noften from a more diverse pool of talent. This approach \nalso means that, as we scale and grow our teams, we can \nkeep property costs low whilst maintaining a strong culture \nthrough a mixture of virtual team events and quarterly in \nperson socials.\n“\u0007We operate from trend to \nspend for our customers”"

The appointment of Gordon \nBrough as non-executive director during the period is a \nfurther indication of this commitment. Gordon has extensive \nexperience in UK public companies having been General \nCounsel at Aberdeen Asset Management plc (subsequently \nthe asset management arm of Abrdn) for almost 10 years. \nGordon’s legal experience, as well as his expertise in \nacquisitions will be crucial to the business as we look to \nfurther bolster our corporate profile. \nOutlook\nWe are mindful of macroeconomic challenges over the \nnext 12-18 months, but have confidence in the prevailing \ntrend that continues to shift marketing budgets away \nfrom traditional advertising and into digital channels. \nFurthermore, our position in this expanding marketplace is \ndifferentiated and growing from strength-to-strength.\nThis organic growth will be compounded by our carefully \nconsidered Acquisition & Integration strategy that has \nproven successful to date. Our Leadership Team is both \ncapable and focussed, and we anticipate that the acquisition \nof Social Chain (completed in February 2023) will have a \ntransformative impact on our ability to win and deliver for \ncustomers in the social media advertising space.\nOliver Green\nExecutive Chairman\n26 April 2023"

      "text": "6\nCFO’S REVIEW\n2022 was a year of healthy growth at Brave Bison.  \nRevenue increased by 46% to £31.7 million (2021: £21.7 million), \ngross profit increased by 117% to £16.9 million (2021: £7.8 \nmillion) and adjusted profit before tax, a measure of underlying \nprofitability, increased by 86% to £2.6 million (2021: £1.4 million). \nOrganic growth of gross profit, removing the impact of \nbusinesses acquired during the period, was £1.8 million, or \napproximately 12%.\nPrincipal Activities \nBrave Bison has two business models.\nFirstly, the provision of digital advertising and technology \nservices to global blue-chip companies. Services provided \ninclude social media advertising, influencer marketing, paid \nmedia services, search engine optimisation services, ecommerce \nsoftware integration, ecommerce system design and others. \nCustomers include New Balance, Muller, Primark and Asus. This \noperation is referred to as “fee based services” in the Group \nsegmental reporting.\nThe digital advertising and technology services business unit \nshowed good growth during the year. Revenues increased by \n169% to £19.7 million (2021: £7.3 million) and the gross profit \napproximately tripled to £14.0 million (2021: £4.8 million). In line \nwith our acquisition and integration strategy, Greenlight Digital \nwas integrated into Brave Bison Performance, and Greenlight \nCommerce and Best Response Media were integrated into Brave \nBison Commerce. \nSecondly, Brave Bison owns and operates a network of social \nand digital media channels. These channels principally exist \non platforms such as YouTube, Snapchat, Facebook, TikTok \nand Instagram. Brave Bison publishes content on these \nchannels which attract views and serve advertising which \ncan be bought programmatically through digital advertising \nplatforms. This operation is referred to as “advertising” in Group \nsegmental reporting.\nThe advertising business unit generated revenue of £11.9 million \n(2021: £14.3 million) and approximately 1.3 billion views (2021: 1.7 \nbillion). This decrease year-on-year largely relates to channels \nthat are operated but not owned by Brave Bison on a revenue \nshare basis, therefore the underlying gross profit remained \nbroadly flat at £2.9 million (2021: £3.0 million). The small drop \nin gross profit was largely due to a softening of CPMs (cost \nper mille) in the second half of the year in response to macro-\neconomic conditions.  As we saw during the pandemic, this part \nof our business can be sensitive to such conditions, but tends to \nrecover swiftly.\nMargins & Operations\nBrave Bison tracks adjusted profit margin (adjusted profit \nbefore tax as a percentage of gross profit) as a key performance \nindicator to measure the Group’s financial performance. \nThe adjusted profit margin for the period was 15.4% (2021: \n17.9%) a decrease year-on-year. This decrease was driven by \nthe tripling of digital advertising and technology services net \nrevenues which operates at a lower adjusted profit margin than \nadvertising generated on the media network. \nDespite the decrease in adjusted profit margin, Brave Bison \nhas completed a number of initiatives to reduce the underlying \noperating costs of the business. These include a reduction \nin property costs through sub-letting excess office space, \nreduction in IT costs as business units are merged and careful \nresource management to reduce the staff cost to net revenue \nratio for billable customers. \nExceptional Costs & Adjustments\nDuring the year Brave Bison incurred restructuring costs of £0.1 \nmillion (2021:£0.2 million), relating to the restructuring and \nexpansion of the Group’s operations in Bulgaria, and acquisition \ncosts of £0.1 million (2021: £0.7 million) relating to the costs \nassociated with acquiring Best Response Media. \nBrave Bison carried out a purchase price allocation exercise \nduring the year in relation to the Greenlight acquisitions which \ncompleted in 2021, which resulted in identification of intangible \nassets relating to the acquired brands and customer relationships. \nAs a result of the rebranding, and retirement of the Greenlight \ntrade brand during the year, the amounts relating to this were \nimpaired in full during the year, resulting in an impairment charge \nof £0.5 million (2021: £nil). The customer relationships are \nbeing amortised over a period of 10 years, resulting in a charge \nof £0.2 million (2021: £nil).  As we deliver on our acquisition \nand integration strategy it is likely that both the amortisation of \nacquired intangibles, and impairment of acquired brands retired \npost-integration will continue to impact our financial statements.\nEquity settled share-based payments relate to the value of share \nawards that have been granted to employees of the Group. £0.3 \nmillion of this amount relates to the directors’ LTIP, which can \nonly be redeemed in accordance with the terms outlined in the \nDirectors’ Remuneration Report. The earliest possible redemption \ndate is December 2024, and redemption is contingent on the \nshare price exceeding 3.0 pence.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure that the Group uses to \nmeasure its performance and is defined as earnings before interest, \ntaxation, depreciation and amortisation and after add back of costs \nrelated to restructuring, acquisitions and share based payments. It \nshould be noted that a portion of the property costs in both 2022 \nand 2021 fall into the finance costs and depreciation lines as a \nresult of the introduction of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. \n“\u00072022 was a year of healthy \ngrowth at Brave Bison”"

The decrease in cash inflow is \nlargely due to a large customer prepayment received at the \nend of 2021, which subsequently unwound during the period. \nIn addition to this, the cashflow generated from operating \nactivities was used to fund the acquisition of Best \nResponse Media (£0.3 million) and the payment of deferred \nconsideration in respect of the Greenlight acquisition made \nin 2021 (£0.8 million). \nThe Group is carrying intangible assets of £6.3 million (2021: \n£6.3 million).

A lack of \nskilled workforce could result in a drop in service \nlevels and customer dissatisfaction, and therefore \nhave an adverse impact on the Group in terms \nof its reputation. The loss of such individuals, or \nthe failure to train and attract other high calibre \nindividuals may impact on the Group’s business and \nthe Group’s ability to achieve its targets.\nThe Group ensures all its employees are \nsupported and managed by way of regular \nperformance appraisals. Furthermore, the \nGroup incentivises key employees using \nperformance-related bonus plans and \nshare option awards that vest over a multi-\nyear period.\nCompetitive industry \ndynamics\nThe Group operates in a highly complex and \nrapidly changing industry. If the Group is not able \nto compete successfully against existing or future \ncompetitors, its competitive position, business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations may be \nadversely affected.\nThe Board believes the Group has adopted \na competitive business strategy to \nincrease the profits of the business. The \nGroup has implemented an acquisitive \nbusiness model to improve its capabilities \nand scale within the markets which \nit operates. Furthermore, the Group \nmaintains a substantial net cash position \nto provide flexibility in the event of a more \ncompetitive and less profitable trading \nenvironment.\nDependence on the \noperating policies of key \nplatforms\nThe Group generates a significant proportion of \nits revenue from three international technology \nplatforms which are subject to external factors \nbeyond the Group’s control. Changes to the \ncommercial agreements or policies implemented by \nthese platforms could have a negative impact on the \nfinancial position of the Group.\nThe Group has diversified its business \nmodel away from the advertising \nplatforms, which now only account for \n38% (FY21: 66%) of the Group’s revenues.\nFurthermore, the Group has diversified \nits revenues between three platforms to \nreduce the impact of any single platform \npolicy change.\nImpact of Pandemics\nA pandemic could cause an adverse impact on the \nGroup’s financial position. Customer marketing \nbudgets could reduce, which may result in lower \nrevenues. The Group’s employees may be unable to \nservice customers due to sickness or disruption to \nthe Group’s operations. \nThe Group operates a robust hybrid \nworking system where its employees are \nnot normally required to be physically \npresent in an office in order to deliver work \nfor customers. \nForeign Currency Risk\nThe Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange \nmovements in the US dollar.

      "text": "12\nESG REPORT\nENVIRONMENTAL\nAs a digital media, digital advertising and technology \nservices group, the direct and indirect impact of the Group \non the environment is low.  Nevertheless, we continue to \naim to reduce our environmental impact.\nOur sustainability strategy has 3 pillars, emissions, waste & \nrecycling and consumables.\nCarbon emissions:\nAs a service business our energy use is by far our biggest \ncontributor to our carbon emissions. Combined, electricity \nand gas represent around 70% of emissions in a normal \n(non-pandemic) year. We encourage energy saving with \nsimple but effective office measures.\nThe most important of these is our pledge to offset actual \ncarbon emissions or the highest year of emissions – \nproviding a direct incentive to staff to save energy, since \nany reduction below our worst year translates into the \nbusiness being carbon negative. This is critical and, we \nbelieve, unique, as it removes the implicit “permission to \nemit” that carbon offsetting programmes can otherwise \ncreate.\nCarbon Emissions are classified as Scope 1, 2 or 3. Scope 1 \nincludes direct emissions from burning fossil fuels, Scope 2 \nis made up of indirect emissions that a company is directly \nresponsible for, such as burning fossil fuels for electricity \nand emissions from public transport made on company \nbusiness, and Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions \nthat the company is indirectly responsible for. Scope 3 \nis wide and includes emissions from cloud computing,  \nemissions associated with the manufacture of office \nequipment and much more.\nOur Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions are measured in the \nfirst half of each year for the prior year. We partner with \nspecialist consultants Carbon Footprint Ltd to assess and \nverify our footprint. The assessment includes rigorous \nestimates of the impact of our people working from \nhome, which they now do a significant proportion of the \ntime. From this year we intend our reports will cover the \nentirety of Scope 3 emissions, making 2022 the first year \na complete and unflinching benchmark of our Carbon \nFootprint has been made.\nOur offsetting programme is a blend of avoided \ndeforestation (REDD) in the Amazon, reforesting in Africa, \nUK tree planting, and clean cooking technology in rural \nChina and India (where wood and coal burning is otherwise \nprevalent). Finally, we plant 15 trees for every new client \nwin or renewed client contract in our Tree Nation forest. \nAs our measurement to date has been for Scopes 1, 2 and \npart of Scope 3, we only claim Scope 1 & 2 carbon neutrality \n(or carbon negativity in years where our offsetting is \ngreater than our emissions).  Following 2022’s Carbon \nFootprint assessment which we expect to be complete \nby the end of May, it’s our ambition to make a Net Zero \ncommitment in line with the Science Based Targets \nInitiative, accompanied by a plan to reach Net Zero across \nall scopes.\nOther measures include automatic timers on our TV’s \nand communication with our staff about the impact their \nenergy use has.  Travel was significantly reduced as a result \nof COVID-19, and the Group continues to minimise travel \nwhere possible.\nWaste & Recycling\nThe Group operates a largely paperless office.  All \nemployees are advised that documents and emails should \nnot be printed, instead accessed via shared digital drives. \nWhen required, printers are set to double-sided and black \nand white, the aim being to reduce the use of both paper \nand toner.\nWe have long been a Group that aims to recycle as much \nwaste as possible.  We have clearly labelled recycling \npoints stationed around the offices, and avoid bins at desks \nto encourage their use.\nConsumables\nWe have an ongoing programme designed to minimise \nthe environmental impact of our consumption beyond \ngreenhouse gases and recycling.\nLivestock farming generates a significant percentage of \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions, with red meat and dairy \nproducing the majority of this. A third of the water used \nfor farming goes toward rearing farm animals. Soy and oat \nmilk alternatives are provided, again reducing our dairy \nfarming impact while avoiding water intensive almond milk. \nFrom this year, our ambition is to stop the routine purchase \nof any meat in food bought for staff and clients, with \nexceptions only for special events and requests.\nWe have removed all plastic bottled water from our London \noffice and installed fresh still and sparkling water taps \ninstead, avoiding over 600 single use plastic bottles every \nmonth.\nLastly, we only buy 100% recycled paper for our office \nprinters.\n“\u0007Governance is central to the effective \ndelivery of our mission and strategy”"

The financial reporting framework that \nhas been applied in the preparation of the group financial \nstatements is applicable law and UK adopted International \nAccounting Standards. The financial reporting framework \nthat has been applied in preparation of the parent company \nfinancial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom \nAccounting Standards, including Financial Reporting \nStandard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable \nin the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom \nGenerally Accepted Accounting Practice).\nIn our opinion:\n•\t\n\u0007the financial statements give a true and fair view of the \nstate of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs \nas at 31 December 2022 and of the group’s profit for the \nyear then ended;\n•\t\n\u0007the group financial statements have been properly \nprepared in accordance with UK adopted International \nAccounting Standards;\n•\t\n\u0007the parent company financial statements have been \nproperly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom \nGenerally Accepted Accounting Practice; and \n•\t\n\u0007the financial statements have been prepared in \naccordance with the requirements of the Companies Act \n2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International \nStandards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable \nlaw. Our responsibilities under those standards are further \ndescribed in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit \nof the financial statements section of our report. We are \nindependent of the group and the parent company in \naccordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant \nto our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including \nthe FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, \nand we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities \nin accordance with these requirements. We believe that \nthe audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and \nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nAn overview of the scope of our audit\nOur audit approach was a risk-based approach founded \non a thorough understanding of the group’s business, its \nenvironment and risk profile. We conducted substantive \naudit procedures and evaluated the group’s internal control \nenvironment. We also addressed the risk of management \noverride of internal controls including assessing whether \nthere was evidence of bias by the directors that may \nhave represented a risk of material misstatement. The \ncomponents of the group were evaluated by the group audit \nteam based on a measure of materiality, considering each \ncomponent as a percentage of the group’s total assets, \ncurrent assets, revenue and gross profit, which allowed \nthe group audit team to assess the significance of each \ncomponent and determine the planned audit response.\nFor those components that were evaluated as significant \ncomponents, either a full scope or specified audit approach \nwas determined based on their relative materiality to the \ngroup and our assessment of the audit risk. For significant \ncomponents requiring a full scope approach, we evaluated \ncontrols by performing walkthroughs over the financial \nreporting systems identified as part of our risk assessment, \nreviewed the accounts production process and addressed \ncritical accounting matters. We then undertook substantive \ntesting on significant transactions and material account \nbalances.\nIn order to address the audit risks identified during our \nplanning procedures, we performed a full scope audit of \nthe financial statements of the parent company and of the \nfinancial information of Brave Bison Limited and Greenlight \nDigital Limited. We performed specified audit procedures \nover the other components in the UK, including Greenlight \nCommerce Limited, Best Response Media Limited and the \nSingapore and dormant entities.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional \njudgement, were of most significance in our audit of the \nfinancial statements of the current period and include the \nmost significant assessed risks of material misstatement \n(whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those \nwhich had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, \nthe allocation of resources in the audit; and directing \nthe efforts of the engagement team. These matters were \naddressed in the context of our audit of the financial \nstatements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, \nand we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters."

The \nprocess of determining the value in use, through \nforecasting cash flows related to each asset and \nthe determination of the appropriate discount rate \nand other assumptions to be applied, can be highly \njudgemental and can significantly impact the results \nof the impairment review.\nBased on the judgemental nature of an impairment \nreview and significant impairment adjustments in \nprior periods, we identified impairment of intangible \nassets as a significant risk.\nOur audit work included, but was not restricted to: \n•\t \u0007Critically assessing management’s assertion that       at the interim \nvaluation management had not been able to reliably estimate the fair \nvalue of acquired intangible assets in respect of the acquisition of \nGreenlight Digital Limited and Greenlight Commerce Limited in the year;\n•\t \u0007Obtaining management’s analysis of their    assessment of whether there \nwere any indicators of impairment.\n•\t \u0007Critically assessing the assumptions underpinning the valuation of online \nchannel content and customer relationship intangible assets.\n•\t \u0007Evaluating the accounting policy and detailed disclosures to check \nwhether information provided in the financial statements is compliant \nwith the requirements of IAS 36 and consistent with the results of the \nimpairment review.\n•\t \u0007We considered the appropriateness of the amortisation policy for all non-\ngoodwill intangible assets.\nKey observations\nBased on our audit work, we concluded that the group’s intangible assets \nincluding goodwill arising on the acquisition of Greenlight Digital limited \nand Greenlight Commerce Limited are not materially misstated as the year-\nend and that management’s impairment assessment and reassessment of \nuseful economic life is appropriate.\nWe consider that the disclosures in the financial statements relating to this \narea are adequate."

      "text": "31\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n BRAVE BISON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nOur application of materiality\nThe scope and focus of our audit was influenced by our \nassessment and application of materiality. We define \nmateriality as the magnitude of misstatement that could \nreasonably be expected to influence the readers and the \neconomic decisions of the users of the financial statements. \nWe use materiality to determine the scope of our audit and \nthe nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to \nevaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and \non the financial statements as a whole.\nDue to the nature of the Group we considered revenue to be \nthe main focus for the readers of the financial statements, \naccordingly this consideration influenced our judgement \nof materiality. Based on our professional judgement, we \ndetermined materiality for the Group to be £186,000, based \non a percentage of revenue. \nOn the basis of our risk assessment, together with our \nassessment of the overall control environment, our \njudgement was that performance materiality (i.e. our \ntolerance for misstatement in an individual account or \nbalance) for the Group was 50% of materiality, namely \n£93,000. \nWe agreed to report to the Audit Committee all audit \ndifferences in excess of £9,300, as well as differences \nbelow that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting \non qualitative grounds. We also reported to the Audit \nCommittee on disclosure matters that we identified \nwhen assessing the overall presentation of the financial \nstatements.\nThe materiality, performance materiality and trivial \nthreshold for the parent company are £148,500, £74,250 and \n£7,425 respectively.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded \nthat the use of the going concern basis of accounting in \nthe preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. \nOur evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the entity’s \nability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of \naccounting included a critical assessment of the detailed \ncash flow projections prepared by the directors, which are \nbased on their current expectations of trading prospects, \nand obtaining an understanding of all relevant uncertainties. \nWe have factored the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine \nconflict into our analysis of the risks affecting the ability of \nthe group to continue to trade and meet its liabilities as they \nfall due for at least twelve months from the date of approval \nof the financial statements.\nThe group achieved a positive cashflow in the year of £0.6m \nincluding the costs of the acquisition in the year. The cash \nflow projections to 30 June 2024 prepared by the directors \nindicate that the group will continue to achieve positive \ncash inflows throughout 2023 and into 2024. Furthermore, \nthe directors are confident that the group’s cash flow \nprojections and profit and loss forecasts are achievable, and \nthe directors are committed to taking any actions available \nto them to ensure that any shortfall in forecast revenues \nis mitigated by cost savings.  As stated above we have \ncritically assessed the projections and the assumptions \nunderlying them in conducting our work in this area.\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not \nidentified any material uncertainties relating to events \nor conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast \nsignificant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a \ngoing concern for a period of at least twelve months from \nwhen the financial statements are authorised for issue. \nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors \nwith respect to going concern are described in the relevant \nsections of this report.\nOther information\nThe directors are responsible for the other information. The \nother information comprises the information included in \nthe annual report, other than the financial statements and \nour auditor’s report thereon.  Our opinion on the financial \nstatements does not cover the other information and, except \nto the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do \nnot express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our \nresponsibility is to read the other information and, in doing \nso, consider whether the other information is materially \ninconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge \nobtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially \nmisstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies \nor apparent material misstatements, we are required to \ndetermine whether there is a material misstatement in the \nfinancial statements or a material misstatement of the other \ninformation. If, based on the work we have performed, we \nconclude that there is a material misstatement of this other \ninformation, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard."

The extent to which our procedures are capable of \ndetecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\nThe objectives of our audit in respect of fraud, are; to \nidentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of \nthe financial statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient \nappropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks \nof material misstatement due to fraud, through designing \nand implementing appropriate responses to those assessed \nrisks; and to respond appropriately to instances of fraud or \nsuspected fraud identified during the audit. However, the \nprimary responsibility for the prevention and detection of \nfraud rests with both management and those charged with \ngovernance of the group and the parent company.\nOur approach was as follows:\n•\t\n\u0007We obtained an understanding of the legal and \nregulatory requirements applicable to the group and \nthe parent company and considered that the most \nsignificant are the Companies Act 2006, UK adopted \nInternational Accounting Standards, UK financial \nreporting standards as issued by the Financial Reporting \nCouncil, and UK taxation legislation.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  \nOF BRAVE BISON GROUP PLC CONTINUED"

On 12 November 2013 the Company was \nadmitted to the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) where \nits ordinary shares are traded.\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group for \nthe year ended 31 December 2022 comprise the Company \nand its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). \nThe Group’s business activities, together with the factors \nlikely to affect its future development, performance and \nposition are set out in the CFO’s Review on pages 6-7, and \nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties on page 9. In addition, \nNote 26 to the financial statements includes the Group’s \nobjectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; \nits financial risk management objectives; details of its \nfinancial instruments and its exposure to credit risk and \nliquidity risk.\n2 Basis of preparation\n2.1. Going Concern\nThe consolidated financial statements have been \nprepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that \nthe Group will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall \ndue for the foreseeable future, and at least for 12 months \nfrom the date of approval of the consolidated financial \nstatements. The Group is dependent for its working capital \nrequirements on cash generated from operations, and cash \nholdings. The cash holdings of the Group at 31 December \n2022 were £6.5 million (2021: £5.9 million). The Group \nmade a profit before tax of £1.5 million for the year ended \n31 December 2022 (2021: £0.5 million), and generated \nan increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2022 of \n£0.6 million (2021: £3.2 million). The Group has net assets \nof £10.0 million (2021: £7.5 million).\nThe Directors have prepared detailed cash flow projections \nfor the period to 31 December 2023 and for the following \n6 month period to 30 June 2024 which are based on their \ncurrent expectations of trading prospects. The Group \nachieved positive cashflow of £1.1 million in H2 2022, and \nthe Board forecasts that the Group will continue to achieve \npositive cash inflows in 2023.\nThe Directors are confident that the Group’s cash flow \nprojections are achievable, and are committed to taking \nany actions available to them to ensure that any shortfall in \nforecast revenue receipts is mitigated by cost savings.\nThe Directors continue to maintain rolling forecasts which \nare regularly updated.\nThe Directors remain confident that the Group has \nsufficient cash resources for a period of at least twelve \nmonths from the date of approval of these consolidated \nfinancial statements and accordingly, the Directors have \nconcluded that it is appropriate to continue to adopt \nthe going concern basis in preparing these consolidated \nfinancial statements.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements consolidate the \nfinancial statements of Brave Bison Group plc and all its \nsubsidiary undertakings up to 31 December 2022, with \ncomparative information presented for the year ended \n31 December 2021. No profit and loss account is presented \nfor Brave Bison Group plc as permitted by section 408 of \nthe Companies Act 2006.\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has \nthe power to control the financial and operating policies \nand is exposed to or has rights over variable returns from \nits involvements with the investee and has the power to \naffect returns. Brave Bison Group plc obtains and exercises \ncontrol through more than half of the voting rights for all \nits subsidiaries. All subsidiaries have a reporting date of \n31 December and are consolidated from the acquisition \ndate, which is the date from which control passes to Brave \nBison Group plc.\nEntities other than subsidiaries or joint ventures, in which \nthe Group has a participating interest and over whose \noperating and financial policies the Group exercises \nsignificant influence, are treated as associates. The results \nof associate undertakings are consolidated under the \nequity method of accounting. The Group applies uniform \naccounting policies and all intra-group transactions, \nbalances, income and expenses are eliminated on \nconsolidation.\nUnrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group \ncompanies are eliminated. Where recognised losses on \nintra-group asset sales are reversed on consolidation, the \nunderlying asset is also tested for impairment from a Group \nperspective.\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the \nacquisition method. The acquisition method involves \nthe recognition at fair value of all identifiable assets and \nliabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, \nat the acquisition date, regardless of whether or not they \nwere recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary \nprior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets and \nliabilities of the subsidiary are included in the consolidated \nstatement of financial position at their fair values, which \nare also used as the basis for subsequent measurement in \naccordance with the Group accounting policies. Goodwill \nis stated after separating out identifiable intangible assets. \nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the \nfair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets \nof the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.\nProfit or loss and other comprehensive income of \nsubsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are \nrecognised from the effective date of acquisition, or up to \nthe effective date of disposal, as applicable."

Government grants\nGovernment grants are recognised at the fair value of the \nasset received or receivable when there is reasonable \nassurance that the grant conditions will be met and the \ngrants will be received.\nA grant that specifies performance conditions is recognised \nin income when the performance conditions are met. \nWhere a grant does not specify performance conditions it \nis recognised in income when the proceeds are received or \nreceivable.

On disposal of a foreign \noperation the cumulative translation differences (including, \nif applicable, gains and losses on related hedges) are \ntransferred to the income statement as part of the gain or \nloss on disposal.\n4.5. Segment reporting\nIFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments \nto be identified on the same basis as is used internally \nfor the review of performance and allocation of resources \nby the Group Chief Executive (chief operating decision \nmaker – CODM).\nThe Board has reviewed the Group and all revenues are \nfunctional activities of a digital media and marketing group, \nand these activities take place on an integrated basis. The \nsenior executive team review the financial information on \nan integrated basis for the Group as a whole, but view the \nbusiness as having 2 key pillars, being the Media Network \nand the Digital Advertising and Technology Services. The \nGroup will provide a split between these two pillars, as well \nas a split by geographical location. Segmental information \nis presented in accordance with IFRS 8 for all periods \npresented within Note 6.\n4.6. Leasing\nFor any new contracts entered into on or after 1 January \n2019, the Group considers whether a contract is, or \ncontains a lease. A lease is defined as ‘a contract, or part \nof a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the \nunderlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for \nconsideration’. To apply this definition the Group assesses \nwhether the contract meets three key evaluations which are \nwhether:\n•\t\n\u0007The contract contains an identified asset, which is \neither explicitly identified in the contract or implicitly \nspecified by being identified at the time the asset is \nmade available to the Group;\n•\t\n\u0007The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of \nthe economic benefits from use of the identified asset \nthroughout the period of use, considering its rights \nwithin the defined scope of the contract; and\n•\t\n\u0007The Group has the right to direct the use of the \nidentified asset throughout the period of use. The \nGroup assess whether it has the right to direct ‘how \nand for what purpose’ the asset is used throughout the \nperiod of use.\nAt lease commencement date, the Group recognises a \nright‑of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. \nThe right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which is made \nup of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any \ninitial direct costs incurred by the Group, an estimate of \nany costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of \nthe lease, and any lease payments made in advance of the \nlease commencement date (net of any incentives received).\nThe Group depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-\nline basis from the lease commencement date to the \nearlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset \nor the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses the \nright-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist.\nAt the commencement date, the Group measures the lease \nliability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid \nat that date, discounted using the interest rate implicit \nin the lease if that rate is readily available or the Group’s \nincremental borrowing rate.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the \nlease liability are made up of fixed payments (including \nin substance fixed), variable payments based on an index \nor rate, amounts expected to be payable under a residual \nvalue guarantee and payments arising from options \nreasonably certain to be exercised.\nSubsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be \nreduced for payments made and increased for interest. It is \nremeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification, \nor if there are changes in in-substance fixed payments."

      "text": "41\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n BRAVE BISON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding \nadjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset, or profit \nand loss if the right-of-use is already reduced to zero.\nThe Group has elected to account for short-term leases and \nleases of low-value assets using the practical expedients. \nInstead of recognising a right-of-use asset and lease \nliability, the payments in relation to these are recognised as \nan expense in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over \nthe lease term.\nOn the statement of financial position, right-of-use assets \nhave been included in property, plant and equipment and \nlease liabilities have been included in trade and other \npayables.\n4.7. Property, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical \ncost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. \nDepreciation is calculated to write down the cost less \nestimated residual value of all property, plant and \nequipment by equal annual instalments over their expected \nuseful lives less estimated residual values, using the \nstraight line method. The rates generally applicable are:\n•\t\n\u0007Fixtures & Fittings – 3 years or over remaining lease \nterm\n•\t\n\u0007Computer Equipment – 3 years\nThe gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an \nitem of property, plant and equipment is determined as \nthe difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying \namount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.\nThe assets’ residual value and useful lives are reviewed, \nand adjusted if required, at each balance sheet date. The \ncarrying amount of an asset is written down immediately \nto its recoverable amount if the carrying amount is greater \nthan its estimated recoverable amount.\nThe Group depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-\nline basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier \nof the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the \nend of the lease term. The Group also assesses the right-of-\nuse asset for impairment when such indicators exist.\n4.8. Impairment of property, plant and \nequipment\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying \namounts of its property, plant and equipment to determine \nwhether there is any indication that those assets have \nsuffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, \nthe recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order \nto determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). \nWhere it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount \nof an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable \namount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset \nbelongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less \ncosts of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in \nuse, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their \npresent value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects \ncurrent market assessments of the time value of money and \nthe risks specific to the asset.\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating \nunit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the \ncarrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is \nreduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is \nrecognised immediately in profit or loss.\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the \ncarrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) \nis increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable \namount, but so that the increased carrying amount does \nnot exceed the carrying amount that would have been \ndetermined had no impairment loss been recognised for the \nasset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an \nimpairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. \nIntangible assets\nAn intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary \nasset without physical substance, is recognised to \nthe extent that it is probable that the expected future \neconomic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the \nGroup and that its cost can be measured reliably. The asset \nis deemed to be identifiable when it is separable or when it \narises from contractual or other legal rights.\nIntangible assets acquired as part of a business \ncombination, are shown at fair value at the date of the \nacquisition less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is \ncharged on a straight line basis to profit or loss. The rates \napplicable, which represent the Directors’ best estimate of \nthe useful economic life, are:\n•\t\n\u0007Customer relationships – 5 to 10 years\n•\t\n\u0007Online channel content – 3 to 5 years\n•\t\n\u0007Brands – 3 years\n•\t\n\u0007Technology – 1 to 5 years\nGoodwill is not amortised but is instead reviewed for \nimpairment on an annual basis as outlined below.\n4.9. Impairment of intangible assets\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying \namounts of its intangible assets and goodwill to determine \nwhether there is any indication that those assets have \nsuffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, \nthe recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order \nto determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). \nWhere it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount \nof an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable \namount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset \nbelongs.\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs \nof disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the \nestimated future cash flows are discounted to their present \nvalue using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current \nmarket assessments of the time value of money and the \nrisks specific to the asset.\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be \nless than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the \nasset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment \nloss is recognised immediately in profit or loss."

Development costs\nExpenditure on the research phase of an internal project \nis recognised as an expense in the period in which it is \nincurred. Development costs incurred on specific projects \nare capitalised when all the following conditions are \nsatisfied:\n•\t\n\u0007Completion of the asset is technically feasible so that it \nwill be available for use or sale;\n•\t\n\u0007The Group intends to complete the asset and use or sell it;\n•\t\n\u0007The Group has the ability to use or sell the asset and \nthe asset will generate probable future economic \nbenefits (over and above cost);\n•\t\n\u0007There are adequate technical, financial and other \nresources to complete the development and to use or \nsell the asset; and\n•\t\n\u0007The expenditure attributable to the asset during its \ndevelopment can be measured reliably.\nDevelopment costs not meeting the criteria for \ncapitalisation are expensed as incurred. The cost of \nan internally generated asset comprises all directly \nattributable costs necessary to create, produce and \nprepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner \nintended by management. Directly attributable costs \ninclude employee (other than Director) costs incurred along \nwith third party costs.\nJudgement by the Directors is applied when deciding \nwhether the recognition requirements for development \ncosts have been met. Judgements are based on the \ninformation available at the time when costs are incurred. \nIn addition, all internal activities related to the research \nand development of new projects is continuously monitored \nby the Directors.\n4.11. Investments in associates and joint \nventures\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted \nfor using the equity method. The carrying amount of the \ninvestment in associates and joint ventures is increased \nor decreased to recognise the Group’s share of the profit \nor loss and other comprehensive income of the associate \nor joint venture, adjusted where necessary to ensure \nconsistency with the accounting policies of the Group.\n4.12. Taxation\nTax expenses recognised in profit or loss comprise the \nsum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax not \nrecognised in other comprehensive income or directly in \nequity.\nCurrent tax\nThe tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the \nyear. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the \nstatement of comprehensive income because it excludes \nitems of income or expense that are taxable or deductible \nin other years and it further excludes items that are never \ntaxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax \nis calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or \nsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is recognised on differences between the \ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial \nstatements and the corresponding tax bases used in \nthe computation of taxable profit, and are accounted \nfor using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are \ngenerally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, \nand deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all \ndeductible temporary differences to the extent that it is \nprobable that taxable profits will be available against which \nthose deductible temporary differences can be recognised. \nSuch assets and liabilities are not recognised if the \ntemporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial \nrecognition (other than in a business combination) of other \nassets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither \nthe taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax \nliabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences \nassociated with investments in subsidiaries except where \nthe Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary \ndifference and it is probable that the temporary difference \nwill not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax \nassets arising from deductible temporary differences \nassociated with such investments are only recognised to \nthe extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient \ntaxable profits against which to recognise the benefits of \nthe temporary differences and they are expected to reverse \nin the foreseeable future.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed \nat each reporting date and reduced to the extent that \nit is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits \nwill be available to allow all or part of the asset to be \nrecovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured \nat the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period \nin which the liability is settled or the asset recognised \nbased on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted \nor substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The \nmeasurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects \nthe tax consequences that would follow from the manner in \nwhich the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover \nor settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there \nis a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets \nagainst current tax liabilities and when they relate to \nincome taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the \nGroup intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities \non a net basis.\n4.13. Financial Instruments\nRecognition and derecognition\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised with \nthe Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of \nthe financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognised \nwhen the contractual rights to the cash flows from the \nfinancial asset expire, or when the financial asset and \nsubstantially all the risks and rewards are transferred. \nA financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, \ndischarged, cancelled or expires."

These are shortfalls in contractual cash flows, \nconsidering the potential for default at any point during \nthe life of the financial instrument. The Group uses its \nhistorical experience, external indicators and forward-\nlooking information to calculate expected credit losses.\nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables are initially measured at fair \nvalue, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, \nusing the effective interest method.\nContract assets and liabilities\nThe Group does not adjust the promised amount of \nconsideration for the effects of a significant financing \ncomponent if the entity expects, at contract inception, that \nthe period between when the entity transfers a promised \ngood or service to a customer and when the customer pays \nfor that good or service will be one year or less.\n4.14. Equity, reserves and dividend \npayments\nShare capital\nShare capital represents the nominal value of shares that \nhave been issued.\nShare premium\nShare premium includes any premiums received on issue \nof share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the \nissuing of shares are deducted from share premium arising \non those shares, net of any related income tax benefits.\nRetained deficits\nRetained deficits include all current and prior period \nretained profits or losses. It also includes credits arising \nfrom share based payment charges.\nTranslation reserve\nTranslation reserve represents the differences arising from \ntranslation of investments in overseas subsidiaries.\nMerger reserve\nThe merger reserve is created when group reconstruction \naccounting is applied. The difference between the cost \nof investment and the nominal value of the share capital \nacquired is recognised in a merger reserve.\nMerger relief reserve\nWhere the following conditions are met, any excess \nconsideration received over the nominal value of the shares \nissued is recognised in the merger relief reserve:\n•\t\n\u0007the consideration for shares in another company \nincludes issued shares; and\n•\t\n\u0007on completion of the transaction, the company issuing \nthe shares will have secured at least a 90% equity \nholding in the other company.\nCapital redemption reserve\nWhere the Company purchases its own equity share \ncapital, on cancellation, the nominal value of the shares \ncancelled is deducted from share capital and the amount is \ntransferred to the capital redemption reserve.\nDividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are \nincluded in ‘other liabilities’ when the dividends have been \napproved in a general meeting prior to the reporting date.\n4.15. Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits \nheld at call with banks, together with other short-term \nhighly liquid investments that are readily convertible into \nknown amounts of cash having maturities of 3 months or \nless from inception and which are subject to an insignificant \nrisk of change in value, and bank overdrafts.\n4.16. Employee benefits\nThe Group operates two schemes on behalf of its \nemployees, private healthcare and a defined contribution \npension plan and amounts due are expensed as they \nfall due.\n4.17. Share based payments\nEmployees (including Directors) of the Group received \nremuneration in the form of share-based payment \ntransactions, whereby employees render services \nin exchange for rights over shares (‘equity-settled \ntransactions’). The Group has applied the requirements \nof IFRS 2 Share-based payments to all grants of equity \ninstruments. The transactions have been treated as \nequity settled.\nThe cost of equity settled transactions with employees \nis measured by reference to the fair value at the grant \ndate of the equity instrument granted. The fair value is \ndetermined by using the Black-Scholes method. The cost \nof equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with \na corresponding charge to equity, over the period between \nthe date of grant and the end of a vesting period, where \nrelevant employees become fully entitled to the award. \nThe total value of the options has been pro-rated and \nallocated on a weighted average basis.\n4.18. Restructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs relate to corporate re-organisation \nactivities previously undertaken or announced, as detailed \nin note 8.\n4.19. Provisions\nThe Group has recognised a provision for the costs to \nrestore leased property to its original condition, as \nrequired by the terms and conditions of the lease. This \nis recognised when the obligation is incurred, either at \nthe commencement date or as a consequence of having \nused the underlying asset during a particular period of the \nlease, at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure \nthat would be required to restore the assets. Estimates \nare regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate for new \ncircumstances."

      "text": "44\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED\n5 Critical accounting \njudgements and key sources \nof estimation uncertainty\nThe preparation of financial statements under UK adopted \nInternational Accounting Standards requires the Group \nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the \napplication of policies and reported amounts. Estimates \nand judgements are continually evaluated and are based \non historical experience and other factors including \nexpectations of future events that are believed to be \nreasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may \ndiffer from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions \nwhich have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the \ncarrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed \nbelow.\n5.1. Critical accounting judgements\nIntangible assets and impairment\nThe Group recognises the intangible assets acquired as \npart of business combinations at fair value at the date \nof acquisition. The determination of these fair values \nis determined by experts engaged by management and \nbased upon management’s and the Directors’ judgement \nand includes assumptions on the timing and amount of \nfuture incremental cash flows generated by the assets and \nselection of an appropriate discount rate. Furthermore \nmanagement must estimate the expected useful lives of \nintangible assets and charge amortisation on these assets \naccordingly.\nTrade receivables’ recovery\nWithin trade debtors there is a balance of £0.7 million \n(2021: £0.7 million) which is over one year in age which the \nGroup has judged it not necessary to provide for. This is \nbecause it believes it is recoverable, since there is a trade \npayable balance of £0.8 million (2021: £0.8 million) with \nthe same company, and the Group is anticipating reaching \nagreement that these balances may be set off against each \nother.\nTreatment of revenue as agent or principal\nThe determination of whether the Group is acting as a \nprincipal or an agent in a transaction involves judgment and \nis based on an assessment of who controls a specified good \nor service before it is transferred to a customer. Significant \ncontracts are reviewed for the indicators of control. These \ninclude if the Group is primarily responsible for fulfilling \nthe promise to provide the good or service, if the Group \nhas inventory risk before the good or services has been \ntransferred to the customer and if the Group has discretion \nin establishing the price for the good or service.\nDeferred taxation\nDeferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax loss \ncarry forwards only to the extent that the realisation of \nthe related tax benefit through future taxable profits is \nprobable.\nGreenlight acquisition and purchase price allocation\nThe purchase price allocation of the Greenlight acquisition \nwas fully assessed in the year, within the one year IFRS \n3 measurement period from the date of acquisition, and \nacquired intangibles were identified and a full valuation \nexercise carried out in relation to the Greenlight trade name \nand the customer relationships. The purchase price has \nbeen reallocated accordingly.\nBest Response Media acquisition and purchase price \nallocation\nThe purchase price allocation of the Best Response Media \nacquisition was provisionally assessed, and the Group \njudged that at the interim valuation stage it was not able \nto reliably estimate the fair value of acquired intangibles \nand therefore the excess of consideration over fair value \nof other assets and liabilities has been allocated to \ngoodwill. A full valuation exercise will be completed within \nthe one year IFRS3 measurement period from the date \nof acquisition which may recognise additional intangible \nassets separately from goodwill.\n5.2. Estimates\nShare based payment charges\nThe Group is required to measure the fair value of its \nshare based payments. The fair value is determined using \nthe Black-Scholes method which requires assumptions \nregarding exchange rate volatility, the risk free rate, share \nprice volatility and the expected life of the share based \npayment. Exchange rate volatility is calculated using \nhistoric data over the past three years. The volatility of \nthe Group’s share price has been calculated as the average \nof similar listed companies over the preceding periods. \nThe risk-free rate range used is between 0% and 1.25% and \nmanagement, including the Directors, have estimated the \nexpected life of most share based payments to be 4 years.\nBad debt provision\nRecoverability of some receivables may be doubtful \nalthough not definitely irrecoverable. Where management \nfeel recoverability is in doubt an appropriate provision \nis made for the possibility that the amounts may not be \nrecovered in full. Provisions are made using past experience \nhowever subjectivity is involved when assessing the level of \nprovision required."

Value in use has been \ndetermined based on future cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future \noperating results, growth rates and anticipated future economic conditions.\nDuring the year, within the one year IFRS 3 measurement period from the date of acquisition, the Group carried out a full \nfair value adjustment exercise in relation to the acquisition of Greenlight Digital and Greenlight Commerce on 1 September \n2021.  As a result intangible assets have been identified in relation to the Greenlight trade name and the customer \nrelationships, and amounts allocated to goodwill at the interim valuation have been reallocated to these intangible assets. \nAn amount has also been reallocated to deferred tax liabilities resulting in an overall increase of intangible assets related \nto the Greenlight acquisition of £0.4 million.\nAs at 31 December 2022, the intangible assets were assessed for impairment. The Greenlight trade names were fully \nimpaired as they are no longer in use following a re-branding during the year. The impairment charge was £0.5million \n(2021: £nil). The customer relationships acquired as part of the Greenlight acquisitions are being amortised over 10 years.\nThe estimated cash flows for a period of 5 years were developed using internal forecasts, and a pre-tax discount rate of \n10%. The cash flows beyond 5 years have been extrapolated assuming nil growth rates. The key assumptions are based on \ngrowth of existing and new customers and forecasts, which are determined through a combination of management’s views, \nmarket estimates and forecasts and other sector information."

Their carrying value is assessed to be \n£5.0 million (2021: £3.7 million) after assessing recoverability. The contractual value and the carrying value of other \nreceivables are considered to be the same.

At each half year and year end, management will assess for further impairment based upon expected \ncredit loss over and above the specific impairments noted throughout the year. Within trade debtors there is a balance \nof £0.7 million which is over one year in age which the Group has judged it not necessary to provide for. This is because \nit believes it is recoverable, since there is a similar trade creditor balance with the same company, and the Group is \nanticipating reaching agreement that these balances may be set off against each other.\nThe other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets."

The consideration \nwas financed by existing cash balances. Best Response Media Limited is a specialist ecommerce and mobile development \ncompany focused exclusively on the Adobe Commerce Platform.\nThe provisional fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows:\nBook value\n£000’s\nFair value\nadjustments\n£000’s\nFair value\n£000’s\nGoodwill\n239\n-\n239\nTangible Assets\n1\n-\n1\nTrade and other receivables\n237\n-\n237\nCash and cash equivalents\n840\n-\n840\nCurrent Liabilities\n(143)\n-\n(143)\n1,174\n-\n1,174\nThe consideration for the acquisition was as follows:\n£000’s\nInitial cash consideration – paid\n962\nCompletion accounts adjustment – paid\n37\nDeferred cash consideration – paid \n175\n1,174\nThe consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income includes £0.1 million of acquisition costs in relation to Best \nResponse Media Limited.\nThe fair value of the financial assets includes trade and other receivables with a fair value of £0.2 million and a gross \ncontractual value of £0.3 million. The best estimate at acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not to be collected is \n£0.1 million. The goodwill represents the acquired accumulated workforce and the synergies expected from integrating Best \nResponse Media into the Group’s existing business. The Group has carried out an interim fair value adjustment exercise and \nwill be completing a full exercise within the one year measurement period from the date of the acquisition in accordance \nwith IFRS3. At the interim valuation stage the Group has not been able to reliably estimate the fair value of acquired \nintangibles and therefore the excess of consideration over fair value of other identifiable assets and liabilities has been \nallocated to goodwill. Once the full valuation exercise has been completed additional intangible assets may be recognised \nseparately from goodwill.\nBest Response Media Limited contributed £0.5 million revenue and £0.2 million loss to the Group’s profit for the period \nbetween the date of acquisition and the reporting date.\nIf the acquisition of Best Response Media Limited had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues \nfor the year would have been £32 million and Group profit would have been £1.9 million.\n30 Post balance sheet events\nOn the 3 February 2023 the Group announced the purchase of 100% of the issued share capital of Social Chain Limited. \nThe initial consideration for the acquisition consisted of a payment of £7.7m. This was partially funded by way of an \noversubscribed vendor placing to raise £4.75 million. Social Chain is one of the UK’s leading social media and influencer \nmarketing agencies. The completion balance sheet in relation to the acquisition is still being prepared, and therefore a \nbreakdown of the assets and liabilities acquired has not been disclosed."

      "text": "62\n31 Accounting Policies\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance \nwith applicable accounting standards including Financial \nReporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard \nApplicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) and \nthe Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have \nbeen prepared on a going concern basis under the historical \ncost convention, modified to include certain items at \nfair value. \nThe financial statements are prepared in sterling which \nis the functional currency of the Company. The figures \nare presented in thousands of pounds (£000’s) unless \notherwise stated. \nGoing concern\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going \nconcern basis, which assumes that the Group will be able \nto meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable \nfuture, and at least for 12 months from the date of \napproval of the consolidated financial statements. The \nGroup is dependent for its working capital requirements \non cash generated from operations, and cash holdings. \nThe cash holdings of the Group at 31 December 2022 \nwere £6.5 million (2021: £5.9 million). The Group made \na profit before tax of £1.5 million for the year ended 31 \nDecember 2022 (2021: £0.5 million), and generated an \nincrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2022 of £0.6 \nmillion (2021: £3.2 million). The Group has net assets of \n£10.0 million (2021: £7.5 million).\nThe Directors have prepared detailed cash flow projections \nfor the period to 31 December 2023 and for the following \n6 month period to 30 June 2024 which are based on \ntheir current expectations of trading prospects. The Group \nachieved positive cashflow of £1.1 million in H2 2022, and \nthe Board forecasts that the Group will continue to achieve \npositive cash inflows in 2023.\nThe Directors are confident that the Group’s cash flow \nprojections are achievable, and are committed to taking \nany actions available to them to ensure that any shortfall in \nforecast revenues receipts is mitigated by cost savings.\nThe Directors also continue to maintain rolling forecasts \nwhich are regularly updated. \nThe Directors remain confident that the Group has \nsufficient cash resources for a period of at least twelve \nmonths from the date of approval of these financial \nstatements and accordingly, the Directors have concluded \nthat it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going \nconcern basis in preparing these financial statements. \nDeferred taxation\nDeferred tax represents the future tax consequences \nof transactions and events recognised in the financial \nstatements of current and previous periods. It is recognised \nin respect of all timing differences, with certain exceptions. \nTiming differences are differences between taxable profits \nand total comprehensive income as stated in the financial \nstatements that arise from the inclusion of income and \nexpense in tax assessments in periods different from those \nin which they are recognised in the financial statements. \nUnrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are \nrecognised only to the extent that it is probable that \nthey will be recovered against the reversal of deferred \ntax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax \nis measured using the tax rates and laws that have been \nenacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet \ndate that are expected to apply to the reversal of timing \ndifferences. Deferred tax on revalued non-depreciable \ntangible fixed assets and investment properties is \nmeasured using the rates and allowances that apply to the \nsale of the asset.\nInvestments\nInvestments are recognised initially at fair value which is \nnormally the transaction price excluding transaction costs. \nSubsequently, they are measured at cost less impairment.\nDebtors\nDebtors are stated in the balance sheet at estimated net \nrealisable value.\nShare based payments\nEmployees (including Directors) of the Company received \nremuneration in the form of share-based payment \ntransactions, whereby employees render services in \nexchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled \ntransactions’).\nThe cost of equity settled transactions with employees \nis recovered by reference to the fair value at the grant \ndate of the equity instrument granted. The fair value is \ndetermined by using the Black-Scholes method. The cost of \nequity-settled transactions are recognised, together with a \ncorresponding credit to equity, over the period between the \ndate of grant and the end of vesting period, where relevant \nemployees become fully entitled to the award. The total \nvalue of the options has been pro-rated and allocated on a \nweighted average basis.\nNOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"

Any transaction costs associated with the issuing \nof shares are deducted from share premium, net of any related income tax benefits.\nProfit and loss account includes all current and prior period retained profits or losses. It also includes charges related to \nshare-based employee remuneration.\nMerger relief reserve – where the following conditions are met any excess consideration received over the nominal value of \nthe shares issued is recognised in the merger relief reserve:\n•\t\nthe consideration for shares in another company includes issued shares; and\n•\t\n\u0007on completion of the transaction, the company issuing the shares will have secured at least a 90% equity holding in the \nother company.\nWhere the Company purchases its own equity share capital, on cancellation the nominal value of the shares cancelled is \ndeducted from share capital and the amount is transferred to the capital redemption reserve.\nDividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in ‘other liabilities’ when the dividends have been \napproved in a general meeting prior to the reporting date.\nSignificant judgements and estimates \nThe Company is required to test, at least annually, whether investments have suffered any impairment. The recoverable \namount is determined based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash \nflows attributable to the acquired cash-generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the \npresent value of these cash flows. Actual outcomes could vary.\nWhere the Company has receivables from other Group entities, the recoverability of the receivables is assessed at the end \nof each accounting period. Where there is doubt in regards to the recoverability, the receivable is considered to be impaired \nand written down to its recoverable value. This assessment is made using past experience however subjectivity is involved \nwhen assessing the level of recoverability and impairment.\n32 Investments in subsidiaries and associates\nInvestments\n2022\n£000’s\n2021\n£000’s\nCost of investments brought forward\n17,635\n9,088\nInvestment in Greenlight \n-\n8,485\nAdditions from equity settled share-based payments\n387\n62\nCost of investment carried forward\n18,022\n17,635\nAs at 31 December 2022, investments were assessed for impairment. The board team have re-assessed projected cash \nflows. The estimated cash flows for a period of 5 years were developed using internal forecasts, and a pre-tax discount rate \nof 10%. The cash flows beyond 5 years have been extrapolated assuming nil growth rates. The key assumptions are based \non growth of existing and new customers and forecasts, which are determined through a combination of management’s \nviews, market estimates and forecasts and other sector information. A sensitivity analysis has also been performed on the \nprojected cash flows. This assessment did not result in an impairment charge for the year ended 31 December 2022."
