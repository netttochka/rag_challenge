We have faced many \nhurdles, yet emerged stronger, thanks \nin no small part to the purpose, passion \nand perseverance of our teammates from \ncoast to coast. \nOur efforts during this time of \nrevitalization to build a stronger culture \nand an engaged, winning team — true \nchampions of the community from coast \nto coast — has set us up to thrive in the \nyears to come. What we could not have \npredicted five years ago is just how much \nof a difference our dedicated teammates \nwould make in supporting Canadians \nthrough tough times in recent years, \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic, to floods \nin British Columbia and Atlantic Canada, \nto the wildfires in the West. Despite it all, \nEmpire was able to thrive and grow, and \nwe continued our transformation apace.\nA Truly Sustainable Business\nI have had the good fortune to work with \nEmpire for many years, long enough to \nremember when our company surpassed \n$1 billion in annual sales. It has been \na privilege to witness Empire reach \n$30 billion in fiscal 2022, another \nsignificant milestone in Empire’s \nsustainable growth story and one that \nour shareholders can be most proud of.\nSustainability at Empire extends far \nbeyond our company’s solid financial \nperformance. Our Board of Directors \nkeeps a strong environmental, social and \ngovernance (ESG) mandate top of mind \nat all times. We believe good governance \nincludes continually evaluating and \nelevating our ESG and sustainability goals. \nAs a top Canadian company with a proud \nhistory and robust culture, our goal is to \nlead the way as a good corporate citizen. \nAt Empire, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion \n(DE&I) is part of every conversation \nand consideration, including business \nstrategy. We want our teams to reflect the \ncustomers and communities we serve. Our \ndrive to embed DE&I into every facet of \nour organization aims to ensure a richly \ndiverse pool of teammates will thrive \nwithin our organization. \nAt Empire, we also recognize that every \ndecision we make, and every action we \ntake, has an impact on the environment. In \nrecent years, we have started the journey \nto address the impact of our operations \nand, as we move forward, you will see \nboth our efforts and our accomplishments \nonly accelerate. Subsequent to the \nend of fiscal 2022, Empire announced \nfurther commitments to meaningfully \nreduce our carbon footprint through our \ncomprehensive Climate Action Plan. We \nhave set science-based targets (SBTs) \nthat align with greenhouse gas reduction \ntargets outlined in the Paris Agreement \nand are working closely with our supplier \npartners to help them set their own \nscience-based targets. I encourage you \nto learn more about our efforts by viewing \nour Sustainable Business Report.\nEmpire has a long history of supporting \ncommunities and families. Over the last \nfive years, our transformation journey has \nallowed us to be an increasingly impactful \ncommunity champion, providing greater \nsupport to our community partners, \nto people in need, and to grassroots \norganizations across the country. Our \nlandmark Family of Support: Child \nand Youth Mental Health Initiative, for \nexample, launched in partnership with \nthe Sobey Foundation in 2020, has already \ncontributed more than $9 million to \n13 children’s hospital foundations \nacross Canada. \n2\nEMPIRE COMPANY LIMITED  2022 ANNUAL REPORT"

Our Empire \nRetail Impact Awards acknowledged 56 \ndeserving teammates who went above \nand beyond to serve customers and their \ncommunities over the past couple of \nchallenging years. With 130,000 devoted \nteammates across the country, we could \neasily have handed out thousands of \nawards. Empire is united by a strong \nculture that prizes community and rewards \ninnovation, and our best ideas come from \nour stores and our teammates. \nVisiting teammates across the country \nalso gave me the chance to see firsthand \nhow many of the exciting, transformative \nchanges our company has put in place \nover the past five years are coming to life \nin our stores, which remain the very heart \nof our business. \nIn only five years, we’ve made major \nstrides against all of our transformation \npriorities. As we enter the third year of \nProject Horizon, we can see its benefits \nextending throughout the Company. Our \nannouncement, subsequent to the end \nof fiscal 2022, of our co-ownership of the \nScene+ loyalty program and our plans to \ntransition to the Scene+ program, mark \nthe most recent step in our journey.\nFor Empire, Scene+ will allow us to thrill \nour customers and unlock the true power \nof personalization. It will deepen our \nrelationships with our customers and \nreward them for their loyalty across many \nof our businesses. There is a mountain of \nopportunity here to thrill our customers, \nbuild our strength in data and take our \nmarketing and merchandising to the \nnext level. \nIn parallel with our transformation, we \nhave also strengthened Environmental, \nSocial and Governance (ESG) measures \nat Empire. We have made tangible \nprogress in the area of Diversity, Equity \nand Inclusion (DE&I) by incorporating \nit into our financial outcomes and every \narea of our business. As Jim Dickson \nmentions in his letter, our commitment to \nESG initiatives has seen us recently table \na bold new Climate Action Plan that will \nwork toward a more sustainable future \nfor all of us and help tackle the existential \nthreat facing our planet. I look forward \nto providing you with ongoing updates of \nthese important initiatives in the months \nand years to come.\nCompany Performance and \nStrategic Initiatives\nOur grocery stores connect us with \ncommunities from coast to coast and \nwe continually refresh and refine the in-\nstore experience to meet the changing \nneeds of our customers.

The Company does not undertake to \nupdate any forward-looking statements that may be made by or on behalf of the Company other than as required by \napplicable securities laws.\nOverview of the Business\nEmpire’s key businesses and financial results are segmented into two reportable segments: (i) Food retailing; and \n(ii) Investments and other operations. With approximately $30.2 billion in annual sales and $16.6 billion in assets, \nEmpire and its subsidiaries, franchisees and affiliates employ approximately 130,000 people.\nFOOD RETAILING\nEmpire’s Food retailing segment is carried out through Sobeys, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Proudly Canadian, with \nheadquarters in Stellarton, Nova Scotia, Sobeys has been serving the food shopping needs of Canadians since 1907. \nSobeys owns, affiliates or franchises more than 1,600 stores in all 10 provinces under retail banners that include \nSobeys, Safeway, IGA, Foodland, FreshCo, Thrifty Foods, Farm Boy, Longo’s and Lawtons Drugs, operates grocery \ne-commerce under the banners Voilà, Grocery Gateway, IGA.net and ThriftyFoods.com, and operates more than \n350 retail fuel locations.\nCOMPANY STRATEGY\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company launched Project Horizon, a three-year strategy focused on core \nbusiness expansion and the acceleration of e-commerce. The Company remains on track to achieve an incremental \n$500 million in annualized EBITDA and an improvement in EBITDA margin of 100 basis points by fiscal 2023 by growing \nmarket share and building on cost and margin discipline. The Company expects to generate a compound average \ngrowth rate in earnings per share of at least 15% over Project Horizon’s three-year timeframe.\nIn fiscal 2021, Project Horizon benefits were achieved from the expansion and renovation of the Company’s store \nnetwork, the addition of new stores, improvement in store operations and merchandising from data analytics along \nwith continued efficiencies gained through strategic sourcing initiatives. \nIn fiscal 2022, earnings continued to be positively impacted by Project Horizon’s strategic initiatives, including \npromotional optimization and data analytics, the continued expansion and renovation of the store network, and \nstrategic sourcing efficiencies. Benefits in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022 were partially offset by the planned investment in \nthe Company’s e-commerce network.\nThese initiatives will continue to deliver benefits in fiscal 2023, and additional benefits are expected from strategic \ninitiatives launched more recently as part of Project Horizon, including the Company’s new loyalty program, Scene+, \nwhich will be rolled out gradually. Project Horizon initiatives focused on loyalty, store optimization and customer \nexperience will primarily benefit fiscal 2024 and beyond.\nGrowth in Market Share\nGrowth in market share is expected from supporting and investing further in the store network, improving store \nproductivity, scaling grocery e-commerce, growing the Own Brands portfolio, continuing the Western discount \nbusiness expansion, increasing the Farm Boy footprint in Ontario and the acquisition of Longo’s which occurred in the \nfirst quarter of fiscal 2022. \nInvest in the Company’s Store Network\nThe Company has accelerated investments in renovations and conversions, store processes, communications, training, \ntechnology and tools. These continuing investments, coupled with refreshed brand marketing strategies and the \nexpansion of the Farm Boy and FreshCo banners, are reflected in the Company’s capital spending over the Project \nHorizon timeframe. See the “Capital Expenditures” section of this MD&A for further details.\nImprove Store Productivity \nThe Company began building the foundation of its advanced analytics capabilities a few years ago. Analytics will \ncontinue to drive improvements in customer facing elements such as store footprints, customer promotions and \navailability of product on shelf. These new advanced analytics capabilities enable the Company to further improve the \ncustomer experience by optimizing category and product adjacencies to tailor its assortment for each store format.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n11"

      "text": "Win Canadian Grocery E-Commerce\nThe first CFC in Vaughan, Ontario has been operating for two years and the second CFC, located in Montreal, began \ndelivering to customers on March 7, 2022. The third and fourth CFCs located in Calgary and the Greater Vancouver \nArea (“Vancouver”), respectively, are in different stages of development. In September 2020, the Company introduced \nits store pick solution at select store locations and has expanded to 98 stores nationally in areas where CFCs will not \ndeliver or are not yet operating. The Company has an e-commerce option available for customers in every province.\nGrow the Company’s Own Brands Portfolio\nThe Company has improved its Own Brands positioning and branding. The Company reviews the specific role of Own \nBrands in each category and determines which categories and banners to expand based on consumer needs. Working \nclosely with its supplier partners, the Company plans to further grow sales and profitability of its Own Brands portfolio \nthrough increased distribution, shelf placement, product innovation and cost of goods sold reduction. \nProvide Best-in-Class Customer Personalization\nThe Company is investing in analytics and technology to better identify customer preferences and support direct, \npersonalized communication – evolving from mass communications to personalized connections with its customers. \nThe goal is to deploy world-class, personalized communications and offers to inspire customers and improve the \nexperience and relevance of promotions.\nThe Company has developed a next generation recommendation engine for one-to-one, machine learning powered \npersonalization at scale. This engine has been launched in select regions with positive early results, specifically \nimproved customer engagement and an increase in customer spending. The targeting algorithms will continue to \nimprove as the engine is rolled out across the country, driving progressively better performance and results. \nIn June 2022, the Company unveiled a new loyalty strategy through Scene+, one of Canada’s leading loyalty programs. \nAlong with Scotiabank and Cineplex, the Company is now a co-owner of Scene+. The rollout will begin in Atlantic \nCanada in August 2022 and continue across the country, culminating in late fiscal 2023 in most of the Company’s \nbanners and liquor stores. AIR MILES® collectors will continue to earn and redeem in the Company’s stores until the \nnew Scene+ program is available. \nBuilding on Cost and Margin Discipline\nThe Company has significantly improved its efficiency and cost competitiveness through Project Horizon. Further \nopportunity still remains to remove non value-added costs and optimize margins.\nDrive Non-Merchandising Sourcing Efficiencies\nThe strategic sourcing team continues to build additional efficiencies and cost reductions in indirect spend.\nContinue to Build Merchandising Sourcing Efficiencies\nThe Company continues to invest in advanced data analytics to support its category planning process. Merchants \nwork with both national and private brand suppliers to sustain gains made through category by category reviews, \nwhile continuing to partner with suppliers on new opportunities to ensure the Company brings the best value and offers \nto its customers.\nA national sourcing team was created at the end of fiscal 2021 to centralize sourcing responsibilities. This structure \nallows the Company to efficiently navigate inflationary pressure and supply chain disruptions, allowing merchants to \nfocus on delivering value to the Company’s customers.\nInvest in Best-in-Class Analytics to Improve Customer Value Proposition\nAdvanced analytics tools are helping the Company shift investments to the products customers care most about, with \nthe goal of improving value for customers.\nAdvanced analytics tools are being leveraged nationally by category merchants across all formats to improve the \nCompany’s effectiveness of promotions, while improving value for customers. The promotional optimization initiative – \na partnership between the advanced analytics team and category merchants – began to show benefits in margins \nduring fiscal 2021. Additional investments in data analytics and technology drove further improvements in fiscal 2022 \nand will continue to do so in fiscal 2023.\nOptimize Supply Chain Productivity\nThe Company continues to optimize its supply chain and logistics networks and consolidate certain procurement \nprocesses.\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company consolidated two distribution centres in Quebec into one facility and opened a new \ndistribution centre in British Columbia (“B.C.”) which consolidates three previous distribution centres into one facility. \nThese consolidations increased capacity and efficiency in the network.\nImprove System and Process \nBy leveraging technology to improve systems and process, the Company has further opportunities to generate \nefficiencies and cost reductions in its back office and support functions and improve its service to stores.\nEMPIRE COMPANY LIMITED  2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n12"

      "text": "BUSINESS UPDATES\nFarm Boy\nThe acquisition of Farm Boy on December 10, 2018 added 26 locations to the Company’s Ontario store network with \nplans to double the store count in five years from the acquisition date, mainly in the Greater Toronto Area (“GTA”). The \nCompany opened two locations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, for a total of eight new stores (including one \nconverted site) in the fiscal year. This is in line with management’s previously stated expectation of expanding Farm \nBoy’s footprint by seven net new stores during fiscal 2022. As at June 21, 2022, Farm Boy has 44 stores open.\nIn fiscal 2023, the Company expects to open four additional Farm Boy stores in Ontario.\nFreshCo\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company announced plans to expand its FreshCo discount format to Western Canada with \nexpectations of converting up to 25% of the 255 Safeway and Sobeys full-service format stores in Western Canada to \nthe FreshCo banner. \nThe Company opened three FreshCo locations in Alberta during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, for a total of 12 new \nstores opened in Western Canada in the fiscal year. This is in line with management’s expectations of opening 10 to 15 \nFreshCo stores in Western Canada during fiscal 2022. As at June 21, 2022: \n•\t 40 stores are open in the following provinces: \n\t» 16 in B.C.\n\t» 12 in Alberta\n\t» 6 in Manitoba\n\t» 5 in Saskatchewan\n\t» 1 in Northern Ontario\n•\t 4 stores are expected to open in Alberta in fiscal 2023\nThe Company expects to have 44 FreshCo stores open in Western Canada by the end of fiscal 2023.\nBusiness Acquisition\nOn March 16, 2021, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, signed an agreement to acquire 51% of Longo’s, \na long-standing, family-built network of specialty grocery stores in the GTA, and its Grocery Gateway e-commerce \nbusiness. The purchase price of the transaction was $660.6 million. The Company acquired the business through the \nissuance of 3,187,348 Non-Voting Class A shares with a transaction date price of $129.6 million, cash of $196.6 million \nand a contingent note payable of $10.7 million. The acquisition closed effective May 10, 2021.\nAfter the fifth anniversary of the transaction, the Longo’s 49% non-controlling shareholders have an option to sell up to \na 12.25% per annum interest in Longo’s to Sobeys, at a multiple applied to the last 12 months earnings before interest, \ntaxes, depreciation and amortization. The multiple will vary depending on achievement of certain business results. If \nLongo’s non-controlling shareholders exercise an option to sell, Sobeys will have a corresponding call option for the \nsame percentage in the following year. After the tenth anniversary of the transaction, both Sobeys and Longo’s have \nmutual put and call options for any remaining minority shares outstanding. A financial liability of $239.7 million was \nrecognized at the date of acquisition which is remeasured at the end of each quarter. \nStore Closure, Conversion and Lease Terminations\nIn the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 7, 2022, the Company reversed $9.1 million in accrued store closure \nand conversion costs primarily related to Farm Boy and FreshCo conversions (2021 – $1.1 million). As a result of these \nreversals, the net fiscal 2022 store closure and conversion expense was $8.8 million (2021 – $29.5 million).\nDuring the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 7, 2022, the Company engaged in lease termination transactions \nwhich resulted in other income of $23.6 million and $47.0 million, respectively (2021 – $ nil and $ nil).\nRatification of New Collective Bargaining Agreement in Alberta\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company announced the ratification of a new Collective Bargaining \nAgreement (“CBA”) for Alberta Safeway stores with UFCW 401, the Union representing the majority of Safeway \nteammates in Alberta. The CBA included a one-time retroactive lump sum payment to Safeway Alberta teammates for \nhours worked over the previous three years. The one-time retroactive lump sum payment of $15.6 million associated \nwith this CBA was charged to operating earnings in the second quarter of prior year.\nSustainable Business Reporting\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) has deep roots in the Company’s history, and the principles of ESG \nhave been a part of the organization since the Company started 115 years ago. The Company is focused on several \ninitiatives as part of a continuing ESG journey such as working to remove plastics from the business, focusing on \navoidable and hard-to-recycle plastics, expanding the Company’s efforts to cultivate a fair, equitable and inclusive \nenvironment for all, embedding sustainable business mandates within the Company’s performance management \ngoals, and completing an extensive assessment of the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions. The executive team \nreviewed a broad range of ESG issues that are important to stakeholders and long-term business success and that \ncreate shared value for the Company’s stakeholders, business and shareholders.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n13"

      "text": "The publication of the Company’s 2021 Sustainable Business Report in August 2021 marked the next step in the \nCompany’s sustainability journey. This was the first year the Company reported according to the Sustainable \nAccounting Standards Board (SASB) Food Retailers and Distributors Standard. This disclosure provides transparency \nand data on the Company’s progress in core ESG areas in the business and industry. The Company’s 2022 Sustainable \nBusiness Report will be released in July 2022. \nVoilà\nOn June 22, 2020, the Company introduced the future of online grocery home delivery to GTA customers through Voilà, \nthe Company’s e-commerce platform. Voilà is powered by industry-leading technology provided by Ocado, through \nits automated CFCs. Robots assemble orders efficiently and safely, resulting in minimal product handling, while Voilà \nteammates deliver orders directly to customers’ homes. In February 2022, Ocado announced a range of innovations, \nincluding next generation robots and grids, which offer efficiencies and a lighter environmental and carbon footprint. \nSome of these innovations will be included in the Company’s fourth CFC and will be available for the Company to \nconsider in future CFC automation and efficiency opportunities.\nThe Company will operate four CFCs across Canada. The Vaughan CFC services the GTA, Barrie, Kitchener, Waterloo, \nGuelph, Hamilton, Niagara, St. Catharines and Brantford, and was expanded to service Ottawa in the fourth quarter of \nfiscal 2022. \nThe second CFC in Montreal began deliveries to customers on March 7, 2022, beginning with a phased transition of \ncustomers to Voilà par IGA from IGA.net. The rollout was completed subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter \nand Voilà par IGA now services over 100 municipalities from Gatineau to Montreal to Quebec City. The second CFC \nis progressing well with increasing weekly order volume and strong customer experience metrics, including on-time \ndelivery and fulfilment.\nCrombie Real Estate Investment Trust (“Crombie REIT”) has substantially completed the construction of the building \nfor Voilà’s third CFC in Calgary and is preparing to turn it over to Ocado to build the internal grid. The CFC will service \nthe majority of Alberta, with deliveries expected to start in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. On February 7, 2022, the \nCompany announced that its fourth CFC will be located in Vancouver and will service customers in B.C. starting in 2025. \nIn March 2021, the Company opened its first spoke location in Etobicoke, Ontario. The second and third spokes were \nopened in Ottawa and Quebec City during fiscal 2022, adding to the areas in Ontario and Quebec being served by \nVoilà. Spokes are cross dock facilities that improve efficiencies at CFCs. \nIn fiscal 2021, the Company launched Voilà Curbside Pickup service at 30 store locations across Atlantic Canada \nand Alberta, and the service has since expanded to B.C., Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario. In fiscal 2022, the \nCompany added 68 stores for a total of 98 stores providing the service. The Curbside Pickup solution is powered by \nOcado’s technology and serves customers in areas where future CFCs will not, or are not yet, operating. \nWith four CFCs, their supporting spokes and Curbside Pickup, the Company will be able to serve approximately 75% of \nCanadian households representing approximately 90% of Canadians’ projected e-commerce spend.\nThe combination of improving results in Vaughan, increasing costs in Montreal, and additional Curbside Pickup \nlocations reduced the Company’s fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 net earnings by $0.07 and $0.28 per share, \nrespectively (2021 – $0.04 and $0.18). This was in line with management’s previously disclosed expectation of $0.25 to \n$0.30 per share. Management continues to expect that fiscal 2022 will represent the highest net earnings dilution for \nthe Voilà program. \nIn Canada, online grocery sales have continued to grow compared to the prior year, although at a much slower \npace than when COVID-19 began. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company’s four e-commerce platforms \nexperienced combined sales growth of 12% versus prior year (2021 – 15%). The increase was primarily driven by \nthe acquisition of Grocery Gateway and continued growth of Voilà, partially offset by declines in IGA.net and \nThriftyFoods.com due to elevated volume levels in the prior year during COVID-19 related lockdowns.\nOther Business Updates\nOn February 7, 2022, teammates at a distribution centre in Quebec went on strike after negotiations between the union \nand the Company were unsuccessful in agreeing on the terms of a new CBA. The strike ended on May 10, 2022, after \nan agreement was reached on a new three-year CBA. The incremental impact of the strike on earnings per share was \n$0.04 and impacted earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nOn May 3, 2022, the Company delivered a notice of early redemption of the $500.0 million Series 2013-2 Notes \n(“Notes”). The redemption was effective on June 2, 2022. The early redemption premium of $9.2 million was charged to \nearnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nEMPIRE COMPANY LIMITED  2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n14"

      "text": "INVESTMENTS AND OTHER OPERATIONS\nEmpire’s Investments and other operations segment, as of May 7, 2022, included:\n1.\tA 41.5% (41.5% fully diluted) equity accounted interest in Crombie REIT (TSX: CRR.UN), an Ontario registered, \nunincorporated, open-ended real estate investment trust. Crombie REIT is one of the country’s leading national retail \nproperty landlords with a strategy to own, operate and develop a portfolio of high-quality grocery and pharmacy-\nanchored shopping centres, freestanding stores and mixed-use developments primarily in Canada’s top urban and \nsuburban markets; and\n2.\tA 40.7% equity accounted interest in Genstar Development Partnership, a 48.6% equity accounted interest in \nGenstar Development Partnership II, a 39.0% equity accounted interest in GDC Investments 4, L.P., a 39.0% equity \naccounted interest in GDC Investments 6, L.P., a 39.0% equity accounted interest in GDC Investments 7, L.P., a \n37.1% equity accounted interest in GDC Investments 8, L.P., and a 49.0% equity accounted interest in The Fraipont \nPartnership (collectively referred to as “Genstar”). Genstar is a residential property developer with operations in \nselect markets in Ontario, Western Canada and the United States. \nOutlook\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the majority of COVID-19 restrictions by government agencies were lifted. The \nCompany and industry continues to be affected by COVID-19 as well as additional impacts such as higher than normal \ninflationary pressures and labour shortages. Given the unpredictability of COVID-19, the Company expects consumer \nbehaviour in fiscal 2023, related to the pandemic, to remain broadly consistent with those experienced through the \nsecond half of fiscal 2022. \nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the cost of maintaining safety and sanitization measures was approximately \n$6.0 million (2021 – $19.0 million) and are included in selling and administrative expenses. These costs have become a \nnormal part of operating the business and will no longer be separately disclosed.\nThe industry continues to experience cost inflationary pressures, particularly related to cost of goods sold, including \nfuel. Although it is difficult to estimate how long these pressures will last, the Company is focused on supplier \nrelationships and negotiations to ensure competitive pricing for consumers.\nThe industry continues to experience supply chain challenges primarily related to labour shortages. Although it is \ndifficult to estimate the duration of these challenges, management, where necessary remains focused on utilizing \nalternative sourcing options and does not expect significant adverse impacts to its supply chain.\nThe Company expects same-store sales will grow in fiscal 2023. Margins will continue to benefit from Project Horizon \ninitiatives and other operating improvements. These benefits could be partially offset by the effect of sales mix \nchanges between banners and the impact of increasing fuel sales.\nThe Company expects continued improvements in the results of Voilà’s Vaughan based e-commerce site as volumes \nincrease and efficiencies improve. At the same time, Voilà will also incur additional costs as the Montreal facility \ncontinues to ramp up operations and the Calgary and Vancouver facilities are commissioned. Future earnings will be \nprimarily impacted by the rate of sales growth. The Company expects fiscal 2023 net earnings dilution for the Voilà \nprogram to marginally improve over fiscal 2022 as the Vaughan CFC is expected to reflect positive EBITDA towards the \nend of its third year of operations. The ramp up of the Montreal facility is expected to have higher costs in the first half \nof fiscal 2023 with improving results in the remainder of the year.\nThe Company continued the expansion of its discount business in Western Canada with 40 stores now operating. In the \nsecond half of fiscal 2022, discount expanded their store footprint in the West by 40%. Newer stores improve efficiency \nat a faster rate than the early conversion stores as the business gains critical mass across each province. The Company \nexpects to open an additional four stores in Alberta by the end of fiscal 2023 for a total of 44 stores.\nManagement continues to expect to achieve its three-year Project Horizon targets and that associated benefits will \ncontinue into fiscal 2024 and beyond, including initiatives launching in fiscal 2023 that are focused on loyalty, store \noptimization and customer experience.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n15"

      "text": "Accounting Standards and Policies \nStandards, Amendments and Interpretations Issued but not yet Adopted\nIn May 2021, the IASB issued amendments to International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 12, “Income Taxes”. The \namendments require deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for transactions that result in both deductible \nand taxable temporary differences of the same amount at initial recognition. These amendments are effective for \nannual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is \nassessing the potential impact of these targeted amendments.\nIn May 2020, the IASB issued a package of narrow-scope amendments to three standards (IFRS 3, “Business \nCombinations”; IAS 16, “Property, Plant and Equipment”; and IAS 37, “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent \nAssets”) as well as the IASB’s Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018 – 2020. These amendments to existing \nIFRS standards are to clarify guidance and wording, or to correct for relatively minor unintended consequences, \nconflicts or oversights. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. \nThe amendments will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nIn January 2020, the IASB issued Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1, \n“Presentation of Financial Statements”). The narrow-scope amendment affects only the presentation of liabilities in the \nstatement of financial position and not the amount or timing of recognition. Specifically, it clarifies: \n•\t the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should be based on rights that are in existence at the end of \nthe reporting period and align the wording in all affected paragraphs to refer to the “right” to defer settlement by \nat least 12 months and make explicit that only rights in place “at the end of the reporting period” should affect the \nclassification of a liability; \n•\t classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of \na liability; and \n•\t that “settlement” refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services. \nThese amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption \npermitted. The Company is assessing the potential impact of this narrow-scope amendment.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles \n(“GAAP”), requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported \nin the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Certain of these estimates require subjective or \ncomplex judgments by management that may be uncertain. Some of these items include the valuation of inventories, \ngoodwill, employee future benefits, stock-based compensation, estimates of provisions, impairments, customer loyalty \nprograms, useful lives of property, equipment, investment property and intangibles for purposes of depreciation and \namortization, and income taxes. Changes to these estimates could materially impact the financial statements. These \nestimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake \nin the future. Management regularly evaluates the estimates and assumptions it uses. Actual results could differ from \nthese estimates.\nLeases\nEstimates and judgments are used in the measurement of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, with key assumptions \nrelated to the determination of discount rates and lease term expectations. \nNon-Controlling Interest Put and Call Options\nThe Company has applied estimates and judgment to the non-controlling interest put and call options the Company \nentered into as part of business acquisitions. The calculation is an earnings multiple that has various components \nincluding estimates of cash flows and discount rates.\nValuation of Inventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value. Significant estimation or judgment are \nrequired in the determination of (i) estimated inventory provisions associated with vendor allowances and internal \ncharges; (ii) estimated inventory provisions due to spoilage and shrinkage occurring between the last physical \ninventory count and the balance sheet dates; and (iii) inventories valued at retail and adjusted to cost. Changes or \ndifferences in any of these estimates may result in changes to inventories on the consolidated balance sheets and a \ncharge or credit to operating income in the consolidated statements of earnings. \nImpairments of Non-Financial Assets\nManagement assesses impairment of non-financial assets such as investments in associates and joint ventures, \ngoodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, right-of-use assets and investment property. In assessing \nimpairment, management estimates the recoverable amount of each asset or cash generating unit (“CGU”) based \non expected future cash flows. When measuring expected future cash flows, management makes assumptions \nabout future growth of profits which relate to future events and circumstances. Actual results could vary from these \nestimated future cash flows. Estimation uncertainty relates to assumptions about future operating results and the \napplication of an appropriate discount rate. \nEMPIRE COMPANY LIMITED  2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n28"

      "text": "Goodwill is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis. The Company performed its annual assessment of \ngoodwill impairment during its third quarter. However, if indicators of impairment are present, the Company will review \ngoodwill for impairment when such indicators arise. In addition, at each reporting period, the Company reviews \nwhether there are indicators that the recoverable amount of long-lived assets may be less than their carrying amount. \nGoodwill and long-lived assets were reviewed for impairment by determining the recoverable amount of each CGU \nor groups of CGUs to which the goodwill or long-lived assets relate. Management estimated the recoverable amount \nof the CGUs based on the higher of value-in-use (“VIU”) and fair value less costs of disposal. The VIU calculations \nare based on expected future cash flows. When measuring expected future cash flows, management makes key \nassumptions about future growth of profits which relate to future events and circumstances. Estimation uncertainty \nrelates to assumptions about future operating results and the application of an appropriate discount rate. Actual \nresults could vary from these estimates which may cause significant adjustments to the Company’s goodwill or long-\nlived assets in subsequent reporting periods.\nPension Benefit Plans and Other Benefit Plans\nThe cost of the Company’s pension benefits for defined contribution plans are expensed at the time active employees \nare compensated. The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other benefit plans is accrued based on actuarial \nvaluations, which are determined using the projected unit credit method pro-rated on service and management’s best \nestimate of salary escalation, retirement ages, and expected growth rate of health care costs. \nCurrent market values are used to value benefit plan assets. The obligation related to employee future benefits is \nmeasured using current market interest rates, assuming a portfolio of Corporate AA bonds with terms to maturity that, \non average, match the terms of the obligation.\nTo the extent that plan amendments increase the obligation related to past service, the Company will recognize a past \nservice cost immediately as an expense.\nIn measuring its defined benefit liability, the Company will recognize all of its actuarial gains and losses immediately \ninto other comprehensive income. The key assumptions are disclosed in Note 18 of the Company’s audited \nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended May 7, 2022.\nIncome Taxes \nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to \ntemporary differences between the financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective \nincome tax bases. Deferred income tax assets or liabilities are measured using enacted or substantively enacted \nincome tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected \nto be recovered or settled. The calculation of current and deferred income taxes requires management to make \nestimates and assumptions and to exercise a certain amount of judgment. The financial statement carrying values of \nassets and liabilities are subject to accounting estimates inherent in those balances. The income tax bases of assets \nand liabilities are based upon the interpretation of income tax legislation across various jurisdictions. The current \nand deferred income tax assets and liabilities are also impacted by expectations about future operating results and \nthe timing of reversal of temporary differences as well as possible audits of tax filings by the regulatory authorities. \nManagement believes it has adequately provided for income taxes based on current available information.\nChanges or differences in these estimates or assumptions may result in changes to the current or deferred income tax \nbalances on the consolidated balance sheets.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nFor business acquisitions, the Company applies judgment on the recognition and measurement of assets and \nliabilities assumed and estimates are utilized to calculate and measure such adjustments. In measuring the fair value \nof an acquiree’s assets and liabilities, management uses estimates about future cash flows and discount rates. Any \nmeasurement changes after initial recognition would affect the measurement of goodwill, except for deferred taxes. \nProvisions \nProvisions are recognized when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for \nwhich it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and where a reliable \nestimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that \nreflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability, if material. \nVendor Allowances\nThe Company has supply agreements with varying terms for purchase of goods for resale, some of which include \nvolume related allowances, purchase discounts, listing fees and other discounts and allowances. Estimates and \njudgment are required when the receipt of allowances is conditional on the Company achieving specified performance \nconditions associated with the purchase of product and determining if these have been met. These include estimates \nof achieving agreed volume targets based on historical and forecast performance.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n29"

The CEO and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s DC&P and, \nbased on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s DC&P was effective as at May 7, 2022 \nand that there were no material weaknesses relating to the design or operation of the DC&P.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting \nManagement of the Company, which includes the CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining \nInternal Control over Financial Reporting (“ICFR”), as that term is defined in National Instrument 52-109, “Certification \nof Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings”. The control framework management used to design and assess \nthe effectiveness of ICFR is “Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)” published by the Committee of Sponsoring \nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. The CEO and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s \nICFR and, based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s ICFR was effective as at \nMay 7, 2022 and that there were no material weaknesses relating to the design or operation of the ICFR.\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s ICFR during the period beginning January 30, 2022 and ended May 7, \n2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s ICFR.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Company enters into related party transactions with Crombie REIT and key management personnel, including \nongoing leases and property management agreements. As at May 7, 2022, the Company holds a 41.5% (2021 – 41.5%) \nownership interest in Crombie REIT and accounts for its investment using the equity method. All transactions unless \notherwise noted are recorded on a fair value basis.\nCrombie REIT has instituted a distribution re-investment plan (“DRIP”) whereby Canadian resident REIT unitholders \nmay elect to automatically have their distributions reinvested in additional REIT units. The Company has enrolled in the \nDRIP to maintain its economic and voting interest in Crombie REIT. \nThe Company leased certain real property from Crombie REIT during the year at amounts which in management’s \nopinion approximate fair market value that would be incurred if leased from a third party. Management has \ndetermined these amounts to be fair value based on the significant number of leases negotiated with third parties in \neach market it operates. The aggregate net payments under these leases totalled approximately $213.5 million (2021 – \n$209.1 million).\nCrombie REIT provides administrative and property management services to the Company on a fee for service basis \npursuant to a Management Agreement.\nSobeys, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, engages in property sales and sale leaseback transactions with Crombie \nREIT, based on fair market values.

The \nCompany’s management does not consider the exposure to such litigation to be material.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to ongoing audits by tax authorities. While the Company \nbelieves that its tax filing positions are appropriate and supportable, from time to time certain matters are reviewed \nand challenged by the tax authorities.\nRisk Management \nThrough its operating companies and its equity-accounted investments, Empire is exposed to a number of risks in \nthe normal course of business that have the potential to affect operating performance. In order to achieve and \nsustain superior business performance an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program has been established within \nthe Company. \nAs part of the ERM process, the Company identifies, assesses, manages and reports on key risks to the organization \nand its objectives. Risks are ranked and executive ownership is established in each case. In addition, processes \nhave been put in place to facilitate effective oversight by establishing risk appetite statements, key risk indicators, \ntreatment action plans and dashboards for key risks identified. Key risks have been, and continue to be, embedded in \nthe business and strategy discussions at the Board and/or Committee meetings. Annually, the senior leadership of the \nCompany conducts a regular assessment of the Company’s effectiveness in managing existing/known risks along with \nan identification and discussion of new and emerging risks.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Company has an established task force with a mandate to monitor, assess and recommend mitigation strategies \nfor impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force implemented a governance structure and protocols at the onset \nof the pandemic, which has been maintained throughout fiscal 2022 to ensure the business continues to operate within \nthe guidelines set forth by local, provincial and/or federal governments. Management’s top priority continues to be the \nhealth and well-being of teammates, customers, and community health by preventing outbreaks in stores, warehouses \nand offices. Additional strategic risks, including labour availability due to pandemic absenteeism, as well as continuity \nof supply of goods for resale and pandemic supplies, such as personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies, \nhave been mitigated to allow for continuous operation of the business. The Company continues to monitor these \nevolving risks. As the pandemic continues to evolve, there is still uncertainty related to the long-term impacts on the \nprice of commodities and inflation of retail prices.\nCompetition\nEmpire’s Food retailing business, Sobeys, operates in a dynamic and competitive market. Other national and regional \nfood distribution companies, along with non-traditional competitors, such as mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, \nand online retailers, represent a competitive risk to Sobeys’ ability to attract customers and operate profitably in \nits markets.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n31"

      "text": "Sobeys maintains a strong national presence in the Canadian retail food and food distribution industry, operating \nin over 900 communities in Canada. A significant risk to Sobeys is the potential for reduced revenues and profit \nmargins as a result of increased competition. A failure to maintain geographic diversification to reduce the effects \nof localized competition could have an adverse impact on Sobeys’ operating margins and results of operations. To \nsuccessfully compete, Sobeys believes it must be customer and market-driven, be focused on superior execution and \nhave efficient, cost-effective operations. It also believes it must invest in its existing store and e-commerce network \nas well as its merchandising, marketing and operational execution to evolve its strategic platform to better meet \nthe needs of consumers looking for food options. The Company updates branding strategies to remain relevant to \ncustomers. Failure to implement a marketing and branding strategy, including evaluating the strategic objectives \nand having people, processes and systems in place to execute the strategy, could adversely affect the Company. The \nconsolidation of industry competitors may also lead to increased competition and loss of market share. The Company \nfurther believes it must invest in merchandising initiatives to better forecast and respond to changing consumer trends. \nAny failure to successfully execute in these areas could have a material adverse impact on Sobeys’ financial results.\nEmpire’s real estate operations, through its investment in Crombie REIT, compete with numerous other managers \nand owners of real estate properties in seeking tenants and new properties to acquire. The existence of competing \nmanagers and owners could affect their ability to: (i) acquire property in compliance with their investment criteria; \n(ii) lease space in their properties; and (iii) maximize rents charged and minimize concessions granted. Commercial \nproperty revenue is also dependent on the renewal of lease arrangements by key tenants. These factors could \nadversely affect the Company’s financial results and cash flows. A failure by Crombie REIT to maintain strategic \nrelationships with developers to ensure an adequate supply of prospective attractive properties or to maintain \nstrategic relationships with existing and potential tenants to help achieve high occupancy levels at each of its \nproperties could adversely affect the Company.\nInformation Management, Cyber Security and Data Protection\nThe integrity, reliability and security of information in all its forms is critical to the Company’s daily and strategic \noperations. Inaccurate, incomplete or unavailable information, external intrusions on information systems or \ninappropriate access to information could lead to incorrect financial and/or operational reporting, poor decisions, \nprivacy breaches or inappropriate disclosure, leaks of sensitive information or system disruptions. Gathering and \nanalyzing information regarding customers’ purchasing preferences is an important part of the Company’s strategy to \nattract and retain customers and effectively compete. In addition, sensitive personal health information is collected in \norder to provide pharmacy and home health care services to customers. Any failure to maintain privacy of customer \ninformation or to comply with applicable privacy laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, \ncompetitive position and results of operations.\nThe Company recognizes that information is a critical enterprise asset. Currently, the information management risk \nis managed through a multi layered security approach involving cyber software tools based controls, policies, \nstandards and procedures pertaining to security access, system development, change management and problem \nand incident management.\nTechnology\nThe Company operates extensive and complex information technology systems that are vital to the successful \noperation of its business and marketing strategies. Any interruption to these systems or the information collected by \nthem would have a significant adverse impact on the Company, its operations and its financial results. The Company is \ncommitted to improving its operating systems, tools and procedures in order to become more efficient and effective. \nThe implementation of major information technology projects carries with it various risks, including the risk of \nrealization of functionality.\nProduct Safety and Security\nSobeys is subject to potential liabilities connected with its business operations, including potential liabilities and \nexpenses associated with product defects, food safety and product handling, and provision of pharmacy products and \nrelated services. Such liabilities may arise in relation to the storage, distribution, display and dispensing of products \nand, with respect to Sobeys’ private label products, in relation to the production, packaging and design of products.\nA large majority of Sobeys’ sales are generated from food and pharmaceutical products and Sobeys could be \nvulnerable in the event of a significant outbreak of food-borne illness or increased public health concerns in connection \nwith certain food or pharmaceutical products. Such an event could materially affect Sobeys’ financial performance. \nProcedures are in place to manage food and pharmaceutical crises, should they occur. These procedures are intended \nto identify risks, provide clear communication to teammates and consumers and ensure that potentially harmful \nproducts are removed from sale immediately.\nSobeys has food safety procedures and programs which address safe food handling and preparation standards. \nSimilarly, provincial pharmacy standards and regulations are strictly followed, supported by robust internal policies \nand procedures to help mitigate risk along with a comprehensive reporting and follow up system is in place to \nquickly manage and contain any incidents. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent the \noccurrence of any such product contamination or safety incident.\nEMPIRE COMPANY LIMITED  2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n32"

      "text": "Supply Chain Disruptions Including Impacts of Climate Change\nThe Company is exposed to potential supply chain disruptions and errors that could result in obsolete merchandise or \nan excess or shortage of merchandise in its retail store network. The Company’s distribution and supply chain could \nbe negatively impacted by over reliance on key vendors, consolidation of facilities, disruptions due to severe weather \nconditions, natural disasters, climate change driven disruptions or other catastrophic events, failure to manage costs \nand inventories, and geopolitical disruptions. A failure to develop competitive new products, deliver high-quality \nproducts and implement and maintain effective supplier selection and procurement practices could adversely affect \nSobeys’ ability to deliver desired products to customers and adversely affect the Company’s ability to attract and \nretain customers, decreasing competitive advantage. A failure to maintain an efficient supply and logistics chain may \nadversely affect Sobeys’ ability to sustain and meet growth objectives and maintain margins.\nEnvironmental\nThe Company operates its business locations across the country, including retail stores, distribution centres and fuel \nsites, and is subject to environmental risks associated with the contamination of such properties and facilities. Sobeys’ \nretail fuel locations operate underground storage tanks. Environmental contamination resulting from leaks or damages \nto these tanks is possible. To mitigate this environmental risk, Sobeys engages in several monitoring procedures, as well \nas risk assessment activities, to minimize potential environmental hazards. The Company also operates refrigeration \nequipment in its stores and distribution centres. These systems contain refrigerant gases which could be released if \nequipment fails or leaks.\nWhen environmental issues are identified, any required environmental site remediation is completed using appropriate, \nqualified internal and external resources. The Company may be required to absorb all costs associated with such \nremediation, which may be substantial. Failure to properly manage any of these environmental risks could adversely \naffect the reputation, operations or financial performance of the Company. \nThe Company is subject to legislation that imposes liabilities on retailers for costs associated with recycling and \ndisposal of consumer goods packaging and printed materials distributed to consumers. There is a risk that the \nCompany will be subject to increased costs associated with these laws.\nBusiness Continuity\nThe Company may be subject to unexpected or critical events and natural hazards, including severe weather events, \ninterruption of utilities and infrastructure or occurrence of pandemics, which could cause sudden or complete cessation \nof its day-to-day operations. The Company has worked to develop an integrated Business Continuity Management \nframework, including a comprehensive crisis plan. The Company is monitoring the evolution of COVID-19 along \nwith other pandemics that could occur. However, no such plan can eliminate the risks associated with events of this \nmagnitude. Any failure to respond effectively or appropriately to such events could adversely affect the Company’s \noperations, reputation and financial results.\nTalent, Attraction and Retention\nEffective leadership is important to the growth and continued success of the Company. The Company develops and \ndelivers training programs at all levels across its various operating regions to improve teammate knowledge and to \nbetter serve its customers. The inability of the Company to properly attract, build talent and retain its teammates with \nthe appropriate skill set and failure to manage and monitor teammates’ performance may affect teammate morale, \noverall reputation and the Company’s future performance.\nThere is always a risk associated with the loss of key personnel. Succession plans have been identified for key roles \nincluding the depth of management talent throughout the Company and its subsidiaries; these plans are overseen by \nthe Human Resources Committee and reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors.\nFranchisee and Affiliates Relationships\nThe success of Empire is closely tied to the performance of Sobeys’ network of retail stores. Franchisees and affiliates \noperate approximately 51% of Sobeys’ retail stores. Sobeys relies on its franchisees, affiliates and corporate store \nmanagement to successfully execute retail strategies and programs.\nTo maintain controls over Sobeys’ brands and the quality and range of products and services offered at its stores, \nfranchisees and affiliates agree to purchase merchandise from Sobeys. In addition, each store agrees to comply with \nthe policies, marketing plans and operating standards prescribed by Sobeys. These obligations are specified under \nfranchise and operating agreements which expire at various times for individual franchisees and affiliates. Despite \nthese franchise and operating agreements, Sobeys may have limited ability to control a franchisees’ and affiliates’ \nbusiness operations. A breach of these franchise and operating agreements or operational failures by a significant \nnumber of franchisees and affiliates may adversely affect Sobeys’ reputation and financial performance.\nLabour Union Relationships\nA significant percentage of the Company’s store and distribution centre workforce, particularly in Western Canada, is \nunionized. While overall the Company has and works to maintain good relationships with its teammates and unions, \nthe renegotiation of collective agreements always presents the risk of labour disruption. The Company has consistently \nstated it will accept the short-term costs of labour disruption to support a commitment to building and sustaining a \ncompetitive cost structure for the long term. Any prolonged or widespread work stoppages or other labour disputes \ncould have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial results.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n33"

      "text": "Economic Environment\nManagement continues to closely monitor economic conditions, including foreign exchange rates, interest rates, \ninflation, employment rates and capital markets. Uncertainty in the economic environment could adversely impact \ndemand for the Company’s products and services which in turn could adversely affect financial performance. \nManagement believes that although a volatile economy has an impact on all businesses and industries, the Company \nhas an operational and capital structure that is sufficient to meet its ongoing business requirements.\nProduct Costs\nSobeys is a significant purchaser of food product which is at risk of cost inflation given rising commodity prices and \nother costs of production to food manufacturers. Should rising costs of product materialize in excess of the Company’s \nexpectations and should the Company not be able to offset such cost inflation through higher retail prices or other cost \nsavings, there could be a negative impact on sales and margin performance.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation\nThe Company’s long-term debt objective is to maintain the majority of its debt at fixed interest rates. Any increase in \nthe applicable interest rates could increase interest expense and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s \ncash flow and results of operations. The Company monitors the respective mix of fixed and variable interest rates to \nmaintain an appropriate level considering economic conditions. There can be no assurance that risk management \nstrategies, if any, undertaken by the Company will be effective.\nUtility and Fuel Prices\nThe Company is a significant consumer of electricity, other utilities and fuel. The costs of these items have been subject \nto significant volatility. Unanticipated cost increases in these items could negatively affect the Company’s financial \nperformance. A failure to maintain effective consumption and procurement programs could adversely affect the \nCompany’s financial results. In addition, Sobeys operates a large number of fuel stations. Significant increases in \nwholesale prices or availability could adversely affect operations and financial results of the fuel retailing business.\nDrug Regulation, Legislation and Health Care Reform\nThe Company currently operates more than 400 in-store and freestanding pharmacies which are subject to federal, \nprovincial, territorial and local legislation as well as regulations governing the sale of prescription drugs. Changes \nto reimbursement models used to fund prescription drugs, including the potential implementation of a national \npharmacare model, or failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a negative impact on financial \nperformance, operations and reputation.\nThese laws and regulations typically regulate prescription drug coverage for public plans including patient and product \neligibility as well as elements of drug pricing and reimbursements including product cost, markup, dispensing fee, \ndistribution allowances and in some provinces the ability to negotiate manufacturer allowances. In some provinces, \nlegislation requires the selling price for prescription drugs to third-party insurance plans and cash customers to not be \nhigher than the price established for the provincial drug plan. In addition to reimbursement, these laws and regulations \ngovern drug approval and distribution, allowable packaging and labelling, marketing, handling, storage and disposal.\nProvincial governments and private plans continue to implement measures to manage the cost of their drug plans, \nthe impact of which varies by province and by plan. The Council of the Federation, a joint collaboration created by the \nprovincial premiers, continues to work on cost reduction initiatives within the pharmaceutical sector many of which are \nextended to the private sector. \nThe Patented Medicines Prices Review Board (“PMPRB”) protects and informs Canadian consumers by regulating the \nprices of patented medicines sold in Canada and by reporting on pharmaceutical trends. PMPRB is a quasi-judicial \nbody that is part of the Health Portfolio and operates at arm’s length from the Minister of Health. Implementation of \namendments to the Patented Medicines Regulations originally proposed in 2019, the first substantive updates to the \nregulations in over 30 years, were delayed due to COVID-19. As a result of changes in the pharmaceutical landscape, \nthe Minister of Health announced in April 2022 that Health Canada will move forward with the PMPRB amendments \nimplementing the new basket of comparator countries and reduced reporting requirements for those medicines at \nlowest risk of excessive pricing, coming into effect on July 1, 2022. The federal government will not proceed with the \namendments related to the new price regulatory factors, nor with the requirements to file information net of all price \nadjustments as the PMPRB will draft and consult on new guidelines. \nWhile timing and impact are uncertain at this time, pharmaceutical price compression will put pressure on pharmacy \nfunding and pharmacy operating models, and it is anticipated that healthcare reform and regulation will continue to \nput pressure on pharmacy reimbursement through changes to patient and drug eligibility, prescription drug pricing \nincluding cost, dispensing fee, allowable markup, manufacturer allowance funding, distribution as well as potential \nrestriction around customer inducements and expanded use of preferred providers. The Company has and will \ncontinue to identify opportunities to mitigate the negative impact these changes have on financial performance.\nEMPIRE COMPANY LIMITED  2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n34"

      "text": "Ethical Business Conduct\nAny failure of the Company to adhere to its policies, the law or ethical business practices could significantly affect its \nreputation and brands and could therefore negatively impact the Company’s financial performance. The Company’s \nframework for managing ethical business conduct includes the adoption of a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics \nwhich directors and teammates of the Company are required to acknowledge and agree to on a regular basis and \nthe Company maintains an anonymous, confidential whistle blowing hotline. There can be no assurance that these \nmeasures will be effective to prevent violations of law or unethical business practices.\nSocial\nSocial reform movements bring public awareness to issues through protests and/or media campaigns. Issues that \nrelate to the Company’s business include, but are not limited to, diversity, animal welfare, local and ethical sourcing, \nnutritional labelling and human rights. Oversight of the Company’s social strategies and issues management is through \nthe Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. Ineffective action or inaction on social reform matters could \nadversely affect the Company’s reputation or financial performance.\nOccupational Health and Safety\nThe Company has developed programs to promote a healthy and safe workplace, as well as progressive employment \npolicies focused on the well-being of the thousands of teammates who work in its stores, distribution centres and \noffices. These policies and programs are reviewed regularly by the Human Resources Committee of the Board \nof Directors. Failure to comply with these policies and programs could adversely affect the Company’s reputation or \nfinancial performance.\nReal Estate\nThe Company utilizes a capital allocation process which is focused on obtaining the most attractive real estate \nlocations for its retail stores, as well as for its commercial property and residential development operations, with direct \nor indirect Company ownership being an important, but not overriding, consideration. The Company develops certain \nretail store locations on owned sites; however, the majority of its store development is done in conjunction with external \ndevelopers. The availability of high-potential new store sites and the ability to expand existing stores are therefore in \nlarge part contingent upon the successful negotiation of operating leases with these developers and the Company’s \nability to purchase high-potential sites.\nLoyalty Program\nThe Company uses loyalty programs to provide additional value to customers. The Company currently utilizes a third-\nparty offering. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2022, a new loyalty program was announced where the Company is \nnow a co-owner. The new program will be rolled out to the Company’s banners throughout fiscal 2023. The decisions \nmade by the third party or partners can adversely affect the reputation and financial operations of the Company. \nPromotional and other activities related to possible changes in the loyalty programs must be effectively managed and \ncoordinated to ensure a positive customer perception. Failure to effectively manage, communicate and implement \nchanges to the loyalty program may negatively impact the Company’s reputation.\nFree Trade\nThe Company is susceptible to risks associated with trade relationships between Canada and other countries including \nthe United States. Changes to trade agreements and tariffs between Canada and other countries could increase the \ncosts of certain products and some items could become unavailable thereby having a negative impact on customer \nexperience. While the Company can mitigate these risks to a certain extent through the use of alternative suppliers, \ninternational trade by its nature can be unpredictable and the Company may not be able to fully mitigate the negative \nimpact of changes in trade agreements and tariffs.\nLiquidity Risk\nThe Company’s business is dependent in part on having access to sufficient capital and financial resources to fund \nits growth activities and investment in operations. Any failure to maintain adequate financial resources could alter \nthe Company’s growth or ability to satisfy financial obligations as they come due. The Company actively maintains \ncommitted credit facilities to ensure that it has sufficient available funds to meet current and foreseeable future \nfinancial requirements. The Company monitors capital markets and the related economic conditions and maintains \naccess to debt capital markets for long-term debt issuances as deemed prudent in order to minimize risk and optimize \npricing. However, there can be no assurance that adequate capital resources will be available in the future \non acceptable terms or at all.\nLegal, Taxation and Accounting\nChanges to any of the various federal and provincial laws, rules and regulations related to the Company’s business \ncould have a material impact on its financial results. Compliance with any proposed changes could also result in \nsignificant cost to the Company. Failure to fully comply with various laws and rules and regulations may expose the \nCompany to proceedings which may materially affect its performance.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n35"

      "text": "Similarly, income tax regulations and/or accounting pronouncements may be changed in ways which could negatively \naffect the Company. The Company mitigates the risk of non-compliance with the various laws and rules and \nregulations by monitoring for newly adopted activities, improving technology systems and controls, improving internal \ncontrols to detect and prevent errors and overall application of more scrutiny to ensure compliance. In the ordinary \ncourse of business, the Company is subject to ongoing audits by tax authorities. While the Company believes that its \ntax filing positions are appropriate and supportable, from time to time certain matters are reviewed and challenged by \nthe tax authorities.\nCredit Rating\nThere can be no assurance that the credit ratings assigned to the various debt instruments issued by Sobeys will \nremain in effect for any given period of time or that the rating will not be lowered, withdrawn or revised by DBRS or \nS&P at any time. Real or anticipated changes in credit ratings can affect the cost at which Sobeys can access the \ncapital markets. The likelihood that Sobeys’ creditors will receive payments owing to them will depend on Sobeys’ \nfinancial health and creditworthiness. Credit ratings assigned by a ratings agency provide an opinion of that ratings \nagency on the risk that an issuer will fail to satisfy its financial obligations in accordance with the terms under which an \nobligation has been issued. Receipt of a credit rating provides no guarantee of Sobeys’ future creditworthiness.\nCapital Allocation\nIt is important that capital allocation decisions result in an appropriate return on capital. The Company has a number \nof strong mitigation strategies in place regarding the allocation of capital, including the Board of Directors’ review of \nsignificant capital allocation decisions. Failure to appropriately allocate capital could alter the Company’s growth and \nadversely affect the financial performance of the Company.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company conducts the majority of its operating business in CAD and its foreign exchange risk is mainly limited to \ncurrency fluctuations between the CAD, the euro, the Great British pound (“GBP”) and the United States dollar (“USD”). \nUSD purchases of products represent approximately 4.3% of Sobeys’ total annual purchases. Euro and GBP purchases \nare primarily limited to specific contracts for capital expenditures. A failure to adequately manage the risk of exchange \nrate changes could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.\nPension Plans\nThe Company has certain retirement benefit obligations under its registered defined benefit plans. New regulations \nand market-driven changes may result in the Company being required to make contributions that differ from \nestimates, which could have an adverse effect on the financial performance of the Company.\nThe Company participates in various multi-employer pension plans, providing pension benefits to unionized \nteammates pursuant to provisions in collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 12% of the teammates of \nSobeys and its franchisees and affiliates participate in these plans. The responsibility of Sobeys, its franchisees, \nand affiliates to make contributions to these plans is limited to the amounts established in the collective bargaining \nagreements and other associated agreements, however, poor performance of these plans could have a negative effect \non the participating teammates or could result in changes to the terms and conditions of participation in these plans, \nwhich in turn could negatively affect the financial performance of the Company.\nLeverage Risk\nThe Company’s degree of leverage could have adverse consequences for the Company. These include limiting the \nCompany’s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital and activities such as capital expenditures, \nproduct development, debt service requirements and acquisitions. Higher leveraging restricts the Company’s flexibility \nand discretion to operate its business by limiting the Company’s ability to declare dividends due to having to dedicate \na portion of the Company’s cash flows from operations to the payment of interest on its existing indebtedness. \nUtilizing cash flows for interest payments also limits capital available for other purposes including operations, \ncapital expenditures and future business opportunities. Increased levels of debt expose the Company to increased \ninterest expense on borrowings at variable rates thereby limiting the Company’s ability to adjust to changing market \nconditions. This could place the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less \ndebt, by making the Company vulnerable during downturns in general economic conditions and limiting the Company’s \nability to make capital expenditures that are important to its growth and strategies.\nInsurance\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are self-insured on a limited basis with respect to certain operational risks and \npurchase insurance coverage from financially stable third-party insurance companies. In addition to maintaining \ncomprehensive loss prevention programs, the Company maintains management programs to mitigate the financial \nimpact of operational risks. Such programs may not be effective to limit the Company’s exposure to these risks, and \nto the extent that the Company is self-insured or liability exceeds applicable insurance limits, the Company’s financial \nposition could be adversely affected.\nEMPIRE COMPANY LIMITED  2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n36"

      "text": "Designation for Eligible Dividends\n“Eligible dividends” receive favourable treatment for income tax purposes. To be considered an eligible dividend, a \ndividend must be designated as such at the time of payment.\nEmpire has, in accordance with the administrative position of CRA, included the appropriate language on its website to \ndesignate the dividends paid by Empire as eligible dividends unless otherwise designated.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures & Financial Metrics\nThere are measures and metrics included in this MD&A that do not have a standardized meaning under GAAP \nand therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures and metrics presented by other publicly traded \ncompanies. Management believes that certain of these measures and metrics, including gross profit and EBITDA, are \nimportant indicators of the Company’s ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flow to fund future working \ncapital requirements, service outstanding debt and fund future capital expenditures and uses these metrics for \nthese purposes.\nFinancial Measures\nThe intent of non-GAAP financial measures is to provide additional useful information to investors and analysts. \nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or used as a substitute for measures of \nperformance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s definitions of the non-GAAP terms included in \nthis MD&A are as follows: \n•\t Gross profit is calculated as sales less cost of sales. Management believes cost of sales is a useful metric to monitor \nprofitability on a product-level basis. Gross profit represents a supplementary metric to assess underlying operating \nperformance and profitability.\n•\t Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is calculated as net earnings before \nfinance costs (net of finance income), income tax expense, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. \nManagement believes EBITDA represents a supplementary metric to assess profitability and measure the \nCompany’s underlying ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flows.\nThe following tables reconcile net earnings to EBITDA:\n\n ($ in millions)\n14 Weeks Ended\nMay 7, 2022\n13 Weeks Ended\nMay 1, 2021\n13 Weeks Ended\nMay 2, 2020\nNet earnings\n$\n193.4\n$\n183.3\n$\n188.8\nIncome tax expense\n \n58.2\n \n45.0\n \n66.5\nFinance costs, net\n \n82.0\n \n66.7\n \n69.0\nOperating income\n \n333.6\n \n295.0\n \n324.3\nDepreciation \n \n227.8\n \n200.2\n \n186.7\nAmortization of intangibles\n \n24.8\n \n19.2\n \n16.8\nEBITDA\n$\n586.2\n$\n514.4\n$\n527.8\n\n\n($ in millions)\n53 Weeks Ended\nMay 7, 2022\n52 Weeks Ended\nMay 1, 2021\n52 Weeks Ended\nMay 2, 2020\nNet earnings\n$\n811.3\n$\n764.2\n$\n612.8\nIncome tax expense\n \n270.3\n \n265.9\n \n219.9\nFinance costs, net\n \n282.1\n \n269.4\n \n279.1\nOperating income\n \n1,363.7\n \n1,299.5\n \n1,111.8\nDepreciation \n \n872.3\n \n768.7\n \n709.1\nAmortization of intangibles\n \n94.8\n \n75.6\n \n71.5\nEBITDA\n$\n2,330.8\n$\n2,143.8\n$\n1,892.4\n•\t Management calculates interest expense as interest expense on financial liabilities measured at amortized cost and \ninterest expense on lease liabilities.

      "text": "Financial Metrics \nThe intent of the following non-GAAP financial metrics is to provide additional useful information to investors and \nanalysts. Management uses financial metrics for decision-making, internal reporting, budgeting and forecasting. The \nCompany’s definitions of the metrics included in this MD&A are as follows:\n•\t Same-store sales are sales from stores in the same location in both reporting periods. Management believes same-\nstore sales represents a supplementary metric to assess sales trends as it removes the effect of the opening and \nclosure of stores.\n•\t Gross margin is gross profit divided by sales. Management believes that gross margin is an important indicator of \nprofitability and can help management, analysts and investors assess the competitive landscape and promotional \nenvironment of the industry in which the Company operates. An increasing percentage indicates lower cost of sales \nas a percentage of sales.\n•\t EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by sales. Management believes that EBITDA margin is an important indicator of \nperformance and can help management, analysts and investors assess the competitive landscape, promotional \nenvironment and cost structure of the industry in which the Company operates. An increasing percentage indicates \nhigher EBITDA as a percentage of sales.\n•\t Return on equity, as reported by Sobeys, is net earnings for the year attributable to owners of the parent, divided by \naverage shareholders’ equity. Management believes return on equity represents a supplementary measure to assess \nSobeys’ profitability.\n•\t Funded debt to total capital ratio is funded debt divided by total capital. Management believes that the funded debt \nto total capital ratio represents a measure upon which the Company’s changing capital structure can be analyzed \nover time. An increasing ratio would indicate that the Company is using an increasing amount of debt in its capital \nstructure.\n•\t Funded debt to EBITDA ratio is funded debt divided by trailing four-quarter EBITDA. Management uses this ratio \nto partially assess the financial condition of the Company. An increasing ratio would indicate that the Company is \nutilizing more debt per dollar of EBITDA generated.\n•\t EBITDA to interest expense ratio is trailing four-quarter EBITDA divided by trailing four-quarter interest expense. \nManagement uses this ratio to partially assess the coverage of its interest expense on financial obligations. An \nincreasing ratio would indicate that the Company is generating more EBITDA per dollar of interest expense, resulting \nin greater interest coverage.\n•\t Book value per common share is shareholders’ equity, net of non-controlling interest, divided by total common \nshares outstanding.\nThe following table shows the calculation of Empire’s book value per common share as at May 7, 2022, May 1, 2021 and \nMay 2, 2020:\n($ in millions, except per share information)\n \nMay 7, 2022\n \nMay 1, 2021\n \nMay 2, 2020\nShareholders’ equity, net of non-controlling interest\n$\n4,991.5\n$\n4,372.7\n$\n3,924.6\nShares outstanding (basic)\n \n265.2\n \n268.3\n \n270.4\nBook value per common share\n$\n18.82\n$\n16.30\n$\n14.51\nAdditional financial information relating to Empire, including the Company’s Annual Information Form, can be found on \nthe Company’s website www.empireco.ca or on the SEDAR website for Canadian regulatory filings at www.sedar.com.\nApproved by Board of Directors: June 21, 2022\nStellarton, Nova Scotia, Canada\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n39"

Included \nin these vendor agreements are volume-related \nallowances, purchase discounts, listing fees and other \nallowances.\nThe Company recognizes these vendor allowances as a \nreduction of cost of sales and related inventories.\nThe number and variety of the vendor agreements can \nmake it complex for management to determine the \nperformance obligations associated with the vendor \nallowances and the related recognition as a reduction \nof cost of sales and related inventories. As a result, \nmanagement judgment is required.\nWe considered this a key audit matter due to the number \nof vendor allowance transactions and varying terms \nof the vendor agreements, making the recognition \nof vendor allowances more complex, requiring \nmanagement judgment. This resulted in a high degree of \nauditor judgment and effort in performing procedures \nand evaluating evidence.\nOur approach to addressing the matter included the \nfollowing procedures, among others:\n•\t Tested the operating effectiveness of controls related \nto the recognition of vendor allowances, including \nmanagement’s approval and recording of vendor \nagreements and the monitoring of the aging of vendor \nallowance receivables.\n•\t For a sample of vendor allowance transactions \nrecognized during the year, evaluated the \nreasonableness of management’s determination \nthat performance obligations associated with vendor \nallowances have been met by:\n\t»\nEvaluating the terms in vendor agreements and \nagreeing amounts recorded to vendor agreements, \ninternal supporting documents, corresponding \ncash receipts/net settlements and any related \ncorrespondence with vendors.\n•\t For a sample of vendor allowance receivables at the \nbalance sheet date, evaluated the reasonableness \nof management’s determination that performance \nobligations associated with vendor allowances have \nbeen met by:\n\t»\nEvaluating the terms in vendor agreements and \nagreeing amounts recorded to vendor agreements, \ninternal supporting documents and any related \ncorrespondence with vendors and, as applicable, \nrecalculating the amount recognized.\n\t»\nObtaining an external confirmation from a vendor \nin respect of the vendor allowance receivable at the \nbalance sheet date; and (ii) tracing amounts to cash \nreceipts/net settlements after the balance sheet \ndate, where applicable.\n\t»\nConsidering outstanding vendor claims at and after \nthe balance sheet date, where applicable.\n•\t Assessed the aging of vendor allowance receivables at \nthe balance sheet date.\n•\t Considered credit notes issued after the balance \nsheet date.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n43"

If we conclude that a material \nuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the \nconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are \nbased on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMay 7, 2022 (in millions of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\n1.\t Reporting entity\nEmpire Company Limited (“Empire” or the “Company”) is a Canadian company whose key businesses are food \nretailing and related real estate. The Company is incorporated in Canada and the address of its registered office of \nbusiness is 115 King Street, Stellarton, Nova Scotia, B0K 1S0, Canada. The consolidated financial statements for the \nyear ended May 7, 2022 include the accounts of Empire, all subsidiary companies, including 100% owned Sobeys Inc. \n(“Sobeys”), and certain enterprises considered structured entities (“SEs”), where control is achieved on a basis other \nthan through ownership of a majority of voting rights. Investments in which the Company has significant influence and \nits joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. As at May 7, 2022, the Company’s business operations \nwere conducted through its two reportable segments: Food retailing and Investments and other operations, as further \ndescribed in Note 27, Segmented information. The Company’s Food retailing business is affected by seasonality and \nthe timing of holidays. Retail sales are traditionally higher in the Company’s first quarter. The Company’s fiscal year \nends on the first Saturday in May. As a result, the fiscal year is usually 52 weeks but results in a duration of 53 weeks \nevery five to six years. The years ended May 7, 2022 and May 1, 2021 were 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.\n2.\t Basis of preparation\nSTATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting \nStandards (“IFRS” or “GAAP”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\nThe consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on June 21, 2022.\nBASIS OF MEASUREMENT\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except the following assets and \nliabilities which are stated at their fair value: certain financial instruments (including derivatives) at fair value through \nprofit and loss (“FVTPL”) and cash settled stock-based compensation plans. Put option liabilities are carried at fair value \nthrough equity. Assets held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and \nassumptions that affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. \nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are \nrecognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\nThe Company has applied judgment in its assessment of the appropriateness of consolidation of SEs, the \nappropriateness of equity accounting for its investments in associates and joint ventures, discount rate, classification \nof financial instruments, the level of componentization of property and equipment, the determination of cash \ngenerating units (“CGUs”), the identification of indicators of impairment for property and equipment, investment \nproperty, intangible assets and goodwill, the recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, \nthe measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, vendor allowances and the recognition of provisions and \nnon-controlling interest put and call options. \nBeginning the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the novel coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on the \nCompany. Sales and costs have fluctuated as pandemic related restrictions have been reintroduced and lifted over this \nperiod. At the end of fiscal 2022 the pandemic related restrictions have been lifted. The ongoing economic impact the \npandemic will have on the Company is subject to continued uncertainty.\nEstimates, judgments and assumptions that could have a significant impact on the amounts recognized in the \nconsolidated financial statements are summarized below. Estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of \ncurrent events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n(A)  INVENTORIES\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value. Significant estimation and judgment \nis required in the determination of (i) estimated inventory provisions associated with vendor allowances and internal \ncharges; (ii) estimated inventory provisions due to spoilage and shrinkage occurring between the last physical \ninventory count and the balance sheet dates; and (iii) inventories valued at retail and adjusted to cost.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n51"

      "text": "(B)  IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS\nAssumptions are used when management assesses impairment of non-financial assets such as investments in associates \nand joint ventures, goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, right-of-use assets and investment property. \nManagement estimates the recoverable amount of each asset or CGU based on the higher of value-in-use (“VIU”) \nand fair value less costs of disposal (“FVLCD”). The VIU calculations are based on expected future cash flows. When \nmeasuring expected future cash flows, management makes key assumptions about future growth of profits which relate \nto future events and circumstances. Estimation uncertainty relates to assumptions about future operating results and the \napplication of an appropriate discount rate. Actual results could vary from these estimates which may cause significant \nadjustments to the Company’s non-financial assets in subsequent reporting periods. Impairment losses and reversals are \ndisclosed in the consolidated financial statements in Notes 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.\n(C)  LEASES\nEstimates and judgment are used in the measurement of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. Key assumptions include \ndetermination of discount rates and lease term expectations. Note 10 details the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\n(D)  INCOME TAXES\nAssumptions are applied when management assesses the timing and reversal of temporary differences and estimates the \nCompany’s future earnings to determine the recognition of current and deferred income taxes. Judgments are also made \nby management when interpreting the tax rules in jurisdictions where the Company operates. Note 14 details the current \nand deferred income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n(E)  PROVISIONS\nEstimates and assumptions are used to calculate provisions when the Company estimates the expected future cash flows \nrelating to the obligation and applies an appropriate discount rate.\n(F)  VENDOR ALLOWANCES\nThe Company has supply agreements with varying terms for purchase of goods for resale, some of which include volume \nrelated allowances, purchase discounts, listing fees, and other discounts and allowances. Estimates and judgment are \nrequired when the receipt of allowances is conditional on the Company achieving specified performance conditions \nassociated with the purchase of product and determining if these have been met. These include estimates of achieving \nagreed volume targets.\n(G)  EMPLOYEE FUTURE BENEFITS\nAccounting for the costs of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits requires the use of several \nassumptions. Pension obligations are based on current market conditions and actuarial determined data such as medical \ncost trends, mortality rates and future salary increases. A sensitivity analysis and more detail of key assumptions used in \nmeasuring the pension and post-employment benefit obligations are disclosed in Note 18. \n(H)  BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS\nFor business acquisitions, the Company applies judgment on the recognition and measurement of assets acquired and \nliabilities assumed, and estimates are utilized to calculate and measure such adjustments. In measuring the fair value \nof an acquiree’s assets and liabilities management uses estimates about future cash flows and discount rates. Any \nmeasurement changes after initial recognition would affect the measurement of goodwill.\n(I)  NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST PUT AND CALL OPTIONS\nThe Company applies estimates and judgment to the non-controlling interest put and call options the Company enters into \nas part of business acquisitions. The calculation is an earnings multiple that has various components including estimates \nof cash flows and discount rates.\n3.\t Summary of significant accounting policies\nThe significant accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently in the preparation of the consolidated \nfinancial statements for all periods presented.\n(A)  BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe financial statements for the Company include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings up \nto the reporting date. Subsidiaries, including SEs, are all entities the Company controls. Control exists when the Company \nhas existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the activities that significantly affect the entity’s returns. The \nCompany reassesses control on an ongoing basis. All subsidiaries have a reporting date within six weeks of the Company’s \nreporting date. Where necessary, adjustments have been made to reflect transactions between the reporting dates of the \nCompany and its subsidiaries.\nEMPIRE COMPANY LIMITED  2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n52"

      "text": "SEs are entities controlled by the Company which were designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant \nfactor in deciding who controls the entity. SEs are consolidated if, based on an evaluation of the substance of its \nrelationship with the Company, the Company concludes that it controls the SE. SEs controlled by the Company were \nestablished under terms that impose certain limitations on the decision-making powers of the SEs’ management and \nthat results in the Company receiving the majority of the benefits related to the SEs’ operations and net assets, being \nexposed to the majority of risks incident to the SEs’ activities, and retaining the majority of the residual or ownership \nrisks related to the SEs or their assets. \nAll intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial \nstatements. \nEarnings or losses and other comprehensive income or losses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period \nare recognized from the effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable.\nNon-controlling interest represents the portion of a subsidiary’s earnings and losses and net assets that is not held by \nthe Company. If losses in a subsidiary applicable to a non-controlling interest exceed the non-controlling interest in the \nsubsidiary’s equity, the excess is allocated to the non-controlling interest except to the extent that the majority has a \nbinding obligation and is able to cover the losses, except as discussed in Note 3(j).\n(B)  BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS\nBusiness acquisitions are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. The acquisition method involves the \nrecognition of the acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, regardless of whether \nthey were recorded on the financial statements prior to acquisition. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and \ncontingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, “Business combinations”, are recognized \nat their fair value at the acquisition date, except for: (i) deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets \nrelated to employee benefit arrangements which are recognized and measured in accordance with International \nAccounting Standard (“IAS”) 12, “Income taxes”, and IAS 19, “Employee benefits”, respectively; (ii) right-of-use assets \nand lease liabilities for leases in accordance with IFRS 16, “Leases” in which the acquiree is the lessee; and (iii) assets \n(or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, “Non-current assets held for sale \nand discontinued operations”, which are measured and recognized at fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill arising on \nacquisition is recognized as an asset and represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the Company’s \nshare of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of identifiable net assets \nover the acquisition cost is recognized in net earnings or loss immediately after acquisition. Transaction costs related \nto the acquisition are expensed as they are incurred. \n(C)  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\nAssets and liabilities of foreign operations with a different functional currency than the Company are translated \nat exchange rates in effect at each reporting period end date. The revenues and expenses are translated at \naverage exchange rates for the period. Cumulative gains and losses on translation are shown in accumulated other \ncomprehensive income or loss (“AOCI”).\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at the foreign \ncurrency exchange rate in effect at each reporting period end date. Non-monetary items are translated at the \nhistorical exchange rate at the date of transaction. Exchange gains or losses arising from the translation of these \nbalances denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in operating income or loss. Revenues and expenses \ndenominated in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at the average foreign currency exchange rate \nfor the period.\n(D)  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nCash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and guaranteed investments with a maturity less than 90 days at \ndate of acquisition, as well as, highly liquid guaranteed investments that are redeemable in cash on demand \nwithout penalty.\n(E)  INVENTORIES\nWarehouse inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost being determined on a weighted \naverage cost basis. Retail inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using \nweighted average cost or the retail method. The retail method uses the anticipated selling price less normal profit margins, \non a weighted average cost basis. The cost of inventories is comprised of directly attributable costs and includes the \npurchase price plus other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition, such as freight. \nThe cost is reduced by the value of allowances received from vendors. The Company estimates net realizable value as the \namount that inventories are expected to be sold taking into consideration fluctuations of retail price due to seasonality \nless estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Inventories are written down to net realizable value when the cost of \ninventories is not estimated to be recoverable due to obsolescence, damage or permanent declines in selling prices. \nWhen circumstances that previously caused inventories to be written down below cost no longer exist or when there is \nclear evidence of an increase in retail selling price, the amount of the write-down previously recorded is reversed. Costs \nthat do not contribute to bringing inventories to their present location and condition, such as storage and administrative \noverheads, are specifically excluded from the cost of inventories and are expensed in the period incurred. \nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n53"

      "text": "(F)  INCOME TAXES\nTax expense recognized in net earnings or loss comprises the sum of deferred income tax and current income tax not \nrecognized in other comprehensive income or loss.\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are comprised of claims from, or obligations to, fiscal authorities relating \nto the current or prior reporting periods, that are unpaid at the reporting date. Current tax is the tax expected to be \npayable on the taxable income for the year calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at \nthe balance sheet date. It includes adjustments for tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous \nperiods. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, the Company establishes provisions based on \nthe most likely amount of the liability or recovery. The calculation of current income tax is based on tax rates and tax \nlaws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.\nDeferred income taxes are calculated using the asset and liability method on temporary differences between the \ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their related tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the \ninitial recognition of goodwill or on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a \nbusiness acquisition or affects tax or accounting profit. The deferred tax assets and liabilities have been measured \nusing substantively enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the amounts are expected to settle. Deferred tax \nassets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be able to be utilized against future taxable \nincome. The assessment of the probability of future taxable income in which deferred tax assets can be utilized is \nbased on the Company’s latest approved forecast, which is adjusted for significant non-taxable income and expenses \nand specific limits to the use of any unused tax loss or credit. If a positive forecast of taxable income indicates the \nprobable use of a deferred tax asset, especially when it can be used without a time limit, that deferred tax asset is \nusually recognized in full. The recognition of deferred tax assets that are subject to certain legal or economic limits or \nuncertainties are assessed individually by management based on the specific facts and circumstances.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the Company has a right and intention to offset current tax \nassets and liabilities from the same taxation authority. Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized as a \ncomponent of income or expense in net earnings or loss, except where they relate to items that are recognized in other \ncomprehensive income or loss (such as the unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges) or directly in equity.\n(G)  ASSETS HELD FOR SALE\nCertain property and equipment have been listed for sale and reclassified as assets held for sale on the consolidated \nbalance sheets. These assets are expected to be sold within a 12-month period. Assets held for sale are valued at the \nlower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.\n(H)  INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES\nAssociates are those entities over which the Company is able to exert significant influence but which it does not control \nand which are not interests in a joint venture. Control is reassessed on an ongoing basis. Investments in associates are \ninitially recognized at cost and subsequently accounted for using the equity method.\nAcquired investments in associates are also subject to the acquisition method as explained above. However, any \ngoodwill or fair value adjustment attributable to the Company’s share in the associate is included in the amount \nrecognized as investments in associates.\nAll subsequent changes to the Company’s share of interest in the equity of the associate are recognized in the carrying \namount of the investment. Changes resulting from the earnings or losses generated by the associate are reported \nwithin share of earnings from investments, at equity on the Company’s consolidated statements of earnings or loss. \nThese changes include subsequent depreciation, amortization or impairment of the fair value adjustments of assets \nand liabilities.\nChanges resulting from earnings of the associate or items recognized directly in the associate’s equity are recognized \nin earnings or losses or equity of the Company, as applicable. However, when the Company’s share of losses in an \nassociate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any unsecured receivables, the Company does not \nrecognize further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the \nassociate. If the associate subsequently reports earnings, the Company resumes recognizing its share of those earnings \nonly after its share of the earnings exceeds the accumulated share of losses that had previously not been recognized.\nUnrealized gains and losses on transactions between the Company and its associates are eliminated to the extent of \nthe Company’s interest in those entities. Where unrealized losses are eliminated, the underlying asset is also tested for \nimpairment losses from a Company perspective. \nAt each reporting period end date, the Company assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment in its \ninvestment in associates. For investments in publicly traded entities, carrying value of the investment is compared to \nthe current market value of the investment based on its quoted price at the balance sheet date. For entities which are \nnot publicly traded, VIU of the investment is determined by estimating the Company’s share of the present value of \nthe estimated cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. If impaired, the carrying value of the Company’s \ninvestment is written down to its estimated recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less cost to sell and VIU.\nEMPIRE COMPANY LIMITED  2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n54"

The actual results may vary and may cause significant \nadjustments to the Company’s investments in associates in the subsequent financial years.\nEach of the associates identified by the Company has a reporting year end of December 31. For purposes of the \nCompany’s consolidated year end financial statements, each of the associates’ results are included based on financial \nstatements prepared as at March 31, with any changes occurring between March 31 and the Company’s year end that \nwould materially affect the results being taken into account.\n(I)  INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES\nInvestments in joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the Company and the other parties to the arrangements \nhave joint control and therefore have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Investments in joint ventures are \ninitially recognized at cost and subsequently accounted for using the equity method.\n(J)  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFinancial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets when the Company becomes a party to the \ncontractual provisions of a financial instrument. The classification and measurement categories for financial assets are \namortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”), and FVTPL. Financial assets that are not \ndesignated as FVTPL on initial recognition are classified and measured at amortized cost if (i) they are held within a \nbusiness model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows, and (ii) the contractual terms give \nrise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. Debt investments that are not \ndesignated as FVTPL on initial recognition are classified and measured at FVOCI if (i) they are held within a business \nmodel whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and (ii) the \ncontractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. Equity \ninvestments held for trading are classified and measured at FVTPL. Financial assets not classified at amortized cost \nor FVOCI are classified and measured at FVTPL. The classification and measurement categories for other financial \nliabilities are amortized cost and FVTPL.\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities are generally classified and measured as follows:\nAsset/Liability \nClassification and Measurement \nCash and cash equivalents\nAmortized cost\nReceivables\nAmortized cost\nLeases and other receivables\nAmortized cost\nDerivative financial assets and liabilities\nFVTPL\nNon-derivative other assets\nFVTPL\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\nAmortized cost\nLong-term debt\nAmortized cost\nOther long-term liabilities (except as below)\nAmortized cost\nSobeys has entered into put and call options with non-controlling interest shareholders of certain subsidiary companies \nsuch that the Company may acquire their shareholdings under certain conditions on or after the exercise date. As \na result, the Company recognizes a financial liability at the present value of the amount payable on exercise of the \napplicable put option. Remeasurement adjustments are recorded in retained earnings. At the end of each reporting \nperiod, non-controlling interests for these subsidiaries that have been recognized, including the earnings attributable \nto these non-controlling interests, are derecognized against the related non-controlling interest liability immediately \nbefore its period-end revaluation.\nImpairment of financial assets are based on expected credit losses (“ECL”). The Company recognizes loss allowances \non its trade receivables based on lifetime ECLs for those assets measured at amortized cost. Loss allowances are \nrecognized on leases and other receivables for which the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial \nrecognition based on the 12-month ECL. Where there is a significant increase in the credit risk of leases and other \nreceivables subsequent to initial recognition, the Company recognizes loss allowances based on lifetime ECLs. The \nCompany considers past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts affecting collectability \nwhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, or in \nestimating lifetime ECLs. \nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n55"

      "text": "(K)  HEDGES\nThe Company has cash flow hedges which are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange \nand energy prices. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging item is \nrecorded in other comprehensive income or loss. To the extent the change in fair value of the derivative does not \ncompletely offset the change in fair value of the hedged item, the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship is \nrecorded in net earnings or loss. Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss are reclassified to net \nearnings or loss when the hedged item is recognized in net earnings or loss. When a hedging instrument in a cash \nflow hedge expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative \ngain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss relating to the hedge is carried forward until the \nhedged item is recognized in net earnings or loss. When the hedged item ceases to exist as a result of its expiry or \nsale, or if an anticipated transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss in accumulated other \ncomprehensive income or loss is immediately reclassified to net earnings or loss.\nFinancial derivatives assigned as part of a cash flow hedging relationship are classified on the consolidated balance \nsheets as either an other asset or other long-term liability as required based on their fair value determination.\nSignificant derivatives include the following:\n(i)\t\n\u0007Foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency swaps for the primary purpose of limiting exposure to \nexchange rate fluctuations relating to the purchase of goods or expenditures denominated in foreign currencies.  \nCertain contracts are designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the effective \nportion of the change in the fair value of the contracts is accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss until \nthe variability in cash flows being hedged is recognized in earnings or loss in future accounting periods.\n(ii)\t \u0007Electricity forward contracts for the primary purpose of limiting exposure to fluctuations in the market prices \nof electricity. These contracts are designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the \neffective portion of the change in fair value of the contracts is accumulated in other comprehensive income or \nloss until the variability in cash flows being hedged is recognized in earnings or loss in future accounting periods.\n(iii)\t \u0007Natural gas forward contracts for the primary purpose of limiting exposure to fluctuations in the market prices \nof natural gas. These contracts are designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the \neffective portion of the change in fair value of the contracts is accumulated in other comprehensive income or \nloss until the variability in cash flows being hedged is recognized in earnings or loss in future accounting periods.\n(L)  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nOwner-occupied land, buildings, equipment, leasehold improvements and assets under construction are carried at \nacquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\nWhen significant parts of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate \ncomponents. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis from the time the asset is available or when assets under \nconstruction become available for use over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\nBuildings \n10 – 40 years \nEquipment \n3 – 20 years \nLeasehold improvements \nLesser of lease term and 7 – 20 years \nDepreciation is included within selling and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. \nMaterial residual value estimates and estimates of useful life are reviewed and updated as required, or annually \nat a minimum.\nGains or losses arising on the disposal of property and equipment are determined as the difference between the \ndisposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets and are recognized in net earnings or loss within other \nincome. If the sale is to a Company’s investment, at equity, a portion of the gain or loss is deferred and reduces the \ncarrying value of the investment.\n(M)  INVESTMENT PROPERTY\nInvestment properties are properties which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for \nboth, rather than for the principal purpose of the Company’s operating activities. Investment properties are accounted \nfor using the cost model. The depreciation policies for investment property are consistent with those described for \nproperty and equipment.\nAny gain or loss arising from the sale of an investment property is immediately recognized in net earnings or loss, \nunless the sale is to an investment, at equity, in which case a portion of the gain or loss is deferred and would reduce \nthe carrying value of the Company’s investment. Rental income and operating expenses from investment property \nare reported within other income and selling and administrative expenses, respectively, on the consolidated statements \nof earnings.\nEMPIRE COMPANY LIMITED  2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n56"

      "text": "(N)  LEASES\n(i)  The Company as a lessee\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability at the commencement date. The \ncommencement date is the date in which the lessor makes the asset available for use by the Company. Lease \npayments for short-term leases or variable payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized in \nselling and administrative expenses.\nLease liabilities reflect the present value of fixed lease payments and variable lease payments that are based on an \nindex or a rate or subject to fair market renewal amounts expected to be payable by the lessee over the lease term. \nLease term reflects the period over which the lease payments are reasonably certain including renewal options that the \nCompany is reasonably certain to exercise. Where applicable, lease liabilities will include the purchase option exercise \nprice if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option, termination penalties if the lease term also reflects \nthe termination option and amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee. Subsequent to initial \nmeasurement the Company measures lease liabilities on an amortized cost basis. Lease liabilities are remeasured when \nthere is a modification to the lease. Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if that \nrate cannot be determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at the lease inception date or the modification date \nas applicable. Interest expense is recognized within finance costs, net on the consolidated statements of earnings.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at the initial amount of the lease liabilities plus any initial direct costs, lease \npayments made at or before the commencement date less lease incentives received and restoration costs. Subsequent \nto initial measurement, the Company applies the cost model to the right-of-use assets. Right-of-use assets are \nmeasured at cost less accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses and any remeasurements of lease \nliabilities. The assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life consistent with \nthe rates in note 3(l) and lease term. Depreciation begins at the commencement date of the lease.\n(ii)  The Company as a lessor\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards \nof ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. For subleases, where the Company acts \nas an intermediate lessor, the Company assesses classification with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the \nhead lease.\nFor finance subleases the Company derecognizes the corresponding right-of-use asset and records a net investment in \nthe finance sublease and related interest income is recognized within finance costs, net on the consolidated statements \nof earnings. \nLease income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. \n(iii)  Sale and leaseback transactions\nA sale and leaseback transaction involves the sale of an asset and the leasing back of the same asset. A sale and \nleaseback is recognized as a sale when the control of the asset has been transferred to the purchaser. The Company \nwill measure the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback and the proportion of the previous carrying amount \nof the asset that relates to the right-of-use retained by the Company. Any profit or loss in a sale and leaseback \ntransaction related to the transfer of rights of the asset to the buyer-lessor is recognized immediately.\n(O)  INTANGIBLES\nIntangibles arise on the purchase of a new business, existing franchises, software (including software that is internally \ndeveloped by the Company) and the acquisition of pharmacy prescription files. They are accounted for using the \ncost model whereby capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as these \nassets are considered finite. Useful lives are reviewed annually and intangibles are subject to impairment testing. The \nfollowing useful lives are applied: \nDeferred purchase agreements \n5 – 10 years \nFranchise rights/agreements \n10 years \nLease rights \n5 – 10 years \nPrescription files \n15 years \nSoftware \n3 – 7 years \nOther \n5 – 10 years \nAmortization has been included within selling and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. \nExpenditures made by the Company relating to intangible assets that do not meet the capitalization criteria are \nexpensed in the period incurred.\nIncluded in intangibles are brand names, loyalty programs and private labels, the majority of which have indefinite \nuseful lives. Intangibles with indefinite useful lives are measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. These \nintangibles are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indicators that intangibles \nmay be impaired.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n57"

      "text": "(P)  GOODWILL\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the business acquired over the fair value of the underlying net \ntangible and intangible assets acquired at the date of acquisition.\n(Q)  IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS\nGoodwill and indefinite life intangibles are reviewed for impairment at least annually by assessing the recoverable \namount of each CGU or groups of CGUs to which the goodwill or indefinite life intangible relates. The recoverable \namount is the higher of FVLCD and VIU. When the recoverable amount of the CGU(s) is less than the carrying amount, \nan impairment loss is recognized immediately in net earnings or loss. Impairment losses related to goodwill cannot \nbe reversed.\nLong-lived tangible and finite life intangible assets are reviewed each reporting period for impairment when events or \nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If such an indication \nexists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if \nany). The recoverable amount is the higher of FVLCD and VIU. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that \nare independent from other assets, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU(s) to which the \nasset belongs. The Company has determined a CGU to be primarily an individual store or customer fulfilment centre. \nCorporate assets such as head offices and distribution centres do not individually generate separate cash inflows and \nare therefore aggregated for testing with the stores they service. When the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is \nestimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to the recoverable \namount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated \nstatements of earnings.\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, other than related to goodwill, the carrying amount of the asset (or \nCGU) is increased to the revised estimate, but is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined if \nno impairment loss had been recognized in prior years. A reversal of impairment loss is recognized immediately in net \nearnings or loss.\n(R)  CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAMS\nThe AIR MILES® loyalty program is used by the Company. AIR MILES® are earned by Sobeys customers based on \npurchases in stores. The Company pays a per point fee under the terms of the agreement with AIR MILES®. Longo’s \nThank You Rewards program allows members to earn points on their purchases at Longo’s stores. Members can \nredeem these points, for cash towards future grocery purchases or to purchase products or services. The cost of points \nis recorded as a reduction of revenue.\n(S)  PROVISIONS\nProvisions are recognized when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for \nwhich it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and where a reliable \nestimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that \nreflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability, if material. \nWhere discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to passage of time (unwinding of the discount) is \nrecognized within finance costs, net on the consolidated statements of earnings.\n(T)  BORROWING COSTS\nBorrowing costs are primarily comprised of interest on the Company’s debts. Borrowing costs directly attributable to \nthe acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as a component of the cost of the asset \nto which it is related. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and are reported \nwithin finance costs.\n(U)  DEFERRED REVENUE\nDeferred revenue consists of long-term supplier purchase agreements. Deferred revenue is included in other long-term \nliabilities and is amortized to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the related agreements.\n(V)  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n(i)  Short-term employment benefits\nShort-term employee benefits include wages, salaries, compensated absences, profit-sharing and bonuses expected \nto be settled within 12 months from the end of the reporting period. Short-term employee benefits are measured on an \nundiscounted basis and are recorded as selling and administrative expenses as the related service is provided.\n(ii)  Post-employment benefits\nThe cost of the Company’s pension benefits for defined contribution plans are expensed at the time active employees \nare compensated. The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other benefit plans is accrued based on actuarial \nvaluations, which are determined using the projected unit credit method pro-rated on service and management’s best \nestimate of salary escalation and retirement ages. \nEMPIRE COMPANY LIMITED  2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n58"

Current market values are used to \nvalue benefit plan assets. The obligation related to employee future benefits is measured using current market interest \nrates, assuming a portfolio of Corporate AA bonds with terms to maturity that, on average, match the terms of the \nobligation.\nRemeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts in net \ninterest), are recognized immediately on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding charge to retained \nearnings through other comprehensive income or loss in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not \nreclassified to net earnings or loss in subsequent periods.\nPast service costs are recognized in net earnings or loss on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment or \ncurtailment, and the date that the Company recognizes restructuring-related costs.\nService cost on the net defined benefit liability, comprising current service costs, past service costs, gains and losses \non curtailments and non-routine settlements, is included in selling and administrative expenses. Net interest expense \non the net defined benefit liability is included in finance costs, net.\n(iii)  Termination benefits\nTermination benefits are recognized as an expense at the earlier of when the Company recognizes related restructuring \ncosts and when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.\n(W)  REVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenue is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of the goods. Revenue is measured at the expected \nconsideration net of discounts and allowances. Sales include revenues from customers through corporate stores \noperated by the Company and consolidated SEs, customer fulfilment centers and revenue from sales to non-structured \nentity franchised stores, affiliated stores and independent accounts. Revenue received from non-structured entity \nfranchised stores, affiliated stores and independent accounts is mainly derived from the sale of product. The Company \nalso collects franchise fees under two types of arrangements: (i) franchise fees contractually due based on the dollar \nvalue of product shipped are recorded as revenue when the product is shipped; and (ii) franchise fees contractually \ndue based on the franchisee’s retail sales are recorded as revenue upon invoicing.\n(X)  VENDOR ALLOWANCES\nThe Company receives allowances from certain vendors whose products are purchased for resale. Included in these \nvendor programs are volume related allowances, purchase discounts, listing fees, and other discounts and allowances. \nThe Company recognizes these allowances as a reduction of cost of sales and related inventories. Certain allowances \nare contingent on the Company achieving minimum purchase levels. These allowances are recognized when it is \nprobable that the minimum purchase level will be met and the amount of allowance can be estimated. Amounts \nreceived but not yet earned are presented in other liabilities as deferred vendor allowances.\n(Y)  FINANCE AND DIVIDEND INCOME\nFinance income and expenses are reported on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. Dividend income is \nrecognized when the right to receive payment has been established.\n(Z)  EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted \naverage number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by \nadjusting the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the dilutive effect of employee stock \noptions and performance share units (“PSUs”). When a loss is recorded, the weighted average number of shares used \nfor the purpose of basic and diluted loss per share is equal, as the impact of all potential common shares would be \nanti-dilutive.\n(AA)  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company operates both equity and cash settled stock-based compensation plans for certain employees. \nAll goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any stock-based payments are measured at their fair \nvalues. Where employees are rewarded using stock-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are \ndetermined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Cash settled plans are revalued \nat each reporting date (Note 28).\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n59"

The amendments require deferred tax assets \nand liabilities to be recognized for transactions that result in both deductible and taxable temporary differences of \nthe same amount at initial recognition. These amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or \nafter January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is assessing the potential impact of these targeted \namendments.\nIn May 2020, the IASB issued a package of narrow-scope amendments to three standards (IFRS 3, “Business \nCombinations”; IAS 16, “Property, Plant and Equipment”; and IAS 37, “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent \nAssets”) as well as the IASB’s Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018 – 2020. These amendments to existing \nIFRS standards are to clarify guidance and wording, or to correct for relatively minor unintended consequences, \nconflicts or oversights. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. The \nCompany does not expect a material impact on its financial statements.\nIn January 2020, the IASB issued Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1, \n“Presentation of Financial Statements”). The narrow-scope amendment affects only the presentation of liabilities in the \nstatement of financial position and not the amount or timing of recognition. Specifically, it clarifies:\n•\t the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should be based on rights that are in existence at the end of \nthe reporting period and align the wording in all affected paragraphs to refer to the “right” to defer settlement by \nat least 12 months and make explicit that only rights in place “at the end of the reporting period” should affect the \nclassification of a liability;\n•\t classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a \nliability; and\n•\t that “settlement” refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services.\nThese amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption \npermitted. The Company is assessing the potential impact of this narrow-scope amendment.\n4.\tInventories\nThe cost of inventories recognized as an expense for the year ended May 7, 2022 was $22,502.7 (2021 – $21,069.0). The \nCompany recorded an expense for the year ended May 7, 2022 of $2.1 (2021 – $4.9) for write-down of inventories below \ncost to net realizable value for inventories on hand.\n5.\t Leases and other receivables\n \n \nMay 7, 2022\n \nMay 1, 2021\nLease receivable\n$ \n553.1\n$ \n540.1\nLoans receivable\n \n45.5\n \n47.1\nNotes receivable and other\n \n24.3\n \n48.0\n \n \n622.9\n \n635.2\nLess amount due within one year\n \n73.8\n \n91.0\n \n$ \n549.1\n$\n544.2\nAll lease receivables are due from franchisees and affiliates and are secured by the related head lease.\nLoans receivable represent long-term financing to certain retail associates.

The Company’s annual test of goodwill was performed \nduring the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and resulted in no impairment (2021 – $ nil) being recorded. \nIn performing the impairment test, the Company determined the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill \nrelates based on FVLCD, except for Farm Boy which was estimated using a VIU model. For all operating segments \nother than Farm Boy, the key assumptions used by management to determine the fair value of the CGU includes \nindustry earnings multiples in a range from 7.0 to 14.0. Farm Boy goodwill was measured using discounted cash flow \nprojections, based on pre-tax cash flow forecasts for the next fiscal year. Cash flow growth is based on projections for \nnew retail sites as well as growth rate of 2.0% to 6.0% over a 10-year timeline for existing sites, with a terminal growth \nrate of 2.0%.

The \nemployee’s pension depends on the level of retirement income achieved with the combined total of employee and \nemployer contributions and investment income over the period of plan membership and annuity purchase rates at the \ntime of the employee’s retirement.\nDEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS\nThe ultimate retirement benefit is defined by a formula that provides a unit of benefit for each year of service. \nEmployee contributions, if required, fund part of the cost of the benefit and employer contributions fund the balance. \nThe employer contributions are not specified or defined within the pension plan text, but are based on the result of \nactuarial valuations which determine the level of funding required to meet the total obligation as estimated at the time \nof the valuation.\nThe defined benefit plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as interest rate risk, mortality risk and \nsalary risk.\nInterest rate risk \nThe present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount rate that reflects the average yield, as \nat the measurement date, on high-quality corporate bonds of similar duration to the plans’ liabilities. A decrease in the \nmarket yield on high-quality corporate bonds will increase the Company’s defined benefit liability.\nMortality risk\nThe present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan \nparticipants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will \nincrease the plan’s liability.\nSalary risk\nThe present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salary of the plan \nparticipants. An increase in the salary of plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.\nThe Company uses either January 1, June 30 or December 31 as an actuarial valuation date and May 1 as a \nmeasurement date for accounting purposes, for its defined benefit pension plans.\n \nMost Recent Valuation Date\nNext Valuation Date\nRetirement pension plans\nDecember 31, 2020\nDecember 31, 2021\nSenior management pension plans\nJune 30, 2021\nJune 30, 2024\nOther benefit plans\nJanuary 1, 2022\nJanuary 1, 2025\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n73"

The goodwill recognized is attributable mainly to the workforce acquired and expected \ncustomer base of the acquired retail store locations and e-commerce business. The goodwill recognized is not \ndeductible for tax purposes. Intangibles of $261.3 are related to the fair value of the Longo’s brand name, loyalty \nprogram and software.\nAfter the fifth anniversary of the transaction, the Longo’s 49% non-controlling shareholders have an option to sell up to \na 12.25% per annum interest in Longo’s to Sobeys, at a multiple applied to the last 12 months earnings before interest, \ntaxes, depreciation and amortization. The multiple will vary depending on achievement of certain business results. If \nLongo’s non-controlling shareholders exercise an option to sell, Sobeys will have a corresponding call option for the \nsame percentage in the following year. After the tenth anniversary of the transaction, both Sobeys and Longo’s have \nmutual put and call options for any remaining minority shares outstanding.\nA financial liability of $239.7 has been recognized at the date of acquisition based on the present value of the amount \npayable on exercise of the non-controlling interest put liability in accordance with IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” \n(“IFRS 9”).

These agreements \ncontain clauses which require Sobeys to provide support to franchisee and affiliate operators to offset or mitigate \nretail store losses, reduce store rental payments, minimize the impact of promotional pricing and assist in covering \nother store related operating expenses. Not all of the financial support noted above will apply in each instance as the \nprovisions of the agreements vary. Sobeys will continue to provide financial support pursuant to the franchise and \noperating agreements in future years.\nDuring fiscal 2009, Sobeys entered into an additional credit enhancement contract in the form of a standby letter of \ncredit for certain franchisees and affiliates for the purchase and installation of equipment. Under the terms of the \ncontract, should franchisees and affiliates be unable to fulfil their lease obligations or provide an acceptable remedy, \nSobeys would be required to fund the greater of $6.0 or 10.0% (2021 – $6.0 or 10.0%) of the authorized and outstanding \nobligation annually. Under the terms of the contract, Sobeys is required to provide a letter of credit in the amount \nof the outstanding guarantee, to be renewed each calendar year. This credit enhancement allows Sobeys to provide \nfavourable financing terms to certain franchisees and affiliates. As at May 7, 2022, the amount of the guarantee was \n$6.0 (2021 – $6.0).\nOther\nAt May 7, 2022, the Company had entered into letters of credit issued in an aggregate amount of $82.4 (2021 – $99.3) \nto support the Company’s obligations.\nSobeys, through its subsidiaries, has guaranteed the payment of obligations under certain commercial development \nagreements. As at May 7, 2022, Sobeys has guaranteed $40.0 (2021 – $40.0) in obligations related to these \nagreements.\nContingent liabilities\nOn June 21, 2005, Sobeys received a notice of reassessment from Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) for fiscal years \n1999 and 2000 related to Lumsden Brothers Limited, a wholesale subsidiary of Sobeys, and the Goods and Service Tax \n(“GST”). The reassessment related to GST on sales of tobacco products to eligible Indigenous Peoples. CRA asserts \nthat Sobeys was obliged to collect GST on sales of tobacco products to eligible Indigenous Peoples. The total tax, \ninterest and penalties in the reassessment was $13.6 (2021 – $13.6). Sobeys has reviewed this matter, has received legal \nadvice, and believes it was not required to collect GST. During fiscal 2006, Sobeys filed a Notice of Objection with CRA. \nThe matter is still under dispute and accordingly, Sobeys has not recorded on its statements of earnings any of the tax, \ninterest or penalties in the notice of reassessment. Sobeys has deposited with CRA funds equal to the total tax, interest \nand penalties in the reassessment and has recorded this amount as an other long-term receivable from CRA pending \nresolution of the matter. The continuation of the hearing of the Appeal was held in July 2021, and the court has not yet \nreleased its judgement.\nThere are various claims and litigation, with which the Company is involved, arising out of the ordinary course of \nbusiness operations. The Company’s management does not consider the exposure to such litigation to be material, \nalthough this cannot be predicted with certainty.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to ongoing audits by tax authorities. While the Company \nbelieves that its tax filing positions are appropriate and supportable, from time to time certain matters are reviewed \nand challenged by the tax authorities.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n81"

The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk are \nprimarily cash and cash equivalents, receivables, leases and other receivables, derivative contracts and guarantees. \nThe Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk corresponds to the carrying amount for all cash and cash equivalents, \nloans and receivables, and guarantee contracts for franchisees and affiliates (Note 25). \nThe Company mitigates credit risk associated with its trade receivables and loans receivables through established credit \napprovals, limits and a regular monitoring process. The Company generally considers the credit quality of its financial \nassets that are neither past due or impaired to be solid. The Company regularly monitors collection performance and \npledged security for all of its receivables, and leases and other receivables to ensure adequate payments are being \nreceived and adequate security is available. Pledged security can vary by agreement, but generally includes inventory, \nfixed assets including land and/or building as well as personal guarantees. Credit risk is further mitigated due to the \nlarge number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. The Company only enters into derivative \ncontracts with counterparties that are dual rated by recognized credit rating agencies and have a credit rating of “A” or \nbetter to minimize credit risk.\nReceivables are substantially comprised of balances due from independent accounts, franchisee or affiliate locations \nas well as rebates and allowances from vendors. The due date of these amounts can vary by agreement but in general \nbalances over 30 days are considered past due. The aging of the receivables is as follows:\n \n \nMay 7, 2022\n \nMay 1, 2021\n0 – 30 days\n$\n456.4\n$\n456.6\n31 – 90 days\n \n36.5\n \n16.1\nGreater than 90 days\n \n90.1\n \n110.6\nTotal receivables before allowance for credit losses\n \n583.0\n \n583.3\nLess allowance for credit losses\n \n24.2\n \n36.3\nReceivables\n$\n558.8\n$\n547.0\nInterest earned on past due accounts is recorded as a reduction to selling and administrative expenses on the \nconsolidated statements of earnings.

The fair value of long-term debt has been estimated by discounting future cash flows at a \nrate offered for borrowings of similar maturities and credit quality.\nThe fair value of derivative financial assets and liabilities, classified as Level 2, is estimated using valuation models that \nutilize market based observable inputs. Management believes that its valuation technique is appropriate. \nThe fair value of the non-controlling interest put liabilities associated with the acquisitions of Farm Boy and other \nacquisitions is equivalent to the present value of the non-controlling interest buyout price which is based on the estimated \nfuture earnings of these entities at a predetermined date. The fair value of the non-controlling interest put liability \nassociated with the acquisition of Longo’s was determined through a statistical simulation, which is based on the \nestimated future earnings of Longo’s at a predetermined date.

      "text": "DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value unless the derivative \ninstrument is a contract to buy or sell a non-financial item in accordance with the Company’s expected purchase, sale \nor usage requirements, referred to as a “normal purchase” or “normal sale”. Changes in the fair values of derivative \nfinancial instruments are recognized in net earnings or loss unless it qualifies and is designated as an effective cash \nflow hedge or a normal purchase or normal sale. Normal purchases and normal sales are exempt from the application \nof the standard and are accounted for as executory contracts. Changes in fair value of a derivative financial \ninstrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other assets and other long-term liabilities with the \neffective portion recorded in other comprehensive income or loss. \nCASH FLOW HEDGES\nThe Company’s cash flow hedges consist principally of foreign currency swaps, electricity sales agreements and \nnatural gas sales agreements. Foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge future purchases or expenditures of \nforeign currency denominated goods or services. Electricity and natural gas sales agreements are used to mitigate the \nrisk of changes in market prices of electricity and natural gas. Gains and losses are initially recognized directly in other \ncomprehensive income or loss and are transferred to net earnings or loss when the forecast cash flows affect income \nor expense for the year.\nAs of May 7, 2022, the fair values of the outstanding derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of forecast \ntransactions were assets of $0.9 (2021 – $0.1) and liabilities of $4.2 (2021 – $0.5).\nCash flows from cash flow hedges are expected to flow over the next two years until fiscal 2025, and are expected to \nbe recognized in net earnings or loss over this period, and, in the case of foreign currency swaps, over the life of the \nrelated debt in which a portion of the initial cost is being hedged.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nInterest rate risk is the potential for financial loss arising from changes in interest rates. Financial instruments that \npotentially subject the Company to interest rate risk include financial liabilities with floating interest rates.\nThe Company manages interest rate risk by monitoring market conditions and the impact of interest rate fluctuations \non its debt. The majority of the Company’s long-term debt is at fixed interest rates. Approximately 17.5% (2021 – 32.1%) \nof the Company’s long-term debt is exposed to interest rate risk due to floating rates.\nNet earnings or loss is impacted by a change in interest rates on the average balance of interest-bearing financial \nliabilities during the year. For the year ended May 7, 2022, the Company’s average outstanding unhedged floating \nrate debt was $210.7 (2021 – $466.0). An increase (decrease) of 25 basis points would have impacted net earnings by \n$0.4 ($0.4) (2021 – $0.9 ($0.9)) as a result of the Company’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its unhedged \nfloating rate debt.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK\nThe Company conducts the vast majority of its business in Canadian dollars. The Company’s foreign currency \nexchange risk principally relates to purchases made in U.S. dollars, British pound and European euros. In addition, \nthe Company also uses forward contracts to fix the exchange rate on some of its expected requirements for foreign \ncurrencies. Amounts received or paid related to instruments used to hedge foreign exchange, including any gains \nand losses, are recognized in the cost of purchases. The Company does not consider its exposure to foreign currency \nexchange risk to be material.\nThe Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency swaps for the primary purpose \nof limiting exposure to exchange rate fluctuations relating to expenditures denominated in foreign currencies. These \ncontracts are designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the effective portion of the \nchange in the fair value of the forward contracts are accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss until the \nvariability in cash flows being hedged is recognized in net earnings or loss in future accounting periods.\nThe Company estimates that a 10% increase (decrease) in applicable foreign currency exchange rates for these \nforwards and swaps would impact net earnings by $ nil ($ nil) (2021 – $ nil ($ nil)) and other comprehensive loss by \n$6.5 ($6.5) (2021 – $3.8 ($3.8)) for foreign currency derivatives in place at year end.\nEMPIRE COMPANY LIMITED  2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n84"

The aggregate net payments under these leases totalled approximately $213.5 \n(2021 – $209.1).\nCrombie REIT provides administrative and property management services to the Company on a fee for service basis \npursuant to a Management Agreement.\nSobeys, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, engages in property sales and sale leaseback transactions with Crombie \nREIT, based on fair market values. These transactions consist of the following:\n \nMay 7, 2022\nMay 1, 2021\n \nNumber \nof sites\n \nCash \nconsideration\n \nPre-tax \ngains\nNumber \nof sites\n \nCash \nconsideration\n \nPre-tax \ngains\nProperties sold and leased back(1)\n10\n$\n95.6\n$\n7.1\n6\n$\n45.3\n$\n0.9\nProperties sold\n1\n2.6\n–\n–\n \n–\n \n–\nLease modification terminations\n3\n \n10.0\n \n22.8\n–\n \n–\n \n–\nTotal\n14\n$\n108.2\n$\n29.9\n6\n$\n45.3\n$\n0.9\n(1)\t Includes a 50% sale leaseback of a distribution centre in which Crombie REIT now owns 100% of the property.\nDuring the year ended May 7, 2022, Crombie REIT disposed of two properties to third parties.

There have been no changes to the Company’s objectives during the year ended \nMay 7, 2022.\nThe Company monitors and makes adjustments to its capital structure, when necessary, in light of changes in \neconomic conditions, the objectives of its shareholders, the cash requirements of the business and the condition of \ncapital markets. \nThe Company considers its total capitalization to include all interest-bearing debt, including bank loans, long-term \ndebt (including the current portion thereof), lease liabilities and shareholders’ equity. The calculation is set out in \nthe following table:\n \n \nMay 7, 2022\n \nMay 1, 2021\nLong-term debt due within one year\n$\n581.0\n$\n46.5\nLong-term debt\n \n595.7\n \n1,178.8\nLease liabilities due within one year\n \n509.5\n \n490.5\nLong-term lease liabilities\n \n5,775.9\n \n5,417.6\nFunded debt, including lease liabilities\n \n7,462.1\n \n7,133.4\nShareholders' equity, net of non-controlling interest\n \n4,991.5\n \n4,372.7\nCapital under management\n$ \n12,453.6\n$\n11,506.1\nThe primary investments undertaken by the Company include additions to the retail square footage of its store \nnetwork through the construction of new, expanded and renovated stores, as well as additions from strategic \nacquisitions. These additions and modifications to the store network include related leasehold improvements and \nthe purchase of land bank sites for future store construction. The Company makes capital investments in information \ntechnology, customer fulfilment centres, and its distribution capabilities. The Company largely relies on its cash flow \nfrom operations to fund its capital investment program as well as share repurchases and dividend distributions to \nits shareholders. The cash flow is supplemented, when necessary, through the incurrence of additional debt or the \nissuance of additional capital stock.\nUnder the terms of existing debt agreements, three financial covenants are monitored on a quarterly basis by \nmanagement to ensure compliance with the agreements. The covenants are: (i) adjusted total debt/EBITDA – \ncalculated as net funded debt plus letters of credit, guarantees and commitments, divided by EBITDA (as defined \nby the credit agreements and for the previous 53 and 52 weeks); (ii) lease adjusted debt/EBITDAR – calculated \nas adjusted total debt plus eight times rent, divided by EBITDAR (as defined by the credit agreements and for the \nprevious 53 and 52 weeks); and (iii) debt service coverage ratio – calculated as EBITDA, divided by interest expense \nplus repayments of long-term debt (as defined by the credit agreements and for the previous 53 and 52 weeks). The \nCompany was in compliance with these covenants during the year.\n31.\t Subsequent events\nOn June 2, 2022, Sobeys redeemed its outstanding 4.70% Series 2013-2 $500.0 Notes, originally due August 2023. The \nearly redemption resulted in a premium of $9.2 being recorded in finance costs on the consolidated statements of \nearnings for the year ended May 7, 2022.\nOn June 7, 2022, the Company announced a new loyalty strategy. The Company is now a joint investor in Scene+ along \nwith its partners Scotiabank and Cineplex. The rollout of the Scene+ loyalty program will begin in Atlantic Canada in \nAugust 2022 and continue across the country, culminating in late fiscal 2023 in most of the Sobeys’ banners and liquor \nstores. AIR MILES® collectors will continue to earn and redeem in the Company’s stores until the new Scene+ program \nis available. The Company has recorded charges of $6.7 in fiscal 2022 related to intangible amortization for the \nAIR MILES® loyalty intangible which previously had an indefinite useful life.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n89"
