      "text": "Chairman’s \nmessage\nDear Shareholder,\nThe past year has brought its own unique set of challenges and change to navigate. \nAs I reflect on the intensity of events we’ve had to \ncontend with as a business and a society in recent \nyears, including the 2019-20 black summer bushfires \nand the lingering global pandemic, it is clear we \nare emerging stronger. We have built a new level of \nagility, resilience and capability that I believe puts \nus in good stead for the significant challenges and \nopportunities that lie ahead. \nWe continue to face into the ongoing impacts of \nglobal supply chain dislocation due to both the \npandemic and heightened geo-political tensions, \nwith simultaneous inflationary pressures, tight labour \nmarkets and investment market volatility presenting \npersistent challenges. As a financial services company \nwe also continued to work through the complexities of \na once-in-a-generation regulatory change agenda. \nWe have additionally been confronted by an \nextraordinary 35 separate natural hazard events \nacross Australia and New Zealand throughout the \nyear, including the devastating Eastern Australia flood \ndisaster in early 2022, the largest weather event in \nSuncorp’s 100-plus year history. \nThe extreme and relentless nature of these events \nhas only served to intensify our efforts in addressing \nclimate change as well as advocating for greater \ninvestment in resilience measures that better protect \nour communities and help address affordability \npressures in high-risk regions.\nI visited the impacted areas on the east coast of \nAustralia, including Lismore and surrounds, as soon as \nit was safe to do so. While confronting, experiencing \nthe situation first-hand served as an important \nreminder of, and provided a deep appreciation for, \nSuncorp’s purpose of building futures and protecting \nwhat matters. It also reinforced that the culture of \nSuncorp is built on the incredible dedication of  \nour people. \nThrough the prism of our changing operating \nenvironment, we recently announced the Board’s \ndecision to sell our banking business, with Suncorp \nGroup to become a dedicated Trans -Tasman insurer \nat a time when the value of insurance has never been \ngreater.  I outline more on this below.\nOur performance and capital position\nWhile the underlying performance of the Group \nremained strong throughout the year, the enormity \nof the challenges faced this year have impacted our \nFY22 result. The Group’s net profit after tax was down \n34.1% to $681 million, with cash earnings down 36.7% \nto $673 million. \nThis was due to the combined impacts of elevated \nnatural hazards costs, estimated at $1.08 billion \ndollars ($101 million over our allowance for the year), \nthe purchase of additional reinsurance covers and \nthe negative impact of investment markets.\nWe have built a new level \nof agility, resilience and \ncapability that I believe puts \nus in good stead for the \nsignificant challenges and \nopportunities that lie ahead.\n6     Annual Report 2021-22\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\nINTRODUCTION"

      "text": "As a result, your Board has declared a fully franked \nfinal dividend of 17 cents per share. This brings the \nFY22 total ordinary dividend to 40 cents per share.\nWhile the total annual dividend to shareholders is \nlower than last year, it is at the upper end of our  \n60-80% target payout ratio at 75%. Your Board \nbelieves this is appropriate given the uncertain \noutlook we continue to face into, including ongoing \ninvestment market volatility and the possibility of a \nthird La Niña weather pattern. \nThe Group’s capital position remains strong, and we \ncontinue to maintain an appropriate capital buffer in \nwhat is a heightened risk environment. Our reinsurance \nprogram continues to provide important protection \nof our balance sheet, and this year we successfully \nplaced our FY23 reinsurance program to reflect the \nelevated natural hazard activity in recent years. \nGood progress has been made to simplify our \nbusiness, drive premium and margin growth and \ndeliver against our strategic priorities. This, combined \nwith our prudent capital management approach, \nunderpins our ongoing commitment to continue to \nunlock value for our company and our shareholders.\nResponding to our changing landscape\nYour Board recognises that Suncorp’s future success \nand sustainability rests on understanding and \nmeeting both the current and future expectations of a \nrange of stakeholders.\nThis year’s materiality assessment of environmental, social \nand governance risks and opportunities saw natural \nhazard resilience, our response to climate change and the \naccessibility and affordability of financial services prevail \nas the Group’s most material topics to address.\nThere remains much to be done at all levels of \ngovernment to address the critical need for community \nresilience and disaster mitigation measures, and \nSuncorp continues to be at the forefront in pushing for \nmeaningful change on this front. \nThis year, the Group refreshed its Climate Change \nAction Plan, reinforcing our commitment to reducing \nour own climate impact while supporting our \ncustomers, suppliers and investees in their transition \nto a low carbon future. \nThe Group also published its second Modern Slavery \nStatement which outlines our approach and progress in \nidentifying and addressing the risk of modern slavery in \nour operations and supply chains.\nOur focus on the increasingly important issue of \ncyber risk remained front and centre, with continued \ninvestment in data security and privacy technology \nand capabilities to reduce the risk of cyber-attacks \nand protect our customers, people and business. \nWe continued to prioritise the health, safety and \nwellbeing of our people and customers and have \ntaken learnings through the pandemic to enhance our \nhybrid model of working. As a Board, we are mindful \nof intense competition for talent and resources \nand remain focused on reskilling and upskilling our \nworkforce as we prepare for the future.\nSale of Suncorp Bank \nFollowing a comprehensive strategic review of the Bank, \nin July 2022 the Board entered into an agreement to \nsell Suncorp Bank to the Australian and New Zealand \nBanking Group (ANZ). In making this decision the Board \nwas focused on ensuring ANZ’s offer created value \nfor shareholders, as well as positive outcomes for our \npeople, customers and communities. \nIt is the Board’s firm belief that this sale will enable both \nour Bank and our Australian and New Zealand Insurance \nbusinesses to accelerate their growth plans through \ndedicated focus and investment. We also believe this will \nresult in a stronger insurance and banking system for \nAustralia and New Zealand more broadly. \nThe transaction is subject to a range of regulatory \napprovals from the Federal Treasurer and the Australian \nCompetition and Consumer Commission, and we will \nengage constructively with the Queensland Government \nin relation to the State Financial Institutions and \nMetway Merger Act 1996 (Qld). Queensland remains an \nimportant part of our future.\nPending completion, your Board is committed to \nreturning to shareholders any capital that is excess \nto the needs of the business. I commit to keeping our \nshareholders updated as the process unfolds.\nIn closing\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to acknowledge \nSuncorp’s Group CEO Steve Johnston, his executive team \nand all employees for continuing to live our purpose and \nstriving to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. \nI also thank you, our valued shareholders, for your loyalty \nand support of the Suncorp Group in what has been \nanother challenging year.\nYour Board remains focused on ensuring Suncorp \nGroup is a sustainable organisation that continues to \ndeliver long-term value. \nChristine McLoughlin, AM\nChairman \n8 August 2022\nAnnual Report 2021-22     7\nREMUNERATION REPORT\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION"

      "text": "Group CEO’s \nmessage\nDear Shareholder,\nAs I reflect on my 17 years at Suncorp, the past three as your CEO, I am regularly reminded of the important role \nour company plays in the lives of our customers and the communities we serve.\nI recall visiting Innisfail soon after Cyclone Larry \ndestroyed everything in its path in 2006. As a new \nrecruit I observed then how central our company was \nto restoring lives and livelihoods. I learnt that while \nbusiness success should be measured in terms of \nprofits, dividends and valuations, equally important \nfor a business like ours are the lives we restore, the \nfutures we assure and the communities we rebuild.\nRoll forward to March 2022, and my visit to Lismore \nafter the east coast flood event was equally \nconfronting. Observing the damage on the ground \nand through the eyes of our customers was \nheartbreaking. What made me so proud was that \neach Suncorp team member knew the role they would \nplay in putting lives back together. \nThis is what we mean when we say we are guided by our \npurpose of building futures and protecting what matters. \nIt’s also why we feel that by engaging our people with \nour purpose, we will deliver for our customers and, in \nturn, create long-term value for our shareholders. \nOur FY22 performance\nWhile the Group’s net profit after tax of $681 million \nand cash earnings of $673 million are down from the \nprevious year, the underlying strength of our business \nis reflected in record growth, improved margins and \ncustomer metrics. \nThis demonstrates the progress we have made against \nour strategic priorities across each of our businesses \nto reinvigorate our well-respected brands, digitise our \nbusinesses, become more efficient and ultimately \nimprove how we serve our customers. Detailed \ninformation about our progress can be found on \npages 12-13 of this Report. \nIt’s disappointing that the 35 separate natural hazards \nevents and global investment market volatility we \nexperienced in FY22 have combined to reduce profits \nand, in turn, your dividends. \nThe flow on effects of volatile investment markets on our \nbusiness can be complex. Like most insurers we invest in \na range of asset classes including government bonds, \nhigh quality corporate fixed interest securities and \nequities. When yield curves steepen and credit spreads \nwiden, as they have recently, accounting rules require us \nto report mark-to-market losses. However, given we hold \nthese assets to maturity, the majority of these losses \nwill unwind over the FY23 year. This, and our strong \nunderlying performance means we have been able to \nreaffirm our FY23 targets. \nWhile business success \nshould be measured in terms \nof profits, dividends and \nvaluations, equally important \nfor a business like ours are \nthe lives we restore, the \nfutures we assure and the \ncommunities we rebuild.\n8     Annual Report 2021-22\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\nINTRODUCTION"

This year we \nformed partnerships with Firesticks Alliance Indigenous \nCorporation and the Foundation for Rural and Regional \nRenewal to help us build greater community resilience.\nWe also extended our partnership with Suncorp \nStadium, which will see us continue as naming-rights \nsponsor of this iconic site of many sporting and \ncultural events for up to ten more years. \nThe year ahead\nOur focus remains on building on the strong \nmomentum across our three businesses to deliver \non our strategic initiatives and meet our FY23 \ncommitments. We know achieving this will allow us \nto accelerate opportunities for further efficiency \nand innovation to meet evolving customer needs and \nunderpin the success of Suncorp.\nWe are committed to supporting the ongoing flood \nrecovery and helping our customers to get back into \ntheir homes and rebuild their lives.

In a year \nwhere the La Niña weather pattern resulted in \nsome of Australia’s most costly natural disasters, \nthe Group’s comprehensive reinsurance program \nprotected earnings with significant recoveries \noffsetting the gross cost of the natural disasters.\n\t\n— Rising yields and widening credit spreads drove \na net loss from yields and investment markets of \n$190 million, while the retained cost of natural hazard \nevents was $101 million above the annual allowance.\n\t\n— A final dividend of 17 cents per share (fully franked) \nbrought total ordinary dividends for the year to \n40 cents per share, representing a full year payout \nratio of 75%, towards the top of the target payout \nratio range of 60% to 80%. Appropriate capital \nbuffers have been maintained in line with the Group’s \nprudent approach to capital management. An on-\nmarket buyback of $250 million was completed in the \nfirst half of FY22.\n\t\n— Insurance (Australia) continued to demonstrate strong \nmomentum in FY22. GWP growth was broad-based \nacross portfolios and stronger in the second half. \nGrowth reflected positive unit performance and rate \nincreases driven by the ongoing pricing response to \nhigher input costs. \n\t\n— Suncorp New Zealand recorded strong growth \nin intermediated and direct channels through a \ncombination of unit growth and targeted pricing \nincreases to offset inflationary pressures on claims. \n\t\n— Suncorp Bank made strong progress on our strategic \ninitiative to Win in Home, growing the home portfolio \nby 9.0% over the year with increasing momentum \nin the second half. Business lending grew by 3.7%, \npredominately driven by commercial lending. At-call \ntransaction accounts increased 20.6%, supported \nby a compelling digital offering. Bank net interest \nmargin (NIM) declined 14 basis points to 1.93%, \nreflecting industry-wide trends.\n\t\n— Group underlying insurance trading ratio (ITR), \nexcluding COVID-19 impacts, was 9.0%, up from \n7.2% in FY21.\n\t\n— Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital held at Group \npost-dividend was $248 million. The Group has \nmaintained an appropriate capital position with the \nGeneral Insurance and Bank businesses operating \nwithin their target ranges after the payment of \ndividends, although at a lower level than in previous \nperiods. This reflects elevated growth in the Bank and \ntemporary capital impacts in General Insurance, \ndue to deferred tax assets (DTA) on unrealised \ninvestment losses and the impact of higher \nreinsurance costs and natural hazards allowance. \nMost of the temporary capital impacts are expected \nto reverse over time as the underlying investment \nassets reach their maturity in the case of the DTA and \nthrough a pricing response in the case of the higher \nreinsurance costs and natural hazards allowance.\n\t\n— \tGroup operating expenses were $2,781 million up \n3.2% excluding emergency services levy (ESL), \ntransitional excess profits and losses (TEPL) provision, \nreorganisation costs, and Wealth expenses. The \nincrease in operating expenses largely reflected the \ntemporary increase in strategic investment as well as \ngrowth related costs.\nCapital management strategy\nThe Group’s capital management strategy is to \noptimise shareholder value by managing the level, \nmix and use of capital resources. Our capital \nmanagement balances the requirements to grow the \nbusiness, commitments to our customers, returns to \nshareholders and regulatory obligations.\nDespite uncertainty in the outlook with volatile \ninvestment markets and continued elevated natural \nhazards activity, the Group’s robust balance sheet \nhas allowed the Board to declare a fully franked \ntotal ordinary dividends of 40 cents per share. This \nequates to a payout ratio of 75% of cash earnings, \ntowards the top of the target payout ratio range of \n60% to 80%. \nThe Group maintained appropriate capital buffers over \nthe year and was able to return $250 million excess \ncapital to shareholders via an on-market buyback in the \nfirst half of FY22.\nThe Group will continue to take a prudent approach \nto capital management throughout FY23. The Group \nremains committed to returning to shareholders any \ncapital that is excess to the needs of the business. \nCapital requirements will be continually reassessed \nconsidering the needs of the business, the economic \noutlook and any regulatory guidance.\nAnnual Report 2021-22   53\nREMUNERATION REPORT\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION"

In addition, the non-\nexecutive directors hold regular discussions during \nscheduled Board and Committee meetings without the \nGroup CEO or other management in attendance.\nThe Board formally assesses the independence of its \ndirectors on appointment, and when reviewing each \nnon-executive director’s annual attestation. A register \nof directors’ interests is kept current, to facilitate an \nongoing assessment throughout the year.\nA director’s interests, positions, associations or \nrelationships will be considered relevant when assessing \nindependence if the individual circumstances materially \ninterfere with (or could reasonably be perceived to \nmaterially interfere with) the director’s ability to exercise \nindependent judgement in relation to any matter before \nthe Board, or to act in the best interests of Suncorp.\nThe Board also gives consideration to a non-executive \ndirector’s tenure on the Board in assessing independence, \nbut the mere fact that a director has served on the Board \nfor a substantial period does not mean that the director \ncan no longer be considered independent.\nDirector independence – FY22 assessment\nBased on its latest annual assessment, the Board \nconsiders that throughout FY22, the Board Chairman \nand all Suncorp non-executive directors have \nremained independent and have satisfied the Board’s \nindependence criteria (which align with the guidance \nprovided by the ASX and other regulators). The Board’s \nposition on certain specific director interests follows.\nIan Hammond:\n\t\n— is a non-executive director of Perpetual Limited \n(Perpetual). As an investment manager, Perpetual group \ncompanies may hold Suncorp Group Limited securities \nfrom time to time. Perpetual’s current shareholding is \nnot considered a substantial shareholding under the \nCorporations Act. Perpetual group companies also \nprovide trustee services to Suncorp, and Perpetual \nalso operates a wealth management business (as did \nSuncorp, until 31 March 2022). Ian has confirmed that \nas a director of Perpetual he has no involvement in, \nor influence over, any decisions made by Perpetual in \nrelation to any of the above activities.\n\t\n— receives a fixed post-termination benefit from his former \npartnership, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). From time \nto time, Suncorp engages PwC to provide consulting \nservices, which are not considered material in nature \nor quantum. Ian does not participate in any decision to \nengage PwC.\nDuncan West:\n\t\n— is a non-executive director of Challenger Limited \n(Challenger). As an investment manager, Challenger \ngroup companies may hold Suncorp Group Limited \nsecurities from time to time, however Challenger’s \ncurrent shareholding is not considered a substantial \nshareholding under the Corporations Act. Challenger \nalso provides fund management services to Suncorp \nand operates in the wealth management sector \n(as did Suncorp, until 31 March 2022).

The sale was for a cash \nconsideration of $83.75 million and resulted in pre-tax \nprofit on sale of $65 million. \nFollowing a comprehensive strategic review, on 18 July \n2022, we announced a share sale and purchase agreement \nwith Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited \n(ANZ), to sell our banking business. The transaction is \nsubject to a range of regulatory and government approvals. \nThe sale is expected to be completed in the second half of \ncalendar year 2023.\nEvents subsequent to reporting date\nFollowing a comprehensive strategic review, on 18 \nJuly 2022, Suncorp Group announced it has signed a \nshare sale and purchase agreement with Australia and \nNew Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) to sell its \nbanking business (the Bank) for a cash consideration of \napproximately $4.9 billion (the transaction). As part of the \ntransaction, the Group has entered into a Brand Licence \nAgreement with ANZ to licence the Suncorp brand for the \nbanking business for a period of five years, with an option \nto extend for further two years, and a Transitional Services \nAgreement will be in place for a period of two to three \nyears post completion of the sale. \nThe targeted timeframe for completion is the second half of \nthe calendar year 2023. Until this time we will continue to \nown and run the Bank. The transaction is subject to a range \nof regulatory and government approvals.\nThere has not arisen in the interval between the end of \nthe financial year and the date of this report any item, \ntransaction or event of a material and unusual nature \nlikely, in the opinion of the directors of the Company, to \naffect significantly the operations of the Group, the results \nof those operations, or the state of affairs of the Company \nin future financial years. \nGroup outlook\nOperating environment:\nThe operating environment remains challenging. Economic \ngrowth is forecast to slow in line with upward movements \nin interest rates, while supply chain issues from the \nongoing impacts of COVID-19 and global geopolitical \nevents are resulting in inflationary pressures. \nWhile the Group’s extensive modelling of catastrophe risk \nindicates only a minor upward trend in the frequency of \nnatural hazard related events, more recent years have \nbeen adversely affected by the prevalence of the La Niña \nrelated weather pattern. The Group has noted current \nmodelling pointing to the likelihood of a third consecutive \nLa Niña year. As previously announced, Suncorp has fully \nplaced its reinsurance program, increased allowances \nand set the balance sheet appropriately. \nOn 4 May 2021, the Federal Government announced a \nreinsurance pool for cyclones and related flood damage \nin Northern Australia. Suncorp will continue to work \nclosely with the Government and regulators to finalise the \nconstruct of the pool.\nAnnual Report 2021-22     79\nREMUNERATION REPORT\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION"

This temporary workforce was put in \nplace during one of the most challenging job markets \nin recent history, with many of our new team members \nbeing attracted to the opportunity to be part of a \nteam helping our customers get back on their feet. \nOrganisations around the world are staring into a \ntight labour market and a workforce emerging from \nCOVID-19 - with employees seeking greater flexibility \nand tighter connection with the true purpose of \nwork. These factors are driving unprecedented \nincreases in employee initiated turnover across most \norganisations. Whilst Suncorp has experienced an \nincrease in turnover and we expect these trends to \ncontinue for the foreseeable future, Suncorp’s well-\narticulated employee value proposition (EVP) “Chase \nthe Sun” stands us in good stead. Your Board, through \nthe People and Remuneration Committee, will ensure \nwe stay on top of these global workforce trends.\nSince the end of the financial year we have announced \nthe sale of Suncorp Bank to ANZ Banking Group (ANZ). \nThe transaction is subject to a number of regulatory \nand government approvals and we are hopeful of \ncompleting this process by the end of 30 June 2023. \nDuring this time, your Board will be focused on \nensuring the delivery of our 2021-23 strategic plan \nwhich has financial targets already communicated \nto the market. The Board believes the retention and \ndevelopment of key talent will be key to delivering these \nfinancial outcomes and in establishing Suncorp as a \nleading Trans-Tasman insurer, protecting what matters \nfor our customers into the future.\nWhat’s different in the 2022  \nRemuneration Report\nTo continue to enhance the content and readability \nof our remuneration report, and having regard to the \nfeedback we have received from our engagement \nwith stakeholders, we have made the following key \nchanges to the remuneration report this year:\n1.\t In line with the public commitments we made at \nthe time, we have now retrospectively disclosed the \nFY20 Cash Return on Equity (Cash ROE) long-term \nincentive (LTI) targets and vesting schedule, along \nwith the outcomes, in section 5 of this report. Cash \nROE was below target and therefore there was no \nvesting against this performance measure. \n2.\t We have now disclosed “actual remuneration \nrealised” and “short-term incentive (STI) \noutcomes” in a graphical format to better illustrate \nthese outcomes compared to the maximum \nremuneration opportunity available.

Our short-term \nperformance measures in the Group Scorecard are \nweighted 50% towards financial measures and 50% \ntowards non-financial measures. \nThe Group’s FY22 financial performance included a \n7.6% increase in Adjusted Net Profit After Tax (ANPAT) \nof $991 million and Cash Return on Tangible Equity \n(Cash RoTE) of 8.7%. Performance against ANPAT was \nabove target, however Cash RoTE performance was \nbelow target.\nSuncorp performed well against its customer, people and \nculture measures. With our ongoing focus on digitising \nour product and service offering to our customers, \nperformance was above target against our digital \nsales and service measures. Employee engagement as \nmeasured by Workday Peakon Employee Voice1, is strong \nat 8.3 out of 10.0, which is in the Top 25% of the Finance \nindustry. Our Gender Pay Gap also decreased from \n19.6% to 18.4%, being just below target of 18.3%. \nManaging risk and culture continues to be a priority \nacross the business. While there has been positive \nmomentum over the year, there remain areas where \nfurther improvement is required. As a result, the risk \noutcome was slightly below target\nOur approach to Environmental, \nSocial and Governance (ESG)\nEach year Suncorp tracks performance against a \nrange of non-financial targets that complement and \nalign to the Group Scorecard. For FY22 these included \ntargets related to complaints resolution, diversity and \ninclusion, safety and wellbeing, community investment \nand the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions. \nThese targets are an important part of the Group’s \noverall ESG performance and our progress is reported \nin the 2021-22 Sustainability Data Pack. Following a \ncomprehensive review, an updated suite of targets \nfor FY23 have been approved by the Board and are \noutlined in the How we create value section of the \n2021-2022 Annual Report. Performance against \nthese targets is considered as part of the Board’s \ndiscretionary overlay in assessing Group performance. \nRemuneration outcomes\nIn recommending the Group CEO and Senior Executive \nSTI outcomes to the Board, the People and Remuneration \nCommittee considered various inputs. These included \nthe Group and relevant Function Scorecard outcomes, \nas well as a judgement overlay which considered the \nshareholder and customer experience together with \nrisk outcomes, Code of Conduct compliance, and \ndemonstration of the Being @ Suncorp behaviours. \nBased on performance in FY22, the Group CEO's FY22 \nSTI outcome was 90% of target (or 60% of maximum) \nwhich was equivalent to the size of the STI pool across \nthe Group. The FY22 STI for the Senior Executives ranged \nbetween 87-96% of target (or 58-64% of maximum). \nSee section 5 for further information.\nThe Group CEO and Senior Executives’ FY23 fixed \npay, on average, increased broadly in line with the \nincreases to employees across the Group. There was \nno increase in non-executive director fees, where the \nbase fees excluding superannuation have remained \nthe same since 2016. \nLooking ahead\nIn relation to the sale of Suncorp Bank, the Board \nconsidered the impact of the transaction on \nunvested equity (consisting mostly of LTI or deferred \nSTI arrangements). This was done with the intent \nto motivate and retain critical talent during a \nperiod of disruption and uncertainty at a time \nwhen commitment is needed to deliver a successful \ntransaction for Suncorp and sustainably position \nSuncorp’s business following the sale of Suncorp Bank. \nWith this in mind, subject to the requisite shareholder \napprovals being obtained at the 2022 Annual General \nMeeting (AGM), the Board intends to make adjustments \nto the FY21 and FY22 LTI performance rights which have \npreviously been granted under the Suncorp Group \nEquity Incentive Plan Rules. See section 4 for detail. \nThere are no intended adjustments to the operation of \nthe equity that was deferred under the STI plan, with this \ncontinuing to vest or be forfeited in the normal course. \nWhile we believe Suncorp’s remuneration \narrangements are strategically aligned, some key \nchanges will be required over the coming year. \nThese changes will address Suncorp becoming \na pure insurance company in Australia and New \nZealand as well as compliance with APRA’s incoming \nRemuneration Prudential Standard (CPS 511) and the \nFinancial Accountability Regime (FAR). \nEach year we seek to improve the content and \nreadability of our remuneration report. To this end I \nwelcome your feedback. \nSylvia Falzon\nChairman of the People and Remuneration Committee \n8 August 2022\nAnnual Report 2021-22     89\nShareholder Information\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\nREMUNERATION REPORT"

The measure is more closely aligned to the areas which management \ncan control such as risk selection, pricing and cost control, whilst also driving longer-\nterm shareholder value creation. Adjustments are typically made for Investment \nmarket and Natural hazard volatility, Prior year reserve movements and Corporate \ndevelopment activity.\nCash Return on Tangible \nEquity (Cash RoTE)\n10%\nCash RoTE is a measure of Suncorp’s overall return to shareholders. It illustrates how \neffective Suncorp is at turning the cash put into the business into greater gains and \ngrowth for the organisation and investors. Compared to Cash Return on Equity, this \nmeasure is more relevant for current shareholders and the management team and is \nmore closely aligned to return on incremental capital. It is also a more comparable \nmeasure across peers.\nMarket Share Growth \n(Insurance (Australia) - \nincluding customer retention, \nSuncorp NZ, and Home \nLending)\n10%\nMeasuring Suncorp’s growth versus System for Insurance (Australia), Suncorp New \nZealand, and Home Lending in Suncorp Bank provides an outcome relative to the \nmarket whilst also separating the impact of changes to market.

The assessment also incorporates \nBoard Risk Committee feedback.\nPeople \nand \nCulture\nEmployee Engagement\n15%\nReal-time results on employee engagement enable Suncorp to transform feedback \ninto action plans to drive improved levels of employee engagement.

A four-year deferral period further aligns the interests of executives and shareholders and \nensures compliance with the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) and incoming Financial Accountability Regime (FAR).\nIf performance rights vest after three years because the performance and service conditions have been achieved, they will convert into \nvested rights and these vested rights are required to be held by Suncorp on behalf of the executive for a further one-year period, taking \nthe total deferral period to four years. At the end of Year 4, the vested rights convert to shares. \nTo more closely align the experience of executives with shareholders, a dividend equivalent payment is made at the end of the four-year \ndeferral period on any vested rights that convert to shares. \nAllocation\nThe LTI opportunity is divided by the VWAP of the ordinary shares over the five days preceding the start of the performance period \n(or the five days preceding the start date for any new appointments). No discount is applied for the probability of achieving the \nperformance measures. \nPerformance \nmeasures\nThere are three equally weighted performance measures:\nRelative TSR against the largest 50 companies by market capitalisation in the S&P / ASX 100 index excluding REITs and resources \ncompanies (broad-based peer group): This peer group was chosen because it provides a relative indicator of changes in shareholder \nvalue by comparing the Company’s return to shareholders against the returns of companies of a similar size and investment profile. \nRelative TSR against 12 ASX 100 financial organisations with banking and / or insurance operations (customised peer group):  \nThis peer group consists of AMP Limited, Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Limited, Bank of Queensland Limited, Australia and New Zealand \nBanking Group Limited, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Insurance (Australia) Group Limited, Macquarie Group Limited, Medibank \nPrivate Limited, National Australia Bank Limited, NIB Holdings Limited, QBE Insurance Group Limited and Westpac Banking Corporation. \nThis peer group was introduced in FY22 as it provides a relative indicator of changes in shareholder value by comparing the Company’s \nreturn to shareholders against the returns of large companies in the same industry that are exposed to similar external factors.\nCash RoTE: This is defined as cash earnings divided by average equity attributable to owners of the Company, less goodwill and \nintangibles. Cash RoTE replaced Cash ROE in FY22 as it is more relevant for current shareholders and the management team and is \nmore closely aligned to return on incremental capital. It is also a more comparable measure across peers. Cash RoTE considers all \ncontrollable and uncontrollable items.\nVesting \nschedule\nRelative TSR targets and vesting schedule\nRelative TSR performance outcomes\nPercentage of LTI award subject to the relevant TSR \nperformance measure that may vest\nBelow the 50th percentile \n0%\nAt the 50th percentile (median)\n50%\nBetween the 50th and 75th percentile\nStraight line vesting between 50-100%\nAt or above the 75th percentile\n100%\nCash RoTE targets and vesting schedule\nGiven commercial sensitivities, the Cash RoTE targets are ordinarily disclosed retrospectively after the completion of the 3-year \nperformance period. However, due to the announcement of the sale of Suncorp Bank and the intended adjustments that are planned \nto be made to the FY22 LTI grant, subject to the requisite shareholder approvals, the targets and vesting schedule have both been \ndisclosed later in section 4. \nMalus and \nclawback\nAll performance rights are subject to malus and clawback criteria.

These changes \nwould ensure continued BEAR compliance and that no adjustments to performance measures are needed to reflect the \nimpact of the sale of Suncorp Bank. \nFY21 LTI Awards\nCurrent operation\n\t\n— There are two equally weighted performance measures of:\n•\t Relative TSR against a broad-based peer group\n•\t Cash ROE\n\t\n— The relative TSR targets and vesting schedule are the same as that outlined in the LTI section earlier in section 4.\n\t\n— Cash ROE is based on the 3-year straight average of FY21-FY23 Cash ROE.

The key proposed revisions are:\n•\t Performance would be tested as at 30 June 2022. At this date:\n\t\nΐ 80.2% of the performance rights would have achieved the relative TSR (broad-based) performance measure \n\t\nΐ 0% of the performance rights would have achieved the Cash ROE performance measure.\n•\t Given the equal weighting between the two measures, 40.1% of the total FY21 performance rights would have \nachieved the performance measures. \n\t\n— The Board intends to waive the performance conditions on the 40.1% of performance rights that would have achieved \nthe performance measures and impose an additional service condition on these rights such that they would now vest at \nthe end of the original deferral period being 30 June 2024. This would create a retention mechanism for the executives \nand ensure ongoing shareholder alignment as ultimate rewards realised are dependent upon the Suncorp share price \nat the end of the deferral period.\n\t\n— Under the current plan operation, if an executive resigned between Year 3 (30 June 2023) and Year 4 (30 June 2024), \nany vested rights would remain on-foot and vest in the normal course. If the above changes are made, the rights that \nare retained after the performance testing as at 30 June 2022 would be forfeited if resignation occurs before 30 June \n2024, thus creating a stronger retention mechanism.\n\t\n— The remaining 59.9% of the performance rights would lapse.\n98     Annual Report 2021-22\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\nINTRODUCTION"

The MSR for the Group General Counsel \nand Group CRO is 75% of fixed pay. \nExecutives are required to meet the MSR four years from the October following their appointment, with 50% to be \nachieved after two years. The Group General Counsel is required to meet the MSR four years following this role being \nclassified as a KMP. The value of the shares for the purposes of this requirement is the five-day VWAP up to 30 June in \nthe relevant year. The Board has discretion to alter the VWAP in any particular year in light of any business decisions or \nexternal factors materially impacting the share price.\nBased on their shareholding as at 30 June 2022, all executives have either met their MSR, or are on track to meet this, \nwithin the required timeframes.

This governance structure ensures that relevant \nnon-financial risks, including conduct risks, are considered. \nThe Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) lays the foundation for all Suncorp’s risk management processes. \nThe ERMF seeks to ensure the integration of effective risk management across the Group and incorporates Suncorp’s \npolicies (which include risk management policies and the Remuneration Policy). Employees understand the importance of \nmanaging risk and the link between risk management and the outcomes for our shareholders, customers and employees. \nThe Board sets the risk appetite for the Group and has ultimate responsibility for the effectiveness of the Group’s risk \nmanagement practices. Suncorp develops its strategy and business plan both in consideration of the Group’s risk \nappetite and with regard to the broader external environment. \nIn addition to ensuring the remuneration framework is aligned to prudent risk management, the Board also places \nsignificant importance on ensuring the framework incentivises desired conduct and behaviours.\nRisk and conduct are incorporated into the remuneration framework as outlined below: \nElement\nDescription\nFor all employees and executives\nMeaningful weighting of non-financial \nmeasures in the Group Scorecard, \nincluding a separately weighted risk \nmeasure in the Group Scorecard\nThe structure of the Group Scorecard consists of a number of measures across the categories \nof Financial, Customer, Risk, and People and Culture, with financial measures and non-financial \nmeasures equally weighted at 50% each.\nSTI outcomes are based on both the \n“what” and the “how”\nFor executives, the Board considers behaviours as part of its judgement overlay in determining  \nSTI outcomes. \nFor other employees, individual scorecards are weighted 80% towards performance measures \nand 20% towards the Being @ Suncorp behaviours, with the intent of ensuring that performance \noutcomes are achieved in the appropriate way.\nThe behavioural STI gateway and \nmodifier linked to the Code of Conduct\nThe behavioural STI gateway and modifier is based on an employee’s compliance with the Code \nof Conduct. This can lead to an employee’s STI being reduced (down to nil) if they do not adhere \nto the Code of Conduct.\nThe Board’s application of a judgement \noverlay on the Group Scorecard \noutcome, with risk management \nconsidered as a key component of the \noverall performance outcome\nIn determining performance and remuneration outcomes, the People and Remuneration \nCommittee considers adherence to effective risk management practices and all other relevant \nfactors in the context of the Group’s risk appetite. This occurs before the Board makes its final \ndetermination of the overall STI pool and individual STI awards for the executives.\nIncorporation of malus and clawback \ncriteria into deferred incentive awards\nDeferred incentives (including STI deferred awards and vested and unvested LTI awards) are \nsubject to malus and clawback criteria based on the Board’s judgment. Malus and clawback \ncriteria enable the Board, in its absolute discretion and subject to compliance with the law, to \ndetermine that a participant’s deferred incentives will be fully or partially lapsed (malus) during \nthe deferral period or any shares or cash payment made will be fully or partially forfeited, lapsed \nand / or repaid (clawback). In exercising its discretion, the Board will consider whether this is \nnecessary to protect the Group’s financial soundness or to respond to unforeseen circumstances.\n\u0007The hedging prohibition\nSuncorp Group’s Securities Trading Policy regulates dealing by directors, employees and \ncontractors in Suncorp securities and prohibits hedging transactions to limit the economic risk of \na holding in the Company’s securities including unvested rights. \nAll KMP are reminded of this policy at least twice per year, usually in the month prior to the release \nof Suncorp Group’s annual and half-yearly financial results.\nAny subsequent dealing in those shares is subject to the terms of the Securities Trading Policy. \nFurther detail can be found in the FY22 Corporate Governance Statement at \nsuncorpgroup.com.au/about/corporate-governance\nFor executives only\nDeferral of a significant portion of \nSTI awards\n\u0007Requiring executives to meet the \nminimum shareholding requirement\nThese requirements are in place to encourage executives to adopt a longer-term mindset in \nmaking decisions and to align the executive and shareholder experience. \nSee earlier in section 4 for information on the STI deferral and LTI deferral arrangements and for \ninformation on the MSR.\n100     Annual Report 2021-22\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\nINTRODUCTION"

This fee pool has remained the same since it was last increased in 2007. \nMinimum shareholding \nrequirement\nNon-executive directors have four years from the October following their appointment to achieve the MSR, equivalent \nto 100% of their base fees. A 50% shareholding is required to be achieved after two years. \nBase fees refer to the Board Chairman fee or Board Member fee only (excluding Committee fees and SGC).\nBased on their shareholding as at 30 June 2022, all non-executive directors have either met, or are on track to meet, \nthe MSR within the required timeframes. \nDetailed share ownership information for the non-executive directors is outlined in section 7.\nOutlined below are the non-executive director fees for FY22. Customer Committee Chairman and Member fees increased \nto $40,000 and $20,000 respectively (excluding SGC).

The \nsale is subject to regulatory approvals from the Federal Treasurer and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and both \nSuncorp Group and ANZ will engage with the Queensland Government in relation to the State Financial Institutions and Metway Merger \nAct 1996 (Qld). The sale is expected to be completed approximately 12 months after signing of the SPA.\nIn accordance with AASB 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the sale of Suncorp Bank does not meet the \ncriteria to be classified as held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2022.\nSale of other businesses\nOn 31 March 2022, Suncorp completed the sale of its Australian Wealth business, Suncorp Portfolio Services Limited (SPSL), to LGIAsuper. \nTotal consideration was $55 million. After allowing for separation and transaction costs, the impact of the transaction and resulting \nprofit and loss on Group profit is not material.\nOn 30 November 2021, Suncorp completed the sale of its 50% interest in RACT Insurance Pty Ltd (RACTI) to its joint venture (JV) partner, \nthe Royal Automobile Club of Tasmania Ltd (RACT). The sale was for a cash consideration of $83.75 million and resulted in pre-tax profit \non sale of $65 million.\nAs the Australian Wealth business and RACTI JV did not constitute major lines of the Group’s business, they have not been classified as \ndiscontinued operations.\n1.\t\nReporting entity\nThe Company is a public company domiciled in Australia.

All the values are rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated, in accordance with ASIC Corporations \nInstrument 2016/191.\nThe consolidated statement of financial position is prepared with assets and liabilities presented in the order of liquidity. In the notes to \nthe consolidated financial statements, amounts expected to be recovered or settled no more than 12 months after the reporting period \nare classified as ‘current’, otherwise they are classified as ‘non-current’.\nWhere necessary, comparatives have been re-presented to conform to changes in presentation in the current financial year.\n120     Annual Report 2021-22\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\nINTRODUCTION"

Recoveries are measured as the present value of the expected future receipts.\nAcquisition costs\nAcquisition costs are deferred and recognised as an asset where they can be reliably measured and where it is probable that they will \ngive rise to premium revenue that will be recognised in profit or loss in subsequent reporting periods.\nDeferred acquisition costs (DAC) are amortised systematically in accordance with the expected pattern of the incidence of risk under \nthe general insurance contracts to which they relate. DAC are recognised as assets to the extent that the related unearned premiums \nexceed the sum of the DAC and the present value of both future expected claims and settlement costs, including an appropriate risk \nmargin. The accounting policy for the write-down of DAC asset is discussed in note 8.2.\nAnnual Report 2021-22     127\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nREMUNERATION REPORT\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS"

      "text": "Significant estimates, judgements and assumptions\nThe carrying value of unearned premium liabilities is assessed at each reporting date by carrying out a LAT. This test assesses whether \nthe net unearned premium liabilities less any DAC is sufficient to cover future claims costs for in-force insurance contracts. Future claims \ncosts are calculated as the present value of the expected cash flows relating to future claims, and include a risk margin to reflect the \ninherent uncertainty in the central estimate. The assessment is carried out on each portfolio of contracts subject to broadly similar risks \nand managed together as a single portfolio. The process used to determine the risk margin is discussed in note 9.4.\nThe probability of adequacy adopted for the general insurance LAT differs from the 90% probability of adequacy adopted in \ndetermining the outstanding claims liabilities (refer to note 9.4). The reason for this difference is that the former is in effect an \nimpairment test used only to test the sufficiency of net premium liabilities whereas the latter is a measurement accounting policy used in \ndetermining the carrying value of the outstanding claims liabilities. \nAs at 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021, the LAT resulted in surpluses for the Australian and New Zealand general insurance portfolios.\nIf a LAT deficiency occurs, it is recognised in the profit or loss with a corresponding write-down of the related DAC asset. Any remaining \nbalance is recognised as an unexpired risk liability on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n9.\t\nOutstanding claims liabilities\n2022 \n$M\n2021 \n$M\nGeneral insurance contracts\nGross central estimate – undiscounted\n10,762\n9,320\nRisk margin\n1,223\n1,192\nClaims handling expenses\n419\n389\n12,404\n10,901\nDiscount to present value\n(875)\n(274)\nGross outstanding claims liabilities relating to general insurance contracts – discounted\n11,529\n10,627\nGross outstanding claims liabilities relating to life insurance contracts – discounted\n163\n161\nTotal gross outstanding claims liabilities – discounted\n11,692\n10,788\nAccounting policies\nOutstanding claims liabilities are measured as the central estimate of the present value of expected future payments, relating to claims \nincurred at the reporting date with an additional risk margin to allow for the inherent uncertainty of the central estimate. Standard \nactuarial methods are applied to determine the net central estimate of outstanding claims liabilities. The details of actuarial assumptions \nand the process for determining the risk margins are set out in note 9.4.\nSignificant estimates, judgements and assumptions\nThe Group has considered the impact from COVID-19 in its assumptions for measuring outstanding claims liabilities and assets arising \nfrom reinsurance contracts, including the potential claims impact of business interruption. At 30 June 2022, the outstanding claims \nliability includes additional claims provisions and risk margins of $179 million (30 June 2021: $211 million) relating to business interruption. \nThe outstanding claims liability continues to include a risk margin to achieve a probability of adequacy of 90% for the Group overall.\nThe provision for additional claims has been calculated on a probability-weighted basis and significant judgement has been exercised \nby management to derive a reasonable estimate of the probability-weighted view of potential future cash flows relating to business \ninterruption. Key areas of judgement relate to ongoing legal risk (refer to note 34.2), including appeals of the second industry test case \nwhich affect the ultimate number of claims (i.e. whether insuring clauses should be triggered) and the estimation of potential economic loss.\nAt 30 June 2022, the level of exposure to policies with Quarantine Act exemptions has reduced as all the business interruption policy \nwordings have now been updated to reflect the Biosecurity Act.\nThe rise of inflation as a result of global supply chain disruptions from COVID-19, including the lockdowns in China and increased oil prices \nfrom the Russian invasion of Ukraine may cause increases in claims in the short-term. For example, claims from recent floods may be \nimpacted by increases in the price of building materials, repair parts and shipping costs. Allowances have been made in the valuations for \nthese potential increased costs. In the current environment, there is also a heightened risk of wage inflation increases, however this has not \nyet eventuated. Increases to wage inflation generally may lead to increases in long-tail claim costs in future reporting periods.\nAnnual Report 2021-22     129\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nREMUNERATION REPORT\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS"

However, given the uncertainty \nin the estimation process, it is likely that the final outcome will prove to be different from the original liability established.\nThe estimation of claims IBNR and claims IBNER is generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty with claims often not being \nadequately reported until many years after the events giving rise to the claims have happened. For this reason, long-tail classes of \nbusiness will typically display greater variations between initial estimates and final outcomes.\nEstimation of assets arising from reinsurance and other recoveries are also calculated using the above methods. The recoverability of \nthese assets is assessed on a periodic basis, taking into consideration factors such as counterparty and credit risk.\n130     Annual Report 2021-22\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\nINTRODUCTION"

The term \nto settlement is calculated separately by class of business and is based on historical settlement pattern.\nEconomic and superimposed inflation – Economic inflation is based on economic indicators such as the consumer price index and/or \nincreases in average weekly earnings. Superimposed inflation reflects the tendency for some costs, such as court awards, to increase \nat levels in excess of economic inflation. Inflation assumptions are set at a class of business level and reflect experience and future \nexpectations.\nDiscount rate – Discount rates are derived from market yields on Commonwealth Government securities in Australia and the 10-year \ngovernment stock rate in New Zealand at the reporting date.\nClaims handling expense ratio – Claims handling expense ratio is calculated with reference to past experience of claims handling costs \nas a percentage of past payments.\nRisk margin – The overall risk margin is determined after analysing the relative uncertainty of the outstanding claims estimate for each \nclass of business and the diversification between classes and geographical locations.\nThe assumptions regarding uncertainty for each class of business are applied to the net central estimates, and the results are \naggregated, allowing for diversification, in order to arrive at an overall position which is intended to have an approximate probability of \nadequacy of 90% across the Group (2021: 90%).\n9.5\t\nImpact of changes in key variables relating to general insurance contracts\nThe Group conducts sensitivity analyses to quantify the exposure to the risk of changes in the key underlying actuarial assumptions.

These changes can include payment deferrals, change in \namortisation periods, and temporary change in interest rates. Loans restructured on commercial terms with a significant modification of \ncontractual cash flows are considered a re-origination. In this case, the asset will be derecognised and a new asset will be recognised. \nFor modifications that do not result in a derecognition, a modification gain or loss will be calculated based on the difference between \nthe present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows and the gross carrying amount prior to modification. The \npresent value is determined using the loan’s original effective interest rate.\nDerecognition of financial assets\nFinancial assets, including loans and advances are derecognised when the rights to receive future cash flows from the assets have \nexpired, or have been transferred, and the Group has transferred substantially all risk and rewards of ownership.\n134     Annual Report 2021-22\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\nINTRODUCTION"

      "text": "12.2\t\nImpairment release on financial assets (continued)\nAccounting policies\nBy providing loans and advances to customers, the Group is exposed to credit risk. Accordingly, there will be instances where the Group \nwill not receive the full amount owed, hence provisions for impairment are recognised.\nExpected credit loss model\nThe Group has developed the ECL model to estimate the adverse impact on future cash flows for each group of loans with similar credit \nrisk characteristics.\nECL is recorded for all financial assets measured at amortised cost or interest bearing assets at FVOCI. ECL is calculated as the \nprobability of default (PD) x loss given default (LGD) x exposure at default. The credit models are calibrated to reflect PD and \nLGD estimates based on historical observed experience, as well as reflecting the influence of unbiased forward-looking views of \nmacroeconomic conditions, through macroeconomic variables that influence credit losses, for example the unemployment rate and \nchanges in property prices.\nThe economic forecasts underpinning the PD and LGD estimates are reviewed on at least a six-monthly basis, taking into account expert \njudgement, and are approved by the Bank’s Asset and Liability Committee. Management may hold ‘out of model’ overlays within the ECL \nto capture risks not deemed to be sufficiently reflected in the ECL model.\nFinancial assets that are subject to credit risk are assigned to one of three stages and could be reassigned based on changes  \nin asset quality:\nAsset quality\nProvision established to provide for ECL for:\nStage 1\nPerforming and/or newly originated assets.\nA 12-month period.\nStage 2\nHave experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination.\nThe remaining term of the asset (lifetime ECL).\nStage 3\nIn default as they are either past due but not impaired or impaired assets.\nLifetime ECL.\nPortfolio managed assets in stage 3 (mainly retail lending), will have a collective provision determined by the ECL model. The portfolios \nare split into pools with homogenous risk profiles and pool estimates of PD and LGD. Some portfolio managed assets are individually \ncovered by a SP.\nThe majority of relationship managed assets in stage 3 (mainly business lending) will require a SP. If it is determined that a collective \nprovision provides a more appropriate estimate, a ratings-based approach is applied using estimates of PD and LGD, at a customer level.\nLoans with similar credit risk characteristics are grouped as follows:\n\t\n—\nRetail loans, small business and non-credit risk-rated business loans are grouped by product.\n\t\n—\nCredit risk-rated business loans are grouped by the industry types, being agribusiness, commercial property, development finance \nand property investment.\nThe independent Business Customer Support and Collections teams provide the Chief Risk Officer, Suncorp Bank and the Bank Credit \nRisk Committee with analysis of the carrying value of impaired loans and factors impacting recoverability.\nSignificant increase in credit risk\nA SICR event occurs if a loan deteriorates on the master rating scale (MRS) by a defined number of notches since origination or by \ngoing into arrears. Loans with a higher MRS at origination (higher risk) require fewer notch movements to trigger a SICR event than loans \nwith a lower MRS at origination (lower risk). From the perspective of arrears, 30 days past due is always considered stage 2. Exposures \nfor which the MRS subsequently improves to below the SICR threshold will move back to stage 1. Loans restructured on commercial \nterms with a significant modification of their terms and conditions are considered a re-origination and will be moved into stage 1. The \nincorporation of forward-looking information within the ECL includes a mechanism to allocate a proportion of portfolio exposure to \nstage 2, based on the macroeconomic outlook and is designed to capture SICR events that are not yet reflected in observed data at the \nexposure level.\nSpecific provisions\nA SP for impairment is recognised where there is objective evidence of impairment and full recovery of principal and interest is \nconsidered doubtful. The present value of the expected future cash flows is compared to the carrying amounts of the loan. All factors \nthat have a bearing on the expected future cash flows are considered, including the business prospects for the customer, the realisable \nvalue of collateral, the Group’s position relative to other claimants, the reliability of customer information and the likely cost and \nduration of the work-out process. These judgements can change as new information becomes available and work-out strategies evolve. \nThe asset quality of an exposure carrying a SP is rated as stage 3.\nThe Group’s policy requires the SP that are above internal thresholds to be reviewed at least quarterly, and more regularly as \ncircumstances require.\n136     Annual Report 2021-22\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\nINTRODUCTION"

      "text": "Write-offs\nA write-off is made when all practical recovery efforts have concluded and all or part of a financial asset is deemed unrecoverable or \nforgiven. Write-offs reduce the principal amount of a claim and are charged against previously established ECLs.\n12.3\t\nExpected credit loss model methodology, estimates and assumptions\nSignificant estimates, judgements and assumptions\nThe provision for impairment on financial assets is considered to be a significant accounting estimate and judgment as forecast \nmacroeconomic conditions are a key factor in determining the ECL for loans and advances. Key economic indicators such as residential \nproperty prices and unemployment improved as the Australian and global economies recovered from the initial significant impacts \nof COVID-19. However, central banks are now responding to significant inflation pressures by tightening monetary policy and this will \nslow demand in economies. As the tightening of monetary policy is still in the early stages there is considerable uncertainty about the \neconomic outlook. Nevertheless, a correction in residential property prices is likely, particularly given the large rise in prices over the past \ntwo years, and assuming some rise in the unemployment rate, albeit from current exceptionally low levels.\nReported expected credit loss\nThe Group calculates the ECL by considering a distribution of economic outcomes around a central underlying scenario, with the \ndistribution of outcomes reflecting the Group’s view of the likelihood of more adverse outcomes.\nAs the negative impact of an economic downturn on credit losses tends to be greater than the positive impact of an economic upturn, \nif the Group determines collective provision only on the ECL under the central scenario, or based on a limited number of discrete \nscenarios, it might maintain a level of collective provision that does not appropriately reflect the range of potential outcomes, including \nmore severe downside events. To address this, AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) requires the ECL to be the probability weighted ECL \noutcome calculated for a range of possible outcomes.\nGiven the Group’s view of likely economic outcomes, the PD and LGD distributions around the central scenario incorporate increased \nweighting to downside outcomes. As an example of the downside allowance in the model, although the central scenario sees residential \nproperty prices falling by 8.1% over FY23/FY24, the weighted average fall is 14.7% and there is a 14% probability that property price falls \nwill exceed 25%. Similarly, for national commercial property prices, the ECL calculation reflects a weighted average fall of 6.4% over \nFY23/FY24 and a 12% probability of falls in excess of 25% over the next two years.\nKey assumptions are presented in the table below.\nWeighted average \nmodel assumption %\nWeighted average \nchange %\nFY23\nFY24\nFY23/24\nProperty prices - residential - annual change \n(11.5)\n(3.6)\n(14.7)\nProperty prices - commercial - annual change \n(1.8)\n(4.7)\n(6.4)\nUnemployment rate1\n3.8\n4.4\nn/a\n1 \t\nUnemployment rate reflects the rate as at June 2023 and June 2024. The PD is driven by combinations of variables relevant for each portfolio, such as unemployment \nand property prices. These combinations form an Economic Cycle indicator for which there is a distribution of outcomes. As such, a weighted unemployment rate is not \na direct model input.\nIn determining the reported ECL of $180 million as at 30 June 2022, a distribution of outcomes around the central scenario is adopted for \nboth PD and LGD, taking into consideration observed and anticipated variability in economic outcomes and collateral values.\nDownside sensitivity expected credit loss\nThe ECL calculation relies on multiple variables and is inherently non-linear and portfolio-dependent, signifying no single analysis can \nfully demonstrate the sensitivity of the ECL to fluctuations in macroeconomic variables. As a result of economic uncertainty and the \nsensitivity to key macroeconomic variables, significant adjustments to the ECL could occur in future periods. To provide an indication of \nthe impact of changes in key macroeconomic variables, a sensitivity analysis is conducted on the following key macroeconomic drivers \nto which the ECL is sensitive:\n\t\n—\nresidential and commercial property prices;\n\t\n—\nthe unemployment rate; and\n\t\n—\na combination of simultaneous adverse movements in the above variables.\nThe table below indicates how each of the aforementioned drivers would impact the profit (loss) before tax with a corresponding impact \non the ECL at reporting date.\nAnnual Report 2021-22     137\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nREMUNERATION REPORT\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS"

AASB \n9 currently provides an option to continue to apply AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (AASB 139) hedge \naccounting rules until this project is finalised. The Group continues to apply hedge accounting under AASB 139.\nCash flow hedges\nA cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability of cash flows that:\n\t\n—\nis attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability (such as future interest payments on variable rate \ndebt) or a highly probable forecast transaction; and\n\t\n—\ncould affect profit or loss.\nChanges in the fair value associated with the effective portion of a hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised \nin OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve within equity as the lesser of the cumulative fair value gain or loss on the hedging \ninstrument and the cumulative change in fair value on the hedged item from the inception of the hedge. Ineffective portions are \nimmediately recognised in the profit or loss.\nIf the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or the hedge \nrelationship is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in \nequity remains there until the forecast transaction affects profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, \nthe amounts accumulated in equity are released to profit or loss immediately. In other cases, the cumulative gain or loss previously \nrecognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.\nFair value hedges\nA fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of:\n\t\n—\na recognised asset or liability;\n\t\n—\nan unrecognised firm commitment; or\n\t\n—\nan identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss.\nWhere an effective hedge relationship is established, fair value gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognised in profit or loss. \n144     Annual Report 2021-22\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\nINTRODUCTION"

The hedged item is accounted for under the effective \ninterest method from that point and any accumulated adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item from when it was effective is \nreleased to profit or loss over the period to when the hedged item will mature.\nHedges of a net investment in a foreign operation\nHedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, including a hedge of a monetary item that is accounted for as part of the net \ninvestment, is accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Where an effective hedge relationship is established, the effective portion of \nthe cumulative net change in the clean fair value of hedging instruments is recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve; while \nthe ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.\nUpon disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, the effective portion recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve \nshall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n17.\t\nFinancial instruments, master netting and transfer of financial assets\n17.1\t\nFair value of financial instruments\nFair values are categorised by a three-level hierarchy which identifies the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value:\n\t\n—\nLevel 1: derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical financial instruments that the Group can access at \nthe measurement date.\n\t\n—\nLevel 2: derived from other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the financial instruments, either directly \nor indirectly. The valuation techniques include the use of discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other market \naccepted valuation models.\n\t\n—\nLevel 3: fair value is determined using valuation techniques which include significant inputs that are unobservable. The valuation \ntechniques include the use of discounted cash flow models for loans and advances. The fair value of investments in infrastructure \nassets (held via unlisted trusts) are determined based on the Group’s share of the net asset value of the unlisted trusts, as advised \nby the external investment manager. The fair value of other unlisted equity securities is determined as the cost of the investment \nadjusted for known increments or decrements as this is considered to be the most reliable measure of fair value.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value \nThe following table presents the financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value categorised by fair value hierarchy.\n2022\n2021\nLevel 1 \n$M\nLevel 2 \n$M\nLevel 3 \n$M\nTotal \n$M\nLevel 1 \n$M\nLevel 2 \n$M\nLevel 3 \n$M\nTotal \n$M\nFinancial assets\nTrading securities\n-\n2,722\n-\n2,722\n-\n1,579\n-\n1,579\nFVTPL1\n2,789\n12,016\n197\n15,002\n4,737\n11,690\n247\n16,674\nFVOCI1\n631\n5,318\n6\n5,955\n-\n4,538\n18\n4,556\nDerivatives\n10\n731\n-\n741\n1\n350\n-\n351\n3,430\n20,787\n203\n24,420\n4,738\n18,157\n265\n23,160\nFinancial liabilities\nOffshore commercial paper2\n-\n1,842\n-\n1,842\n-\n1,763\n-\n1,763\nDerivatives\n9\n774\n-\n783\n6\n326\n-\n332\nManaged funds units on issue\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n987\n-\n987\n9\n2,616\n-\n2,625\n6\n3,076\n-\n3,082\n1 \t\nDisclosed within the consolidated statement of financial position category of ‘Investment securities’.\n2 \t\nDesignated as financial liabilities at FVTPL.

Discounted cash flow models are used to \ncalculate the fair value of other term deposits included in deposits based upon deposit type and related maturities. \nThe fair value of borrowings and loan capital are calculated based on either the quoted market prices at reporting date or, where \nquoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model using an observable yield curve appropriate to the remaining \nmaturity of the instrument.\nSignificant estimates, judgements and assumptions\nThe Group continues to monitor valuation inputs when determining fair value of financial instruments.

      "text": "17.3\t\nTransfers of financial assets and collateral accepted as security for assets\nTransferred financial assets continue to be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position if the Group is deemed to have \nretained substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the financial assets transferred. This arises when the Group enters into \nrepurchase agreements and conducts covered bond and securitisation programs. \nRepurchase agreements\nThe Group enters into repurchase agreements involving the sale of interest-bearing securities and simultaneously agrees to buy \nthem back at a pre-agreed price on a future date. In the consolidated statement of financial position, the interest-bearing securities \ntransferred are included in ‘Trading securities’, ‘Investment securities’ and ‘Loans and advances’, because the Group retains the risks \nand rewards of ownership. The obligation to repurchase is included in ‘Borrowings’.\nReverse repurchase agreements\nThe Group enters into reverse repurchase agreements whereby interest-bearing securities are acquired and simultaneously agrees to \nsell them back at a pre-agreed price on a future date. In the consolidated statement of financial position, the securities acquired are not \nrecognised because the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership.\nCovered bonds\nSML conducts a covered bond program whereby it issues covered bonds guaranteed by the Covered Bond Guarantor that are secured \nover covered pool assets consisting of $2,320 million (2021: $2,260 million) of mortgages and cash at call. Eligible mortgages are sold by \nSML to a special purpose trust, the Suncorp Covered Bond Trust, which guarantees the covered bonds. The Covered Bond Guarantor can \ntake possession of the cover pool under certain events. In the event of default by SML, the covered bond holders have claim against both \nthe cover pool assets and SML. SML receives the residual income of the Suncorp Covered Bond Trust after all costs of the program have \nbeen met. In the consolidated statement of financial position, the eligible mortgages transferred are included in ‘Loans and advances’ \nand the covered bonds issued are included in ‘Borrowings’.\nTerm funding facility\nThe Group obtains funding through the facility by entering into repurchase agreements with the RBA. At 30 June 2022 the Group has \ndrawn down $4,129 million (2021: $4,129 million) of the facility, with $nil million (2021: $nil million) remaining undrawn (refer to note 14). \nInterest is charged at a fixed rate equivalent to the official cash rate at the time the respective portion of the facility is drawn down and \nis presented within interest expense (refer to note 10). The repurchase agreements entered into under the Term funding facility require \nthe Group to pledge eligible collateral which includes self-securitised residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). As at 30 June 2022 \n$5,483 million (2021: $5,409 million) of RMBS were pledged as collateral. In the consolidated statement of financial position, the eligible \ncollateral transferred is included in ‘Loans and advances’.\nSecuritisation programs\nSML conducts a mortgage securitisation program whereby residential mortgages are packaged and sold to special purpose \nsecuritisation trusts known as the Apollo Series Trusts (the Trusts). The Trusts fund their purchase of the mortgages by issuing floating-\nrate pass-through debt securities. The Group receives residual income from the Trusts after all payments to security holders and costs \nof the program have been met. The Group does not guarantee the capital value or the performance of the securities or the assets of the \nTrusts, and it does not guarantee the payment of interest or the repayment of principal due on the securities. The mortgages subject \nto the securitisation program have been pledged as security for the securities issued by the Trusts, and as such, the Group cannot use \nthese assets to settle the liabilities of the Bank. The Group is not obliged to support any losses that may be incurred by investors and \ndoes not intend to provide such support. In the consolidated statement of financial position, the mortgages transferred are included in \n‘Loans and advances’ and the securitisation securities issued are included in ‘Borrowings’.\n148     Annual Report 2021-22\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\nINTRODUCTION"

The Boards for the New Zealand General Insurer and Life \ncompany receive equivalent reports and advice in respect of obligations imposed by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.\n24.2\t \tTerms and conditions of general insurance contracts\nThe majority of direct insurance contracts written are entered into on a standard form basis. Insurance contracts are generally \nentered into on an annual basis, with most terms and conditions negotiable at the time of entering into a contract or, in the case \nof renewals, renegotiable. Non-standard and long-term policies may only be written if expressly approved by a relevant delegated \nauthority.

The management of Business Banking \ntroublesome and impaired assets is the responsibility of the Business Customer Support team within the Chief Risk Office, with the CEO, \nSuncorp Bank having accountability for these activities.\nCredit risk on loans and advances\nCredit risk involves a wide spectrum of customers ranging from individuals to large institutions and as such credit risk management is \ndivided into two distinct categories: a statistically managed portfolio and a risk-graded portfolio.\nThe statistically managed portfolio covers retail lending and certain SME exposures and automated credit scoring is widely used to \ndetermine customer creditworthiness. Credit scoring is embedded within the Bank’s end-to-end automated workflow system that also \nenforces credit policies and certain business rules. These exposures are generally not reviewed individually unless arrears occur when all \ncollections and recovery actions are managed by a centralised team.\nThe risk-graded portfolio includes commercial, agribusiness, certain SME exposures. Within these portfolios, exposures are individually \nassessed, and an internal risk grade is assigned depending on the discrete analysis of each customer or group of related customers’ \nrisk profile. Exposures within this portfolio are subject to annual review, or more frequent review if deemed necessary including a \nreassessment of the assigned internal risk grade. In the event of default, collections and recovery activity is managed within a well-\ndefined structure. This process involves initial follow-up by the relationship manager including regular performance monitoring, reporting \nand if required, transfer to the Business Customer Support team.\nA Portfolio Quality Review team within the Suncorp Bank Chief Risk Office reviews the acceptance and management of credit risk in \naccordance with the approved ERMF.\nCredit risk on derivative financial instruments\nThe Bank manages its exposures to potential credit losses on over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts through central clearing and \nby entering into netting arrangements with its derivative counterparties (refer to note 17.2).\nThe fair value of derivatives recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represent the current risk exposure, but not \nthe maximum risk exposure. The notional value and fair value of derivatives are illustrated in note 16.\nCredit risk by gross credit exposure\nThe tables below detail the Bank’s exposure to credit risk from its financial assets and credit commitments as at the reporting date.

      "text": "25.2\t Credit risk for Bank’s financial instruments (continued)\n(c) Collateral management\nCollateral is used to mitigate credit risk as the secondary source of repayment in the event the counterparty cannot meet their \ncontractual repayment commitments.\nThe Bank evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The extent of collateral value secured, if deemed \nnecessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty.\nMore than 81.0% (2021: 80.2%) of the Bank’s lending is classified as retail and 99.9% (2021: 99.7%) of that lending is secured by \nresidential property. Residential Lenders Mortgage Insurance is generally required for residential mortgages with a loan-to-value ratio \nat origination of more than 80% to cover any shortfall in outstanding loan principal and accrued interest. The financial effect of these \nmeasures is that remaining credit risk on residential loans is significantly reduced.\nFor the business banking portfolio, the Bank will hold collateral against loans and advances to customers in the form of mortgage \ninterests over property, other registered securities over assets, and guarantees.\nIn the event of ongoing customer default and/or post appropriate customer hardship support and negotiations, the Bank may enact \npossession of security held as collateral against the outstanding claim. Any loan security for residential mortgages is held as mortgagee in \npossession while the Bank seeks to realise its value through the sale of the property. Therefore, the Bank does not hold any real estate or other \nassets acquired through the repossession of collateral. It is the Bank’s practice to demonstrate high standards of conduct when taking recovery \naction, and to dispose of repossessed properties in an orderly fashion. The proceeds are used to reduce or repay the outstanding claim. \nFor impaired assets, considerable care is taken to assess the underlying collateral value taking into account the likely method of recovery such \nas whether the client sells or through a formal insolvency appointment, the time involved and likely costs associated with the strategy. At 30 \nJune 2022 the net impaired loans of $92 million (2021: $121 million) were supported by collateral held against the impaired loans of $105 million \n(2021: $150 million). Collateral and other credit enhancements held by the Bank mitigates the maximum exposure to credit risk.\n(d) Concentration of credit risk\nConcentration of credit risk is managed by client or counterparty, industry sector and geography. Portfolios are actively monitored and \nfrequently reviewed to identify, assess and protect against unacceptable risk concentrations. The following table details the credit risk \nby geographical concentration on gross loans and advances.\nGeographic breakdown\n2022 \n$M\n2021 \n$M\nQueensland\n29,195\n28,020\nNew South Wales\n17,388\n15,771\nVictoria\n8,516\n7,393\nWestern Australia\n4,048\n3,686\nSouth Australia and other\n2,926\n2,693\nGross loans and advances\n62,073\n57,563\n25.3\t Liquidity risk\nThe key objective of the Group’s liquidity and funding management is to ensure that it has sufficient available liquidity to meet the \ncurrent and future obligations under both normal and stressed liquidity environments, and does not introduce an unacceptable level \nof funding risk.\nThe following key facilities and arrangements are in place to mitigate liquidity risks (excluding Bank):\n\t\n—\nInvestment portfolio mandates provide sufficient cash deposits to meet day-to-day obligations.\n\t\n—\nInvestment funds set aside within the investment portfolios can be realised to meet significant claims payment obligations.\n\t\n—\nIn the event of a major catastrophe, cash access is available under the terms of reinsurance arrangements.\n\t\n—\nMandated liquidity limits.\n\t\n—\nRegularity of premiums received provides substantial liquidity to meet claims payments and associated expenses as they arise.\nIn conjunction with Group policies, the Bank has separate documents and processes to mitigate liquidity and funding risk which are \napproved by the Board Risk Committee and the Chief Risk Officer, Suncorp Bank, which are also subject to APRA review.

      "text": "25.5\t Market risk for Bank’s financial instruments\nDue to the nature of the Bank’s business, market risk exposure is managed separately to other business areas of the Group.\nThe Bank is exposed to mainly two sources of market risk, being interest rate and foreign exchange risks. For the purposes of market risk \nmanagement, these are further broken down into traded and non-traded market risks.\nThe Bank uses value at risk (VaR) as one of the key measures of traded market risk and non-traded interest rate risk in the banking \nbook (IRRBB). The VaR model is a statistical technique used to measure and quantify the market risk over a specific holding period at a \ngiven confidence level. The Bank’s standard VaR approach for traded and non-traded risk is based on a historical simulation which uses \nequally weighted market observation from the last two years and eight years respectively. Historical VaR simulation assumes that the \ndistribution of past price returns will reflect future returns.\n(a) Traded market risk\nThe Bank trades a range of on-balance sheet interest, foreign exchange and off-balance sheet derivative products. Income is earned \nfrom effective trading within the established risk management framework.\nIn addition to VaR, traded interest rate and foreign exchange risks are managed using a framework that includes stress-testing, scenario \nanalysis, sensitivity and stop losses. These measures are monitored and reported to the Chief Risk Officer, Suncorp Bank, and the Bank \nAsset and Liability Committee for management oversight.\nVaR is modelled at a 99% confidence level over a 1-day holding period for trading book positions.\nThe VaR for the Bank’s total interest rate and foreign exchange trading activities at the end of the financial year are as follows:\n2022\n2021\nBank\nInterest \nrate risk\n$M\nFX risk \n$M\nCombined \nrisk1 \n$M\nInterest \nrate risk \n$M\nFX risk \n$M\nCombined \nrisk1 \n$M\nVaR at the end of the financial year\n0.24\n0.03\n0.25\n0.41\n0.18\n0.48\nAverage VaR for the financial year\n1.20\n0.08\n1.23\n0.31\n0.12\n0.31\n1 \t\nVaR for combined risk is the interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, taking into account correlations between different positions in both the interest rate and foreign \nexchange trading portfolios.\n(b) Non-traded interest rate risk\nNon-traded IRRBB is defined as all on-balance sheet items and off-balance sheet items in the banking portfolio that create an interest rate \nrisk exposure within the Bank. The main objective of IRRBB management is to maximise and stabilise net interest income in the long term.\nInterest rate risk arises from changes in interest rates that expose the Bank to the risk of loss in terms of earnings and/or economic value. \nThere are several sources of IRRBB and they include:\n\t\n—\nrepricing risk: resulting from changes in the overall levels of interest rates and the effect this has on the banking book with respect to \nmismatches in repricing dates.\n\t\n—\nyield curve risk: resulting from changes in the relative levels of interest rates at different tenors of the yield curve (that is a change in \nthe slope or shape of the yield curve).\n\t\n—\nbasis risk: resulting from differences between the actual and expected interest margins on banking book items.\n\t\n—\noptionality risk: resulting from the existence of stand-alone or embedded options to the extent that the potential for losses is not \nincluded in the measurement of repricing, yield curve or basis risks.\n\t\n—\nembedded value risk: resulting from differences in transactions book value compared to market-to-market fair value due to past \ninterest rate movements.\n\t\n—\nspread risk: arises due to the imperfect movement of interest rates for different yield curves within an economy.\n164     Annual Report 2021-22\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\nINTRODUCTION"

      "text": "(i) IRRBB – Net interest income sensitivity\nIRRBB exposures are generated by using underlying reconciled financial position data to generate cash flows using relevant interest rate \ncurves, and a static balance sheet assumption. Contractual cash flows are generated except for products where expected behavioural \ncash flow modelling is more appropriate, and they are modelled with a profile and at a term that can be statistically supported.\nAs a measure of shorter-term sensitivity, net interest income sensitivity (NIIS) measures the sensitivity of the banking book earnings over the \nnext 12 months to instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the yield curve. NIIS is measured using a 2% downwards parallel and \nnon-parallel shock to the yield curve to determine the potential adverse change in net interest income in the ensuing 12-month period.\nThe following table indicates the potential impact to NIIS from an adverse 2% parallel movement in interest rates on the Bank’s statement \nof financial position. The results are prepared based on the IRRBB framework applicable to the respective financial year.\nBank\n2022 \n$M\n2021 \n$M\nExposure at the end of the financial year\n(45)\n(7)\nAverage exposure during the financial year\n(18)\n(12)\n(ii) Present value sensitivity\nAs a measure of longer-term sensitivity, present value sensitivity measures the sensitivity of the present value of all known future cash \nflows in the banking book, to instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the yield curve.

The objective of foreign currency exchange risk management is to minimise \nthe impact on earnings of any such movements. The Bank policy is to fully hedge any such exposure and accordingly minimise exposure \nto the risk. All offshore borrowing facilities arranged as part of the overall funding diversification process have been economically \nhedged in respect of their potential foreign exchange risk through the use of financial derivatives (refer to note 16).\nAnnual Report 2021-22     165\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nREMUNERATION REPORT\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS"

Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.\nSubsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group which includes companies, managed funds and trusts. The Group controls an entity when \nit is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its \npower over the entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date when control commences until the date on which control ceases.\nNon-controlling interests recognised as equity and managed funds units recognised as a liability arise when the Group does not hold 100% \nof the shares or units in a subsidiary. They represent the external equity or liability interests in non-wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group.\nSE are entities created to accomplish a specific and well-defined objective such as the securitisation of particular assets or the \nexecution of a specific borrowing or lending transaction. Critical judgements are applied in determining whether a SE is controlled and \nconsolidated by the Group. A SE is consolidated if the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the \nSE and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SE.\nThe main types of SE established by the Group are securitisation trusts and covered bond trusts. The securitisation trusts and the \ncovered bond trusts are controlled by the Group and are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements.\n26.3\t Unconsolidated structured entities\nThe Group conducted fiduciary activities during the current and prior financial year for superannuation funds, until the sale of \nAustralian Wealth business on 31 March 2022.

The Group was deemed a sponsor \nof these entities through normal terms and conditions and by the association of its brand names. Compensation received by the Group \nfrom sponsored entities for the financial year ended 30 June 2022 related to fees from trust fiduciary activities of $39 million (2021: $55 \nmillion). The funds under administration of SPSL were valued at $5,731 million as at 30 June 2021.\n26.4\t Consolidated structured entities\nThe Group has the following contractual arrangements which require it to provide support to its consolidated structured entities, the \nApollo Series Trusts. \nLiquidity facility\nThe Group provides a liquidity facility to the Trustee of the Apollo Series Trusts. If there is a remaining net liquidity shortfall, the trustee \nmay be able to request an advance under the liquidity facility up to a total aggregate amount equal to the unutilised portion of the \nliquidity facility limit. Drawings under the liquidity facility will be subject to certain conditions precedent. The maximum amount which \ncan be drawn is $207 million (2021: $207 million). The amount drawn as of 30 June 2022 is $nil million (2021: $nil million). \nRedraw facility\nThe Group provides a redraw facility to the Trustee of the Apollo Series Trusts. If total principal collections for a monthly period are \ninsufficient to fully reimburse the seller for redraws made during that monthly period to the extent the seller is entitled to be reimbursed, the \ntrustee may be able to request an advance from the redraw facility provider under the redraw facility up to a total aggregate amount equal \nto the unutilised portion of the redraw facility limit.

      "text": "27.1\t\nImpairment test for cash-generating units containing goodwill\nFor the purpose of the annual impairment test, goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units (CGU) which represent the \nGroup’s operating segments (refer to note 3.1). The carrying amount of each CGU is then compared to its recoverable amount. \nThe value of goodwill allocated to each group of CGUs is disclosed in note 3.1. The value of goodwill allocated to each of the Bank and \nSuncorp New Zealand operating segments is not significant in comparison to the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill.\nThe recoverable amount for the banking CGU is determined based on fair value less cost to sell.\nThe recoverable amounts for the Insurance (Australia) and Suncorp New Zealand operating segments, are determined based on value in \nuse.\nSignificant estimates, judgements and assumptions\nValue in use for Insurance (Australia)\nThe recoverable amount of Insurance (Australia) is its value in use and is determined by discounting the future cash flows generated \nfrom the continuing use of the unit and are based on the latest three-year business plans projected for years four and five using key \nassumptions to cover a five-year period. A terminal growth rate of 2.5% (2021: 2.5%) is used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five-\nyear projections which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the industry.\nThe key assumptions for Insurance (Australia) include gross earned premium growth, projected insurance loss ratios, operating expense \ngrowth, and expected operational and regulatory capital levels. The cash flow projections and values assigned to the key assumptions \nrepresent management’s assessment of future trends in the industry and are based on both external and internal sources of data. \nFor Insurance (Australia), the weighted average cost of capital is used as the post-tax discount rate. The discount rates reflect an equity \nbeta and a market risk premium sourced from observable market inputs.\nDiscount rates\n2022\n2021\nPost-tax\n%\nPre-tax \nequivalent\n%\nPost-tax\n%\nPre-tax \nequivalent\n%\nInsurance (Australia)\n7.6\n10.2\n7.2\n9.0\nAccounting policies\nGoodwill is recognised at cost from business combinations and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment loss. \nIntangible assets are recognised at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Where an \nintangible asset is acquired in a business combination, the cost of that asset is its fair value at acquisition date.\nInternally generated intangible assets such as software are recognised at cost, which comprises all directly attributable costs necessary \nto purchase, create, produce, and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. All other \nexpenditure, including expenditure on software maintenance, research costs and brands is recognised as an expense as incurred.\nAmortisation\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the estimated useful lives from the date the asset is available for use. Amortisation is \ncharged to profit or loss in a manner that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed \nusing straight-line or diminishing balance methods. All intangible assets except goodwill have finite useful lives. The maximum remaining \nuseful lives as outlined in note 27 are reviewed annually.\nIntangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life are not amortised but are tested for impairment at least annually. \nImpairment\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date. If any such indication exists, the \nasset’s recoverable amount is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows \n(as part of CGU) which may be an individual asset or a group of assets. The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs \nto sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax \ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. In assessing \nfair value less cost to sell, an earnings’ multiple applicable to that type of business is used.\nImpairment losses are recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment \nlosses, if any, recognised in respect of the CGU are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU \nand then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.\nAn impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.\nAnnual Report 2021-22     171\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nREMUNERATION REPORT\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS"

The customised peer group is 12 ASX 100 financial organisations \nwith banking and / or insurance operations.\n\t\n—\nNon-market measure: Service and internal Cash Return on Tangible Equity.\nIf a company in either TSR peer comparator group is suspended or delisted from the ASX during the performance period, it may be \nremoved from the peer comparator group. There may, therefore, be fewer than 50 companies in the broad-based peer comparator \ngroup and fewer than 12 companies in the customised peer comparator group for that period. No LTI related to the TSR performance \nmeasure will vest unless the Company achieves a relative TSR of 50th percentile (median) or above. Any performance rights not vested \nat the end of the performance period are lapsed. Further details on TSR and the vesting schedule and other terms and conditions can be \nfound on page 97 of the Remuneration Report.\nThe fair value of services received in return for LTI granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares granted. The estimate \nof the fair value of the shares is measured based on a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model and reflects the fact that vesting of the \nshares is dependent on meeting performance criteria based on TSR. The vesting of the shares is also subject to non-market conditions, \nhowever these are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the services received.\n174     Annual Report 2021-22\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\nINTRODUCTION"

Significant resources have been committed to a comprehensive program of work, to ensure that all issues are \nidentified and addressed.\nKey remediation programs have been identified and associated provisions estimated.

They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are \nsettled. Related on-costs such as superannuation, workers’ compensation and payroll tax are also included in the liability.\nLong service leave and annual leave\nThe liabilities for long service leave and annual leave are those not expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of \nthe reporting period. They are measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided \nby employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee \ndepartures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using Australian corporate bond rates with terms to \nmaturity that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. Related on-costs such as superannuation, workers’ \ncompensation and payroll tax are also included in the liability.\nTermination benefits\nTermination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group \nrecognises costs for a restructure. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Group can no longer \nwithdraw the offer as an employee has accepted the offer or when a restriction on the Group’s ability to withdraw the offer takes effect.\nAnnual Report 2021-22     179\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nREMUNERATION REPORT\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS"

      "text": "Royal Commission\nThe 2019 report of the Royal Commission (Report) set out 76 policy recommendations. In the period since the Report, a number of items \nhave been actioned by government, although in some cases the changes have not yet been legislated and applied in full. The Group has \nimplemented many of the known reforms and continues to monitor and respond to any additional legislative and regulatory activity. The \nrecent Federal Government change may result in revisiting of the recommendation for further legislative change.\nIn addition to policy matters, the Report sets out details of various case studies and made observations in respect of each. Two matters \nwere referred to regulators for further enquiry and provisions have been recognised. Whilst one matter relating to Accrued Default \nAmount transfers to MySuper has been concluded, APRA indicated that a broader industry review may be conducted relating to \nutilisation of tax surpluses in the future. It remains uncertain whether any other enquiries or claims may arise following the case studies \nand observations in the Report.\nLitigation\nAs disclosed in an ASX announcement on 15 April 2021 a class action was filed against AAI Limited and former Suncorp Group entity \nSuncorp Life & Superannuation Limited (SLSL) on behalf of persons who purchased addon insurance products sold with the purchase \nor lease of motor vehicles at car dealerships between 1 May 2006 and 30 June 2018. Another Group entity MTAI Limited has now been \njoined as a defendant. The Group is defending this matter. The Group has made provision for legal, investigation and other defence \ncosts. At this stage of the proceedings it is currently not possible to determine the ultimate financial impact of this matter, if any.\nFollowing the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the construction of various business interruption wordings has been tested through litigation \nincluding two industry test cases. The first test case considered the validity of policy exclusions that referenced the ‘Quarantine Act and \nsubsequent amendments’. The Court determined that insurers could not rely on these exclusions and the matter has now finalised. Overall \npolicy response and assessment of claims arising from these policies cannot yet occur as this is dependent on the construction of other \nclauses that are being considered in the second test case. The second test case considers whether the insuring clauses for these policies \nrespond, including the construction of Infectious Diseases, Prevention of Access, and adjustments clauses. The Full Federal Court determined \nthat the insuring clauses considered did not generally respond to COVID-19 business interruption claims. This judgement is currently the \nsubject of an application for special leave to appeal before the High Court of Australia. Other industry participants have discrete litigation \nand/or class actions on foot considering their business interruption wordings and other aspects of their response to these issues. Accordingly, \nthere may be additional judicial determinations which may be of broader industry application and impact future exposure for the Group.\nThe potential impact of these matters is uncertain and has been considered in the recognition of claims provisions and risk margins in \nthe General Insurance outstanding claims liabilities as set out in note 9.\nAs disclosed to the ASX on 1 July 2019, a class action has been filed against SPSL, being the trustee of the former Suncorp Master \nTrust and two former SPSL executive directors. A settlement has been achieved and the expected outflow for the Group has been fully \nprovided for. The settlement requires Court approval and this is currently scheduled for late 2022.\nThere are other outstanding court proceedings, potential fines, enquiries, industry reviews, claims and possible claims against the \nGroup, the aggregate amount of which cannot be readily quantified.

The new or revised accounting standard that is expected to have a material impact on the Group’s \nconsolidated financial statements is set out below. The Group has not early adopted this accounting standard.\nAASB 17 Insurance Contracts\nAASB 17 Insurance Contracts (AASB 17) is a new accounting standard for all types of insurance contracts and replaces AASB 4 Insurance \nContracts, AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts. AASB 17 was issued in July 2017 and \nfollowing stakeholder feedback, amendments were approved in July 2020 to address implementation issues identified. A further \namendment was approved in March 2022 to add a transition option that permits an entity to apply a classification overlay relating to \ncomparative information about financial assets presented on initial application of AASB 17 and AASB 9 Financial Instruments at the same \ntime. AASB 17 is effective for the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the reporting period beginning on 1 July 2023.\nAASB 17 introduces three new measurement models. The general model measures insurance contracts based on the fulfilment cash \nflows (the present value of estimated future cash flows with an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk) and the contractual service \nmargin (the unearned profit that will be recognised as services are provided over the coverage period). A modified version of the general \nmodel (variable fee approach) is applied to insurance contracts with direct participation features, and a simplified measurement \nmodel (premium allocation approach) is permitted in certain circumstances. The premium allocation approach is similar to the current \nmeasurement model used for general insurance. \nThe measurement model requirements are applied at an aggregated level rather than at an individual contract level. Contracts are \ninitially aggregated into portfolios (comprised of contracts subject to similar risks that are managed together) and then divided into \ngroups based on the expected profitability of contracts and the periods in which the contracts are written. Contracts may not be \ngrouped if they are written more than 12 months apart. Under the level of aggregation requirements, the identification and measurement \nof contracts that are expected to be loss making will be performed at a lower granularity than occurs for the liability adequacy test \nunder current accounting standards, with any loss component recognised on initial recognition of the group of contracts.\n182     Annual Report 2021-22\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\nINTRODUCTION"

      "text": "Based on the current insurance business, the Group expects to be eligible to use the premium allocation approach for all its general \ninsurance contracts and to be required to use all measurement models across its life insurance contracts. Applying the AASB 17 \nmeasurement models:\n\t\n—\nInsurance contracts issued to policyholders and reinsurance contracts held are measured separately.\n\t\n—\nDiscount rates are required to reflect the time value of money, the characteristics of the cash flows and the liquidity characteristics \nof the insurance contracts. This differs from the risk-free discount rates used under current accounting standards. The Group \nis currently developing and testing its framework and models to determine discount rates and expects to apply the bottom-up \napproach, whereby a risk-free yield curve is adjusted to reflect the liquidity characteristics of the insurance cash flows through the \naddition of an illiquidity premium. The Group expects to present the financial impacts of discounting in the profit or loss, rather than \ndisaggregate the impact between profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\n\t\n—\nThe risk adjustment reflects the compensation an entity requires for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the \ncash flows that arise from non-financial risks as the entity fulfills insurance contracts. This differs from the risk margin used under \nAASB 1023 which reflects the inherent uncertainty in the central estimate of estimated future cash flows, and AASB 1038 does not \nrequire the inclusion of an explicit risk margin in the measurement of policy liabilities. The Group is currently developing and testing \nits framework and models for determining the risk adjustment and expects to use a confidence level approach.\n\t\n—\nAcquisition costs that form part of the fulfilment cash flows of groups of insurance contracts measured using the premium allocation \napproach can either be immediately expensed or included within the insurance contract balance and amortised over the coverage \nperiod. For general insurance contracts applying the premium allocation approach, the Group expects to amortise acquisition costs \nover the coverage period. The Group is yet to finalise its assessment of the policy options for life insurance contracts applying the \npremium allocation approach.\nAASB 17 also introduces significant changes to the presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts which include:\n\t\n—\nThe separate disclosure of assets and liabilities related to insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held, replacing \ncurrent balance sheet items such as premiums outstanding, reinsurance and other recoveries, deferred reinsurance assets, deferred \nacquisition costs, amounts due to reinsurers, unearned premium liabilities and outstanding claims liabilities. \n\t\n—\nThe presentation of insurance revenue and insurance service expense gross of reinsurance. Insurance service expense includes \nclaims expenses, non-reinsurance recoveries and expenses that are directly attributable to the fulfilment of insurance contracts. The \nreinsurance result is disclosed separately and is included in the insurance service result. The financial impact of changes to discount \nrates and the unwinding of the discounting of insurance and reinsurance assets and liabilities will be presented as part of the \ninvestment result rather than the insurance service result. \n\t\n—\nAdditional disclosures to provide information on amounts recognised for insurance contracts and the nature and extent of risk \narising from insurance contracts.\nAASB 17 is to be applied retrospectively to all insurance contracts on the transition date unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case \na modified retrospective or fair value approach may be applied. The Group expects to use the full retrospective approach for general \ninsurance contracts and is currently performing an assessment on the transition approach for life insurance contracts.\nThe Group has established a project team to assess and implement the requirements of AASB 17. A detailed business impact assessment \nof the standard has been completed, and the Group is progressing with implementation and testing of changes to finance systems and \nprocesses and actuarial modelling. \nThe AASB 17 requirements are complex and global interpretation of these requirements is evolving. Regulators are considering their \nresponse to the new standard which is likely to result in changes to the capital and reporting prudential standards and tax legislation \nor guidance. The Group continues to closely monitor all these developments and to assess the impacts of the standard and other \nregulations on the Group. The financial impact of adopting AASB 17 is not reasonably estimable at the date of this report.\n37.\t\nSubsequent events\nFollowing a comprehensive strategic review, the Group announced on 18 July 2022 it has signed a share sale and purchase agreement \nwith Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited to sell its banking business (the Bank) for a cash consideration of approximately \n$4.9 billion (the transaction). As a part of the transaction, the Group has entered into a Brand Licence Agreement with ANZ to license the \nSuncorp brand for the banking business for a period of five years, with an option to extend for a further two years, and a Transitional \nServices Agreement will be in place for a period of two to three years post completion of the sale.\nThe sale is expected to be completed approximately 12 months after signing of the SPA, and until then Suncorp Group will continue to \nown the Bank. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals from the Federal Treasurer and the Australian Competition and Consumer \nCommission, and both Suncorp Group and ANZ will engage with the Queensland Government in relation to the State Financial \nInstitutions and Metway Merger Act 1996 (Qld).\nThere has not arisen in the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this report any item, transaction or event of a \nmaterial and unusual nature likely, in the opinion of the directors of the Company, to affect significantly the operations of the Group, \nthe results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Company in future financial years.\nAnnual Report 2021-22     183\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022\nREMUNERATION REPORT\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS"

This includes assessing \nkey assumptions such as average claim size, \nfuture wage and superimposed inflation and \nrisk margins applied. Examples include claims \nrelating to Compulsory Third Party (CTP) and \nWorkers’ Compensation. \nValuation of reinsurance and other recoveries \ninvolves a high degree of judgement due to the \nimplicit dependence on the estimate of gross \noutstanding claims and the complexity of \nsignificant contracts (such as coverage for natural \nhazards and catastrophes). \nAs the auditor, challenging the Group’s estimation \nprocess requires deep understanding of the \nindustry and specialist actuarial knowledge. \nWorking with our actuarial specialists, our procedures \nincluded: \n• \nassessing the appropriateness of the Group’s selection \nof actuarial methods against the requirements of the \naccounting standards, actuarial standards and the \nmethods applied in the prior periods and industry. \n• \ntesting key controls in relation to the claim payments \nand case estimates processes.

AASB 9 Financial \nInstruments (AASB 9) requires significant \njudgement to estimate expected credit losses. \nAASB 9 requires the Group to measure ECLs on a \nforward-looking basis reflecting a range of \nassumptions affecting the performance of loans \nand advances, including factors relevant to the \ncircumstances of individual exposures and forward \nlooking macro-economic conditions, including key \nforward-looking assumptions such as forecast \nReal-Gross Domestic Product (GDP), residential \nhouse price index and unemployment levels. \nAt 30 June 2022, economic uncertainty remains \nheightened. Given the range of potential economic \noutcomes and impacts, significant judgement \ncontinues to be exercised by the Group in \ndeveloping forward-looking macro-economic \nscenarios to estimate future credit losses.

This focuses on estimating \nwhen an impairment event has occurred and the \npresent value of expected future cash flows, \nwhich have high estimation uncertainty. We \nfocused on the high degree of estimation \nuncertainty related to the business and \nagribusiness loans as the forecast cash flows are \ndependent on future and uncertain events, for \nexample, the timing and proceeds from the future \nsale of collateral.  \nThese features resulted in significant audit effort \nto address the risks around loan recoverability and \nOur procedures for the ECL provisions for loans and \nadvances held at amortised cost and disclosures included: \nTesting key controls relating to: \n• \nreconciliation of relevant data used in the ECL model \nand specific provisioning assessments to source \nsystems; \n• \nthe onboarding of new lending facilities, including \nquality assurance over key loan information (such as \nborrower type and security details) used in the \nmeasurement of ECL allowances;  \n• \nassessment of the credit quality of business lending \ncounterparties;   \n• \nfor retail loans, testing controls over the systems \nwhich record lending arrears; \n• \nthe Group’s monitoring mechanisms to identify loans \nexperiencing signs of stress, including a Significant \nIncrease in Credit Risk (SICR) or default event; \n• \nthe Group’s ECL model governance and validation \nprocesses; and \n• \nthe Group’s assessment and approval of the ECL \nestimate, application of forward-looking \nmacroeconomic assumptions and post-model \nadjustments. \nIn addition to controls testing, our procedures included: \n• \ntesting the completeness and accuracy of a sample of \ncritical data elements used within ECL models, such as \nchecking year end balances, repayment history and risk \nratings to source systems; \n• \nworking with our credit risk specialists, we assessed \nthe results of model monitoring processes performed \nover key ECL models.

KPMG IT \nspecialists were used throughout the engagement \nas a core part of our audit team. \nWorking with our IT specialists, we tested key automated \ncontrols and the control environments that support the \nconsistent operation of these. The in-scope systems were \nassessed at both an entity level and process level with \nrespect to the controls that were identified as relevant to \nfinancial reporting. \nOur procedures included: \n• \ntesting controls that support the governance of access \nrights given to employees, contractors and privileged \nusers by checking them to approved records, and \ninspecting the reports regarding the granting and \nremoval of access rights. We also tested controls \nrelated to monitoring of access rights. \n• \ntesting controls used to request, document, develop, \ntest and authorise changes to the functionality and \nconfiguration of core systems relevant to in-scope \nautomated controls. We also tested controls related to \nthe appropriateness of users with access to request, \nauthorise, and release changes into the production \nenvironment of core systems relevant to financial \nreporting. \n• \ntesting the operating effectiveness of automated \ncontrols key to our audit testing in relation to system \ncalculations, the generation of reports, and operation of \nsystem enforced access controls. \nWhere we noted design or operating effectiveness matters \nrelating to IT system or application controls relevant to our \naudit, we performed alternative audit procedures. We also \nidentified and tested mitigating controls in order to respond \nto the impact on our overall audit approach. \n \n \n \n \nREMUNERATION REPORT\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS"

The Directors are responsible for the Other \nInformation.  \nOur opinion on the Financial Report does not cover the Other Information and, accordingly, we do not express an \naudit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and \nour related assurance opinion. \nIn connection with our audit of the Financial Report, our responsibility is to read the Other Information. In doing \nso, we consider whether the Other Information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Report or our \nknowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. \nWe are required to report if we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this Other Information, and \nbased on the work we have performed on the Other Information that we obtained prior to the date of this \nAuditor’s Report we have nothing to report. \nResponsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report \nThe Directors are responsible for: \n• \npreparing the Financial Report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting \nStandards and the Corporations Act 2001; \n• \nimplementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a Financial Report that gives a true and \nfair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and \n• \nassessing the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and whether the use of the going \nconcern basis of accounting is appropriate. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going \nconcern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group and \nCompany or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. \nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report \nOur objective is: \n• \nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Report as a whole is free from material \nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and  \n• \nto issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion.  \nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance \nwith Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. \nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they \ncould reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Financial \nReport. \nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report is located at the Auditing and \nAssurance Standards Board website at: https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1_2020.pdf.
