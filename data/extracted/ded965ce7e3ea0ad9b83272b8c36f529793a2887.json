This underlines both the \nresilience of our business model as well as the ability, commitment \nand dedication shown across all levels of the business. \nI would like to thank my Board colleagues, the Executive Management \nand the wider team, together with our advisers, who have worked \ntirelessly to deliver these excellent financial, operational and strategic \nresults against a challenging backdrop. Their efforts have been the \nfoundation of our success this year. \n \nStrong progress from all corners of the business\nPlaytech made significant progress throughout 2022 across \nboth the B2B and B2C businesses, further diversifying its \nportfolio and positioning the Group to capitalise on the \nexciting opportunities ahead:\n•\t In the US, Playtech expanded its footprint with Parx, launching its \nIMS platform in Pennsylvania. In early 2023, Playtech also signed \na landmark agreement with Hard Rock Digital that accelerates our \nUS strategy and provides significant growth opportunities globally.\n•\t Good progress was made in Canada, with Playtech signing an \nagreement with NorthStar to launch a broad suite of products in \nthis newly regulated market, along with taking an equity investment \nin NorthStar in early 2023, incorporating elements of the strategic \nagreement model employed successfully in other markets. \n•\t In Latin America, Playtech’s presence continues to go from strength \nto strength, with existing agreements in Mexico and Colombia \nseeing excellent growth in the period. Playtech is ideally positioned \nto benefit from growth in the soon to be regulated Brazil market. \nPlaytech opened a new Live Casino facility in Peru as it continues \nto expand its presence across the region. \n•\t Snaitech has continued to exceed expectations with the online \nsegment proving resilient despite the reopening of retail sites, while \nit also maintained its number one position by brand across retail \nand online sports betting in Italy. Fabio Schiavolin, CEO of Snaitech, \ndiscussed the opportunity for the business at an investor event \nhosted in September 2022. \nMore details can be found on pages 19 and 22 for B2B and B2C \nbusinesses, respectively.\nCorporate activity\nThe impressive performance delivered in 2022 is all the more notable \ngiven the intensity of the corporate activity that Playtech has been \ninvolved in. Taken together, this activity shone a spotlight on the \nquality of Playtech’s strategy, operations, technology and people, \nwhose commitment and expertise continue to drive Playtech from \nstrength to strength. \nOffer and further approach for Playtech\nIn October 2021, the Board recommended an all-cash offer from \nAristocrat at a 58% premium to the prevailing share price. Ultimately, \nat the Court and General Meetings held on 2 February 2022, \nAristocrat’s proposal did not achieve the requisite 75% level of \nshareholder approval needed for its offer to progress. \nShortly after Aristocrat’s proposal lapsed, Playtech received an approach \nby an investor group formed and advised by TTB Partners Limited. On \n14 July 2022, TTB Partners advised that it did not intend to make an \noffer for the Company due to challenging underlying market conditions. \n6\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report\nBrian Mattingley\nChairman"

After five years as Chief \nFinancial Officer (CFO), Andrew Smith stepped down from the Board \nin November 2022. Andrew contributed significantly to Playtech’s \nstrategy and helped guide the business through a period of substantial \ntransformation. We wish him all the best in his future endeavours.\nIt’s a testament to the succession planning work of the Nominations \nCommittee and the Board that we’ve had such a seamless transition \nwith Chris McGinnis becoming our new CFO. Chris has done a superb \njob as Deputy CFO and Director of Investor Relations, and I believe that \nhis deep knowledge of Playtech will be invaluable in the years ahead. \nSince the start of the new year, we have also welcomed Samy Reeb \nto the Board as a Non-executive Director. We are already reaping the \nbenefits of his broad skillset and extensive experience of working with \nglobal businesses.\nOne of my highest priorities when joining Playtech was to address the \nbalance of the Board. While we have made good progress towards \nimproving the Board’s gender diversity, there is still work to be done \nand we are actively focused on taking further steps towards meeting \nour ambition of having a more diverse Board.\nSustainability\nFollowing an intense period of corporate activity last year, we enter \n2023 with a renewed focus on issues around the environment, \nsustainability, and our wider contribution to communities and \nsociety. Our Sustainable Success strategy is central to this and sets \nout an ambitious plan for how we intend to bring the principles of \nsustainability and responsible business into everything we do. \nDespite the competing priorities of a busy year, our newly formed \nSustainability and Public Policy Board Committee met regularly to \nreview, monitor and advise on Playtech’s sustainability, responsible \nbusiness and public policy matters. The Committee also ensures the \ncontinued effectiveness of Playtech’s ESG strategy, ensuring that \nwe remain truly forward looking and progressive in our plans.\nUkraine/people\nThe backdrop of the war in Ukraine has put a significant strain on our \npeople and on the communities in which we operate. While we took quick \nand decisive action to minimise disruption to our business, we are mindful \nthat our colleagues and their families who remain in Ukraine continue to \nface very real and dangerous challenges every day as the war continues. \nI’m proud of the response from our people who have maintained contact \nwith those colleagues in Ukraine, assisted with relocation efforts and \nprovided emergency supplies. We remain committed to doing everything \nwe can to ensure their safety during these difficult times. \nOur people are our greatest asset and I want to thank everyone for \ntheir hard work in helping us to navigate the challenges of the past \nyear and deliver such a strong set of results. \nLooking forward\nWhilst we anticipate many of the challenges faced last year to continue \ninto 2023, I am confident that Playtech’s clear and proven strategy across \nboth the B2B and B2C divisions positions us well to build on our progress \nand deliver another outstanding performance in the year ahead. \nBrian Mattingley\nChairman\n23 March 2023\nRemembering Alan Jackson \nIt is with great sadness that we lost a dear friend and a \nmember of the Playtech family – Alan Jackson. Alan was \nappointed to Playtech’s Board as a Non-executive Director \nduring Playtech’s IPO in 2006 and became Chairman in \nOctober 2013, serving a total of 14 years on the Playtech \nBoard. Alan built an extraordinary and distinguished career \nin business and Playtech was fortunate to have benefited \nfrom his leadership, dedication, support, kindness and \nenthusiasm. We are grateful for Alan’s contributions, which \nwere instrumental in making Playtech the company it is today. \nWe will all miss Alan dearly – may he rest in peace. \n“\t\u0007I am delighted to report another \nhighly successful year for Playtech \nwhere we delivered strong growth \nand made significant progress \nagainst our strategy despite \na challenging economic and \ngeopolitical backdrop.”\n7\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

We aim to be the \npartner of choice for operators in newly \nregulating markets, with a particular focus \non the Americas and Europe. \nThe US represents a huge revenue \nopportunity of $3 billion for Playtech on a per \nannum basis across iGaming, online sports \nand platform (see page 25). \nThe LatAm region has strong structural \ndrivers (see page 26). With Caliente providing \nthe blueprint for success in this region, \nPlaytech is ideally positioned to deliver \nstrong growth via its structured agreements \nin multiple countries, including Brazil. \nFinally, there continues to be strong potential \nin European markets that are either regulating \nor underpenetrated online where Playtech \ncan bring the strength of its offerings to bear \nsuch as the Netherlands and Spain. \nLink to KPIs\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nLink to risks\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nLive represents an enormous opportunity \n(see page 29), in which Playtech has invested \nheavily. Ten studios are currently operational \nwith a further one in Pennsylvania under \nconstruction. We have more than doubled \nthe number of tables over the past four years \nand invested in both the latest cutting-edge \ntechnology and branded gaming rights \nsuch as Jumanji™. With significant operating \nleverage in the business, growth in Live is \nmargin accretive.\nThe SaaS business model (see page 31) \nallows Playtech to serve those operators \nlooking for Playtech’s content without the \nplatform, thus increasing the Company’s \ntotal addressable market. With investments \nalready made in building out infrastructure, \nsuch as data centres, SaaS is a high-margin \nsegment. Although SaaS revenues have \nbeen growing strongly, revenue from each \noperator represents a small proportion \nof their wallet. Thus, we see ample scope \nto increase wallet share amongst these \nexisting customers.\nLink to KPIs\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nLink to risks\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nWith exciting areas of growth in regulated \nmarkets and several technology trends (see \ntechnology trends on page 28) maturing at \nthe same time, there is a need to continue to \ninvest in the B2B Gambling division to ensure \nPlaytech maintains and grows its market \nshare lead.

Looking further ahead, \nPlaytech is well-positioned to continue its growth and capitalise on \nother strategic agreements in Latin America in the years ahead. \nPlaytech also opened a new Live Casino facility in Peru, giving \nthe Company a strong base from which to serve both its existing \nclients in Latin America and prospective clients in newly regulated \nmarkets in the region. Several customers, such as Wplay, Bet365 and \nBetVictor, have launched tables in the new Live facility with demand \nproving strong so far. Given the success of legislation in markets like \nColombia, Playtech anticipates continued favourable regulation and \nstrong growth in the region in the years to come. \nOne example of this is in Brazil, where sports betting legislation \nhas been passed and is expected to be implemented in the near \nfuture. Brazil is anticipated to be a significant market given the large \npopulation and love of sports. The Company has an exciting strategic \nagreement in place with Galerabet, with economics similar to its \nother arrangements in Latin America, in anticipation of regulation in \nthis market. \nEurope ex-UK\n2022 B2B revenue growth in Europe ex-UK of 31% (+31% at constant \ncurrency) was driven by strong growth across several countries, \nincluding Netherlands, Spain, Poland and Ireland.\nThe move towards greater regulation in Europe continues to \nrepresent significant growth opportunities. The first full year of \nPlaytech’s new, expanded long-term strategic software and services \nagreement with Holland Casino has seen an impressive start. \nPlaytech now supplies Holland Casino with a full turnkey multi-\nchannel technology package, as well as certain ancillary services. \nThe agreement includes the IMS platform, Sports betting, Online \nCasino, Live Casino, Poker and Bingo products, plus selected \noperational and marketing services. While growth rates moderated \nas the year went on, the partnership is continuing to see the benefits \nof its first mover advantage. It was a key driver of revenue growth in \nEurope in 2022, illustrating the significant growth opportunities of \nnewly regulated markets. This agreement, as well as the launch of \nCasino and Poker with Bet365 and Unibet in the Netherlands in 2022, \nmeans Playtech is well positioned to capitalise on the newly regulated \nNetherlands market. \nElsewhere in Europe, the Company invested in its physical \ninfrastructure by expanding its Live facility in Romania. The facility \nnow also includes Blackjack and Poker studios, enabling Playtech \nto serve its customers with an even wider and more diverse suite of \nproducts. In terms of new customers, the Live business launched with, \namong others, Betsson in Italy and Pokerstars in Greece. \nPlaytech’s Casino business made great progress opening up new \nterritories with its existing customer base, such as Pokerstars and \nBetsson in Greece, Leo Vegas in Spain, Betway and 888 in Italy, \nStoiximan in The Czech Republic, Betano in Bulgaria and Fortuna \nin Slovakia. This clearly demonstrates the scalability of Playtech’s \nbusiness model. \n20 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "UK \nThe UK saw revenue decline 4% (-5% on a constant currency basis) \ncompared to FY 2021, where the positive impact of the reopening of \nretail stores from mid-April 2021 was more than offset by a decline in \nrevenue from Entain in addition to a slowdown in the online business \ncaused by the uncertain regulatory climate. \nThe UK Government is currently undertaking a review into existing \ngambling laws in the UK. In response, several operators are taking \npre-emptive measures such as stake limits and affordability checks in \nan attempt to show regulators that the industry is able to self-regulate. \nIn December 2020, the UK Government announced a call for \nevidence to review the existing gambling laws in the UK. Since the \ninitial 16-week call for evidence, which ended on 31 March 2021, the \nGovernment has been assessing the evidence presented, alongside \nother data, with the aim of setting out conclusions and any proposals \nfor reform in a White Paper. Playtech submitted data and evidence \nrelating to the call and will support this wherever possible going \nforward. The White Paper was due to be published in 2022, but \nthis has been delayed with media reports suggesting it is due to be \npublished imminently. \nPlaytech remains committed to the UK market and will actively \nsupport its customers in implementing any necessary changes \nfollowing the White Paper’s expected publication. Playtech has been \nactively involved in discussions around safer game design and online \nadvertising for some time. By using its technology and data to support \nits licensees in safer gambling, the Company is confident that it will \nremain the go-to platform for regulated markets including the UK.\nOther unregulated (excl. Asia)\nThe Group’s strategy to focus on both regulated and regulating \nmarkets includes unregulated markets which are expected to \nregulate in the near future. These are classified in the “Unregulated \nexcl. Asia” line within B2B Gambling. These unregulated markets \n(excluding Asia) were up 11% year on year (+10% at constant currency) \nversus 2021, primarily driven by very strong growth in Brazil, offset \nin part by a decline in Germany, which saw regulatory changes, and \nNetherlands moving to a regulated market in 2021. \nIn Canada, recent legislation means that single-game sports betting \nis now allowed at the discretion of individual provinces. Seven \nprovinces, including the country’s largest province, Ontario, began \nallowing bets to be placed on single-game sporting events. Since \nthen, as of 4 April 2022, Ontario has become the first fully regulated \nonline gambling market in Canada, with iGaming launched as well. \nAs other provinces across Canada introduce sports betting and \niGaming, the market opportunity in North America will continue to \ngrow. In line with the Company’s strategy to target newly regulating \nmarkets, Playtech signed a strategic agreement with NorthStar \nGaming in January 2022. \nThe Company also took steps to establish its presence in South \nAfrica, a nascent but fast-growing market, which permits sports \nbetting and Live casino. Towards the end of 2022, Playtech \nlaunched Casino and Live products with TsogoSun.\nUnregulated Asia\nRevenue from the Unregulated Asia business declined 18% (-21% \non a constant currency basis) compared to 2021. The decline was \nlargely the result of further lockdowns in China during the year. As it \nstands today, the Asia business is much more diversified in terms of \nboth distributors as well as geographies compared to recent years. \nThe Company incurred a bad debt provision of €15.4 million in H1 22 \nfollowing continued collection delays in the region. \nB2B – Product Developments \nPlaytech remains committed to diversifying its B2B Gambling \ndivision by bringing on new brands and licensees. As well as making \nprogress with new strategic agreements and joint ventures, Playtech \nalso maintained its track record of attracting new customers in both \nregulated and regulating markets to its SaaS offering. Playtech \nlaunched over 100 brands in the period, with more than 350 now live \nsince the launch of its SaaS model in 2019. \nIn August 2022, Playtech launched The Walking Dead™ 2, taking \nadvantage of the exclusive rights it acquired for Online Casino in \n2021. A second title is planned to launch in 2023, with both expected \nto engage and retain a large audience. Alongside partnerships \nwith major licensed brands, Playtech’s Casino content strategy \ncontinues to focus on the development of original brand suites, \nknown as Playtech power suites, with the likes of Age of the Gods™ \nand Fire Blaze™ producing some of Playtech’s most popular slots. \nLeprechaun’s Luck became Playtech’s top-performing new game \nof 2022 and was shortlisted for Game of the Year in the 2022 \nEGR awards.\nIn terms of other notable product developments, the Live team \nlaunched Safari Riches Live, a live casino slot game created \nexclusively for 888. This marks a major milestone as it represents the \nfirst time a slot brand developed by 888 has been transformed into \na bespoke live casino game. Elsewhere, the Live team also signed \nup the exclusive global rights to Jumanji, including for the US, and \nplans to launch a game in 2023. Other highlights include Everybody’s \nJackpot and The Greatest Cards Show, which have both broken new \nground technologically. Everybody’s Jackpot features first of its kind \n“Unreal engine” metaverse technology, while The Greatest Cards \nShow’s augmented reality and horizontal wheel – a Live sector first – \nmakes it one of Playtech’s most sophisticated games yet.\n21\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

This exceptional performance was \nprimarily driven by the reopening of retail sites in Italy, which occurred \nat the end of June 2021 and have since remained open.\nAs a result, retail sales grew significantly in the period and are within \n10% of pre-pandemic levels. This is a good performance given a \nsmall proportion of franchise retail shops closed permanently, some \ncustomers permanently transitioned to the online channel and new \nlegislation – introduced in January 2020 – that requires customers \nto present ID card to enter retail shops. At the EBITDA level, the \nretail segment has now surpassed 2019 pre-pandemic levels on an \nabsolute basis, while EBITDA margins are also higher than 2019 levels \ndriven by an increasing proportion of revenue generated from the \nhigher margin sports betting segment and a lower retail sports pay out \nin 2022 compared to 2019. \nThe online business grew 2% in 2022 versus 2021 despite retail \nshops being reopened in June 2021, suggesting a combination of a \nproportion of existing retail customers permanently shifting to online \nin conjunction with new customers being onboarded via the online \nchannel.

Those countries that become newly regulated tend to see strong growth early on, \nwhich is why it is crucial for operators and technology partners to build a presence in a country that is about to be regulated or is newly regulated. \nHowever, growth typically slows down after a certain period. This tends to be driven by three main factors. Firstly, there is increased competition \nas new players enter the market, causing pricing pressure. Secondly, as markets mature, they become saturated due to limited demographic \ngrowth. Thirdly, regulation typically becomes more stringent over time. For example, in the mature UK market, we have seen a tightening of \nrules on age and identity checks and a ban on gambling using credit cards.\nDeviations from the broad shape of the curve are mainly attributable to the stringency of regulations in a country. For example, Spain has \nimplemented strict restrictions on advertising for the gambling sector.\nAt this point in time, we are in an advantageous position in multiple countries across the world which are moving towards regulating gambling \nor have newly regulated the sector.

This is driven by two major trends: \n•\t Firstly, there is a shift to online from \nretail as the world digitises and this \nhas accelerated due to the pandemic.\n•\t Secondly, within online, there is a growing \ntrend away from random number generation \n(RNG) towards Live, as players want more \nof an interactive, immersive experience. \nWith the imminent launch of VR by tech \ncompanies such as Apple, we expect this \nshift to accelerate. \nThe combination of these drivers means \nindustry analysts predict the Live market \nto reach $18 billion based on GGR by 2025, \nup from $6.9 billion in 2021, a CAGR of 28%.\nImpact on industry/Playtech \nPlaytech has already made significant \ninvestments to capitalise on this attractive \nproduct vertical: \n•\t Ten studios are currently operational \nwith a further one in Pennsylvania under \nconstruction. The latest one to open is in \nPeru which was launched earlier this year \nand will help us to support growth within the \nattractive LatAm region, particularly Brazil.\n•\t The number of tables has more than \ndoubled over the past four years.\n•\t Significant investment has been made \nto ensure we have the latest cutting-edge \ntechnology and access to branded \ngaming rights such as Jumanji™.\nThese investments have already been \nmade, and the nature of the Live business \nmodel is such that additional players can be \nadded to tables at minimal cost. This creates  \nsignificant operating leverage and leads to \nLive being margin accretive to the overall \nB2B division.\nLink to strategy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nUnderpenetrated online \nmarkets in Europe\nOverview \nThe pandemic accelerated the shift towards \nonline gambling as retail shops were closed \nduring lockdown and customers, with plenty \nof time to pass, played online. We await to see \nhow structural this shift is over the coming year. \nHowever, early indications suggest the migration \nto online has remained sticky post pandemic, with \nall major countries in the EU seeing at least a seven \npercentage point rise in online penetration from \nprior to the pandemic in 2019 compared to 2022. \nThere is ample scope for the migration to online \nto continue. Looking to the UK as an example \nof a mature market, online penetration in 2022 \nwas just under 60%, far in excess of Spain, Italy \nand Germany. \nImpact on industry/Playtech \nWithin the B2C division, Playtech is very \nwell placed to continue to benefit from an \nunderpenetrated online market in Europe. In \nItaly, Snaitech gives Playtech exposure to a \nlarge market where online penetration remains \nat 26%, far below the UK at 58%. In addition, \nthe online business is higher margin and less \ncapital intensive, meaning it generates higher \nreturns. Aside from Italy, Playtech is also well \nplaced in Germany with HAPPYBET, which \npossesses one of the few available online \nsports betting licences in Germany. \nWithin the B2B division, Playtech has a \nstrong presence in Spain across Live, Casino \nand Sports, and is well positioned to take \nadvantage of the continued shift to online.\nSeveral large European countries \nhave an underpenetrated \nonline market \nOnline penetration as % of GGR\n \n 2019 \n 2022\nSource: H2GC (includes betting and gaming and \nexcludes lotteries).\n58\nUK\nFrance\nSpain\n30\n28\n55\n41\n23\nItaly\n26\n15\nGermany\n25\n15\nLink to strategy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nSports \nOverview\nAs the market shifts to online, the Sports \nsegment is impacted by multiple trends:\n•\t convergence of sports betting, media \nstreaming and social;\n•\t emerging markets shifting \ntowards embedded betting within \nstreaming services;\n•\t shift to in-play betting with the types \nof bets becoming more granular; and\n•\t more and more data sources being used \nto come up with sports betting odds such \nas fitness of players.\nImpact on industry/Playtech \n•\t Our Sports offering is targeted at those \nareas where we see strategic benefits. \nOne such region is LatAm, where many of \nthe countries enjoy a rich sporting culture \nand we have made good progress in \nMexico, Colombia and Panama.\n•\t Our Betbuilder product, now available for \nfootball with other sports to follow, will be a \nfocus of our Sports offering given the trend \nof shifting towards offering more granular \ntypes of bets.\nLink to strategy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n4) Shift to online continues, accelerated by the pandemic\n29\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

We continue to provide \nessential support to our colleagues as well as humanitarian \nsupport to communities across the country.\nStrengthening governance\nAlongside the CEO and executive team, the Committee \nmembers have actively engaged with the external \nStakeholder Advisory Panel. This engagement has been \ninstrumental in helping us challenge ourselves to continuously \nimprove our strategy and consider future trends and \ndevelopments as well as understand how other companies \nacross sectors are tackling environmental, social and \ngovernance considerations. During the year, the Company \nalso appointed a new Chief Sustainability and Corporate \nAffairs Officer, who is a member of the Company’s Executive \nManagement Committee. \nEnhancing our safer gambling technology \noffering and partnerships\nThrough our Playtech Protect division, we continued \nto enhance the technology and service offering for our \nlicensees, expand our research portfolio and our partnerships \nto empower our licensees to enhance player protection \nmeasures and raise industry standards. \nTaking action to tackle climate change\nThe Company recognises that urgent action is required to \nsubstantially reduce the risks and impacts of climate change \nand, therefore, made a formal commitment to set near-term \nand net zero science-based targets through the Science \nBased Targets initiative (SBTi). 2022 also saw the Company \nmake significant progress in shifting to renewable energy \nacross the Group’s assets. \nAdvancing equality and inclusion\nThe Group has set out an ambition for equality in the \nworkplace and has begun to make progress on gender \ndiversity within its leadership population. In addition, we \nhave taken action to embed diversity as part of leadership \ndevelopment and succession planning. \nAs we look to 2023 and beyond, our priorities will be to \ncontinue to deliver against our commitments whilst also \nfocusing on how we can embed sustainability into our culture, \ndecision making and performance management.\nAs a Non-executive Board member and Chair of the Board’s \nSustainability and Public Policy Committee, I am delighted to share the \nprogress and highlights of our sustainability performance for 2022. \nThis was the first full year that the Committee has been operational \nand it held six meetings to review and monitor progress and challenge \nthe business to accelerate action across safer gambling, diversity \nand inclusion, climate change, procurement and human rights. These \nsessions enabled the Committee to better understand areas of \nprogress and the challenges ahead. The outcome of our meetings \nincluded an endorsement of strategies to leverage technology to \nadvance safer gambling solutions, combat climate change, contribute \nto a more inclusive business culture and support communities and \nour workforce. The Committee is also working with the Remuneration \nCommittee and Executive Management to link ESG performance \nto remuneration for Executives and selected leaders. Additionally, \nthe Committees are working with Executive Management to develop \na framework for embedding sustainability into performance \nmanagement across the Group. \nLinda Marston-Weston\nChair of the Sustainability and \nPublic Policy Committee\n23 March 2023\n48 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "Sustainability governance and oversight\nPlaytech officially formed its Sustainability and Public Policy Board \nCommittee in 2021. Since then, the Committee has played an \nimportant role in reviewing the implementation of the sustainability \nstrategy, recommending enhancements on measuring progress, \nsetting achievable targets and reviewing implementation and actions \nto meet the Company’s commitments. The Committee also oversees \nthe Company’s key non-financial commitments, strategy, targets and \nreporting from Board level.\nThe day-to-day responsibility for sustainability governance sits \nwithin the Sustainability and Corporate Affairs function. In practice, \nthis function co-ordinates action, provides subject matter expertise, \ndelivers support to other relevant functions, business units and \ncountry management, manages and tracks performance, and leads \nengagement and partnerships with external stakeholders. The team is \nworking closely with the Regulatory Affairs and Compliance function \nto align and integrate compliance and regulatory considerations into \nplanning and decision making.\nThe Group’s governance processes are supported by the Internal \nAudit and Risk function, providing assurance to the Board and \nExecutive Management team that effective systems and controls \nare in place to manage significant risks within the business. The \nRegulatory Affairs and Compliance function is subject to recurring \nannual reviews, the scope of which is dynamic and varies from year \nto year. Internal Audit also ensures that compliance-related areas are \nintegrated into other operational audits, as and when applicable, and \nscrutinises the processes and data used to populate KPIs.\nThe Regulatory Affairs and Compliance function continued to lead the \nCompliance Council and other internal governance forums. The key \nobjectives are to:\n•\t inform Playtech’s product teams, business units and projects of \ncurrent and evolving regulatory affairs and compliance topics;\n•\t review and assess the impact of regulatory and compliance \ndevelopments;\n•\t proactively engage on opportunities and shape debates on \nregulatory affairs;\n•\t discuss and co-ordinate regulatory and compliance positions; and\n•\t share information and raise awareness of progress, challenges \nand/or resource concerns that may impact Playtech’s compliance \nand regulatory position.\nAction and accountability\nIn response to the evolving expectations regarding Board and \nexecutive accountability on environmental, social and governance \nperformance, the Board has agreed to link executive remuneration \nto year-on-year progress against the Company’s 2025 sustainability \ncommitments, effective from 2022 with an expansion to Executive \nManagement Committee and selected senior leaders in 2023. The \nKPIs used to assess year-on-year performance cover safer gambling, \ndiversity and inclusion and climate change.\nDuring the year, the Board endorsed the Company’s commitment to \nset near-term and net zero targets in line with climate science with the \nScience Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The Company is developing \nits roadmap and transition plan to meet these targets. During 2022, \nthe Board and members of the Executive Management have also \nparticipated in climate change training.\nThe Board Sustainability and Public Policy Committee reviewed, \napproved and monitor the Company’s diversity, equity and inclusion \nstrategy, including targets to increase female representation in \nleadership roles. In December 2022, the Board approved a new Board \nDiversity Policy outlining its commitment to ensure that diversity is a \nkey factor in the recruitment and succession planning at the Board \nand executive levels.\nStakeholder engagement\nIn 2022, Playtech continued to challenge its approach to sustainability \nand the way we do business through an external Stakeholder \nAdvisory Panel. The Panel was established in 2021 to help inform and \nadvance the strategy and raise standards for responsible business \npractices within the gaming and betting sector. The Stakeholder \nAdvisory Panel has brought together external subject matter experts \nand senior internal decision makers, including the Company’s CEO \nand other relevant senior leaders. This forum complements Playtech’s \nexisting and regular stakeholder engagement mechanism. The Panel \ndiscussed the Company’s approach to safer gambling, diversity, \nequity and inclusion as well as climate change. During the course of \n2022, the Panel’s insight, engagement and challenges provided an \ninvaluable perspective to help Playtech accelerate and mature its \napproach going forward.\nKey themes raised during the sessions included recommendations \nfor embedding sustainability into the Company’s purpose and \nambition, clarifying the business case for change and action, \nharnessing employee engagement and insight, and leveraging \nthe Company’s role as a catalyst for greater collaboration in \nthe sector. Detailed summaries of the Panel meetings and \nthe actions that Playtech is taking forward can be found at \nwww.playtech.com/sustainable-success.\nIn 2023, Playtech intends to continue with a formalised external \nengagement panel as part of its continued efforts to evolve and \ninform its future sustainability strategy.\n49\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "Issues that matter to Playtech and society\nThe Company recognises that standards, requirements and \nexpectations about the role of business in tackling environmental, \nsocial and governance topics continue to evolve. Regularly assessing \nwhich issues are material to the business and industries it operates in \nis essential to successfully test and develop the Group’s responsible \nbusiness strategy and reporting. Playtech defines an issue as \nbeing material if it is considered important by key stakeholders and \ncould have a significant financial impact on the business. As such, \nthe business considers both risks and opportunities as part of the \nmateriality assessments. \nIn 2022, we updated our Group’s materiality assessment by \nconducting a refreshed systematic scan of the priority issues for \nthe betting and gaming and software and services sectors. We \nreviewed the frameworks defined by investors and the wider financial \ncommunity, employees, licensees, gambling charities, regulators and \nthe media in order to conduct this analysis. We then grouped a long \nlist of issues into more meaningful clusters, which were prioritised \nthrough a variety of exercises, including internal interviews.\nThe diagram below provides a visual overview of the material \nconcerns, segmented into strategic, material and emerging issues. \nStrategic issues typically represent challenges that may not be on the \nstakeholders’ radar yet but are instrumental in the Group’s planning \nfor the future. Emerging issues typically represent challenges that are \nrising up on the stakeholders’ radar but are not yet instrumental in the \nGroup’s planning for the future. Four out of the five emerging issues \nare challenges related to the environment, and thus we will monitor \nand explore these within our new pillar, “Powering action for positive \nenvironmental impact”, to assess how we can mitigate these risks \nand reduce our impact on the environment.\nWhile this may break with usual conventions around materiality \nassessments, Playtech is a unique business, spanning both \nthe technology and gambling industry classifications for ESG \nbenchmarks. To that end, the Company has taken into account \nmaterial issues from both sectors in its materiality assessment.\nThe issues identified as being the most material are: \nSafer gambling \nEmbraces areas such as games design and product safety, \nmarketing, investment in research, education and treatment \n(RET), customer engagement, regulation, data analytics \nand the use of AI.\nClimate change \nCovers policies, existing and impending regulations, initiatives \nand performance relating to climate change prevention, mitigation \nand adaptation.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion \nCovers increased representation and inclusivity for various \ngroups, including gender, culture, identity and disability, directly \nlinked to talent attraction, retention, employee engagement, \ntraining and development.\nResponsible advertising and marketing1\nRefers to adopting a socially responsible approach to advertising \nand marketing, such as ensuring that adverts do not exploit the \nsusceptibilities of young or vulnerable people.\nEmployee health and safety\nRelates to looking after the mental and physical health of \nemployees – a concern that has come further to the fore following \nthe pandemic. \nData protection and cybersecurity\nRelates to policy, governance and resourcing as well as \noperational KPIs related to security strategies, data protection \nand security controls, vulnerability monitoring and risk \nassessments and risk management as well as data governance.\nCorporate governance\nRefers to elements of governance that relate to the social and \nenvironmental aspects of sustainability such as Board diversity \nand experience, incentives and remuneration, as well as \nintegration of sustainability into decision making.\nFinancial crime\nFocuses on anti-money laundering (AML), anti-bribery and \ncorruption (ABC), tax evasion and professional integrity.\nHuman rights1\nFocuses on recognising the rights of all people regardless of race, \nsexuality, nationality or any other status.

With its unique reach, \ndata capabilities and investments in safer gambling technologies, we \nhave taken the conscious decision to lead and pioneer technological \nsolutions to help our licensees improve safeguards as part of the \ngambling experience for consumers. A key principle of the Company’s \napproach has been collaboration. Playtech has partnered across its \noperations and externally, with academics, non-profit organisations, \nlicensees and think tanks, to further develop and advance the delivery \nof safer gambling solutions and standards as well as broaden its safer \ngambling product portfolio under Playtech Protect. In 2022, Playtech \ncontinued to integrate safer gambling technology and solutions as a \ncore part of its products and solution offerings to licensees.\nInnovation and development of Playtech Protect – \nPlaytech’s safer gambling offering\nPlaytech Protect was established to offer licensees a wide range of \nresponsible gambling and compliance technology, tools and solutions \nas well as its research partnerships. The solutions are embedded into \nPlaytech’s technology including Playtech’s Information Management \nSolution (IMS) platform and Engagement Centre. \nIn 2022, we saw continued interest and uptake of safer gambling \ntechnology tools and solutions by licensees. With more jurisdictions \nintroducing specific requirements on the use of behavioural analytics \nto detect players at risk, Playtech expects an increase in demand \nfor technology solutions, identifying, engaging and reducing \ngambling‑related risk. During 2022, 13 brands were integrated with the \nPlaytech Protect solution, BetBuddy, compared to 8 brands in 2021.\nBy the end of 2022, Playtech Protect has expanded into three new \njurisdictions, having been adopted by clients in Germany, Portugal \nand Switzerland. During the year, Playtech also continued the \ndevelopment of its offering. The tools have been redeveloped on a \nbetter performing cloud architecture to ensure the Company has the \nbandwidth to scale the offering with operators and support a larger \ncustomer base. Additional improvements include a wider range of \ncustomised reports. To date, it is estimated that over 2 million players \nhave been monitored and risk assessed for responsible gambling \nacross 13 brands. \nCommitments\nPioneering safer gambling solutions has always been a \nvital area for Playtech – and the sector it operates in – and \nwill only become more important in the years ahead as the \nCompany works to:\n•\t Expand the portfolio of safer gambling technology, tools \nand solutions\n•\t Harness investment in R&D to advance the next generation \nof safer solutions\n•\t Strengthen operational safer gambling standards and \ntechnology across our operations\nPerformance measures\n \u0007More information on methodology and KPIs at www.playtech.com\n13\nBrands deployed \nand integrated \nwith BetBuddy\n6\nNumber of \njurisdictions\n11\nCompliance and \nsafer gambling \nSaaS partnerships\nEngagement and \ncollaboration \nwith licensees\nSafer gambling \ncertification\nResearch and \npartnerships\n52\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "Examining player protection \nand responsible gambling \nbehaviours in Latin America\nAs part of Playtech’s aspiration to build greater \nconfidence in the benefits of regulation and find \nsolutions to advance responsible gambling, Playtech \ncommissioned a regional research and insights study in \n2021 to examine player attitudes towards responsible \ngambling. In 2022, Playtech commissioned research \nfor a second year. In a region where many countries \nare discussing online gambling regulation, it is notable \nthat players have a positive view of rules and guidelines \non responsible gambling to help them stay safe. The \nstudy, conducted in collaboration with a third-party \nsurvey company (Toluna), explores the key issues \nrelated to responsible gambling in the region. The study \nsurveyed consumer views on responsible gambling \nacross Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru, and \nexamined aspects of responsible gambling, notably \nplayer preferences when gambling, the acceptance \nof protection messages along the playing journey, \nperceptions of regulation, expectations of operators \nand a view on how players perceive their behaviours.\nIn addition to Playtech’s core offering under Playtech Protect, the \nCompany continues to maintain compliance and safer gambling \nSaaS partnerships which play an important role to support more \nlicensees to compete, grow and thrive in the changing regulatory \nlandscape. These partnerships offer licensees a broader range of \nquality technology solutions as well as making access easier via the \nPlaytech integration. One particular area of focus in mature markets, \nsuch as the UK, is the role that technology solutions can play in \nassessing the affordability of a player. Playtech continued to engage \nwith third-party providers to ensure it is well positioned to support \nlicensees with technology solutions to assess customer affordability \nvoluntarily as well as when regulatory regimes mandate affordability \nchecks. In 2022, Playtech increased its compliance and safer \ngambling SaaS partnerships to 11 from 9 in 2021. These partnerships \nplay an important role in supporting more licensees to compete, grow \nand thrive in the changing regulatory landscape, by giving them more \nchoices of best-in-class solutions and making access easier via the \nPlaytech integration.\nThe Playtech Engagement Centre offering can be used by \nlicensees to create bespoke safer gambling journeys, interact \nwith their players and provide information, or encourage them \nto undertake a specific action. More information can be found at \nwww.playtech.com/playtech-protect. The Company has promoted \nthe use of Player Journeys as part of an operator’s safer gambling \nstrategy and provided training and demonstrations to licensees \nthroughout 2022.\nIn 2022, Playtech has continued to strengthen collaboration across \nall its operations and business units to standardise its delivery of safer \ngambling solutions to all its B2B and B2C brands. Playtech carried out \nplayer engagement for operators in various markets in partnership \nwith the Playtech Managed Services (PTMS) division. PTMS \ncollaborates with Playtech Protect to inform how customer insights \ncan be used to improve interaction with at-risk players.\nCollaboration with licensees\nPlaytech recognises that the key challenge ahead is to identify the \nmost meaningful metrics to measure player protection across the \nindustry. In 2022, Playtech launched a four-year research partnership \nwith Holland Casino, Erasmus University and the University of \nAmsterdam. This partnership will explore how to measure player risk \nand behavioural impacts from safer gambling interactions through \nBetBuddy. It will develop a library of interventions which will be made \npublicly available.\nAs Shimon Akad, COO, says: “We are investing in data analytics \nand digital solutions to promote responsible gambling and deliver \nsolutions to reduce gambling-related harm. While there are already \ntools to help customers gamble safely, we want to significantly \nimprove the effectiveness and use of these tools amongst \ncustomers. We believe the best way to achieve this goal is to work \ncollaboratively with academic experts who can identify and evaluate \nnew approaches based on scientific theory. The goal of this research \ncollaboration is to develop a range of effective tools and interventions \nthat can be shared with all stakeholders and adopted by industry and \nregulators globally.”\nAs Playtech’s strategic focus continues to expand to other markets \nsuch as the US, Canada and Latin America, where individual states \nand provinces are regulating online gambling for the first time, the \nCompany will use its experience in compliance and safer gambling \nto support its licensees in those markets. This will ensure that the \nopportunities that regulation creates are balanced with the need \nto protect consumers. \n“\t\u0007We believe that gambling can \nbe an important and enjoyable \npart of the leisure industry and, \nmore importantly, society. We \nalso believe that to ensure that \ngaming benefits all stakeholders, \nit is essential that the industry \nleverages the technology and tools \navailable to put player protection \nand trust at the heart of any \ncustomer experience.”\n\t Mor Weizer\n\t CEO\nStrategic Report\n53\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022"

      "text": "Safer gambling insights and solutions\nPlaytech has continued to expand its research programme portfolio \nto cover a variety of topics, including Data Analytics, Product Safety, \nEthics and AI, and Digital Resilience. The programme builds on the \nongoing efforts to understand and address behavioural gambling risk \nfactors and convert those insights into player engagement. In 2022, \nPlaytech published two research reports as part of its collaboration \nwith the Responsible Gambling Council of Canada (RGC) and Demos, \na UK think tank. The reports generated insights about behavioural \nfeatures that are the strongest markers of harm and the effect of the \nintroduction of a stake limit for online slot games in Germany. \nPlaytech also presented two papers at the prestigious European \nAssociation for the Study of Gambling (EASG) conference. The \nRGC published two research papers as part of the ongoing \ncollaboration. The first was on Digital Wellbeing and Online Gambling, \nand the second looked at the promising practices identified in \ndigital gambling tools that are designed to support users across \nthe player spectrum. All are available on Playtech’s website, \nwww.playtech.com/playtech-protect/research.\nSafer gambling standards and certification\nPlaytech’s commitment to safer gambling solutions and the vital \nimportance it has for the business have been demonstrated by the \nexternal recognition Playtech received year on year. In 2022, Playtech \ninitiated the GamCare B2C Safer Gambling Standard independent \nassessment to add to the B2B Safer Gambling Standard that was \nachieved in April 2021, www.safergamblingstandard.org.uk. Playtech \nwas the first company to receive the GamCare B2B Safer Gambling \nStandard. GamCare is the UK’s leading provider of information, \nadvice and support for anyone affected by problem gambling. \nThe GamCare Safer Gambling Standard is an independent quality \nstandard, which assesses the quality of controls that companies put \nin place to protect customers from experiencing gambling-related \nharm. The accreditation process involved an in-depth review of \nPlaytech’s business, including governance, culture and executive \nsupport for safer gambling, as well as safer game design and \nproduct development. \nThe Snaitech Group is committed to implementing new initiatives \ndedicated to responsible gaming and player protection. The Snaitech \ndivision achieved the G4 international certification of responsible \nonline gambling in 2020, which remains valid until 2023.\nResponsible gambling escalation to licensees – iPoker\nWithin the Poker network, iPoker employs its analytical skills to \nidentify possible money laundering, problem gambling and collusion \nissues. Playtech’s dedicated team identifies potential issues and \nescalates these to licensees to review and assess whether further \naction should be taken. While Playtech is unable to take direct \naction on behalf of licensees, as it does not have access to player \naccounts, money or personal information, the team assists licensees \nby escalating potential concerns about safer gambling, collusion and \nanti-money laundering (AML). \nThe table below summarises the percentage of unique cases \nescalated to licensees on AML, collusion and safer gambling over \nthe past three years. In 2022 several new licensees joined iPoker \nand as result there was a significant increase in the number of \nplayers and responsible gambling escalations. There was a drop \nin the number of collusion escalations. This is predominantly due \nto Playtech liaising with a specific licensee to strengthen security \nof their sign-up process. There were a number of developments \nin 2022, which included processes dedicated to the identification \nof Real Time Assistance software and also advancements in the \nCompany’s existing prohibited software investigation methods.\nResponsible gambling escalation to licensees – Live Casino\nPlaytech’s Live Casino operations continued to provide licensees \nwith information about player behaviour that could indicate players \nat risk and/or displaying behaviour that could be harmful. Similar to \nthe iPoker team, the Live operation does not have access to player \naccounts, money or personal information. \nThe Live team uses a machine learning application, which analyses \nchat for words and phrases indicating potential at-risk behaviour. This \nyear, Playtech is reporting on safer gambling escalations to include \ndata from its Live Casino operations in Spain, Romania, Belgium, \nLatvia, the US and Lima. In 2022, Playtech at-risk escalations from its \nLive operations totalled 53,085 cases, compared to 23,802 in 2021 \nand 19,558 in 2020. This number has increased due to new products, \nthe launch of new tables, entering new markets and the continuous \nupgrade of the chat analyser tool resulting in increased player \nchat activities.\nEscalations to licensees – iPoker \nAML (%)\n2022\t\n0.03\n2021\t\n0.02\n2020\t\n0.03\nCollusion (%)\n2022\t\n0.76\n2021\t\n1.03\n2020\t\n1.03\nResponsible gambling (%)\n2022\t\n0.53\n2021\t\n0.39\n2020\t\n0.36\nResponsible business and sustainability continued\n54 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

These projects included updates to its technology \ninfrastructure to strengthen the accuracy and use of near-real-time \nidentification of at-risk players. Additionally, the B2C operations \ninitiated over 100 actions to strengthen player identification and \nengagement procedures. Major workstreams include development \nof a new internal single customer view tool to assess player risk and \na new segmentation engine to enhance categorisation of gambling \nrisk categories using a combination of risk factors. The latter project \nwill enable Playtech to also strengthen its capability to direct players \ntowards specific player journeys based on this segmentation.

The Company’s \nSpeak Up line is instrumental in ensuring that employees have \naccess to an independent channel to raise concerns confidentially \nand without fear of criticism or retaliation. Since 2017, Playtech has \noffered an independent Speak Up hotline to enable employees to \nraise their concerns confidentially and anonymously. During 2022, \nPlaytech had two incident reports, anonymously submitted in writing \nvia the Speak Up platform. These incidents triggered the internal \nreview and escalation process to the Chief Compliance Officer \nand General Counsel for review and have now been resolved.\nData protection\nPlaytech is committed to protecting and respecting the personal data \nit holds, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the gaming \nmarkets in which it operates.

The global technological \nenvironment is ever evolving, and so are cyber and physical security \nthreats. The gaming and betting industry is a highly lucrative target for \nmalicious parties, ranging from individuals operating by themselves to \nhighly sophisticated organised crime groups, which drives Playtech \nSecurity to constantly strive for improved technologies, processes \nand skills to address these challenges.\nThe Playtech Security team oversees the operational, technical and \norganisational measures taken to protect the organisation from both \ncyber and physical security risks. Domains such as infrastructure, \napplication, compliance and physical facilities are covered by a \ncomprehensive security programme, which assures the safe and \nsecure operation of Playtech’s business. The global Security team \nhas a strong customer-centric approach manifested by:\n•\t \temphasis on securing customer data at rest and in transit;\n•\t \teducating licensees on the security capabilities of the \nPlaytech platform;\n•\t \tmonitoring activities around production applications and infrastructure;\n•\t \tassuring suppliers and third parties undergo due diligence process \nbefore integration with the Company’s infrastructure; and\n•\t \tperforming ongoing security audits and tests to verify the security \ncontrols in place.\nFurthermore, the Playtech Security team feeds into the corporate risk \nregister and provides monthly updates to the Board about the security \nprogramme, which includes:\n•\t annual audit activities, in house and by licensees (ISO 27001, ISAE \n3402, PCI-DSS, global regulations, etc.);\n•\t network security architecture, automation and governance; and\n•\t state-of-the-art protection of the Company’s devices from \nmalware, in-depth scanning of application code across \ndevelopment teams to find security bugs and a 24/7 SOC team \nwhich monitors the security incidents across the Company.\nCompliance and responsible supply chain management\nIn 2022, Playtech initiated the review of its procurement policy to \nstrengthen oversight and mitigate compliance, ethical and climate‑related \nrisks, to ensure minimum standards are adhered to when entering \njoint ventures. Compliance continues to work closely with the \nProcurement function to review risks in the supply chain. Supply chain \nissues, including human rights and climate related, were specifically \nexamined as part of the compliance health check process and \nrisk assessment.\nHuman rights\nPlaytech is committed to upholding the principles embodied in the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the International \nLabour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and \nRights at Work. Playtech’s most salient human and labour rights \nissues relate to employment, data protection, procurement of goods \nand services, and AML, specifically ensuring that individuals involved \nin human trafficking and slavery are not laundering their money \nthrough Playtech’s operations. \nIn 2022, Playtech published its sixth Modern Slavery Act statement, \noutlining the initiatives the Company is undertaking to understand \nand assess potential risks of modern slavery and human trafficking, \navailable at www.playtech.com.\nKey areas of focus for 2022 included the reinforcement of processes \nand procedures for managing third parties used in employment \npractices, reviewing and strengthening audit procedures, and \nstrengthening supplier human rights assessments. In 2022, Playtech \nenhanced its supplier risk profile to identify sectoral risks as well \nas risks from their geographical location. A risk assessment matrix \nwas used, looking at sectoral risk, country risk and spend data to \nprioritise next steps. The Company has reviewed 133 supplier sectoral \ncategories and has given a human rights and modern slavery risk \nrating from “low” to “high” to each category. The Group has identified \n57 “high” and “medium” categories as priority categories. To identify \ncountry-specific risks, the Company took account of a number of \nexternal indices in its process, including the UN Human Development \nIndex, Freedom House’s Freedom in the World Civil Liberties, the US \nState Department’s Trafficking in Persons Report, the Global Slavery \nVulnerability Index and the World Bank Worldwide Governance \nIndicators – Regulatory Quality, with the addition of the UNICEF \nChild Rights Atlas – Workplace Index. In 2023, Playtech will engage \nwith its suppliers identified as being in a high-risk sector and located \nin a high-risk country through a self-assessment questionnaire to \nconfirm that they continue to uphold the same standard as Playtech. \nThe Company will also continue an in-depth review of its internal \nprocesses to ensure any gaps are identified and corrected.\nIn addition, Playtech’s Compliance team continues to monitor human \nrights flags as part of its risk monitoring of third parties, including \nsuppliers, partners and licensees. The Company reviews any cases \ninvolving human rights flags on a case-by-case basis to assess risk \nand actions required.\n59\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

During the year, Playtech launched its first \nglobal mentorship programme, which aimed at matching mentors \nand mentees based on the needs of each mentee. The programme \nis designed to run for 12 months with a plan to continue a second \nphase in 2023. The Company has set out its future focus to enhance \nleadership development and embed diversity and inclusion as a core \npart of the development programme for current and future leaders \nand managers. To support this aspiration, in 2023 Playtech will also \nlaunch a new Learning and Development policy and programme.\nChampioning diversity, equity \nand inclusion in Estonia\nIn 2022, Playtech Estonia engaged its employees across \ndifferent initiatives to raise awareness around diversity, \nequity and inclusion (DEI) and to foster an organisational \nculture where every employee feels welcome and valued. \nIn May, Playtech Estonia celebrated Diversity Day in \ncollaboration with other local companies. All activities \nwere planned and organised by the local diversity \nchampions with the aim to make employees think more \nabout the value of having diverse teams and encouraging \nopenness. Employees participated in a gamified session \nabout nationalities and raised donations for the Estonian \nHuman Rights Center.

In this first baseline \nexercise, the Company received a 70% response rate on overall \nengagement, with a score of 8.2 out of 10.

The Company \ncurrently reports on the gender pay gap in the UK and will be looking \nto conduct this exercise in other markets starting in 2023. \nThis year is the fifth anniversary of publishing UK GPG data for \nPlaytech. The data analysis and graphical representations indicate \na significant reduction of the median pay gap from 60.4% in 2018 \nto 26.5% in 2022. However, compared to last year, there has been \nan increase from 18.9% in 2021 to 26.5% in 2022. When reviewing \nthe data for the relevant period, it is clear this is due to the number \nof male leavers in lower paid positions. This is also reflected in the \nbonus median pay gap figure. In addition, the Company continues \nto see higher representation of men in the higher salaried roles, with \n81% males and only 19% females in the upper quartile, although \nthis year there is a slight improvement compared to 2021 where the \nsplit was 83% males and 17% females. The proportion of males and \nfemales receiving a bonus has improved compared to the previous \nyear (65% males and 57% females in 2022 vs 81% males and 69% \nfemales in 2021) following improvements to our internal processes \nand policies to reduce any possible bias and discrimination.

The Group’s retention rate has \nremained over 65% over the last three years with 2020 having the \nhighest figure mainly due to the pandemic and the stability of the \nemployment market at that time (68% in 2022, 65% in 2021 and 77% \nin 2020). The Company’s global turnover rate has increased slightly \nfrom 28% in 2021 to 38% in 2022, which has been partly driven by \ndivestments in the year and an increase in the number of employees in \nits Live studios.

During the year, \nPlaytech continued to prioritise workplace wellbeing and continued to \nimplement a flexible working model to support work/life balance and \nflexibility for its employees, particularly those caring for friends and \nfamily in these challenging times. \nIn 2022, Playtech continued to implement and scale its global \nwellbeing framework with a focus on physical, mental, financial \nand social wellbeing. We continued to cultivate a culture of support \nfor its employees, ensuring they have access to a suite of support, \nadvice and networking opportunities to help them be resilient, grow \nand succeed at work. In 2022, Playtech rolled out more than 100 \nwellbeing initiatives with a focus on physical, mental, financial and \nsocial wellbeing. Over 3,400 employees participated in one or more of \nthese sessions.\nLine managers have played an instrumental role in supporting the \nGroup’s commitments to employee wellbeing.

Playtech engages in tax planning that \nsupports its business and reflects commercial and economic activity. \nPlaytech selects the location of its operations based on commercial \nand operational factors that extend well beyond tax, including: the \nprevailing regulatory environment available, a widely available pool \nof technical talent, the linguistic capabilities in these jurisdictions, the \nlocation of the Group’s licensees, and labour and operational cost \nfactors. The Group is committed to complying with all tax regulations \nin jurisdictions in which it operates and seeks to minimise the risk \nof uncertainty and disputes through proactive dialogue with the \ntax authorities and by obtaining third party expert advice, where \nappropriate.\nPlaytech has offices in 20 countries, with offices and commercial \nactivities in multiple jurisdictions, with the majority of its development \nand technical operations in Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Bulgaria and \nGibraltar. These locations are well known as technology hubs with \na large population of highly skilled experts. The Group’s presence \nin some markets, such as Austria, Australia and Italy, is a result of \nacquisitions. \nGiven the dynamic nature of tax rules, guidance and tax authority \npractice, the business is exposed to continuously evolving rules and \npractices governing the taxation of e-commerce and betting and \ngaming activities in countries in which the Group has a presence. \nSuch taxes may include corporate income tax, withholding taxes \nand indirect taxes. The Head of Tax keeps the Board and Executive \nManagement fully informed of developments in domestic and \ninternational tax laws within jurisdictions where the Group has a \npresence. The Group has an appropriately qualified Tax team to \nmanage its tax affairs. \nDuring the year, the Board reviewed and adopted the Group’s  \nUK Tax Strategy Statement (available at www.playtech.com/ \nresponsibility-regulation/tax-strategy). The total adjusted tax charge \nfor 2022 is €54.9 million (2021: tax credit of €7.1 million) and the \neffective tax rate for the current period is 25.5%.\n63\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "Powering action for \npositive environmental \nimpact\nIn 2022, Playtech evolved its sustainability framework to include a new pillar that outlines its commitment to climate change. The Board and \nleadership recognise that urgent action is required to substantially reduce the risks and impacts of climate change, that climate change is a material \nissue and that the Company has an important role to play in the sector and the countries and communities where it operates. Additionally, the \nCompany is impacted by existing and potential future regulations to limit GHG emissions from the corporate sector and exposed to the impacts \nthat climate change can have on its operations, employees and customers. As a large company with significant B2B operations, Playtech has an \nopportunity to scale action on climate through partnership and engagement with its value chain – from its customers to its suppliers. \nCommitments\n•\t Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within own \noperations and supply chain\n•\t Build capability and climate resilience through decisive \nactions in both own operations and supply chain\n•\t Align to global climate efforts to transition into a low carbon \neconomy, in accordance with the latest climate science, \nand prioritise climate innovation\nTargets and \nperformance measures\nPolicy and commitments\nPlaytech’s Group environmental policy outlines the Company’s \ncommitment to reducing its environmental footprint as well as to \nbuying renewable energy and engaging suppliers to reduce its supply \nchain emissions. In 2022, the Company circulated an environmental \nprocedure document to support the implementation of the policy \nwithin its existing and new operations.\nIn 2022, one of the major areas of focus was to switch its material \noperations to renewable energy, where possible. Another notable \narea of progress is the Company’s formal commitment to set near-term \nand net zero targets through the Science Based Targets initiative \n(SBTi). Finally, the Company continued to improve its understanding \nof its Scope 3 GHG emissions and its climate-related risks and \nopportunities and started considering the levers it has to influence \nthose areas. The Board and members of the Executive Management \nhave also participated in climate change training during 2022.\nEnvironment metrics\nAs per the UK SECR requirements for 2022, Playtech has reported \nits Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and energy consumption \nfigures for the UK.\nIn 2019 Playtech introduced a GHG emissions target to guide its \nenergy reduction efforts. The Company’s ambition is to reduce its \nabsolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 40% by 2025, using 2018 \nas the baseline year. To make this happen, Playtech is working with \nkey site operations, supported by environmental specialists, to reduce \nenergy usage and address other environmental impacts. In addition, \nPlaytech has a central fund to support energy reduction projects. \nPlaytech’s total Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) emissions decreased \nby 11.7% in 2022. Since 2018, they have decreased by 39.6%, meaning \nthat Playtech is very close to achieving its 40% reduction target. The \ndecrease in emissions is explained mainly by the decreasing emission \nintensity of the electricity grids in the countries where the Company \noperates, which averaged -14.1% (weighted by total electricity \nconsumption per country) in 2022. Normalised per full-time equivalent \n(FTE) employees, emissions decreased by 12.5%.

The data for previous years, where assured, is detailed in the respective Annual Reports.\n4 \t Detailed breakdown on the Scope 3 categories can be found in the Responsible Business and Sustainability Addendum to the Annual Report 2022.\nDuring 2022, Playtech drove forward its transition to renewable \nelectricity in the key markets where the Company operates. This \nhas resulted in 56.4% of the Company’s total energy consumption \nnow coming from renewable sources, backed up by energy \nattribute certificates, up from 10.8% in 2021. This has led to a \ndecrease of Playtech’s Scope 2 (market-based) emissions of \n77.0% compared to 2021.\nPlaytech recognises the environmental impact across its global \nvalue chain. The Company therefore conducts an annual Scope 3 \nfootprint. In the process, the Group has followed the GHG protocol \nguidance to calculate those emissions, based on a combination of \nfinancial and actual supplier data. The Company is committed to \nincreasing engagement with key suppliers on their emissions and \ngathering more actual data to continuously improve the accuracy of \nScope 3 figures in future years. Playtech determined which of the 15 \ncategories listed by the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope \n3) Standard are relevant to the Company and therefore should be \nincluded in its Scope 3 footprint. 13 out of the 15 categories were \nidentified as being relevant to the Company and two were not relevant \nfor Playtech. All relevant categories have been calculated, although \n“employee commuting” has only been calculated for Snaitech, which \nrepresents around half of the Group’s total employees, due to data \navailability. The Company aims to collect sufficient data to include a \nfull Group footprint on employee commuting in future reporting. \nPlaytech’s Scope 3 GHG emissions are over 90% of its total \ncarbon footprint and out of the 15 Scope 3 categories, the \nCompany’s top three material categories are “products and \nservices”, “capital goods” and “franchises”. Further details on the \nmethodology behind the environment metrics, such as emission \nfactors used, and the breakdown of Scope 3 GHG emissions \ncan be found in the Sustainability Reporting and Data section \nat www.playtech.com/sustainable-success.\n65\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "Scenario analysis and climate-related risks and opportunities\nIn 2022, Playtech conducted its second scenario analysis, building on the extensive scenario analysis conducted in 2021. The scenarios used \nin 2021 were updated based on the latest information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and International Energy \nAgency (IEA). Three workshops were held with subject matter experts from across the different business units and countries where Playtech \noperates to consider the outcomes from the 2021 analysis and identify any changes. The Company was again supported by Carnstone, a \nmanagement consultancy specialised in sustainability and ESG. Playtech’s scenarios and the external scenarios that fed into Playtech’s \nscenarios are summarised in Table A: Climate scenarios and sourcesand comply with the TCFD guidelines to use a range of scenarios that \nprovide a reasonable diversity of potential future climate states, including a 2°C scenario or lower. They draw on the IPCC’s Representative \nConcentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs); IEA’s World Energy Outlook scenarios; and the Principles for \nResponsible Investment’s (PRI) Inevitable Policy Response (IPR) scenarios.\nBecause scenarios are models of the future and not precise predictions, the scenarios refer to global warming outcomes and the path towards \nthose outcomes on a decadal level. The scenarios use a mix of qualitative and quantitative information and were applied through three lenses: \noperations (key markets and assets); supply chain; and customers and consumers. As Playtech is a global company with assets in 20 markets, \nthe scenarios considered both global climate impacts as well as specific local impacts in its key markets. \n1.5°C Scenario\n2°C Scenario\n3°C Scenario\nPlaytech’s scenarios\nSummary: \nphysical \naspects\nIncrease in heatwaves, extreme weather \nevents (precipitation, droughts, storms), \nfloods, species extinctions and wildfires \nover current conditions, but slow and \nbroadly manageable across most \ngeographies.\nIncrease in heatwaves, extreme \nweather events and wildfires which \nreach unmanageable levels in some \ngeographies by the 2040s. Water \navailability for agriculture, hydropower and \nhuman settlements severely diminished \nfrom the 2040s. High flood damages. \nSignificant adaptation necessary and \nfrequent disruption expected.\nVarious areas of the world become \nuninhabitable due to intense heatwaves, \ndroughts or combinations of both. Heavy \nprecipitation events and longer and more \nintense wildfire seasons covering more \nareas of the globe lead to a constant \nstate of disruption. Floods cause \nwidespread disruption, including to coastal \ninfrastructure such as ports. Species \nextinctions and severe water shortages \nprevent the production of key commodities \nincluding foods. By 2100, sea level rise \nis becoming a problem for low-lying \ncoastal areas.\nSummary: \ntransition \naspects\nSignificant, rapid and disruptive policy \nchange across carbon pricing, energy, \ntransport, buildings and deforestation. \nRapid phase out of fossil fuels in the \n2030s and 2040s. Every policy decision \nhas a climate angle. Global GHG \nemissions peak by 2025 and reach \nnet zero by the early 2050s.\nNew policies are implemented over \ncurrent levels, in a slow and inconsistent \nmanner. Carbon prices and other limits on \nemissions are implemented, but the cost \nof emitting grows in a slow and steady \nmanner. The electrification of transport \nand buildings does not pick up much pace. \nGlobal GHG emissions peak in the 2020s \nand reach net zero in the 2070s.\nClimate policies are maintained at current \nlevels, with major economies reducing \nemissions gradually over the next 30 years \nand reach net zero around 2050. New \ntechnologies are not deployed as fast as \npredicted and the world remains reliant on \nfossil fuels with widespread use of carbon \ncapture and storage (CCS) by the second \nhalf of the century. Globally, GHG emissions \ncontinue to rise.\nExternal scenarios\nIPCC \nscenarios\nRCP2.6/SSP1\nRCP4.5/SSP2\nRCP6.0/SSP5\nIEA \nscenarios\nSustainable development\nNew policies\nCurrent policies\nOther \nscenarios\nPRI IPR: 1.5C Required Policy Scenario\nPRI IPR: Forecast Policy Scenario\nOther data \nsources\nClimate Analytics, Climate Impact Explorer; Climate Interactive, EN-ROADS Climate Change Solutions Simulator; Network for \nGreening the Financial System, Climate Scenarios Phase 2; World Bank, Climate Knowledge Portal; World Resources Institute, \nAqueduct Water Risk Atlas.\nTable A: Climate scenarios and sources.\nClimate-related risks are regularly monitored by the executive cross-functional Environment Forum, the Sustainability and Public Policy \nCommittee of the Board, as well as the Risk & Compliance Committee of the Board. They are also considered as part of the Risk & Compliance \nCommittee’s biannual review of risks across the Group. Playtech routinely monitors the status of climate regulation in its key markets to ensure \nthat its GHG reduction targets keep pace with regulatory changes.\nThe risks and opportunities that were identified as part of the climate scenario analysis are summarised in the below table. The Company \ndefines short term as less than one year; medium term as one to five years; and long term as more than five years. The Group defines the impact \nas material when it is larger than the Group materiality as set out in the Independent Auditor’s Report on pages 136-137. The Company attempted \nto calculate the financial impact of each risk and opportunity. For some, however, this was not yet possible due to a lack of data. Playtech will aim \nto increase the number of risks and opportunities for which impacts are quantified, year on year as more data becomes available. For the risks \nand opportunities where the financial impact was determined and quantified, it was calculated based on a combination of projections on the \nphysical impacts of climate on specific locations, projections on the societal responses to certain future climate states, both from reputable data \nsources described in the table Table A: Climate scenarios and sources and information gathered from within the business.\nResponsible business and sustainability continued\nResponsible business and sustainability continued\n70\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "Supporting our colleagues and communities in Ukraine\nThe war in Ukraine had an unprecedented impact on the lives of our \nemployees and country. During the year, Playtech provided a wide range \nof support to its employees as well as charities delivering humanitarian aid \nto communities across the country. From the inception of the war in early \n2022, the Company rapidly mobilised its skills, community budgets, assets \nand technology to support employees, their families and local communities.\nAcross the Group, Playtech donated over €250,000 to eight different \nhumanitarian organisations, which delivered lifesaving medical equipment \nand supplies, essential items and psychological support to people across \nthe country. Over 300 employees from 14 different countries volunteered \nto support their Ukrainian colleagues. Support included establishing \na 24/7 hotline group chat, maintaining daily contact with designated \nemployees and co-ordinating the transportation and accommodation \noutside of Ukraine. In addition, local “essential items” drives were \norganised by employees across five Playtech offices, with over 100 boxes \nincluding food, clothing, portable chargers and hygiene products shipped \nto Ukraine. A Company-wide fundraising initiative raised over €10,000 \nand was donated to an additional three humanitarian charities.\nIn the autumn, colleagues in Ukraine initiated a special initiative called \nthe “cold winter project”. This initiative is supporting Ukraine-based \ncharities which are delivering a combination of medical emergency \nsupport, housing, five ambulances and hot meals, supporting thousands \nof vulnerable children and families this winter. Playtech continues to \nsupport this initiative and has deployed an additional €100,000 at the \nbeginning of 2023.\nFurther information on Playtech’s charitable and humanitarian efforts \nare located on pages 8-9. \nDelivering positive impact \nthrough Playtech’s Recovery \nand Resilience Fund\nIn 2020, Playtech partnered with Charities Aid Foundation \n(CAF) to launch the £3 million COVID-19 Recovery and \nResilience Fund. The fund provided both immediate and  \nlong-term support to charities, social enterprises and  \nnot-for-profit organisations that were dedicated to \ndelivering mental health services. \nThe fund has awarded 56 grants to organisations in 10 \ndifferent locations including: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, \nGibraltar, IOM, Italy, Latvia, Philippines, UK and US. These \ngrants supported 18 different causes, with the top 4 causes \nbeing frontline workers (23%), mental health patients (23%), \ndomestic violence (10%) and at-risk youth (10%). So far, the \nfund has collectively reached over 24,000 people directly \nand over 1.4 million people indirectly. \nOne project example is Crisis Text Line, Inc., a US non-profit \norganisation dedicated to providing support to people in crisis \nthrough text conversations. In 2020, it saw a 19% increase in \nvolume compared to 2019, and 19% of its US texters  \nself-identified as frontline workers. This project helped \ncover the costs associated with supporting these texters in \ncrisis and a total of 4,226 people directly benefited from this \nfunding.

Scrutiny and pressure on the sector \nto act have added urgency, visibility and relevance for \naddressing the intersection of these issues. The enormity \nof the current situation also serves as an opportunity and \nplatform for bringing together interested organisations to \nmake a difference across the issues. \nThe intersection of gambling, online life and \nmental health\nSafer gambling\nMental health\n Healthy lives and  \ndigital wellbeing\n \nIn 2020, Playtech announced a commitment to supporting \nprogrammes and partnerships designed to reduce gambling-\nrelated harm and promote positive digital wellbeing and health \noutcomes. In doing so, Playtech formally announced and \ncommitted £5 million over five years in five areas of focus, to \nsupport partnerships and initiatives that can make a positive \ndifference at the intersection of gambling, online life and mental \nhealth. Playtech has established strategic partnerships with a \ngrowing number of organisations including Betknowmore, Epic \nrestart foundation, Kindbridge, RG+, the National Centre for \nSuicide Prevention, YGAM and more. To date, over 470,000 \nbeneficiaries were reached, both directly and indirectly. \nA summary of each of these partnerships is available on \nthe Playtech website. \nPlaytech has continued its investment in research, \neducation and treatment programmes designed to reduce \ngambling-related harm. In 2022, Playtech invested over \n£1,010,000 in such programmes and initiatives. Below are \na few examples of programmes supported during the year.\nPartnering for change: Playtech \nCyprus and Generation for \nChange CY collaboration for \ninclusion and equality\nIn 2022, Playtech Cyprus continued its partnership with \nGeneration for Change CY, an organisation committed \nto supporting vulnerable and marginalised communities, \nincluding refugees, migrants and asylum seekers. Individuals \nfrom these communities experience significant societal \nchallenges including cultural differences and understanding \nnew traditions. The initiatives delivered included the Let’s \nPlay Together Intercultural 3x3 Basketball Tournament, \na Humanitarian Aid Programme and IT donations. The \norganisation Generation for Change CY and 22 Playtech \nemployees worked together throughout the year to deliver \nevents and initiatives, all focusing on different aspects \nof inclusion.\nThe basketball tournament helped people from all walks of life \ncome together to compete in good spirit and with the utmost \nrespect for one another. The aim of the initiative was to bring \npeople from different backgrounds together, allowing them to \ninteract with each other on equal grounds, fostering familiarity, \nexchange and appreciation and forming friendships. This initiative \nbrought together more than 76 players from 21 different countries.\nThe Humanitarian Aid Programme resulted in the collection of \na large range of products including food, hygiene essentials, \nclothes, bedding and kitchen utensils. These collections \ndirectly helped approximately 240 households around Cyprus. \nThis initiative highlighted the importance of equality and \ninclusion for all, as no one should be without the necessities. \nPlaytech donated five laptops in support of Generation \nfor Change CY’s educational and skills development \nprogrammes. The laptops helped provide IT skills courses \nto 13 participants to develop their digital literacy. In addition, \nthe laptops allowed the organisation to deliver employability \nactivities, which included CV writing, job search sessions and \nIT skills courses and were delivered to more than 130 job-\nseeking individuals from vulnerable communities. Due to the \noverall success of the Playtech and Generation for Change \nCY partnership, there will be plans for future collaborations. \n76\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

Launched \nin 2019, the aim of this programme is to develop a best practice \nframework for the identification and support of players experiencing \nfinancial difficulty due to gambling-related harm. This multi-\nstakeholder initiative brings together lived experience as well as \nrepresentatives from the financial sector, the gambling industry, \nmoney and debt advice organisations, gambling treatment and \nsupport services, and research bodies to share best practices, set \nnew standards, innovate and connect.\nThe initiative helps organisations better understand the links \nbetween gambling-related financial harm, in particular debt, \nand enables them to better help the individuals affected. It has \nlaunched a comprehensive toolkit for financial institutions, gambling \nbusinesses and debt advice agencies across the UK to help them \nrecognise, support and refer people experiencing GRFH. This \nensures that common language is used and GRFH interventions \nare built into processes and cascaded to frontline staff. Various \nvirtual and in‑person workshops and networking events were \norganised for frontline workers who might encounter debt and other \ngambling‑related financial harms. In total, 338 professionals were \nreached directly in 2022, with 222 of those receiving wider learning or \nengagement under the programme.\n \nWorksafe\nPlaytech is funding the development of Worksafe by Betknowmore \nUK and GamCare. Worksafe is a workplace wellbeing programme \nfocused on the prevention and reduction of harms linked to gambling \nand related digital behaviours. The programme aims to fill the gap \nin relation to gambling, in the training, resources and care provided \nto employees to maintain positive mental health through enhanced \nresilience in the workplace.\nThe programme accelerated in 2022, after being delayed due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The programme’s strategy focuses on three \npriority areas: awareness raising, capability building and research. A \nworkshop was created to improve people’s ability to recognise and \nrespond to gambling in the workplace. The workshop is flexible so \nthat it can apply to SMEs and multinationals in every conceivable \nsector. Content includes lived experience of people with gambling \nharms and others who have been affected in the most sensitive \nbut impactful way possible. It has been piloted with 34 different \norganisations, which have in turn provided feedback on the content \nand structure of the programme. There are four bespoke packages \noffered and the resources will be City & Guilds quality assured. In \nthe meantime, the Worksafe team has developed partnerships with \numbrella organisations for the sectors it intends to prioritise. These \ninclude gambling operators, local and central government, housing \nassociations, finance and retail. Worksafe will be formally launched \ninto the marketplace in early 2023, with a view to becoming  \nself-sustaining in the future.\n77\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

Similarly, \nreported EBITDA increased by €91.2 million to €372.5 million \n(2021: €281.3 million). Total reported revenue from continuing \noperations was €1,601.8 million (2021: €1,205.4 million), representing \na 33% increase (31% on a constant currency basis) compared to \n2021. The excellent overall results in 2022 were driven by continued \nstrength in the Group’s online businesses as well as retail reopening \nfollowing pandemic-related closures in parts of 2021 in many of the \nGroup’s markets. \nThe strong performance was driven by both the B2C and B2B \ndivisions. In B2C, Snaitech had an excellent 2022 performance as \nthe strong results in its online business continued and its retail shops \nwere open for the entirety of 2022, following the pandemic-related \nclosures for most of H1 2021. This led to B2C Adjusted EBITDA of \n€245.4 million, an increase of 38% compared to 2021.\nIn B2B, the results were driven by strong growth in regulated markets, \nwith revenues growing by 22% from €378.7 million to €461.6 million \n(18% on a constant currency basis), led by Caliente in the Americas \nand Holland Casino in Europe, validating the strategy of focusing on \nopportunities in regulated and soon to be regulated markets. \nReported and adjusted profit \nAdjusted profit before tax from continuing operations increased \nby 79% to €215.4 million (2021: €120.4 million), driven by the rise \nin Adjusted EBITDA, decrease in depreciation and amortisation \nand increase in finance income due to favourable EUR/USD \nFX movements.\nReported profit before tax from continuing operations decreased to \n€95.6 million (2021: €605.0 million), mainly due to the €583.2 million \nof unrealised fair value gains on derivative financial assets recognised \nin the prior year with the current year fair value gain being only \n€6.0 million.\nThis led to a total post-tax reported profit from continuing operations \nof €40.6 million (2021: €686.7 million). \nBalance sheet, liquidity and financing \nThe Group continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with \nAdjusted gross cash, which excludes the cash held on behalf of \nclients, progressive jackpots and security deposits, of €272.4 million \nas at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: €434.3 million). The \ndecrease is a result of fully paying down the outstanding Revolving \nCredit Facility (RCF) balance of €166.1 million in July 2022, as well \nas the €330.0 million part repayment of the 2018 Bond, offset by \nthe €223.9 million cash consideration received on the disposal of \nFinalto and the positive cash generation due to the performance of \nthe Group during the year. The Group now has a reduced leverage \nposition with net debt decreasing by €332.6 million to €275.2 million \nas at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: €607.8 million).

The retail network in \nItaly was shut for almost the entirety of H1 2021 due to the COVID-19 \npandemic. The relaxing of COVID-19 restrictions at the end of June \n2021 enabled retail sites to reopen, which drove the increase in \nrevenues and costs in 2022.

However, operating costs within \nSun Bingo increased by 15% to €63.3 million (2021: €55.2 million). The \nmain reason for the increase is that, following the commencement \nof the new contract with News UK, the cost structure of the business \nchanged. From July 2021, Playtech incurs the marketing costs \n(previously they were recharged to News UK) and furthermore, there \nis now a brand fee being charged by News UK (previously this was \ncovered by the minimum guarantee). \nThis led to Adjusted EBITDA of €2.0 million (2021: €6.7 million). \nAdjusted EBITDA still includes the unwinding of the minimum \nguarantee prepayment of €5.4 million in the current year (2021: \n€11.9 million) over the new period of the contract which was \nrenegotiated in 2019. \nOn a reported basis Playtech incurred a one-off cost of €10.4 million \nin H1 2022 to terminate an onerous contract with a service provider. \nThe termination of the agreement will improve the profitability of the \nbusiness going forward. \nHAPPYBET\nThe Sport B2C business, saw year-on-year revenue growth of 10% \nto €20.1 million (2021: €18.2 million), with costs increasing by 4%. \nThe business remains loss making, with Adjusted EBITDA loss in the \ncurrent period of €10.8 million (2021: loss of €11.4 million).

The recoverable amount (being net sales proceeds \nas per the binding sale agreement) was compared to the property’s \nnet book value which led to the impairment; \n•\t €6.4 million impairment in the Bingo VF cash-generating unit \nmainly driven by the termination of one of the biggest customer \ncontracts; and\n•\t €2.7 million of development workforce aborted projects.\nFinance income and finance costs \nReported and adjusted finance income of €11.6 million (2021: €1.1 \nmillion) mainly relates to a €9.2 million foreign exchange gain, driven \nprimarily by the favourable movement in the USD to EUR rate during \n2022. In the prior year, this was an overall loss of €0.5 million and \nhence included in finance costs. The remainder of the finance income \nis interest received. \nReported finance costs includes interest payable on the bonds and \nother borrowings, bank facility fees, bank charges, interest expense \non lease liabilities, the movement in contingent consideration \nand redemption liabilities, fair value loss of convertible loans and \nexpected credit losses on loan receivables. Reported finance costs \nincreased by 8% to €73.0 million (2021: €67.7 million), mainly due to \nthe €3.0 million (2021: €Nil) fair value loss on the GameCo convertible \nloan immediately before it was converted to equity and the first \ntime recognition of €1.6 million of expected credit losses on the \nloans receivable. This was offset by a reduction in the movement in \ncontingent consideration and redemption liability to €0.1 million (2021: \n€4.8 million). Adjusted finance costs increased by 11% to €69.9 million \n(2021: €62.9 million). The difference between adjusted and reported \nfinance costs is the movement in contingent consideration and \nredemption liability of €0.1 million (2021: €4.8 million) and fair value \nloss of the GameCo convertible loan of €3.0 million.\nUnrealised fair value changes of derivative financial assets\nThe unrealised fair value changes of derivative financial assets of \n€6.0 million (2021: €583.2 million) is due to the recognition of the fair \nvalue of the various call options held by the Group in Latin America \nwhich fall under the definition of derivatives within IFRS 9 Financial \nInstruments.

The key items \nfor which the reported tax charge has been adjusted are the provision \nof €8.4 million in respect of overseas tax audits and the reversal of \ndeferred tax liabilities of €8.3 million in respect of intangibles assets \nacquired through business combinations. \nThe Group’s reported effective tax rate for the current period is 39.5%. \nThis rate is higher than the UK statutory rate of 19%. The key reasons \nfor the differences are profits of subsidiaries located in territories \nwhere the tax rate is higher than the UK statutory tax rate (which \npredominately relates to Snaitech based in Italy) and expenses not \ndeductible for tax purposes including professional fees, impairment of \nintangible assets and loss on disposal of subsidiaries. \nThe total adjusted tax expense is €54.9 million (2021: tax credit \nof €7.2 million) which arises on an adjusted profit before tax of \n€215.4 million (2021: €120.4 million). The total adjusted tax expense \nof €54.9 million consists of an income tax expense of €20.4 million \n(2021: tax charge of €14.6 million) and a deferred tax expense of \n€34.5 million (2021: deferred tax credit of €21.8 million). The total \nadjusted deferred tax expense mainly consists of a deferred tax \nexpense of €44.7 million relating to the Snaitech group including the \nuse of Snaitech tax losses and a credit of €16.7 million relating to UK \ntax losses for which a tax benefit is recognised in the current year. \nThe Group’s effective adjusted tax rate for the current period is 25.5%. \nThis rate is higher than the UK statutory rate of 19% as there are \nprofits within subsidiaries located in territories where the tax rate is \nhigher than the UK statutory tax rate (which predominately relates to \nSnaitech based in Italy).\n81\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

New and emerging markets \nare also evolving and learning, which can make it challenging both \noperationally and commercially to keep ahead of all these changes. \nOur presence in Italy has been of increasing strategic importance \nto us over the years. With the growing success in this jurisdiction, \nwe have been exposed to headwinds of increasing taxes and the \neconomic pressures that have come from increased regulation \nin areas such as key social-related elements like AML, GDPR and \nresponsible gambling.\nIt is vital we seek to respond appropriately to regulatory changes. As \na business, we have launched a number of initiatives through the year \nsuch as: investing in safer gambling research and tools, enhancing \nthe cyber protection levels we can offer our customers and staff \nand building an in-house Regulatory Intelligence team.\nPrioritising our people and helping them achieve \ntheir potential\nOur people make Playtech the success it is today.

With the financial \npressures placed on our people, we see this as an opportunity to \nprovide assistance to our staff to make their life easier and ensure \ntheir welfare is prioritised. In the race for talent, we have introduced \ninitiatives concentrating on both supporting and maintaining the \nvaluable talent we have, while focusing recruiting efforts on talent \nthat will maximise our potential as a business.\nBalancing industry pressure and competition\nAs markets mature, growth normalises and regulatory changes impose \nhigher operating costs, our industry continues to consolidate. We are \nfaced with the constant threat of staying competitive in an industry with \na constant flow of innovation and new entrants, as well as facing cost \npressures from our customers who continue to consolidate. \nTo respond to this, we are investing our resources in staying on top of \nthe technological changes in the industry and extending our platform \nto be more nimble and agile to address the evolving needs, desires \nand jurisdictions of our customers.\nDealing with the impacts of climate change \nThe financial impact of both physical and transitional risks related to \nclimate change continue to be of importance to ourselves and our \nstakeholders. Playtech’s TCFD statement and long-term strategy \nto address climate change risks and opportunities are extensively \nexamined on pages 67 to 73 of the Annual Report. This year, climate \nrisks have been specifically referenced in two principal risks “Building \na sustainable business” and “Complying with a changing landscape in \nlegal, regulatory, licensing and tax requirements” where we consider \nthe risks and mitigative actions in further detail.\nA focus on newly regulating markets\nWe make developing business in a sustainable way and meeting our \nbusiness objectives our priority by applying a risk-based approach. \nFocusing on regulated markets and diversifying revenue streams \nacross customer, product and geography allows us to limit our \nexposure. There remains plenty of growth opportunities for us in \ncountries that are starting to regulate online gambling. For example, \nmany states in the US have introduced regulation with others \nconsidering it and Brazil has also introduced regulation, even if the \nimplementation itself seems an extra step away.

End customers \nare facing financial pressures reducing disposable income and \nincentives to gamble. With rising inflation, increasing interest \nrates and refinancing burdens, this increases the pressure \non our staff and customers and influences our investment \ndecisions. From a cost perspective, our B2B business is \ndirectly impacted by rising wage pressure and the economic \nclimate; Snaitech’s retail business is less affected due to the \nvalue sharing agreement with franchisees being based on \nrevenues, rather than profit.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates also pose a risk as \nwe expand into jurisdictions with volatile currencies, such \nas in the Americas. However, this is not as significant across \nmost of the business as our revenue and cost bases are \nevenly matched.\nMitigation\nWe have implemented some monitoring tactics to keep \nabreast of the ongoing situation and the impact on our \noperations by:\n•\t actively monitoring the economic environment as it evolves;\n•\t preparing appropriate responses for action plans that we \ncan take that mitigate the risks to an acceptable level; and \n•\t creating internal remuneration and training schemes to \nretain and support existing employees.\nStrategic considerations\nProtecting the long-term future of the Company  and delivering \non our vision is our priority as the uncertain economic climate can \nadversely impact this. \nOutlining our principal risks \nRisk management, principal risks and uncertainties continued\n87\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "Viability statement\nThe UK Corporate Governance Code requires the Board to explain \nhow it has assessed the prospects of the Group and state whether it \nhas a reasonable expectation that the Group can continue to operate \nand meet its liabilities, taking into account its current position and \nprincipal and emerging risks.\nThe Group’s principal markets and strategy are described in detail in \nthe Strategic Report on pages 24 to 29 and pages 12 to 15, respectively.\nThe key factors affecting the Group’s prospects are:\n•\t Playtech is a global business and a leading technology provider in \nthe gambling industry;\n•\t Playtech is well positioned to meet the growing demand for \ntechnology in regulated and regulating markets;\n•\t Playtech has a clear vision for its technology-centric growth \nstrategy, driven by new licensee and partnership agreements in the \nnewly regulated markets in the US and LatAm and expanding with \nexisting customers with additional products and into new markets;\n•\t Playtech through its B2B division has a diverse portfolio with \nover 180 licensees across retail and online, in over 40 regulated \njurisdictions; and \n•\t Playtech through its B2C division is a leader in the second largest \nEuropean Gambling market with Snaitech in Italy; with this leading \nbrand and Playtech’s technology it is ideally positioned to continue \nits success in this market whilst also being a fast growing player \nin Italy in the online sector when measured by Gross Gaming \nRevenue (GGR).\nThe Directors believe that a five-year period is appropriate for their \nviability assessment as it is supported by a five-year plan adopted by \nthe Board, which covers Playtech’s strategy to continue to penetrate \nthe newly regulated markets in the US and LatAm. This is the longest \ntimeframe over which the Directors believe they can reasonably \nforecast the Group’s performance. This plan relies on certain key \nmilestones being met in the initial years (including successful entry in \nthe US and certain LatAm countries), which would then drive further \ngrowth in the latter years. This plan is revised as required to take into \naccount known facts that will have an impact to the existing forecasts. \nIn making this statement, the Directors have carried out a robust \nassessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, \nincluding those that would threaten its business model, future \nperformance, solvency or liquidity. This includes the availability and \neffectiveness of mitigating actions that could realistically be taken to \navoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the underlying risks. In \nconsidering the likely effectiveness of such actions, the conclusions \nof the Board’s regular monitoring and review of risk management \nand internal control systems, as described on pages 85 to 90 \nare considered.\nBase case five-year projections\nAs set out in the Chief Financial Officer’s review (pages 78 to 84), the \nGroup had excellent overall results which were driven by continued \nstrength in the Company’s online businesses as well as retail \nreopening following pandemic-related closures in H1 2021 in many \nof the Group’s markets, including Italy. Base case projections for \nviability purposes have been made using the Directors’ best estimate \nincluding the following key assumptions:\n•\t Modest Adjusted EBITDA growth beyond FY 2023 on \nexisting business;\n•\t Constant growth in the US;\n•\t High levels of growth in new markets in LatAm;\n•\t Significant cash outlay in the region of €250 – €300 million payable \nacross 2025 and 2026 in relation to the renewal of the Snai gaming \nand betting licenses;\n•\t No major changes in working capital;\n•\t No further impact of COVID-19; and\n•\t No significant changes to Group structure.\nThe Group has the following borrowing facilities in place (as further \ndescribed in Notes 27 and 28 of the Annual Report):\n•\t A revolving credit facility (RCF) of €277.0 million is undrawn as of \n31 December 2022 and available until October 2025, with an option \nto extend by 12 months; \n•\t The 2018 Bond, issued 12 October 2018 as €530 million of senior \nsecured notes, maturing in October 2023 (of which €330 million \nwas repaid in 2022, see below); and\n•\t The 2019 Bond, issued 7 March 2019 as €350 million of senior \nsecured notes maturing in March 2026.\nThe resulting financial model assesses the ability of the Group to \nremain within the financial covenants and liquidity headroom of its \nexisting borrowing facilities. Within the five-year assessment period, \nthe revolving credit facility (RCF) expires as do the 2018 Bond and \n2019 Bond. During 2022, the RCF was fully repaid and €330 million of \nthe 2018 Bond was also repaid, leaving a balance of €200 million that \nis due in H2 2023. \nWithin the five-year plan, the Group assumed that the €200 million \nbalance left on the 2018 Bond and the €350 million 2019 Bond will be \nrepaid on maturity. Furthermore, the RCF facility will be utilised based \non the operational and investment needs of the business during the \nfive-year period, however repaid when free cash is available, in order \nto minimise interest costs. \nDespite the assumptions made in the five-year plan, the Directors \nare confident that if refinancing is required it can be achieved at \nacceptable terms, and, even though currently no formal proposal has \nbeen put forward to the Board, the Group is in regular dialogue with its \nexisting banks, and is continuously reviewing its options. \nClimate change impact\nIncluded within our TCFD statement on pages 67 to 69 is the Group’s \nsecond scenario analysis building on the extensive scenario analysis \nconducted in 2021, to identify the resilience of the Group’s strategy \nunder three different possible climate change scenarios (global \nwarming of 1.5°C/2°C/3°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100) \nand where possible were able to quantify the impact as material or \nimmaterial. In the instances where it was assessed as material, the \nimpact was assessed as long term, which is defined as more than \nfive years. Therefore, these impacts are currently not considered to \nimpact the conclusions made in our viability statement period.\nA third-party company with expertise in TCFD was appointed to \nassist with the analysis, and key management across the business \nis engaged in the assessments made to date and going forward. \nThe key findings are summarised in the TCFD statement. While \nenvironmental risk was added to our emerging risks register for the \nfirst time in 2021, this has been addressed through the establishment \nof the Sustainability and Public Policy Committee of the Board and \nalso through regular monitoring by the executive cross-functional \nEnvironment Forum, as well as the Risk & Compliance Committee of \nthe Board. They are also considered as part of the Risk & Compliance \nCommittee’s biannual review of risks across the Group. The Board \nis committed to continue to assess the situation and the financial \nand other implications as quantification becomes possible over the \nviability statement period and beyond. \n91\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "Viability statement continued\nClimate change impact continued\nFrom a viability perspective, in the instances where we cannot yet \nquantify the impact under each of the scenarios because of the lack \nof data, this is considered in the overall reverse stress test analysis \n(see below). Furthermore, we are closely monitoring how the risks \nwill progress over the next few years, meaning that we are already \ntrying to mitigate our potential exposure, and at this point in time are \ncomfortable that any climate change over the viability assessment \nperiod will not impact the conclusions being made in our scenario \nanalysis below. \nScenario analysis\nTwo scenarios were applied to the base case as follows:\n1.\t\n\u0007the stress-test scenario: encompass the principal and emerging \nrisks which were applied to the base case; and\n2.\t \u0007the reverse stress-test scenario: to illustrate the Adjusted EBITDA \nreduction required that could result in either a liquidity event or \nbreach of the bond covenant.\nUnder Scenario 1, the following risks were factored in:\n•\t building a Sustainable Business (risk number 3) being the risk \nof delays in launching in US and certain LatAm countries due to \nregulation or competition; it was specifically considered because \neven though it has been allocated a low likelihood, the impact could \nbe high; and\n•\t complying with a changing landscape in legal, regulatory, licensing \nand tax requirements (risk number 4) by considering the impact of \npotential changes in taxes across some of our key markets (such \nas Italy).\nThe impacts applied to this scenario were offset by potential savings \nsuch as reducing capital expenditure. In this scenario, monthly \naverage decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was 20% over the five-year \nperiod. Despite this, the Group was still able to meet its financial \ncovenants under its RCF until the point it is repaid, further noting \nthat the probability of all risks applied happening simultaneously is \nconsidered remote. \nScenario 2 was specifically looked at because should we breach \nthe covenants under the RCF, the Group would have sufficient \nfunds to repay the outstanding balance. However, if we were to \nbreach the interest cover covenant under the bonds, which would \nmean the bonds might subsequently be called for repayment, the \nGroup will not be able to repay without raising further finance. This \nscenario indicated that Adjusted EBITDA would need to decrease \non average by 93% over the five-year period at each bank reporting \ndate for us to breach the covenant, noting that it did not consider \nany mitigating actions the Board can take. The probability of this \nscenario materialising is therefore considered remote, given the \nexcellent overall results in 2022 as discussed in the Chief Financial \nOfficer’s review.\nBased on this assessment, the Directors have concluded that there \nis a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue \nin operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five-year \nperiod to 31 December 2027.\nThe Strategic Report on pages 2 to 92 was approved by the Board \nand signed on its behalf by Mor Weizer and Chris McGinnis.\nMor Weizer\t\n\t\nChris McGinnis\nChief Executive Officer\t\nChief Financial Officer\n23 March 2023\n92\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nStrategic Report"

It also notes the \nimportance of a company establishing a culture that promotes \nintegrity and openness, values diversity and is responsive to the \nviews of shareholders and wider stakeholders.\nUK Corporate Governance Code\nThe Code is applicable to all companies with a premium listing, \nwhether incorporated in the UK or elsewhere. The Code applies to \nall accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.\nSection 1: Board leadership and company purpose\nA successful company is led by an effective and entrepreneurial \nboard, whose role is to promote the long-term sustainable success \nof the company, generating value for shareholders and contributing \nto wider society. See pages 96 and 97. \nThe Board should establish the Company’s purpose, values and \nstrategy, and satisfy itself that these and its culture are aligned. All \nDirectors must act with integrity and promote the desired culture. \nPlease refer to our Strategic Report as set out on pages 2 to 92. \nThe Board should ensure that the necessary resources are in place \nfor the Company to meet its objectives and measure performance \nagainst them. The Board should establish a framework of prudent and \neffective controls, which enable risk to be assessed and managed. \nDetails of our principal risks are set out in our Strategic Report on \npages 85 to 90.\nIn order for the Company to meet its responsibilities to shareholders \nand stakeholders, the Board should ensure effective engagement \nwith, and encourage participation from, these parties. Please refer \nto details of our relationships with stakeholders on pages 43 to 45.\nThe Board should ensure that workforce policies and practices are \nconsistent with the Company’s values and support its long-term \nsustainable success. The workforce should be able to raise any \nmatters of concern. Our Strategic Report on pages 2 to 92 gives detail \nof our values and how we integrate these into our corporate culture \nwhich, in turn, leads to engagement with the wider workforce. \nSection 2: Division of responsibilities\nThe Chair leads the Board and is responsible for its overall \neffectiveness in directing the Company. The Directors should \ndemonstrate objective judgement throughout their tenure and \npromote a culture of openness and debate. In addition, the Chair \nfacilitates constructive Board relations and the effective contribution \nof all Non-executive Directors, and ensures that Directors receive \naccurate, timely and clear information. See pages 99 to 105. \nThe Board should include an appropriate combination of Executive \nand Non-executive (and, in particular, Independent Non-executive) \nDirectors, such that no one individual or small group of individuals \ndominates the Board’s decision making. There should be a clear \ndivision of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and \nthe executive leadership of the Company’s business. See pages \n99 to 105. \nNon-executive Directors should have sufficient time to meet their \nBoard responsibilities. They should provide constructive challenge \nand strategic guidance, offer specialist advice and hold management \nto account. See pages 99 to 105. \nThe Board, supported by the secretary, should ensure that it has the \npolicies, processes, information, time and resources it needs in order \nto function effectively and efficiently. See pages 99 to 105.\nSection 3: Composition, succession and evaluation\nAppointments to the Board should be subject to a formal rigorous and \ntransparent procedure, and an effective succession plan should be \nmaintained for the Board and senior management. Both appointments \nand succession plans should be based on merit and objective criteria \nand, within this context, should promote diversity of gender, social and \nethnic backgrounds, and cognitive and personal strengths. See pages \n99 to 105. \nThe Board and its committees should have a combination of skills, \nexperience and knowledge. Consideration should be given to the \nlength of service of the Board as a whole and membership regularly \nrefreshed. See pages 99 to 105. \nAnnual evaluation of the Board should consider its composition and \ndiversity and how effectively members work together to achieve \nobjectives. Individual evaluation should demonstrate whether each \nDirector continues to contribute effectively. See page 104.\nSection 4: Audit, risk and internal control\nThe Board should establish formal and transparent policies and procedures \nto ensure the independence and effectiveness of internal and external \naudit functions and satisfy itself as to the integrity of financial and \nnarrative statements. See pages 99 to 105.\nThe Board should present a fair, balanced and understandable \nassessment of the Company’s position and prospects. Our Strategic \nReport is on pages 2 to 92. \nThe Board should establish procedures to manage risk, oversee the \ninternal control framework, and determine the nature and extent of \nthe principal risks the Company is willing to take in order to achieve \nits long-term strategic objectives. Details of our principal risks are set \nout on pages 85 to 90. In addition, our Risk & Compliance Committee \nReport is set out on page 102. \nSection 5: Remuneration \nRemuneration policies and practices should be designed to support \nstrategy and promote long-term sustainable success. Executive \nremuneration should be aligned to Company purpose and values \nand be clearly linked to the successful delivery of the Company’s \nlong‑term strategy. \nA formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive \nremuneration and determining Director and senior management \nremuneration should be established. No Director should be involved \nin deciding their own remuneration outcome. \nDirectors should exercise independent judgement and discretion \nwhen authorising remuneration outcomes, taking account of \nCompany and individual performance, and wider circumstances. \nDetails of our Remuneration Policy and how it is applied are set out \nin the Governance section on pages 111 to 128. \nCompliance statement \nWe continued to make improvements during the year both to our \nBoard structure and our governance procedures in accordance with \nthe provisions of the Code. In accordance with provision 38 of the \nCode, and in keeping with our Remuneration Policy as approved by \nshareholders at our Annual General Meeting held in May 2021, we \nreached a position in January 2023 whereby pension contributions to \nour Executive Directors are aligned with pension contribution to our \nwider workforce. I am pleased to be able to report that it is the view of \nthe Board that the Company is now fully compliant with the principles \nof the Code.\n98 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nGovernance Report"

      "text": "Following the results on our AGM held in June 2022, the Board noted \nin its announcement dated 30 June 2022 that certain resolutions \nwere passed with the necessary majority but received less than \n80% of votes in favour. These resolutions were in respect of the \nRemuneration Report and disapplication of pre-emption rights. We \nexplained at that time that we aspire to high levels of shareholder and \nstakeholder engagement and would consult with those shareholders \nwho voted against these resolutions to understand their specific \nconcerns. Since the AGM, we have held regular discussions with \nour shareholders to hear their views and better understand their \nconcerns. Our Sustainability and Public Policy Committee continues \nto steer Playtech towards stronger governance around sustainability. \nA statement setting out our response to the voting figures from last \nyear’s AGM was uploaded to the Investment Association portal. \nIn accordance with the principles of the Code, we are focused on \nengaging with our workforce. Full details of how we engage with \nour employees are set out in our Strategic Report, Stakeholder \nEngagement on pages 43 to 45. In addition, our Chief Operating \nOfficer and our Head of Human Resources engage with the Board \non strategic and operational issues affecting and of interest to our \nworkforce. These issues include remuneration, talent pipeline, \nwellbeing and diversity and inclusion. The Chief Operating Officer is a \nstanding attendee at Board meetings. We believe that these methods \nof engagement with our workforce are extensive and very effective \nand meet the requirements of the Code. During the year, the Board \ncontinued with a review of our current arrangements with a view to \nenhancing its engagement with the workforce including arrangements \nto appoint a Non-executive Director for workforce engagement at \nBoard level. \nWe announced on 21 February 2022 that the Board was notified \nby our Chief Executive Officer, Mor Weizer, that he wished to \nexplore participating in the investor group formed and advised by \nTTB Partners Limited (TTB) in considering a possible offer for the \nCompany. The Board formed an Independent Committee consisting \nof the Playtech Directors excluding Mor Weizer to consider all matters \nrelating to any possible offer from TTB and any other M&A proposals \nreceived by the Company. The Independent Committee was \nespecially mindful of its obligations to Playtech stakeholders and the \nrequirements of the Code. On 14 July 2022, TTB advised that it did not \nintend to make an offer for the Company due to challenging underlying \nmarket conditions.\nIan Penrose was appointed as Chair of the Remuneration Committee \non 1 November 2018, having been appointed as a member of the \nCommittee on 1 September 2018. Notwithstanding that he had not \nbeen a member of the Committee for at least 12 months prior to his \nappointment as Chair, his extensive experience in the plc environment \nmade him the most appropriate person for the role. Ian has now served \nas Chair for over 4 years. \nThe Company’s auditor, BDO LLP, is required to review whether the \nabove statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the Code \nby the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and to report \nif it does not reflect such compliance. No such negative report has \nbeen made.\nThe Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good \ngovernance and the statements set out in this report describe how the \nGroup applies the principles identified in the Code. \nThe Board\nComposition \nAs at 31 December 2022, the Board comprised the Non-executive \nChairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, \nand four independent Non-executive Directors. The list of Directors \nholding office during the year to 31 December 2022 and their \nresponsibilities are set out on pages 96 and 97. \nWith the exception of Andrew Smith, who stepped down in November \n2022 and Chris McGinnis, who was appointed in November 2022 the \nDirectors served throughout the financial year. \nSamy Reeb was appointed as a Non-executive Director in January 2023. \nThe Non-executive Directors are all considered by the Board to be \nindependent of management and free of any relationship which could \nmaterially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement, \nas explained above. \nThe Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Board and its \nCommittees and his appointment and removal is a matter for the \nBoard as a whole.

Therefore, all \nDirectors are seeking their reappointment at this year’s AGM. \nThe Board has collectively agreed that the Directors proposed for \nre-election at this year’s AGM have made significant contributions \nto the business since their last re-election and each has a key role to \nplay in the formulation of the Group’s future strategy and its long-term \nsustainable success.\nIn certain circumstances, Directors are entitled to seek independent \nprofessional advice under an agreed Board procedure, which would \nthen be organised by the Company Secretary, and in this regard the \nCompany would meet their reasonable legal expenses.\nService contracts and exit payments \nExecutive Directors \nSet out in the table below are the key terms of the Executive Directors’ \nterms and conditions of employment. \nA bonus is not ordinarily payable unless the individual is employed and \nnot under notice on the payment date. However, the Remuneration \nCommittee may exercise its discretion to award a bonus payment \npro-rata for the notice period served in active employment (and not on \ngardening leave).\nThe LTIP rules provide that other than in certain “good leaver” \ncircumstances awards lapse on cessation of employment. Where an \nindividual is a “good leaver” the award would vest on the normal vesting \ndate (or cessation of employment in the event of death) following the \napplication of performance targets and a pro-rata reduction to take \naccount of the proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed. The \nCommittee has discretion to partly or completely disapply pro-rating \nor to permit awards to vest on cessation of employment. \nProvision\nDetail\nRemuneration\nSalary, bonus, LTIP, benefits and pension \nentitlements in line with the above Directors’ \nRemuneration Policy table\nChange of \ncontrol\nNo special contractual provisions apply in the \nevent of a change of control\nNotice period\n12 months’ notice from the Company or employee \nfor the CEO and the CFO\n•\t CEO contract signed on 1 January 2013\n•\t CFO contract signed on 28 November 2022\nTermination \npayment\nThe Company may make a payment in lieu of \nnotice equal to basic salary plus benefits for the \nperiod of notice served subject to mitigation and \nphase payments where appropriate\nRestrictive \ncovenants\nDuring employment and for 12 months thereafter\n103\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nGovernance Report"

Ian Penrose, as Senior Non-executive Director, \nconsidered the performance of Brian Mattingley, taking into account \nthe views of the Executive Directors. There were no material areas of \nconcern highlighted and the main outcome of the evaluation this year \nwas to shape and define the Board’s objectives for the coming year, \ncontinuing the focus on Group strategy and ensuring the structures, \ncapabilities and reporting are in place to achieve the Board’s goals. \nAs stated in last year’s Annual Report, the Board was required to carry \nout a full external review in 2021, This review commenced in late 2021 \nand continued into 2022.

The process was overseen by the \nCompany Secretary. In addition, the Company Secretary is the person \nresponsible for providing access and support for Independent Audit \nLimited. The review has been finalised and is with the Chairman. The \nBoard members will discuss the findings and continue to adopt and \nimplement plans to further develop the effectiveness of the Board \nduring 2023. \nNewly appointed Directors can expect a detailed and systematic \ninduction on joining the Board.

The year saw great expansion and success \nin the Group’s activities in both North and South America, which will \nincreasingly be key contributors to overall performance requiring \nthe Committee to realign its focus accordingly.

      "text": "Audit Committee report continued\nKey estimates, judgements and financial \nreporting standards\nRevenue recognition \nThe Audit Committee reviewed the judgements made in respect of \nrevenue recognition, in particular in assessing whether it is acting \nas a principal or an agent. In making these judgements, the Group \nconsiders, by examining each contract with its business partners, \nwhich party has the primary responsibility for providing the services \nand is exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards associated \nwith providing the services, as well as if it has latitude in establishing \nprices, either directly or indirectly. The business model of this division \nis predominately a revenue share model which is based on royalties \nearned from B2C business partners’ revenue. The Committee \nconcluded the Group’s revenue recognition policy relating to these \ntypes of contracts are in line with IFRS requirements. \nFurthermore, the Committee directed work this year to ensure that \nthe embedded controls within the IT systems capturing all the different \nrevenue streams are operating in line with our internal procedures and \naccurately capture the data required for revenue recognition. \nGoodwill and intangible assets\nDuring the year, the Audit Committee also considered the \njudgements made in relation to the valuation methodology adopted \nby management to support the carrying value of goodwill and other \nintangible assets, to determine whether there was a risk of material \nmisstatement in the carrying value of these assets and whether an \nimpairment should be recognised. \nThe Committee considered the assumptions, estimates and \njudgements made by management to support the models that \nunderpin the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets in the \nbalance sheet. Business plans and cash flow forecasts prepared by \nmanagement supporting the future performance expectations used in \nthe calculations were reviewed, as were the valuation methodologies \napplied. The Committee noted that analyses and conclusions were \nimpacted by the conflict in the Ukraine and the fundamental move to \na higher interest rate environment. \nThe Committee particularly considered the outcome of the \nimpairment reviews performed by management. The impairment \nreviews were also an area of focus for the external auditor, who \nreported their findings to the Committee. The Committee satisfied \nitself that the conclusions made on the impairments of the Bingo VF, \nQuickspin, Eyecon and IGS cash-generating units were reasonable, \nand, aside from that, there were no other material impairments to the \ncarrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets. \nClassification and valuation of investment in associates \nand derivative financial assets\nThe Audit Committee has considered the judgements made \nin determining the classification of each structured agreement \narrangement, as further explained in Note 6 of the financial \nstatements, and in particular using the appropriate guidance under \nthe accounting standards to determine the existence of control or \nsignificant influence. \nIn reviewing each assessment, the Committee is comfortable that \neach classification, which is further explained and disclosed in Note \n20 of the financial statements is correct and in accordance with the \naccounting standards. \nThe Group engaged external valuation specialists to perform the \nvaluations of the derivative financial assets held at fair value, who \nwere guided by management in terms of judgements made. The Audit \nCommittee reviewed and challenged the resulting values of each \narrangement and is comfortable with the assumptions, estimates \nand judgements in each of the valuations, including the valuation \nmethodology applied. The Audit Committee is also satisfied with \nthe judgement made in relation to the Caliente Call Option and the \nimpact this judgement may have on the valuation of the Playtech M&A \nCall Option as further explained in Notes 20A and 20C. \nOther financial statement areas \nThe Audit Committee reviewed the level of judgement and \nestimation required in the following areas of the financial statements, \ndocumented in management papers, and it is satisfied that the \njudgement made and disclosures included in the financial statements \nare reasonable and in line with each applicable IFRS:\n•\t recovery of financial assets including trade receivables and \nexpected credit losses, particularly where aged debt is apparent. \nFurthermore, the Committee was satisfied that the bad debt \nprovision in place for the Group’s receivables from Asia is sufficient \nto cover its current exposure;\n•\t the fair value assessment of assets acquired as part of the \ninvestment made in LSport and associated equity call option during \nthe year, which was recognised as an investment in associate (refer \nto Note 20);\n•\t consideration of Group tax risk including potential uncertain tax \nprovisions. The Group has provided for uncertain tax positions \nwhich meet the recognition threshold and these positions are \nincluded within tax liabilities;\n•\t adjusted performance measures and in particular the determination \nof whether non-cash items, one-off items and not directly related \nexpenses to the operations of the Group should form part of the \nadjusted results; and\n•\t the recognition of the funds provided to Ocean 88 Holdings Ltd, \nwhich is the sole holder of Galera Gaming Group (together “Galera”) \nas a loan, a treatment which has remained unchanged from the prior \nyear (refer to Note 20A).\nViability and Going Concern Statements \nThe Committee reviewed management’s work on assessing risks \nand potential risks to the Company’s business both for the going \nconcern and viability statement periods, which included challenging \nthe approach taken by management to support the going concern \nstatement on page 84 and viability statement set out on pages 91 \nand 92, by considering the Group’s principal and emerging risks. This \nincluded the assumptions made on the repayment of the Group’s \nborrowings when they fall due, as well as the payment for the renewal \nof the Italian Gaming Licenses, and furthermore, considering the \npotential impacts of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, a potential \nrecessionary environment, and the impact these could have on the \nbusiness. Following this review, the Committee was satisfied that \nmanagement had conducted a strong and thorough assessment \nand recommended to the Board that it could approve the viability and \ngoing concern statements. \nFinancial Reporting Council (FRC) Review\nPrior to the 2021 year end the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) \ninformed the Group that it had carried out a review of the Annual \nReport for the year ended 31 December 2020 and raised questions as \nto whether the Group had satisfied relevant reporting requirements. \nThe Group worked with the FRC to clear their queries, and a number \nof key disclosure matters were enhanced within the 2021 financial \nstatements in respect of the following areas:\n•\t Investments in derivative financial assets\n•\t Sun Bingo contract\n•\t \tRevenue recognition\n•\t Taxation\n108 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nGovernance Report"

BDO \nhave kept the Committee updated with progress of the review and \nhave considered findings to date as part of the audit approach for the \n2022 year-end audit. The Committee is expected to consider the final \nfindings with BDO and understand how BDO intend to address them \nin future audits.\nExternal audit efficiencies, independence and \nnon‑audit services\nFollowing the 2021 audit the Chairman met separately with the current \nand previous Chief Financial Officer and the lead external auditor to \nreview the audit process, and to highlight areas of improvement for the \n2022 audit. The findings were then reviewed with the Audit Committee \nmembers and a programme to improve the efficiency of the audit \nprocess was agreed for 2022. This programme covered a formal \nreview of corporate measures to support the audit process, including \na restructuring of certain finance team responsibilities and a project to \nimprove the Group’s financial control regime. The audit process, which \nwhile previously sufficient for audit purposes, is now more efficient and \nreceives greater oversight by the Audit Committee.\nIn addition, the Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, undertakes \na formal assessment of the auditor’s independence each year, \nwhich includes: \n•\t a discussion with the auditor of a written report detailing all \nrelationships with the Group and any other parties which could \naffect independence or the perception of independence; \n•\t a review of the auditor’s own procedures for ensuring independence \nof the audit firm and partners and staff involved in the audit, \nincluding the periodic rotation of the audit partner;\n•\t obtaining written confirmation from the auditor that they are \nindependent; and\n•\t a review of fees paid to the auditor in respect of audit and \nnon‑audit services.\nThe FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard introduced certain specific \ncriteria for non-audit work. This included the introduction of a \nnon-audit services fee cap and white list of permitted services. \nA breakdown of audit and non-audit fees are included in Note 11 \nto the financial statements on page 177. \nThe Committee remain satisfied with the manner, robustness and level \nchallenge of BDO’s audit processes and believe BDO should remain \nas auditor for 2023. The reappointment will be formally considered \nat the Annual General Meeting. \nInternal Audit and Risk Management\nThe Company has an internal audit function which comprises six \nin-house auditors, including the Director of Internal Audit & Risk, \nwhich reports to the Chair of the Committee and has direct access \nto all key executives. Its key objectives are to provide the Board, the \nCommittee and management independent and objective assurance \non risks and mitigating controls, and to assist the Board in meeting \nits corporate governance and regulatory responsibilities. Overall, \nthe system of internal controls and audit is designed to ensure local \nlegal and regulatory compliance and manage, rather than eliminate, \nthe risk of failure to achieve business objectives. It can therefore only \nprovide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material \nmisstatement or loss.\nAs also reported in last year’s Annual Report, in recognition of the \nincreasing level of complexity across the Company the Committee \ncontinues to take further steps to expand and enhance internal \ncontrols, strengthening the internal audit function and its position \nwithin the organisation. In addition, in recognition of the increasingly \ncomplex environments within which the Group operates, a separate \nRisk Management committee continues to ensure appropriate review \nand assessment of risks and risk appetite within the Company, thereby \noffering further oversight and challenge of the control regimes. \nIn order to provide access to evolving specialist knowledge \nrequired to audit certain aspects of the Company, particularly with \nrespect to IT, the historical Internal Audit relationship between \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) and Playtech continues as a \nco-sourced arrangement, with PwC providing support to the Internal \nAudit Team given their experience with the Group across a series of \nprojects. The Committee believes this is an appropriate and effective \nmodel, and an important source of insight in their assessment of the \nevolving Group.\nThe scope of work of the Internal Audit team covers all the systems \nand activities of the Group. Early in 2022 the scope was reviewed \nand reprioritised in light of the Group’s changing risk profile and \nrestrictions placed on how and where it could engage with the Group \ngiven ongoing COVID-19 restrictions in some areas of the Group’s \noperations. During the year, the Internal Audit Team performed a \nnumber of audits over both individual entities and central functions \nacross the Group, which included:\n•\t Data Protection Audit\n•\t Financial Governance & Systems Health Check\n•\t Corporate Criminal Offence (CCO) Impact Assessment \n•\t IMS Security Audit/Billing Audit \n•\t Fraud Maturity Review/Risk Management Maturity Health Check\n•\t \tPlaytech Sports Cybersecurity Audit\nThe results of these audits were reported to the Audit Committee on \na regular basis, with recommendations made by Internal Audit and \ncorresponding management actions being reviewed and challenged, \nwhere appropriate. In addition to regular feedback of audit results, the \nInternal Audit Team monitors completion of management actions and \nprovides updates of these to the Audit Committee twice a year or upon \nrequest by the Committee on a quarterly basis.\nA particular focus of the Audit Committee in 2022 was a complete \nreview and re-setting of the Group’s internal financial control regime \nin light of expected SOX Compliance Requirements. The Audit \nCommittee worked in conjunction with the finance team, as well as \nthe Internal Audit Team and PwC, to assess requirements and scope \na project plan. An external consultant was appointed to lead the \nreview, working across all aspects of the Group, and develop revised \npolicies which will be implemented during 2023 and 2024 as part \nof an expanded second line controls function.\nThe Committee confirms that any necessary action will be taken to \nremedy any significant failings or weaknesses identified from any \nInternal Audit reviews. \nEach year, the Committee reviews the quality and effectiveness of the \nInternal Audit Team through a number of methods, including a regular \nreview of ongoing work to ensure the Audit plan is being delivered, \ndiscussions with key executives, and feedback from both BDO and \nPwC. This review includes an assessment of Audit Plan delivery, \nbusiness understanding, impact of the Internal Audit Team on the \norganisation, communication and performance. In addition, the Audit \nCommittee Chairman meets with the Director of Internal Audit & Risk \nand his deputy at a minimum on a monthly basis to be updated on the \nTeam’s activities.\n109\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nGovernance Report"

Internal Audit will carry \nout audits in accordance with this plan using a risk-based approach \nand continue to maintain effective lines of communication with the \nAudit Committee and key management. The Committee believes this \nprogramme of continual assessment will ensure the Internal Audit \nPlan for 2023 remains fit for purpose in light of any new or emerging \nrisks. The Internal Audit Team will also be utilised to provide assurance \nover corporate governance matters and for ad hoc projects, \nwhere necessary.\nCommittee Evaluation \nThe performance of the Audit Committee was assessed as part \nof the Board Review which was facilitated by Independent Audit \nLimited. The process sought views from Executives and Non-\nexecutive Directors and included a review of the operations of the \nCommittee. Independent Audit Limited’s conclusion was that the \nAudit Committee has been transformed under the current Chair \nand demonstrably holds the finance leadership accountable for \nperformance and delivery. In addition, Independent Audit highlighted \nthat a new Standard covering the management of external oversight \nis being developed as an enforceable requirement. During 2023, the \nCommittee will start developing its approach to this area of evaluation, \nincluding obtaining the views of stakeholders from across the business. \nNon-Financial Control Systems\nIn parallel to the review of the Group’s internal financial control regime, \nthe Audit Committee considered the Group’s broader control regime \nand how best to assess overall governance given the evolving nature \nof the Group’s strategic priorities, the regulatory environments in \nwhich the Group operates and stakeholder interests.\nIn order to monitor and challenge key dimensions of the Group’s \ngovernance model the Audit Committee formalised a review process \nwith each of the senior management responsible for compliance, \nsustainability, tax and IT security. As part of the 2023 Audit Committee \nprogramme, each team will present its strategy, together with \ncurrent and any proposed changes to their control regimes, and \nthis will provide the basis for subsequent formal evaluation over \nthe following 12 months.\nAreas which will have their control regime reviewed in 2023 are:\n•\t R&D and technology expenditure to ensure ongoing efficacy of \nbudgeting and execution occurs in light of the Group’s changing \nbusiness model and geographic emphasis\n•\t Mergers & Acquisitions to ensure that appropriate project \nevaluation and prioritisation takes place, and requisite integration \nand management oversight occurs\n•\t ESG and CSR management to ensure the Group delivers on all \nenvironmental, regulatory and other stakeholder undertakings\nLooking ahead the Committee is working on the assumption that \nPlaytech will be subject to further regulatory and compliance \nrequirements as it continues to expand geographically and the \ncomplexity of its business model increases, while at the same \ntime regulators increase the levels of scrutiny across the sector. \nAccordingly, the Committee has taken steps to both broaden and \ndeepen the control environment across the Group with particular \nfocus this year on enhanced financial controls, but also establishing \noversight of ESG, CSR, and broader security and audit regimes.\nMy thanks go to Andrew Smith for his service to the Board and as \nCFO working with the Audit Committee, having stepped down in \nNovember 2022.\nI believe the skills and experience of the Committee members remain \nstrong and relevant, enabling the Audit Committee to continue to \nperform effectively.\nJohn Krumins \nChairman of the Audit Committee\n23 March 2023\n110 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nGovernance Report"

      "text": "Statement by the Committee Chairman\nDear Shareholder\nOn behalf of the Board, I welcome the opportunity to present the \nRemuneration Committee’s report on Directors’ remuneration for \nthe year to 31 December 2022.\nThis report describes how the Board has applied the principles of \nthe 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) to Directors’ \nremuneration. Although Playtech is an Isle of Man incorporated entity \nand, as such, is not required to comply with the UK regulations on \nDirectors’ remuneration, we recognise the importance of shareholder \ntransparency. Accordingly, we can confirm that the Company adheres \nto the UK regulations as they relate to Directors’ remuneration and the \nreport below is divided into: (i) this Annual Statement; (ii) a summary \nof the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the “Policy”) as approved \nby shareholders at the 2021 AGM; and (iii) the Annual Report on \nRemuneration that reports on the implementation of the Company’s \nstated Remuneration Policy for the year to 31 December 2022. The \nAnnual Report on Remuneration and this Statement will be the subject \nof an advisory shareholder resolution at the forthcoming AGM.\nBusiness context\nAs shareholders will be aware, we made significant and wide-ranging \nchanges to the Remuneration Policy in 2021 as a result of an extensive \nreview and shareholder consultation process. In undertaking this \nreview the Committee sought to draw a line under the poor voting \nrecord on remuneration over the past few years. Changes included \na 20% reduction in the base pay of the CEO, reduction in executive \npension contributions, increase in the bonus deferral into shares and \na material reduction in the fee for the Chairman. At the 2022 AGM \nthe total votes received in favour of resolution for the Remuneration \nReport were 69.67%. Following the AGM and throughout the year \nduring the takeover period and discussions, the Group has continued \nto engage extensively with shareholders. It was clear from these \ndiscussions that the principal reason why certain shareholders were \nunable to support the resolution related to the CEO’s payout under the \none-off equity incentive scheme approved by shareholders in 2019. \nShareholders were, however, supportive of the changes implemented \nsince 2021. \nAs a result of these significant changes, the balance of remuneration \nshifted towards one driven by performance, which the Remuneration \nCommittee believes has contributed to the significant growth in Group \nperformance over the period.\nRestructured \nremuneration aligns\n with performance \n“\t\u0007The balance of remuneration \nhas shifted towards one driven \nby performance, which the \nRemuneration Committee believes \nhas contributed to the significant \ngrowth in Group performance \nover the period.”\n\t Ian Penrose\n\t \u0007Chairman of the  \nRemuneration Committee\n111\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nRemuneration Report"

The Company \nwas only able to grant LTIP awards in August 2022, once the Group \ncame out of an unusually lengthy closed period of over 12 months, \nwhich meant there was a gap of nearly two years between grants. \nThe 2022 LTIP awards are subject to relative TSR and adjusted EPS \nperformance. Further details on the 2022 LTIP awards are given \non page 122.\nWe confirm that as stated last year, the Committee did not grant \nany form of catch-up LTIP award despite the Executive Directors \neffectively missing their 2021 award. This resulted in a significant \nreduction in the remuneration potential of the Executive Directors, and \nindeed the wider Playtech management team, and we are delighted at \ntheir continued focus on the business and delivery despite this.\nThe Committee remains cognisant of the need to continue to show \nrestraint with regards to executive remuneration, particularly in the \ncontext of the current cost of living crisis (which has a more significant \nimpact on our employees). In this vein, the Committee reviewed \nthe salaries of the Executive Directors and senior management \nteam and approved increases of 2% and 3.5% for the CEO and \nCFO (significantly below the 7% average increase awarded across \nthe UK workforce) with effect from 1 January 2022. Furthermore, it \nremains the Committee’s intention that future salary increases for the \nExecutive Directors will not exceed the general level of increases for \nthe Group’s employees.\nAs a result of the intensive corporate activity that occurred during the \nyear, the Non-executive Directors undertook significant additional \nresponsibilities, and committed substantially more time to the business, \nwhich extended far beyond their normal responsibilities. This was \na complex, lengthy and intense period of corporate activity, which \nmeant the Company was in a closed period for over 12 months. \nFurthermore, the expansion into the United States necessitated extensive \nlicence applications in several States, one requiring physical attendance. \nIt is estimated that each of the Chairman and Non-executive Directors \nspent at least an additional 32 days (2021: 20 days) over and above \ntheir contracted hours working on Playtech matters over the course \nof 2022. As a result, and in line with Policy, a pro rata additional \nfee was paid to the Chairman and each Non-executive Director, \ncommensurate with the time spent and the fee level for the Senior \nIndependent Director, equating to £132,000 (2021: £120,000 or \nlower if appointed part way through 2021), and then scaling back the \nadditional fees payable so the increase was no more than 10% of \nthe additional fees paid in 2021, despite the more than 50% increase \nin additional days. \nIt is not anticipated that any additional fees will be paid in respect of \n2023, however if this does occur the fees and basis for determining \nthese will be disclosed in the 2023 Directors’ Remuneration Report.\nExecutive Director changes during the year\nAs announced on 1 November 2022, the Company mutually agreed \nwith Andrew Smith that he would step down from the Board and his \nrole as CFO on 28 November 2022. Chris McGinnis was promoted \nto CFO and Executive Director of the Company with effect from the \nsame date. Given the proximity to the financial year end, the Board \nagreed with Andrew Smith that he would remain involved with the \nbusiness until the end of the financial year to facilitate an orderly \ntransition to the new CFO. \nFurther details regarding the leaving arrangements for Andrew Smith \nare set out on pages 122 and 123.\nThe reward package for Chris McGinnis has been set in line with the \nexisting remuneration policy. Chris McGinnis was appointed as CFO \non a basic salary of £350,000 (which is lower than Andrew Smith, \nwhose salary on his stepping down from the Board was £445,567). \nThe Committee intends to increase his salary to £400,000 effective \nfrom 1 July 2023 once he becomes established in his new role, \nwith a commitment to not undertake a further salary review until \n1 January 2025.\nPerformance and pay outcome for 2022\nAnnual bonus\nThe financial performance of Playtech was strong in 2022, despite \nthe enormous distractions and challenges faced due to the lengthy \ntakeover activity and corporate transactions. \nAt the beginning of the year, the Committee reviewed the approach to \ncalibrating challenging performance targets, and agreed to increase \nthe level of stretch within the targets such that the level of performance \nrequired to achieve maximum payouts under the financial targets was \nto exceed target by 10%. This was an increase on the level of stretch \nwithin the 2021 targets, which required a 5% outperformance of target \nto achieve maximum payout.\nCognisant of consensus forecasts for adjusted EBITDA (€331 million \nat the beginning of the financial year), the Committee set on-target \nadjusted EBITDA (equivalent to a 50% payout under the adjusted \nEBITDA element) 10% above consensus at €365 million. The \nmaximum target adjusted EBITDA was set at a further 10% premium \nto this at €401.5 million, or 21% above consensus. Similarly, with \nconsensus forecasts for cash generation being €284 million, the \ntarget cash generation was set at €307 million, and maximum payout \nat €338 million. Adjusted EBITDA and cash generation for 2022 \nwere €405.6 million and €396.9 million respectively, which resulted \nin a maximum payout under both the adjusted EBITDA and cash \ngeneration elements of the bonus.\nThe Group made good progress against all of the key strategic and \noperational objectives (comprising 20% of the annual bonus) set \nat the beginning of the year.

This was a new \ncriteria introduced in 2022, and is being extended to all members of \nthe senior management team in 2023 in recognition of its strategic \nimportance. The specific ESG measures assessed in 2022 were:\n•\t Safer gambling – innovation in and promotion of safer gambling \nsolutions and insights, including continued uptake and development \nof Playtech Protect solutions\n•\t Environment – continued progress towards our stated emissions \nreduction target of 40% scope 1 and 2 emissions target by 2025 \n(on a 2018 baseline) and increased use of renewable energy \nacross the Group\n•\t DEI targets – annual progress towards increasing female representation \nacross the leadership and senior management population to 35% \nfrom a 2021 baseline\n•\t Reputation, ethics and Compliance – no new material ESG, ethical \nor compliance breaches resulting in significant reputational damage \nfor the Group\n•\t Leadership qualities around crisis management, human compassion, \noperational excellence and standard setting during the Ukraine war \nwhere we have 10% of the global workforce\nIn particular, the Committee took account of the CEO’s exceptional \nleadership and social responsibility in facing the ongoing Ukraine crisis. \nPlaytech has over 700 employees (10%+ of the global workforce) \nin Ukraine, and, before and during the invasion, Playtech’s Crisis \nManagement Group has worked 24/7 to look after our workforce, \nprovide relocation opportunities to adjacent countries and provide \nhumanitarian support whilst ensuring the business continues to \noperate. The Committee is proud of Playtech’s response to this awful \nsituation. Finally, it should be noted that the above has been achieved \nagainst the backdrop of continued corporate activity and takeover \napproaches which have understandably consumed large amounts of \nmanagement time, whilst continuing to deliver record financial results.\nIn this context and recognising the significant progress made in \nrespect of the key strategic, operational and ESG objectives of the \nCompany, the Committee determined to pay a maximum bonus in \nrespect of these objectives. When combined with the maximum \npayout achieved under the financial targets, the overall bonus payout \nfor the CEO and former CFO was 100% of maximum. \nThis amounted to £1.6 million (2021: £1.6m) for the CEO and £613k \n(2021: £549k) for the former CFO. As set out above, the Remuneration \nCommittee determined to not pro-rate the bonus for the former CFO \nin recognition that he was actively employed during the whole financial \nyear, in reflection of the Board’s request for him to remain in the \nbusiness to support an orderly transition.\nNo bonus was payable to the new CFO under this plan in respect \nof the one month of the year served as a Director.\nIn line with the remuneration policy, 33.3% of the annual bonus \npayment to the CEO will be deferred into shares. In light of the \nexceptional Company performance and Andrew Smith’s commitment \nto the Company until the year end, the Committee determined that the \nannual bonus would be paid in cash for the former CFO.\nLTIPs\nThe LTIP granted in 2020 which will vest in October 2023 is subject \nto Adjusted Diluted EPS (25%) and relative TSR (75%) performance. \nAdjusted Diluted EPS for the financial year ending 31 December 2022 \nwas 51.5 Euro cents, which will result in vesting of 93.4% of the EPS \nelement. As at 31 December 2022, the performance period for the \nrelative TSR component of the LTIP is not yet complete (26 October \n2020 – 25 October 2023), and therefore an estimate of the vesting \nunder this element of 50% of maximum has been provided at year end. \nFollowing the end of the performance period, the final vesting level \nwill be calculated and the corresponding LTIP amounts disclosed in \nthe single figure table for financial year ending 31 December 2022 will \nbe updated in the 2023 Directors’ Remuneration Report to reflect the \nfinal outcome.\nThese awards are also subject to a two-year post vesting holding \nperiod, in line with the Policy.\nThe Committee recognises that the CEO also has a one-off equity \nincentive scheme that was approved by shareholders in 2019. This \npartially lapsed during 2022 as a consequence of the share price not \nreaching the £8 share price targets set in 2019. Full details are set out \nin the Annual Report on Remuneration.\nHow we will operate the Policy in 2023\nBase salary\nThe average salary increase for 2023 awarded to those employees \nacross the UK workforce who were eligible to receive a salary increase \nwas 8.1% as a consequence of the rising demand for suitably qualified \ntechnology staff, together with the increased rate of inflation. The \nCommittee is very conscious that the effects of inflationary pressures \naffect the lower paid employees the most, and so decided that all \nBoard members and senior staff (and therefore higher earners) would \nbe limited to an increase of 3.5%. As a consequence, the salary for the \nCEO increased by 3.5% to £844,000 with effect from 1 January 2023. \nAs set out above, the new CFO commenced his role on a basic salary \nof £350,000 (significantly lower than the previous CFO, whose base \nsalary on exit was £445,567), which will increase to £400,000 on 1 July \n2023, and then not change until the next review on 1 January 2025.\nThe Committee has commissioned a market benchmarking exercise \nfor all of the roles within its remit, including those in the wider senior \nmanagement team, and will reflect on the results of this as well as pay \nand conditions across the wider workforce when considering any \nfurther amendments to salary levels next year.\nAnnual bonus\nThe annual bonus opportunity for 2023 will remain unchanged at \n200% and 150% of salary for the CEO and CFO respectively. Financial \nperformance will continue to drive 70% of the bonus and will be split \n50% EBITDA and 20% cash flow. We have set stretching targets for \nboth measures in an inflationary year facing a cost of living crisis, \nmaterial rises in energy costs and the ongoing war in Ukraine (where \nwe employ over 700 people), with target performance set above \nmarket consensus on 25 January 2023 (the date of the meeting of \nthe Remuneration Committee when the targets were set) and with \nmaximum for achieving a material increase above consensus. The \nremaining 30% of the bonus will be based on key strategic targets \nwhich will again include ESG measures relating to safer gambling, \ndiversity and reduction of the Company’s Scope 1, Scope 2 and \nsupply chain emissions. The targets will have a graduated approach \nto differentiating between good and excellent performance, with full \ndisclosure in next year’s Annual Report.\nIn line with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, 33.3% of any annual \nbonus payment will be deferred into shares for two years.\n113\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nRemuneration Report"

There are no proposals to amend the \nDirectors’ Remuneration Policy at the 2023 AGM. \nA summary of the policy is set out below for reference to assist with \nthe understanding of the contents of this report. The full policy is \ndetailed in our 2020 Annual Report, which can be found in the “Investors” \nsection under “Annual Reports” on the Company’s corporate website \n(www.playtech.com). \nRemuneration philosophy\nOur Remuneration Policy is designed to reward the contributions \nof senior management as well as incentivise it to drive shareholder \nreturns, and to maintain and enhance Playtech’s position as the \nsoftware and services provider of choice to the gambling sector.\nRemuneration is delivered via fixed remuneration and simple and \ntransparent incentive-based plans enabling the Executive Directors \nto be rewarded for delivering strong financial performance and \nsustainable returns to shareholders. In a fast-moving sector such as \nours we need to apply the Policy flexibly in order to deliver the right \nlevel of overall pay to Directors.\nConsiderations when forming the Remuneration Policy \nThis Policy has been formed in accordance with the principles and \nprovisions in the Code. The table below sets out how the Committee \nhas addressed various aspects in the Code:\n•\t Clarity – The Committee’s policy has been clearly set out in this \nreport, the individual elements of remuneration and their operation\n•\t \tSimplicity – This proposed Policy is well understood by \nboth management and shareholders and aligns to typical \nmarket practice\n•\t Risk – The Committee believes that the incentive structure does not \nencourage undue risk taking. There are a number of mechanisms \navailable to the Committee, including discretions and malus and \nclawback provisions within incentive plans, that allow adjustment in \nthe case that the Committee believes the outcomes are excessive \n•\t Predictability – The Policy table and the illustrations of remuneration \nprovide an illustration of potential levels of remuneration that may \nresult from the application of the Policy under different performance \nscenarios. The Committee believes that the range of remuneration \nscenarios is appropriate for the roles and responsibilities of the \nExecutive Directors, based on the performance required for \nincentive awards to pay out\n•\t Proportionality – The Policy has been designed to give appropriate \nflexibility in operation, particularly in relation to incentive plan \nmetrics, which allows the Committee to implement the Policy from \nyear to year using the metrics that align with the Group’s strategy. \nFurthermore, the Policy contains discretion to allow the Committee \nto adjust remuneration outcomes to ensure that they are reflective \nof overall performance in the short and long term \n•\t Alignment to culture – As well as aligning with the strategy of the \nbusiness, the Policy has been formed to allow focus on broader \nstakeholders. In particular, there is an increased focus on employee \nand shareholder engagement through incentive metrics and \nCommittee discretion\nRemuneration Policy for Executive Directors\nThe following table summarises each element of remuneration, how it supports the Company’s short and long-term strategic objectives \nand changes the Committee is proposing to the current Policy based on shareholder feedback.\nElement of \nremuneration\nShort-term and long-term \nstrategic objectives\nOperation\nOpportunity\nFramework to \nassess performance\nBase salary\nTo attract, retain and \nmotivate high calibre \nindividuals for the role \nand duties required\nTo provide a market \ncompetitive salary \nrelative to the \nexternal market\nTo reflect appropriate \nskills, development and \nexperience over time\nNormally reviewed annually by the \nRemuneration Committee, with any \nincreases typically effective in January \nTakes account of the external market \nand other relevant factors including \ninternal relativities and individual \nperformance.

The Committee reviewed the Executive Directors’ salaries with effect from 1 January 2022. It was decided that Mor Weizer and Andrew Smith’s salary would be increased by 2% and 3.5% \nrespectively. Chris McGinnis was appointed to the Board on 28 November 2022 on a base salary of £350,000 and therefore the amounts disclosed are in respect of the period he served as a Director.\n2\t \u0007The figures for bonuses represent payments as determined by the Remuneration Committee for the Executive Directors based on the Company’s performance during each financial year and \nby reference to their actual salary earned during the respective period. The bonuses were determined in Pounds Sterling and then converted into Euros at the exchange rates applicable as at \n31 December 2021 and 31 December 2022 respectively. Details of (a) how the annual performance bonus for the Executive Directors was determined; and (b) the timing of bonus payments are \nset out below. Chris McGinnis was appointed to the Board on 28 November 2022 but did not receive a bonus in respect of the period he served as a Director.\n3\t \u0007The LTIP awards granted in February 2019 vested subject to performance conditions measured over a three-year period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2021. As a result of the performance \nconditions being partially met, 46.16% of the award will vest. This performance outcome corresponds to a total of 217,787 and 68,437 nil cost options for Mor Weizer and Andrew Smith. The value \nincluded in the table is therefore £1,440,661 (€1,727,051) and £452,710 (€542,704), based on the share price on vesting (1 March 2022) of £6.615 (€7.93), of which £520,729 (€653,361) and £163,632 \n(€205,310) relates to share price appreciation respectively.\n4\t \u0007The LTIP awards granted in October 2020 vest after three years subject to an EPS performance condition (measured over a three-year period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022) and relative \nTSR performance conditions (measured over a three-year period from 26 October 2020 to 25 October 2023). Based on performance to 31 December 2022, the final vesting outcome under the EPS \ncondition is 93.4%. However, as we are still partway through the performance period for the relative TSR performance condition, we have used an estimate of the vesting as at 31 December 2022 (equal \nto 50% of the relative TSR element, 37.5% of the overall award). Considering both the EPS and estimated relative TSR outcomes, 60.9% of the award is estimated to vest. This performance outcome \ncorresponds to a total of 332,216 and 49,832 nil cost options for Mor Weizer and Chris McGinnis respectively. The value included in the table for Mor and Chris is therefore £1,690,979 (€1,906,920) and \n£253,645 (€286,036), based on the share price on 31 December 2022 of £5.09 (€5.74), of which £474,072 (€564,767) and £71,110 (€84,714) relates to share price appreciation respectively. Further details \non the estimated LTIP outcomes for the 2022 awards are set out on pages 121 and 122. As part of the settlement agreement with Andrew Smith, the Committee determined to settle the in-flight 2022 LTIP \naward via a payment of £208,857, based on the time pro-ration between the grant date and the end of his notice period.\n5\t \u0007No awards that were granted to Mor Weizer in December 2019 vested in 2022, compared to 700,000 options that vested in 2021 partially vested during the 2021 financial year, with 300,000 options \nvesting on 26 November 2021 and 400,000 options vesting on 14 December 2021. The value included in the table is therefore £2,208,000 (€2,601,000) and £2,906,000 (€3,412,000) respectively, \nbased on the share prices on vesting of £7.36 (€8.67) and £7.265 (€8.53), of which £1,050,300 (€1,251,000) and £1,362,400 (€1,612,000) relates to share price appreciation.\n6\t \u0007Benefits include private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, car and life assurance.\n119\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nRemuneration Report"

This is \nincluded within the table above.\n4\t \u0007The Non-executive Directors did not receive an increase in the year, having had their fees amended on 1 October 2021. Ian Penrose was appointed as Senior Independent Director, effective from \n1 October 2021. \n5\t \u0007The Chairman and Non-executive Directors received additional fees in respect of the significant additional work performed in the year, arising from the intense and lengthy corporate activity and \nglobal regulatory work. It is estimated that each of the Chairman and Non-executive Directors spent at least an additional 32 days working in 2022 over and above their contracted days. As such, it \nwas determined that an additional fee equating to £132,000 (2021: £120,000) would be payable. This amount was based on the annual fee level for the Senior Independent Director, and then scaled \nback so that the amount was no more than 10% above the additional fees paid in respect of 2021, despite the more than 50% increase in additional days’ work/commitment. It is not anticipated that \nadditional fees will be payable in respect of 2023. The amounts included in the table above in respect of 2021 have been updated to reflect the additional amounts paid in 2022 in respect of additional \nwork completed during 2021. \nDetermination of 2021 bonus \nIn accordance with the Company’s Remuneration Policy, the CEO and CFO had the opportunity to earn a bonus in respect of 2021 of 200% \nand 150% of salary respectively. 2021 performance was assessed against a mixture of financial and non-financial targets as set out below. \nThe bonus was payable on a sliding scale of 0% for threshold to 100% for maximum performance.\nPerformance metric\nWeighting\nThreshold\nMaximum\nActual\nCEO payout level \n(% of maximum)\nCFO payout level \n(% of maximum)\nFinancial (70%)\nAdjusted EBITDA (€’m)\n50%\n347.0\n401.5\n405.6\n50%\n50%\nCash flow (€’m)\n20%\n292.0\n338.0\n396.9\n20%\n20%\nStrategic and non-financial (30%)\n30%\nSee below\n30%\n30%\nTotal\n100%\n100%\n100%\nAs set out in the 2021 Directors’ Remuneration Report, the financial performance targets were divided this year between Adjusted EBITDA and \ncash flow, with 50% and 20% weightings respectively. The targets for Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow were set cognisant of analyst consensus \nas at January 2022. \nAdjusted EBITDA and cash generation are the key financial performance metrics of the Company most closely representing the underlying \ntrading performance of the business. When setting the EBITDA targets for 2022, the Committee and Board took into consideration both \nconsensus estimates and internal forecasts. \nThe financial performance of Playtech was strong in 2022, despite the enormous distractions and challenges faced due to the lengthy takeover \nactivity and corporate transactions. \nAt the beginning of the year, the Committee set challenging metrics for the Executive Directors and reviewed the approach to calibrating \nperformance targets, Following this review, the Committee determined to increase the level of stretch within the targets such that the level \nof performance required to achieve maximum payouts under the financial targets was to exceed target by 10%. This was an increase on the \napproach taken in 2021 which required a 5% outperformance of target to achieve maximum payout.\nCognisant of consensus forecasts for EBITDA (€331 million), the Committee set target EBITDA (equivalent to a 50% payout under the EBITDA \nelement) at €365 million (10% above consensus), and maximum payout for delivering 110% of target EBITDA of €401.5 million (21% above \nconsensus). Similarly, with consensus forecasts for cash generation being €284 million, the target cash generation was set at €307 million, and \nmaximum payout at €338 million. EBITDA and cash generation was €405.6 million and €396.9 million respectively, which resulted in a maximum \npayout under both the EBITDA and cash generation elements of the bonus. \n120 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nRemuneration Report"

      "text": "The non-financial performance targets (representing 30% of the total \nbonus potential) were selected to underpin key strategic objectives \nof the Group aligned with the business strategy. The Group made \ngood progress against many of the key strategic and operational \nobjectives set at the beginning of the year. The CEO was tasked with \ncompleting the disposal of the Finalto business (2.5%), accelerating \nthe performance and market positioning of the LATAM business \n(5%), continuing to drive the digital growth/channel shift in Snaitech \nto improve the quality of earnings and therefore value (7.5%), and \naccelerating Playtech’s position in the rapidly growing market in \nthe United States (5%). The former CFO was tasked with improving \nthe structure and efficiency of the balance sheet (10%), supporting \nthe CEO on certain strategic initiatives (5%), and to commence the \noverview of the business integration and efficiency plan to drive \nmaterial cost efficiencies and additional cash generation in 2023 \nand particularly 2024 (5%).\nIn addition, for both the CEO and former CFO, 10% (out of the 30% \npotential for non-financial performance measures) was allocated \ntowards ESG targets. This was a new criteria introduced in 2022, and \nis being extended to all members of the senior management team in \n2023. These were: \n•\t Safer gambling – continued uptake and development of Playtech \nProtect solutions and safer gambling features.\n•\t Environment – continued progress towards our stated emissions \nreduction target of 40% scope 1 and 2 emissions target by 2025 \n(on a 2018 baseline) and supply chain emissions reduction as \ncompared to a 2020 baseline.\n•\t DEI targets – annual progress towards increasing female leadership \nto 35% from a 2021 baseline.\n•\t Reputation, ethics and Compliance – no new material ESG, ethical \nor compliance breaches resulting in significant reputational damage \nfor the Group.\nIn particular, the Committee took account of the CEO’s exceptional \nleadership and social responsibility in facing the ongoing Ukraine \ncrisis. Playtech has over 700 employees (10%+ of the global \nworkforce) in Ukraine, and, before and during the invasion, Playtech’s \nCrisis Management Group has worked 24/7 to look after our \nworkforce, provide relocation opportunities to adjacent countries and \nprovide humanitarian support whilst ensuring the business continues \nto operate. The Committee is proud of Playtech’s response to this \nawful situation. Finally, it should be noted that the above has been \nachieved against the backdrop of continued corporate activity and \ntakeover approaches which have understandably consumed large \namounts of management time, whilst continuing to deliver record \nfinancial results.\nIn this context and recognising the significant progress made in \nrespect of the key strategic, operational and ESG objectives of the \nCompany, the Committee determined to pay a maximum bonus in \nrespect of these objectives. When combined with the maximum \npayout achieved under the financial targets, the overall bonus payout \nfor the CEO and former CFO was 100% of maximum. \nThis amounted to £1.6 million (2021: £1.6m) for the CEO, £613k \n(2021: £549k) for the former CFO. As set out in Chair’s statement, the \nRemuneration Committee determined to not pro-rate the bonus for \nthe former CFO in recognition that he was actively employed during \nthe whole financial year, in reflection of the Board’s request to remain \nin the business to support an orderly transition.\nNo bonus was payable to the new CFO in respect of the one month \nof the year served as a Director.\nIn line with the Policy, 33.3% of these payments will be deferred into \nshares for two years for the CEO.

Following the normal assessment \nof performance, Andrew Smith received an annual bonus payment of \n£668,351, of which £55,696 (1 month) was in respect of the period of \nemployment whilst not a Director.\n2020 LTIP\nThe in-flight LTIP award that was granted in October 2020 will \nvest in accordance with the normal timescales and be subject to \nperformance. Given that the granting of these awards was delayed \nfrom the usual grant date in March due to the Remuneration \nCommittee pausing the grant due to the impact of COVID-19, it was \nagreed that the time pro-rating for this award would be disapplied as \nAndrew Smith will have served a full three-year term based on the \nnormal LTIP grant cycle, taking into account his notice period.\nIn addition, as part of the settlement agreement, it was agreed that \nthe 2020 LTIP award would be underpinned to vest at least equal \nto two thirds of maximum for Andrew Smith, cognisant of an interim \nassessment of performance as at the date of his stepping down from \nthe Board (c.92% of maximum vesting).\nThe value of this award at vesting will be disclosed in the 2023 \nDirectors’ Remuneration Report.\nCompensation for Loss of Office\nThe Compensation for Loss of Office is set out below:\n•\t £222,783 in respect of salary between 1 December 2022 and \n31 May 2023, of which £185,653 relates to the financial year \nending 31 December 2023.\n•\t £45,690 in respect of pension and benefits between 1 December 2022 \nand 31 May 2023, of which £38,074 relates to the financial year \nending 31 December 2023. \n•\t £37,131 payable on 31 May 2023 in respect of the employee’s loss \nof employment rights.\nNo payments other than those set out above were made to past \nDirectors in 2022.\nImplementation of Policy for 2023\nThis section sets out the proposed implementation of the Directors’ \nRemuneration Policy in 2023. The proposed implementation does \nnot contain any deviations from the Directors’ Remuneration Policy \napproved by shareholders at the 2021 AGM.\nSalary and fee review\nAs stated last year, salary reviews for the Executive Directors take \nplace at the beginning of the calendar year as this will result in the \nalignment of salary reviews with the Company’s financial year.\nAccordingly, the Committee reviewed the salary for Mr Weizer, and \nit was decided that Mr Weizer would receive a salary increase of \n3.5%, effective from 1 January 2023. The average salary increase for \n2023 awarded to those employees across the UK workforce who \nwere eligible for a salary increase was 8.1%. As stated previously, \nMr McGinnis, who was appointed CFO on 28 November 2022, did \nnot receive a salary increase on 1 January 2023, but will receive an \nincrease to £400,000 on 1 July 2023. He will then not receive an \nincrease until 1 January 2025.\nThe Committee has commissioned a market benchmarking exercise \nfor all of the roles within its remit, including those in the wider senior \nmanagement team, and will reflect on the results of this as well as pay \nand conditions across the wider workforce when considering any \nfurther amendments to salary levels next year.\nIt was also determined that the fee for the Chairman should increase \nby 3.5%, in line with the CEO and significantly below the 8.1% average \nsalary increase awarded to those employees across the UK workforce \nwho were eligible for a salary increase. The Board decided that \nthe fees for the Non-executive Directors and Senior Independent \nDirector should be increased, proportionate with the increased time \ncommitment of these roles to reflect their close involvement in improved \nbusiness performance, with improved oversight in the running of the \nbusiness and focus on improving governance across the business, \ncommittees and global regulation. The Board wanted to maintain the \ncurrent high level of engagement of the NEDs in the business, both in \nthe UK and overseas, and to stop the payment of additional fees for \nadditional time spent, except in exceptional circumstances.\nAs such, the current basic salary levels of the Executive and Non-\nexecutive Directors from 1 January 2023 (together with the Euro \nequivalent at 31 December 2022 based on the exchange rate between \nSterling and Euro used in the accounts) are: \n•\t Mor Weizer: £844,560 (€971,515);\n•\t Chris McGinnis: £350,000 (€402,612).\n•\t Chairman: £350,000 (€402,612); \n•\t Non-executive Director base fee: £140,000 (€160,771);\n•\t Additional Committee Chair fee: £15,000 (€17,255); and\n•\t Senior Independent Director fee: £160,000 (€184,051).\nBenefits\nBenefit will continue to be in line with the approved Policy. \nPension\nThe pension contributions to Executive Directors will be 7.5% of salary, \nwhich is in line with the wider workforce.\nAnnual bonus\nThe annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged at 200% of \nsalary for the CEO and 150% of salary for the CFO.\nFor 2023, bonuses for the Executive Directors will be based on \nthe following: \nWeighting\nPerformance target\nAdjusted EBITDA\n50%\nCommercially confidential\nCash flow\n20%\nCommercially confidential\nNon-financial and strategic \nobjectives\n30%\nCommercially confidential\nThe Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow targets have been set above \nCity consensus in line with the business plan. Maximum payout for \nachieving the financial targets has been set for achieving 110% of the \nstretching target level. The Committee considers the precise targets \nto be commercially confidential at this time, but these will be disclosed \nretrospectively in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.\nFollowing the successful introduction of ESG measures in 2022, the \nCommittee has again set ESG measures for the 2023 bonus, including \nmeasures relating to safer gambling, diversity and reduction of the \nCompany’s Scope 1, Scope 2 and supply chain emissions.\nThe level of bonus payable by reference to the financial performance \nof the Company will be determined on a sliding scale. There will be \nretrospective disclosure of the targets and performance in next \nyear’s report.\n123\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nRemuneration Report"

      "text": "Role and membership \nThe Remuneration Committee is currently comprised entirely of three independent Non-executive Directors as defined in the Code. Ian Penrose \nchairs the Committee, and the other members are Linda Marston-Weston and Anna Massion. \nDetails of attendance at the Remuneration Committee meetings are set out on page 101 and their biographies and experience on pages 96 to 97. \nThe Committee operates within agreed terms of reference detailing its authority and responsibilities. The Committee’s terms of reference are \navailable for inspection on the Company’s website, www.playtech.com, and include: \n•\t determining and agreeing the Policy for the remuneration of the CEO, the CFO, the Chairman and other members of the senior \nmanagement team;\n•\t reviewing the broad Policy framework for remuneration to ensure it remains appropriate and relevant;\n•\t \treviewing the design of and determining targets for any performance-related pay and the annual level of payments under such plans;\n•\t reviewing the design of and approving any changes to long-term incentive or option plans; and\n•\t ensuring that contractual terms on termination and payments made are fair to the individual and the Company and that failure is not rewarded.\nThe Remuneration Committee also considers the terms and conditions of employment and overall remuneration of Executive Directors, the \nCompany Secretary and members of the senior management team and has regard to the Company’s overall approach to the remuneration of all \nemployees. Within this context the Committee determines the overall level of salaries, incentive payments and performance-related pay due to \nExecutive Directors and senior management. The Committee also determines the performance targets and the extent of their achievement for \nboth annual and long-term incentive awards operated by the Company and affecting the senior management. In order to manage any potential \nconflicts of interest, no Director is involved in any decisions as to his/her own remuneration.\nThe Remuneration Committee takes advice from both inside and outside the Group on a range of matters, including the scale and composition \nof the total remuneration package payable to people with similar responsibilities, skills and experience in comparable companies, sectors and \ngeographies that have extensive operations inside and outside the UK. A benchmarking exercise of the highest paid 20 individuals has recently \nbeen undertaken, to provide assurance that the remuneration levels and structures remain appropriate.\nDuring the year the Remuneration Committee received assistance and advice from the Company Secretary, Brian Moore (who is also secretary \nto the Committee). \nThe Remuneration Committee has a planned schedule of at least three meetings throughout the year, with additional meetings and zoom calls \nheld when necessary. During 2022, the Committee met ten times, addressing a wide variety of issues, including: \nMonth\nPrincipal activity\nJanuary and February\n•\t Review of bonus and other incentivisation arrangements in relation to Executive Directors and \nmembers of senior management\n•\t Review of pay increases for 2022\n•\t Consideration of ongoing corporate takeover activity on staff morale and incentivisation with the \nongoing close period and uncertain future\nMay, June and July\n•\t Consideration of voting at AGM\nAugust, September \nand October\n•\t Discussions to introduce ESG component to senior management team bonuses\n•\t Review of long-term bonus proposals for over 400 members of the team\n•\t Consideration of remuneration package for the incoming CFO, and the terms of the compensation for \nloss of office of the former CFO\nNovember and December\n•\t Review of long-term financial and bonus targets for Snaitech in Italy\n•\t Consideration of remuneration matters for 2023\nExternal advisers\nAs a result of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s (PwC’s) appointment as reporting accountant in relation to Finalto during 2020, the firm stood \ndown as independent adviser to the Committee. Following the completion of the sale of Finalto in 2022, later in 2022 PwC were reappointed as \nthe independent adviser to the Committee. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under \nthe code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. Total fees for advice provided to the Committee were £69,200 on \na time and materials basis.\n127\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nRemuneration Report"

Following the AGM and \nthroughout the year during the takeover period and discussions, the \nGroup has continued to engage with shareholders. The principal \nreason given by those shareholders who were unable to support \nthe resolutions related to payouts under the one-off equity incentive \nscheme approved in 2019. Shareholders were more supportive of the \nchanges to remuneration implemented since 2021 and therefore the \nCommittee has not made any changes to how it operates the ongoing \nRemuneration Policy during 2022. \nThe Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the Directors’ Annual Report \non Remuneration were each subject to a shareholder vote at the AGM \nheld on 26 May 2021 and 30 June 2022 respectively, the results of \nwhich were as follows:\nFor\nAgainst\nWithheld\nApproval of \nRemuneration Report\n166,001,674\n(69.67%)\n72,258,663\n(30.33%)\n107,756\nApproval of \nRemuneration Policy\n177,453,581\n(75.47%)\n57,668,932\n(24.53%)\n155,838\nEngagement with the wider workforce\nWith respect to employee engagement, the Board and Chairman of \nthe Remuneration Committee engages with the COO of B2B, the CEO \nof Snaitech and Global Head of Human Resources on strategic and \noperational issues affecting and of interest to the workforce, including \nremuneration, talent pipeline and diversity and inclusion. The COO \nand CEO are standing attendees at the Board meetings. In addition, \nthe Company has established a Speak Up hotline, which enables \nemployees to raise concerns confidentially and independently of \nmanagement. Any concerns raised are reported into the Head of \nLegal and Head of Compliance for discussion and consideration by \nthe Risk Committee. The Board considers the current mechanisms \nappropriate for understanding and factoring in stakeholder concerns \ninto plc level decision making. However, the Board will assess whether \nadditional mechanisms can strengthen its understanding and \nengagement of stakeholder concerns in the future.\nSpecifically, wide-ranging discussions were held around \nremuneration, reviewing benchmarking data about the \ncompetitiveness of Playtech’s basic pay levels compared to peer \ngroups and geographies. Bonus targets and quanta were reviewed to \ncontinue to improve the alignment of individual and Group operating \nand strategic performance. The Committee also took the opportunity \nto consider the list of team members who historically have been \neligible for an LTIP grant, to ensure that this element of aligning \nemployee and shareholder interests remains appropriate. There \nwas significant engagement around the wide-ranging implications \nof the Takeover Offer by Aristocrat for the Company, the subsequent \ncorporate activity around other potential acquirers, and also around \nthe uncertainties created for the business and its employees by the \nnumerous items of corporate activity that affected the Company \nthroughout much of 2021 and 2022. \nFurthermore, and working in conjunction with the ESG Committee, \nseveral discussions were held reviewing the Company’s approach to \ndiversity and inclusion, followed by setting the Company goals and \ntargets in this area.\nDuring 2022, the Board discussed, reviewed and engaged on a \nnumber of stakeholder issues. The material stakeholder topics \ndiscussed by the Board in 2022 included: \n•\t executive compensation and pay;\n•\t environmental, social and governance matters;\n•\t developing the business in markets;\n•\t corporate governance;\n•\t diversity;\n•\t inclusion and gender pay gap and regulatory and compliance \ndevelopments;\n•\t safer gambling;\n•\t data protection;\n•\t environment;\n•\t anti-money laundering and anti-bribery and corruption;\n•\t human rights and modern slavery;\n•\t responsible supply chain and procurement; and\n•\t commercial developments with B2B licensees and third parties.\nBy order of the Board \nIan Penrose \nChair of the Remuneration Committee \n23 March 2023\n128 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nRemuneration Report"

Critical accounting estimates \naffecting the carrying values of assets and liabilities of the Group are \ndiscussed in Note 6 to the financial statements. \nThe principal and emerging risks are set out in detail in the Strategic \nReport on pages 85 to 90 together with a description of the ongoing \nmitigating actions being taken across the Group. The Board carries \nout a robust assessment of these risks on an annual basis, with \nregular updates being presented at Board and Board Committee \nmeetings. These meetings receive updates from Finance, Legal, \nTax, Operations, Internal Audit, Regulatory and Compliance, Data \nProtection, Human Resources, IT Security and Group Secretariat. \nThe Group maintains a risk register which is monitored and reviewed \non a continuous basis.\nDuring 2022, the Board carried out an assessment of these principal \nrisks facing the Group, including those factors that would threaten its \nfuture performance, solvency or liquidity. This assessment considered \nthe current situation around the potential impact of the Ukraine crisis. \nThis ongoing assessment forms part of the Group’s strategic plan. \nAfter making appropriate enquiries and having regard to the \nGroup’s cash balances and normal business planning and control \nprocedures, to include a detailed analysis of various scenarios, \nthe Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company \nand the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational \nexistence and meet their liabilities for a period of at least 15 months \nfrom the date of approval of the financial statements. In respect of \nthe viability assessment, the Directors reviewed a five-year forecast \nconsidering the viability status for the period to December 2027 in \naccordance with the Group’s five-year plan, which is considered \nto be an appropriate period over which the Group can predict its \nrevenue, cost base and cash flows with a higher degree of certainty, \nas opposed to more arbitrary forms of forecasts based solely on \npercentage increases. Notwithstanding projected profitability over \nthe forecast period, the Directors have no reason to believe that the \nGroup’s viability will be threatened over a period longer than that \ncovered by the positive confirmation of long-term viability as per the \nViability Statement on pages 91 and 92.

Accordingly, to the \nextent a relevant threshold of ownership is passed, or to the extent any \nshareholder may be found by any such regulator to be able to exercise \nsignificant and/or relevant financial influence over the Company and \nis indicated by a regulator to be unsuitable, a holder of an interest in \nordinary shares may be subject to such restrictions or compelled \nto sell its ordinary shares (or have such ordinary shares sold on \nits behalf).\nVoting rights \nSubject to any special rights or restrictions as to voting attached to \nany shares by or in accordance with the articles of association, on a \nshow of hands every member who is present in person or by proxy \nand entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll every member who \nis present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote for \nevery share of which he is the holder.\nRestrictions on voting \nNo member shall, unless the Board otherwise determines, be entitled \nto vote at a general meeting or at any separate meeting of the holders \nof any class of shares, either in person or by proxy, in respect of any \nshare held by him or to exercise any right as a member unless all \ncalls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of that share \nhave been paid to the Company. In addition, any member who having \nbeen served with a notice by the Company requiring such member to \ndisclose to the Board in writing, within such reasonable period as may \nbe specified in such notice, details of any past or present beneficial \ninterest of any third party in the shares or any other interest of any kind \nwhatsoever which a third party may have in the shares, and the identity \nof the third party having or having had any such interest, fails to do so \nmay be disenfranchised by service of a notice by the Board.\nTransfer \nSubject to the articles of association, any member may transfer all or \nany of his or her certificated shares by an instrument of transfer in any \nusual form or in any other form which the Board may approve.

This requires the \nfaithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and \nconditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria \nfor assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International \nAccounting Standards Board’s “Framework for the Preparation and \nPresentation of Financial Statements”. In virtually all circumstances, \na fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial \nstatements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure \nFramework (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under \nthose standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.

Our evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group and the Parent Company’s ability to continue to \nadopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements included:\n•\t Evaluating the Directors’ process in making its assessment, including the period covered, including confirming the assessment and underlying \nprojections were prepared by appropriate individuals with sufficient knowledge of the detailed figures as well as an understanding of the \nGroup’s markets, strategies and risks;\n•\t Understanding and corroborating the achievability of key Director assumptions in their cash flow forecasts and challenging these against \nour knowledge of the prior year, our knowledge of the business and industry, and other areas of the audit;\n•\t Checking through enquiry with the Directors, review of Board minutes and review of external resources for any key future events that may \nhave been omitted from cash flow forecasts and assessing the impact these could have on future cash flows and cash reserves;\n•\t Assessing the Directors’ stress test scenarios and challenging whether other reasonably possible scenarios could occur and including \nin our assessment where appropriate;\n•\t Assessing the Directors’ reverse stress test to analyse the level of reduction in EBITDA that could be sustained before a covenant breach \nor liquidity event would be indicated; \n•\t Confirming the financing facilities, repayment terms and financial covenants to supporting documentation;\n•\t Reviewing the Directors’ assessment of covenant compliance throughout the forecast period to 30 June 2024;\n•\t Considering the impact of inflation including energy costs and other macroeconomic matters;\n•\t Ensuring any large non-routine payments are considered as part of the Directors’ assessment, this included matters such as the repayment \nof the 2023 bond of €200 million; \n•\t Challenging the Directors as to matters outside of the going concern assessment period, principally relating to the timing and cost of the \nItalian license renewals; and\n•\t Considering the adequacy of the disclosures relating to going concern included within the Annual Report against the requirements of the \naccounting standards and consistency of the disclosure against the forecasts and going concern assessment.\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or \ncollectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 \nmonths from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. \n136 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

The valuation methodology has \ntherefore changed from using the SPAC \ntransaction price to a discounted cash flow \n(DCF) approach as at 31 December 2022. \nThe DCF approach introduces additional \nrisk due to the additional estimates and \njudgements required.\nAs the Group announced publicly on 6 \nFebruary 2023, it is seeking a declaration \nfrom the English Courts to obtain clarification \nof a point of disagreement with Caliplay.

Should it be declared \nthat Caliplay still has its redemption option and \nCaliplay then exercises said option, this would \ncancel the equity option held by the Group.\nWith the support of our valuation experts, we challenged the key \nassumptions used in the discounted cash flow models – this included:\n•\t Challenge of the cash flows used and where possible, comparison \nto third party market data;\n•\t Recalculated the discount rates and challenged as to whether \nappropriate risk premiums have been applied;\n•\t Assessed the sensitivity analysis performed to changes in key \nassumptions (such as discount rate, EBITDA margin, exit multiples, \nexit date and post exit restrictions on realising value of the shares) \nand considered any additional sensitivities required based on the \naudit team’s assessment of the key inputs and judgements; \n•\t Confirmed to contractual terms the expected share holdings of \nthe Group on exercise of the options; and\n•\t Checked the underlying models for mathematical accuracy.\nIn respect of the valuation of the options, management were supported \nby a third-party expert.

Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be \nevaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, \nwhen evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole. \nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole and performance materiality as follows:\nGroup financial statements\nParent Company financial statements\n2022\n€’m \n2021\n€’m\n2022\n€’m \n2021\n€’m \nMateriality\n12.0\n7.9\n6.0\n4.5\nBasis for determining \nmateriality\n3% of Adjusted EBITDA\n2.5% of Adjusted EBITDA\n50% of group materiality\n55% of group materiality\nRationale for the \nbenchmark applied\nAlthough the previous offer \nto acquire the company \nhas expired, Adjusted \nEBITDA was the underlying \nbenchmark used in \ndetermining the offer \nprice and is a key metric \nused by analysts and the \nDirectors in assessing \nthe performance of \nthe business and in \nbanking covenants. \nGiven the potential corporate \ntransaction activity, \nAdjusted EBITDA (which \nwas the underlying basis \nfor the Aristocrat offer) was \nconsidered to be the metric \nof greatest interest to users of \nthe financial statements. \n2% of total assets \ncapped at 50% of Group \nmateriality. This was \ncalculated as a percentage \nof Group materiality for \nGroup reporting purposes \ngiven the assessment of \naggregation risk.\n2% of total assets capped \nat 55% of Group materiality. \nThis was calculated as \na percentage of Group \nmateriality for Group \nreporting purposes \ngiven the assessment of \naggregation risk.\nPerformance materiality\n7.8\n5.5\n3.9\n3.2\nBasis for determining \nperformance materiality\n65% of Group materiality \n– this was set by the audit \nteam with reference to \nthe level of adjustments \nidentified in the prior year, \nlevel of sampling work \nrequired and the number \nof components.\n70% of Group materiality – \nthis was set by the audit team \nwith reference to the level of \nadjustments identified in the \nprior year, level of sampling \nwork required and the \nnumber of components. \n65% of Parent Company \nmateriality – this was \nset by the audit team \nwith reference to the \nlevel of adjustments \nidentified in the prior year, \nlevel of sampling work \nrequired and the number \nof components. \n70% of Parent Company \nmateriality – this was set by \nthe audit team with reference \nto the level of adjustments \nidentified in the prior year, \nlevel of sampling work \nrequired and the number \nof components. \nComponent materiality\nWe set materiality for each component of the Group based on a percentage of between 25% and 60% (2021: 9% and 63%) of Group \nmateriality dependent on the size and our assessment of the risk of material misstatement of that component. Component materiality ranged \nfrom €3 million to €7 million (2021: €0.8 million to €5.0 million). In the audit of each component, we further applied performance materiality \nlevels of 65% (2021: 70%) of the component materiality to our testing to ensure that the risk of errors exceeding component materiality was \nappropriately mitigated.\nReporting threshold \nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all individual audit differences in excess of €240k (2021: €136k). We also \nagreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n141\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other \nthan the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, \nexcept to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is \nto read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or \nour knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies \nor apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements \nthemselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are \nrequired to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nDirectors’ Remuneration Report\nThe Parent Company voluntarily prepares a Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006. \nThe Directors have requested that we audit the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report specified by the Companies Act 2006 to be audited \nas if the Company were a UK registered listed company. In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been \nproperly prepared in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006.\nCorporate governance statement\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate \nGovernance Statement relating to the Parent Company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for \nour review. \nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance \nStatement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit. \nGoing concern and \nlonger-term viability\n•\t The Directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting \nand any material uncertainties identified set out on page 84; and\n•\t The Directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the Group’s prospects, the period this assessment covers \nand why the period is appropriate set out on page 91.\nOther Code \nprovisions \n•\t Directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 134;\n•\t Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 91; \n•\t The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control \nsystems set out on pages 85 to 90; and\n•\t The section describing the work of the Audit Committee set out on pages 106 to 110.\nResponsibilities of Directors\nAs explained more fully in the Directors’ Governance report, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for \nbeing satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation \nof financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a \ngoing concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors \neither intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, \nwhether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is \nnot a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements \ncan arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the \neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n142 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

The extent to which \nour procedures are capable of detecting non-compliance are detailed below:\n•\t We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates, through \ndiscussion with management and the Audit Committee and our knowledge of the industry. We focused on significant laws and regulations \nthat could give rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements, including, but not limited to, the IoM Companies Act 2006, the UK \nListing Rules, certain gaming license requirements, IFRSs as it applies in the UK and tax legislation; and\n•\t We considered compliance with these laws and regulations through discussions with management, in-house legal counsel, head of \ncompliance, Group tax director and as well as reviewing internal audit reports. Our procedures also included reviewing minutes from Board \nmeetings of those charges with governance to identify any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations.\nExtent to which the audit was capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\nWe design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including \nfraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\n•\t We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur. In addressing \nthe risk of fraud including management override of controls and improper revenue recognition, we tested the appropriateness of journal \nentries made throughout the year by applying specific criteria;\n•\t We performed a detailed review of the Group’s year end adjusting entries and journals throughout the year, investigated any that appeared \nunusual as to nature or amount; assessed whether the judgements made in accounting estimates were indicative of a potential bias and tested \nthe risk of manipulation of IT systems with regards revenue recognition (see key audit matter above); and\n•\t We also communicated potential fraud risks to all engagement team members and component auditors, and remained alert to any indications \nof fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.\nOur audit procedures were designed to respond to risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, recognising that the risk of not \ndetecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate \nconcealment by, for example, forgery, misrepresentations or through collusion. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures performed \nand the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the \nless likely we are to become aware of it.\nA further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. \nThis description forms part of our auditor’s report.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the Parent Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 80C of the Isle of Man Companies Act \n2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Parent Company’s members those matters we are required to state \nto them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to \nanyone other than the Parent Company and the Parent Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions \nwe have formed.\nOliver Chinneck (Recognised Auditor)\nFor and on behalf of BDO LLP, Statutory Auditor \nLondon, UK\n23 March 2023\nBDO LLP is a limited liability partnership registered in England and Wales (with registered number OC305127).\n143\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements\nNote 1 – General\nPlaytech plc (the “Company”) is an Isle of Man company. The registered office is located at St George’s Court, Upper Church Street, Douglas, \nIsle of Man IM1 1EE. \nThese consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).\nNote 2 – Basis of preparation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the UK adopted International Accounting Standards (IAS). \nThey were authorised for issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on 23 March 2023.\nDetails of the Group’s accounting policies are included in Note 5. \nGoing concern basis\nIn adopting the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements, the Directors have considered the current trading performance, \nfinancial position and liquidity of the Group, the principal and emerging risks and uncertainties together with scenario planning and reverse stress tests. \nThe Directors have assessed going concern over a 15-month period to 30 June 2024 which aligns with the six-monthly covenant measurement period. \n31 December\n2022\n€’m\n31 December\n2021\n€’m\nCash and cash equivalents \n426.5\n575.4\nCash held on behalf of clients, progressive jackpots and security deposits \n(154.1)\n(141.1)\nAdjusted gross cash and cash equivalents (excluding assets and liabilities held for sale)\n272.4\n434.3\nDespite the decline in adjusted gross cash and cash equivalents from €434.3 million at 31 December 2021 to €272.4 million at 31 December \n2022, the Group continues to hold a strong liquidity position. The decline from the prior year is explained by the full repayment of the revolving \ncredit facility (RCF) drawn amounting to €166.1 million, as well as the €330.0 million partial repayment of the 2018 Bond, both offset by the cash \nproceeds from disposal of the Financial segment of €223.9 million (refer to Note 25), as well as the Group’s strong performance during the year. \nThe Directors have reviewed liquidity and covenant forecasts for the Group, which assume that there will be no further lockdowns on a global \nscale. The Directors have also considered sensitivities in respect of potential downside scenarios, reverse stress tests and the mitigating actions \navailable to management. \nThe modelling of downside scenarios assessed if there was a significant risk to the Group’s liquidity and covenant compliance position. \nThis includes risks such as not realising budget/forecasts across certain markets and any potential implications of changes in tax and other \nregulations, as well as the impact on cash flow should the share buyback scheme and other shareholder return options resume.\nThe Group’s principal financing arrangements include an RCF up to €277.0 million, the 2018 Bond amounting to €200.0 million post partial \nrepayment and the 2019 Bond amounting to €350.0 million which are repayable in October 2023 and March 2026 respectively. The RCF has \nbeen restructured during the year reducing the credit line from €317.0 million to €277.0 million and is available until October 2025, with the Group \nhaving the option to extend by 12 months. The remaining €200.0 million balance of the 2018 Bond will be due upon expiration in October 2023, with \nthe current plan assuming this will be paid through cash reserves, rather than refinanced. \nThe RCF is subject to certain financial covenants which are tested every six months on a rolling 12-month basis, as set out in Notes 27 and 28. \nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group comfortably met its covenants which were as follows:\n•\t Leverage: Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA to be less than 3.5:1 for the 12 months ended 31 December 2022 (12 months ended 31 December 2021: 3:1).\n•\t Interest cover: Adjusted EBITDA/Interest to be over 4:1 for the 12 months ended 31 December 2022 (12 months ended 31 December 2021: 4:1).\nThe Bonds only have one financial covenant, being the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (same as the Interest cover ratio for the RCF), which should \nequal or be greater than 2:1.\nIf the Group’s results are in line with its base case projections as approved by the Board it would not be in breach of the financial covenants for a period \nof no less than 15 months from approval of these financial statements (the “relevant going concern period”). This period covers the bank reporting \nrequirements for June 2023, December 2023 and June 2024 and is the main reason why the Directors selected a 15-month period of assessment. \nStress test\nThe stress test assumes a worst-case scenario for the entire Group which includes additional sensitivities around Italy, the Americas and Asia, \nbut with mitigations similar to the ones taken in 2020 and 2021 (including salary and capital expenditure reductions). It also considers the impact \nof cash flow should the share buyback scheme commence again, as well as other shareholder return options. Under this scenario Adjusted \nEBITDA would fall on average by 7% per month compared to the base case over the relevant going concern period, but the Group would not \nbreach its covenants. \nReverse stress test\nThe reverse stress test was used to identify the reduction in Adjusted EBITDA required that could result in either a liquidity event or breach of the \nRCF and bond covenants. \nAs a result of completing this assessment, without considering further mitigating actions, management considered the likelihood of the reverse \nstress test scenario arising to be remote. In reaching this conclusion management considered the following:\n150 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

The amendments replace all instances \nof the term “significant accounting policies” with “material accounting policy information”. Accounting policy information is material if, when \nconsidered together with other information included in an entity’s financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that \nthe primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.\nThe supporting paragraphs in IAS 1 are also amended to clarify that accounting policy information that relates to immaterial transactions, other \nevents or conditions is immaterial and need not be disclosed. Accounting policy information may be material because of the nature of the related \ntransactions, other events or conditions, even if the amounts are immaterial. However, not all accounting policy information relating to material \ntransactions, other events or conditions is itself material.\nThe amendments to IAS 1 are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with earlier application permitted, and are \napplied prospectively. The amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2 do not contain an effective date or transition requirements.\n•\t Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates.\nThe amendments replace the definition of a change in accounting estimates with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, \naccounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”.\nThe definition of a change in accounting estimates was deleted. However, the Board retained the concept of changes in accounting estimates in \nthe standard with the following clarifications:\n•\t A change in accounting estimate that results from new information or new developments is not the correction of an error.\n•\t The effects of a change in an input or a measurement technique used to develop an accounting estimate are changes in accounting estimates \nif they do not result from the correction of prior period errors.\nThe amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 to changes in accounting policies and changes in \naccounting estimates that occur on or after the beginning of that period, with earlier application permitted.\nThe Group does not expect any other standards issued by the IASB, but not yet effective, to have a material impact on the Group.\nThe following amendments are effective for the period beginning 1 January 2024:\n•\t Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Classification of \nLiabilities as Current or Non-current – deferral of effective date.\nThe amendments affect only the presentation of liabilities as current or non-current in the statement of financial position and not the amount of \ntiming of recognition of any asset, income or expenses, or the information disclosed about those items. \nThe amendments clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current is based on the rights that are in existence at the end of the \nreporting period, specify that the classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement \nof a liability, explain the rights that are in existence if covenants are complied with at the end of the reporting period, and introduce a definition \nof “settlement” to make clear that settlement refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services.\n151\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued\nNote 5 – Significant accounting policies\nThe Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, except if \nmentioned otherwise. \nA. Basis of consolidation\n(i) Business combinations\nThe Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition \nof a business and control is transferred to the Group. In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group \nassesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired \nset has the ability to produce outputs. \nThe consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill \narising is tested semi-annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in the profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs \nare expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\nAny contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the \ndefinition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured, and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, \nother contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent \nconsideration are recognised in the profit or loss. A contingent consideration in which the contingent payments are forfeited if employment is \nterminated is compensation for the post-combination services and is not included in the calculation of the consideration and recognised as \nemployee-related costs. \nCash payments arising from settlement of contingent consideration and redemption liability are disclosed in financing activities in the \nconsolidated statement of cash flows.\nWhen a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to its acquisition-\ndate fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the \nacquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the profit or loss, where such treatment \nwould be appropriate if that interest were disposed of. \n(ii) Subsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is achieved when the Group:\n•\t has the power over the entity;\n•\t is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the entity; and\n•\t has the ability to use its power over the entity to affect its returns. \nThe Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three \nelements of control listed above.\nWhen the Group has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it considers that it has power over the investee when the voting rights \nare sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Group considers all relevant facts and \ncircumstances in assessing whether or not the Company’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:\n•\t the size of the Group’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders;\n•\t potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties;\n•\t rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and\n•\t any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Group has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities \nat the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings. \nWhere the Group holds a currently exercisable call option, the rights arising as a result of the exercise of the call option are included in the \nassessment above of whether the Group has control.\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences \nuntil the date on which control ceases. \n(iii) Non-controlling interests (NCI)\nNCI are measured initially at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. \nChanges in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The difference \nbetween the consideration and the carrying value of the NCI is recognised as profit/loss in the retained earnings. \n(iv) Loss of control\nWhen the Group loses control over a subsidiary it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and any related NCI and other \ncomponents of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the profit or loss. \n(v) Investments in associates and equity call options\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. \nSignificant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control \nover those policies.\nThe considerations made in determining significant influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries. \nIn the consolidated financial statements, the Group’s investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\n152 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Note 5 – Significant accounting policies continued\nA. Basis of consolidation continued\n(v) Investments in associates and equity call options continued\nUnder the equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint venture is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition \nchanges in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate. The Group’s share of the results of the associate is included in the profit or loss. \nLosses of the associate or joint venture in excess of the Group’s cost of the investment are recognised as a liability only when the Group has \nincurred obligations on behalf of the associate.\nOn acquisition of the investment, any difference between the cost of the investment and share of the associate’s identifiable assets and liabilities \nis accounted for as follows:\n•\t Any premium paid is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the associate. \n•\t Any excess of the share of the net fair value of the associate’s identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as \nincome in the determination of the share of the associate’s profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired. \nAny intangibles identified and included as part of the investment are amortised over their assumed useful economic life. Where there is objective \nevidence that the investment in an associate may be impaired the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same way as \nother non-financial assets.\nThe aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate is shown on the face of the profit or loss outside operating profit and \nrepresents profit or loss before tax. The associated tax charge is disclosed in income tax.\nThe Group recognises its share of any changes in the equity of the associate through the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Profits \nand losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate.\nThe Group applies equity accounting only up to the date an investment in associate meets the criteria for classification as held for sale. From \nthen onwards, the investment is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\nWhen potential voting rights or other derivatives containing potential voting rights exist, the Group’s interest in an associate is determined solely \non the basis of existing ownership interests and does not reflect the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights and other derivative \ninstruments unless there is an existing ownership interest as a result of a transaction that currently gives it access to the returns associated with \nan ownership interest. In such circumstances, the proportion allocated to the entity is determined by taking into account the eventual exercise \nof those potential voting rights and other derivative instruments that currently give the entity access to the returns. When instruments containing \npotential voting rights in substance currently give access to the returns associated with an ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture, \nthe instruments are not subject to IFRS 9 and equity accounting is applied. In all other cases, instruments containing potential voting rights in an \nassociate or a joint venture are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9.\nA derivative financial asset is measured under fair value under IFRS 9. In the case where there is significant influence, but the option is not \ncurrently exercisable, there is still an investment in associate but as there is no current access to profits the option is fair valued instead.\nDerivatives are recorded at fair value and classified as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. \nSubsequently, derivatives are measured at fair value.\n(vi) Equity investments held at fair value\nAll equity investments in scope of IFRS 9 are measured at fair value in the balance sheet. Fair value changes are recognised in the profit or loss. \nFair value is based on quoted market prices (Level 1). Where this is not possible, fair value is assessed based on alternative methods (Level 3).\n(vii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation\nIntra-group balances and transactions are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated \nagainst the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, \nbut only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. \nB. Foreign currency\n(i) Foreign currency transactions\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group companies at the exchange rates at the \ndates of the transactions. \nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. \nNon-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate \nwhen the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange \nrate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in the profit or loss and presented within finance costs. \n(ii) Foreign operations\nOn consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are \ntranslated into Euro at the exchange rates at the reporting date and their statements of profit or loss are translated into Euro at the end of each \nmonth at the average exchange rate for the month which approximates the exchange rates at the date of the transactions. \nThe exchange differences arising on the translation for consolidation are recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI) and accumulated in \nthe foreign exchange reserve.\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative \namount in the foreign exchange reserve relating to the foreign operation is reclassified to the profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n153\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Discontinued operation\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished \nfrom the rest of the Group and which:\n•\t represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;\n•\t is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or\n•\t is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\nClassification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as \nheld for sale.\nWhen an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of comprehensive income is re-presented as if \nthe operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.\nD. Revenue recognition \nThe majority of the Group’s revenue is derived from selling services with revenue recognised when services have been delivered to the \ncustomer. Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the supply of services in the ordinary course of \nthe Group’s activities. Revenue is recognised when economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group. Specific criteria and performance \nobligations are described below for each of the Group’s material revenue streams.\nType of income \nNature, timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and significant payment terms\nB2B licensee fee\nLicensee fee is the standard operator income of the Group which relates to licensed technology and the provision of \ncertain services provided via various distribution channels (online, mobile or land-based interfaces). \nLicensee fee is based on the underlying gaming revenue earned by our licensees calculated using the contractual terms \nin place. Revenue is recognised when performance obligation is met which is when the gaming transaction occurs. \nThe payment terms of the B2B licensee fee is on average 30 days from the invoice date.\nB2B fixed-fee income\nFixed-fee income is the standard operator income of the Group which includes revenue derived from the provision \nof certain services and licensed technology for which charges are based on a fixed fee and/or stepped according to \nthe monthly usage of the service/technology. The usage measurement is typically reset on a monthly basis.\nThe performance obligation is met and revenue is recognised once the obligations under the contracts have been met \nwhich is when the services have been provided. \nServices provided and fees for:\na.\t\n\u0007minimum revenue guarantee: the additional balance billed by the Group on a monthly basis for the difference in the \nminimum guarantee per licensee contract and actual performance; and\nb.\t\n\u0007other: hosting, live, set-up, content delivery network and maintenance fees. The fees charge to licensees for these \nservices are fixed per month.\nThe amounts for the above are recognised over the life of the contracts and are typically charged on a fixed percentage \nand stepped according to the monthly usage of the service depending on the type of service. Set-up fees are recognised \nover the whole period of the contract, with an average period of 36 months. The revenue is recognised monthly over the \nperiod of the contract and the payment terms of the B2B fixed fee income is on average 30 days from the invoice date.\nB2B cost-based revenue\nCost-based revenue is the standard operator income of the Group which is made of the total revenue charged to the \nlicensee based on the development costs needed to satisfy the contract with the licensee.\nThe largest type of service included in cost-based revenue is the dedicated team costs. Dedicated team employees are \ncharged back to the client based on time spent on each product.\nCost-based revenues are recognised on a monthly basis based on the contract in place of licensee with Playtech and any \nadditional services needed on development are charged to the licensee upon delivery of the service. The payment terms \nof the B2B cost-based revenue is on average 30 days from the invoice date.\nB2B revenue received from \nthe sale of hardware\nRevenue received from the sale of hardware is the total revenue charged to customers upon the sale of each hardware \nproduct. The performance obligation is met and revenue is recognised on delivery of the hardware and acceptance \nby the customer. \nRevenue received from future sale of hardware is recognised as deferred revenue. Once the obligation for the future \nsale is met, revenue is then recognised in profit or loss. The payment terms of the B2B revenue received from the sale \nof hardware is on average 30 days from the invoice date.\nAdditional B2B services fee\nThis income is calculated based on the profit and/or net revenues generated by the customer in return for the additional \nservices provided to them by the Group. This is typically charged on a monthly basis and is measured using a predetermined \npercentage set in each licensee arrangement. The revenue is only recognised when the customer’s activities go live and \nthe revenue from the additional B2B services is recognised only once the Group is unconditionally contractually entitled \nto it. The Directors have determined that this is when the customer starts generating profits which is later than when the \ncustomer goes live with its B2C operations. The Directors' rationale is that there is uncertainty that the Group will collect the \nconsideration to which it is entitled before the customer starts generating profits and therefore, the revenue is wholly variable. \nThe payment terms of the additional B2B services fees is on average 30 days from the invoice date.\n154 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Following the 2012 LTIP employees are granted cash-settled options and \nequity-settled options. The Remuneration Committee has the option to determine if the option will be settled in cash or equity, a decision \nthat is made at grant date. The fair value of the equity-settled options granted is charged to the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the \nvesting period and the credit is taken to equity, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is determined \nby the Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo or binomial valuation model, as appropriate. The cash-settled options are presented as a liability. The \nliability is remeasured at each reporting date and settlement date so that the ultimate liability equals the cash payment on settlement date. \nRemeasurements of the fair value of the liability are recognised in profit or loss. \nThe Group has also granted awards to be distributed from the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust. The fair value of these awards is based on \nthe market price at the date of the grant; some of the grants have performance conditions. The performance conditions are for the Executive \nManagement and include targets based on growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return over a specific period compared to other \ncompetitors. The fair value of the awards with market performance conditions is factored into the overall fair value and determined using a \nMonte Carlo method. Where these options lapse due to not meeting market performance conditions the share option charge is not reversed.\nF. Income tax\nThe income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. \n(i) Current tax\nThe tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in profit or loss because \nit excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or \ndeductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of \nthe reporting period. \nA provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax determination is uncertain, but it is considered probable that there will be a \nfuture outflow of funds to a tax authority. The provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount expected to become payable. \nThe assessment is based on the judgement of tax professionals within the Company supported by previous experience in respect of \nsuch activities and in certain cases based on specialist tax advice. \nNote 5 – Significant accounting policies continued\nD.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are \nreassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the \ndeferred tax asset to be recovered.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability \nis settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\nDeferred tax relating to items recognised outside the profit or loss is recognised outside the profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised \nin correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.\nTax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognised \nsubsequently, if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long \nas it does not exceed goodwill) if it was recognised during the measurement period or is otherwise recognised in profit or loss.\nThe Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and \ncurrent tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either \nthe same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the \nassets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected \nto be settled or recovered.\nThe tax base of assets and liabilities is assessed at each reporting date, and changes in the tax base that result from internal reorganisations, \nchanges in the expected manner of recovery or changes in tax law are reflected in the calculation of deductible and taxable temporary differences.\nG. Finance expense \nFinance expense arising on interest-bearing financial instruments carried at amortised cost are recognised in the profit or loss using the effective \ninterest rate method. Finance expense includes the amortisation of fees that are an integral part of the effective finance cost of a financial \ninstrument, including issue costs, and the amortisation of any other differences between the amount initially recognised and the redemption price. \nAll finance expenses are recognised over the availability period.\nInterest expense arising on the above during the period is disclosed under the financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nH. Inventories\nInventories are initially recognised at cost, and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises all costs of purchase, \ncosts of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n156 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Intangible assets and goodwill\n(i) Recognition and measurement\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the Group’s interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities \nand contingent liabilities acquired. Cost comprises the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued, plus the \namount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree plus, if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity \ninterest in the acquiree. Contingent consideration is included in cost at its acquisition date fair value and, in the case of contingent consideration \nclassified as a financial liability, remeasured subsequently through profit or loss. Direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately as an \nexpense. Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the profit or loss. Where the fair \nvalue of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the profit \nor loss on the acquisition date as a gain on bargain purchase.\nExternally acquired intangible assets \nOther intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any \naccumulated impairment losses. \nBusiness combinations\nIntangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual/legal \nrights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques.\nInternally generated intangible assets (development costs)\nDevelopment costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group \nare recognised as intangible assets where the following criteria are met:\n•\t it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use;\n•\t management intends to complete the software and use or sell it;\n•\t there is an ability to use or sell the software;\n•\t it can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits;\n•\t adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software are available; and\n•\t the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.\nThe amount initially recognised for internally generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the \nintangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Expenditure includes salaries, wages and other employee-related costs \ndirectly engaged in generating the assets and any other expenditure that is directly attributable to generating the assets (i.e. certifications \nand amortisation of right of use assets). Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is \nrecognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred.\n(ii) Subsequent expenditure\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. \nAll other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.\n(iii) Amortisation\nAmortisation is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over \ntheir estimated useful lives and is generally recognised in the profit or loss. Goodwill is not amortised.\n157\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Assets held for sale\nNon-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be \nrecovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.\nThe criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, and the asset or disposal group is available for \nimmediate sale in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale \nwill be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. Management must be committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to \nbe completed within one year from the date of the classification.\nSuch assets, or disposal groups, are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a \ndisposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, \nfinancial assets or deferred tax assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group’s other accounting policies. Impairment \nlosses on initial classification as held for sale or held for distribution and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the \nprofit or loss.\nOnce classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated.\nL. Financial instruments\nInitial recognition and subsequent measurement\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n(i) Financial assets\nInitial recognition and measurement\nFinancial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive \nincome and fair value through profit or loss.\nThe classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s \nbusiness model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which \nthe Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset \nnot at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which \nthe Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured \nat amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the \nprincipal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. Financial assets with cash \nflows that are not SPPI are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model.\nSubsequent measurement\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:\n•\t financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments);\n•\t financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments);\n•\t financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon \nderecognition (equity instruments); and\n•\t financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\nFinancial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments) \nFinancial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) method and are subject to impairment. Gains \nand losses are recognised in the profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired. The Group’s financial assets at amortised \ncost include trade receivables, loans receivable and cash and cash equivalents.\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits with an original maturity of less than three months and \ncustomer balances. \nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised in the \nprofit or loss. This category includes listed equity investments which the Group had not irrevocably elected to classify at fair value through OCI. \n158 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Note 5 – Significant accounting policies continued\nL. Financial instruments continued \n(i) Financial assets continued\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss continued\nThe Group recognises a debt financial instrument with an embedded conversion option, such as a loan convertible into ordinary shares of an \nentity, as a financial asset in the balance sheet. On initial recognition, the convertible loan is measured at fair value with any gain or loss arising on \nsubsequent measurement until conversion recognised in profit or loss. On conversion of a convertible instrument, the Group derecognises the \nfinancial asset component and recognises it as an investment (equity interest, associate, joint venture or subsidiary) depending on the results of \nthe assessment performed under the relevant standards.\nAt every reporting date, the Group evaluates whether the debt instrument is considered to have low credit risk using all reasonable and \nsupportable information that is available without undue cost or effort. In making that evaluation, the Group reassesses the internal credit \nrating of the debt instrument. In addition, the Group considers whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk depending on the \ncharacteristics of each debt instrument.\nDerecognition\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised \n(i.e. removed from the Group’s consolidated balance sheet) when:\n•\t the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or\n•\t the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full \nwithout material delay to a third party under a “pass-through” arrangement, and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks \nand rewards of the asset; or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has \ntransferred control of the asset.\nWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a passthrough arrangement, it evaluates if, and \nto what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither: transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and \nrewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing \ninvolvement. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on \na basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.\nContinuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount \nof the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.\nImpairment\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs \nare based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group \nexpects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from \nthe sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.\nECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, \nECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit \nexposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses \nexpected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).\nFor trade receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, \nbut instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is \nbased on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.\n(ii) Financial liabilities\nInitial recognition and measurement\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, \nor; derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value \nand, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade \nand other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts, and derivative financial instruments.\nSubsequent measurement\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities are classified in two categories:\n•\t financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss; and\n•\t financial liabilities at amortised cost (loans and borrowings and bonds).\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial \nrecognition as at fair value through profit or loss.\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost\nThis is the category most relevant to the Group. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured \nat amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognised in the profit or loss when the liabilities are \nderecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium \non acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the profit or loss.\n159\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Financial instruments continued \n(ii) Financial liabilities continued\nDerecognition\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability \nis replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such \nan exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the \nrespective carrying amounts is recognised in the profit or loss.\n(iii) Offsetting \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right \nto offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\nM. Share capital\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity and are stated at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.\nN. Share buyback \nConsideration paid for the share buyback is recognised against the additional paid in capital. Any excess of the consideration paid over the \nweighted average price of shares in issue is debited to the retained earnings.\nO. Employee Benefit Trust\nConsideration paid/received for the purchase/sale of shares subsequently put in the Employee Benefit Trust, which is controlled by the \nCompany, is recognised directly in equity. The cost of shares held is presented as a separate reserve (the “Employee Benefit Trust reserve”). \nAny excess of the consideration received on the sale of treasury shares over the weighted average cost of the shares sold is credited to \nretained earnings.\nP. Dividends\nDividends are recognised when they become legally due. In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when paid by the \nDirectors. In the case of final dividends, this is when they are declared and approved by the shareholders at the AGM. \nQ. Impairment of non-financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than inventories and deferred tax assets) \nto determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. \nGoodwill is tested semi-annually for impairment. \nFor impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are \nlargely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs that are \nexpected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. \nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use is based on the \nestimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the \ntime value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. \nAn impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. \nImpairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the \nCGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. \nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s \ncarrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment \nloss had been recognised.\nR. Provisions \nProvisions for legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable \nthat an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for \nfuture operating losses.\nWhere there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the \nclass of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same \nclass of obligations may be minimum.\nProvisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the \nend of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of \nthe time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. \n160 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Note 5 – Significant accounting policies continued\nS. Leases\nAt inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract \nconveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nGroup as a lessee\nThe Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. \nThe Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right of use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. \n(i) Right of use assets\nThe Group recognises right of use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). \nRight‑of‑use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of \nlease liabilities. The cost of right of use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments \nmade at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right of use assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the \nshorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n(ii) Lease liabilities\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made \nover the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, \nvariable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease \npayments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties \nfor terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. \nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses in the period in which the event or condition that \ntriggers the payment occurs.\nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the \ninterest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect \nthe accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. \nIn addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease \npayments (e.g. changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in \nthe assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is \nmade to the carrying amount of the right of use asset or is recorded in the profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right of use asset has been \nreduced to zero.\nThe cash payments made in relation to long-term leases is split between principal and interest paid on lease liability and disclosed within \nfinancing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n(iii) Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\nThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or \nless from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to \nleases that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on \na straight-line basis over the lease term and included within financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nT. Fair value measurement\n“Fair value” is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants \nat the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability \ntakes place either: (a) in the principal market for the asset or liability; or (b) in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market \nfor the asset or liability. \nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, \nassuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, \nmaximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, \ndescribed as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n•\t Level 1 – quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\t Level 2 – \u0007valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n•\t Level 3 – valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n161\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

EBITDA is a measure of the Group’s overall \nfinancial performance and profitability which the Directors consider useful to reflect the underlying performance of the business. \nThe Board of Directors believes that in order to best represent the trading performance and results of the Group, the reported numbers should \nexclude certain non-cash items, one-off items and the impact of substantial reorganisations and acquisition-related items.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Profit/Loss after making these exclusions are therefore presented alongside the reported EBITDA and reported \nProfit/loss in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. \nThe Directors use the Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Profit/Loss to understand, manage and evaluate the business and make operating \ndecisions. These adjusted measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. \nFurthermore, compensation of the executives is based in part on the performance of the business based on Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted results exclude the following items:\n•\t Material non-cash items: these items are excluded to better analyse the underlying cash transactions of the business as the management \nregularly monitors the operating cash conversion to Adjusted EBITDA.\n•\t Material one-off items: there items are excluded to get normalised results that are distorted by unusual or infrequent items unusual or \ninfrequent items that are excluded to get normalised results that were previously distorted by these items. Unusual items include highly \nabnormal, one-off and only incidentally relating to the ordinary activities of the Group. Infrequent items are those which are not reasonably \nexpected to recur in the foreseeable future given the environment in which the Group operates. \n•\t Material reorganisations and acquisition-related items: these items are excluded as they are not considered related to the ordinary activities \nof the business and are not considered to be ongoing costs of the operations of the business.\nIn addition, management presents underlying adjusted results and constant currency adjusted results to the Board of Directors.\nUnderlying adjusted results are presented as an alternative performance measure to exclude the impact of acquisitions made in the period or \nin the comparable period in order to present a more accurate “like-for-like” comparison over the comparable period.\nConstant currency adjusted results are presented in order to try and present measures that exclude the effect of currency fluctuations. In view \nof the fact that the Group has transactions in foreign currencies and may be affected from the fluctuations of the currencies, all transactions in \nforeign currencies are converted to Euro using the exchange rate of the comparable period.\nAs these are non-GAAP measures, they should not be considered as replacements for IFRS measures. The Group’s definition of these non-GAAP \nmeasures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A full reconciliation of adjustments is included \nin Note 10.\nNote 6 – Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements and estimates that affect the application of the \nGroup’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual events may differ from these estimates. \nJudgements\nIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant \neffect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nThe Group applies judgement in determining whether it is acting as a principal or an agent specifically on the revenue earned under the B2B \nlicensee fee stream. This income falls within the scope of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In making these judgements, the \nGroup considers, by examining each contract with its customers, which party has the primary responsibility for providing the services and is \nexposed to the majority of the risks and rewards associated with providing the services, as well as if it has latitude in establishing prices, either \ndirectly or indirectly. The business model of this division is predominantly a revenue share model which is based on royalties earned from B2C \nbusiness partners’ revenue. \nIFRS 15, paragraph B37 describes indicators that an entity controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to a customer and \ntherefore acts as the principal. Based on this assessment it was concluded that Playtech is acting as an agent under the B2B licensee fee stream \ndue to the three indicators under B37 which are not satisfied as follows:\n•\t Playtech is responsible in fulfilling the contract to the operator, principally in respect of the software solutions, and not to the end customer \nwhich is the responsibility of the operator;\n•\t there is no inventory risk as Playtech does not have the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from \nthe good or service before it is transferred to the end customer; and\n•\t Playtech does not have any discretion in establishing prices set by the operator to third parties.\nBased on the above it was determined that the Group was acting as agent and revenue is recognised as the net amount of B2B licensee fees \nreceived. The majority of this B2B revenue is recognised when the gaming or betting activity used as the basis for the revenue share calculation \ntakes place, and furthermore is only recognised when collection is virtually certain with a legally enforceable right to collect.\n162 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Note 6 – Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions continued\nJudgements continued \nInternally generated intangible assets\nThe Group capitalises costs for product development projects. Expenditure on internally developed products is capitalised when it meets \nthe following criteria:\n•\t adequate resources are available to complete and sell the product;\n•\t the Group is able to sell the product;\n•\t sale of the product will generate future economic benefits; and \n•\t expenditure on the project can be measured reliably.\nInitial capitalisation of cost is based on the management’s judgement that the technological and economic feasibility is confirmed, usually when \nproduct development has reached a defined milestone and future economic benefits are expected to be realised according to an established \nproject management model. Following capitalisation, an assessment is performed in regard to project recoverability which is based on the \nactual return of the project. During the year, the Group capitalised €57.5 million (2021: €51.3 million) and the carrying amount of capitalised \ndevelopment costs as at 31 December 2022 was €123.2 million (2021: €122.3 million). \nAdjusted performance measures\nAs noted in Note 5, paragraph U, the Group presents adjusted performance measures which differ from statutory measures due to exclusion \nof certain non-cash and one-off items and material reorganisation and acquisition-related items from the actual results. The determination \nof whether non-cash and one-off items and material reorganisation and acquisition-related items should form part of the adjusted results \nis a matter of judgement and is based on whether the inclusion/exclusion from the results represent more closely the consistent trading \nperformance of the business. The items excluded from the adjusted measures are described in further detail in Note 10.\nProvision for risks and charges and potential liabilities\nThe Group operates in a number of regulated markets and is subject to lawsuits and potential lawsuits regarding complex legal matters, which \nare subject to a different degree of uncertainty in different jurisdictions and under different laws. For all material ongoing and potential legal \nand regulatory claims against the Group, an assessment is performed to consider whether an obligation or possible obligation exists and \nto determine the probability of any potential outflow to determine whether a claim results in the recognition of a provision or disclosure of a \ncontingent liability. The timing of payment of provisions is subject to uncertainty and may have an effect on the presentation of the provisions \nas current and non-current liabilities in the balance sheet. Expected timing of payment and classification of provision is determined by the \nmanagement based on the latest information available at the reporting date. See Note 29 for further details. \nClassification of equity call options\nBackground\nIn addition to the provision of software-related solutions as a B2B product, the Group also offers certain customers a form of offering (which \nincludes software and related services) which is termed a “structured agreement”. Structured agreements are customarily with customers which \nhave a gaming licence and are retail/land based operators that are looking to establish their online B2C businesses – these customers require \ninitial support beyond the provision of the Group’s standard B2B software technology. With this product offering, Playtech offers additional \nservices to support the customer’s B2C activities over and above the B2B software solution products.\nPlaytech generates revenues from the structured agreements as follows: \n•\t the standard operator revenue (B2B licensee fee income as per Note 5D); and\n•\t revenue based on predefined revenue generated by each customer under the structured agreement which is typically capped at a percentage \nof the profit (also defined in each agreement) generated by the customer, which compensates Playtech for the additional services provided \n(additional B2B services fee as per Note 5D).\nUnder these agreements, Playtech typically has a call option to acquire equity in the operating entities. If the call option is exercised by Playtech, \nthe Group would no longer provide certain services (which generally include technical and general strategic support services) and would no \nlonger receive the related additional B2B services fee. This mechanism is not designed as a control feature but mainly to protect Playtech’s \nposition should the customer be subject to an exit transaction. Playtech is therefore able to benefit from any value appreciation in the operation \nand could also potentially cease to provide the additional B2B services should it choose to do so dependent on the nature of the exit transaction.\n163\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued\nNote 6 – Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions continued\nJudgements continued \nClassification of equity call options continued\nJudgement applied\nIn respect of each of the structured agreements where the Group holds equity call options, management applies judgement to assess whether \nthe Group has control or significant influence. For each of the Group’s structured agreements an assessment was completed in Note 20 using \nthe below guidance.\nThe existence of control by an entity is evidenced if all of the below are met in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, \nparagraph 7: \n•\t power over the investee;\n•\t exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n•\t the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.\nIn the cases where the Group assessed that it exercises control over these arrangements, then the company is consolidated in the Group’s \nannual results in accordance with IFRS 10. \nThe existence of significant influence by an entity is usually evidenced in one or more of the following ways in accordance with IAS 28 Investment \nin Associates and Joint Ventures, paragraph 6:\n•\t representation on the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee;\n•\t participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or other distributions;\n•\t material transactions between the entity and its investee;\n•\t interchange of managerial personnel; or\n•\t provision of essential technical information.\nIf the conclusion is that the Group has significant influence, the next consideration made is whether there is current access to net profits and \nlosses of the underlying associate. This is determined by the exercise conditions of each relevant equity call option and in particular whether \nthe options are exercisable at the end of each reporting period. \nIf the option is exercisable then the investment is accounted for using the equity accounting method. However, in the cases where the company \nover which the Group has a current exercisable option generates profits, management made a judgement and concluded that Playtech’s share \nof profits (were the option to be exercised) should not be recognised as it is unlikely that the profits will be realised as the existing shareholder \nhas the right, and is entitled, to extract distributable profits. As such management did not consider it appropriate to recognise any share of these \nprofits. However, in the cases where the associate has generated losses, the Group’s percentage share is recognised and deducted from the \ncarrying value of the investment in associate.\nManagement has made a further judgement that if the equity call option is not exercisable at the end of the reporting period, then the option \nis recorded at fair value as per IAS 28, paragraph 14 and recognised as a derivative financial asset as per IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. \nFurthermore, under some of these arrangements the Group has provided loan advances. In such instances a judgement was made as to \nwhether these amounts form part of the Group’s investment in the associate as per IAS 28, paragraph 38, with a key consideration being \nwhether the Group expects settlement to occur in the foreseeable future. In the case where this is not expected and there is no set repayment \nterm, then it is concluded that in substance these loans are extensions of the entity’s investment in the associate and therefore would form part \nof the cost of the investment. \nFinally, the Group has certain agreements in relation to the provision of services by service providers in connection with certain of the Group’s \nobligations under their various structured agreements. Under these arrangements, the service providers have certain rights to equity. In order for \nthese rights to crystallise, the Group must first exercise the relevant option. A judgement was therefore made that no current liability exists under \nIAS 32, until the point when Playtech exercises the option. \nEstimates and assumptions\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, which have a significant \nrisk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The \nGroup based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing \ncircumstances and assumptions about future developments may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the \ncontrol of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\nImpairment of non-financial assets \nImpairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair \nvalue less costs of disposal and its value in use. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model (DCF). The cash flows \nare derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant \nfuture investments that may enhance the performance of the assets of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the \ndiscount rate used for the DCF model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. These \nestimates are most relevant to goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives recognised by the Group. The key assumptions used to \ndetermine the recoverable amount of the different CGUs, are disclosed and further explained in Note 19, including a sensitivity analysis for the \nCGUs with lower headroom.\n164 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Note 6 – Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions continued\nEstimates and assumptions continued \nIncome taxes\nThe Group is subject to income tax in several jurisdictions and significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes. \nDuring the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, \nthe Group recognises tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognised \nwhen, despite the Group’s belief that its tax return positions are supportable, the Group believes it is more likely than not that a taxation authority \nwould not accept its filing position. In these cases, the Group records its tax balances based on either the most likely amount or the expected \nvalue, which weights multiple potential scenarios. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years \nbased on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and \nassumptions and may involve a series of complex judgements about future events. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters \nis different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. \nWhere management conclude that it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, they calculate the effect \nof uncertainty in determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax, credits or tax rates. The effect of \nuncertainty for each uncertain tax treatment is reflected by using the expected value – the sum of the probabilities and the weighted amounts in \na range of possible outcomes. More details are included in Note 14.\nDeferred tax asset\nIn evaluating the Group’s ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, management considers all available \npositive and negative evidence, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. Deferred tax asset \nis recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. \nJudgement is required in determining the initial recognition and the subsequent carrying value of the deferred tax assets. Deferred tax asset is \nonly able to be recognised to the extent that utilisation is considered probable. It is possible that a change in profit forecasts or risk factors could \nresult in a material change to the income tax expense and deferred tax asset in future periods.\nDeferred tax asset in the UK\nAs a result of the Group’s internal restructuring in January 2021, the Group is entitled to UK tax deductions in respect of certain goodwill and \nintangible assets. A deferred tax asset was recognised as the tax base of the goodwill and intangible assets is in excess of the book value \nbase of those assets. At the beginning of the period, the net recognised deferred tax asset amounted to €63.6 million. As at 31 December \n2022, an additional deferred tax asset of €5.2 million was recognised. This additional deferred tax asset has been recognised as the Group’s \nmanagement has concluded that it is probable for the UK entities to continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which the Group \ncan utilise the tax deductions for goodwill and intangible assets giving a tax benefit of €68.8 million. This represents the benefit of the deductions \nagainst forecast profits for the next five years. During the year, €12.0 million has been utilised and the net recognised deferred tax asset as \nat 31 December 2022 amounts to €56.8 million. In addition, a total of €37.0 million of deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect \nof the benefit of future tax deductions expected to arise after the next five years for the remaining useful economic life of the goodwill and \nintangible assets. \nThe Group reviewed the latest forecasts for the UK companies for the next five years, including their ability to continue to generate income \nbeyond the forecast period under the tax laws substantively enacted at the reporting date. Based on this, the Group’s management concludes \nthat it is probable that the UK companies will continue to generate taxable income in the future. Any future changes in the tax law or the structure \nof the Group could have a significant effect on the use of the tax deductions, including the period over which the deductions can be utilised. \nThe Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of €60.4 million in respect of tax losses and excess interest in the UK which are available to \noffset against the future profits of the UK Group companies. Based on the current forecasts, these losses will be fully utilised over the next \nfive years. \nDeferred tax assets in Italy\nThe Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of €23.1 million in respect of tax losses in Italy which are available to offset against the future \nprofits of the Italian Group companies. Based on the current forecasts, these losses will be fully utilised within the next five years. \nThe Group reviewed the latest forecasts for the Italian companies for the next five years, including their ability to continue to generate income \nbeyond the forecast period under the tax laws substantively enacted at the reporting date. Based on this, the Group management concludes \nthat it is probable that the Italian Group companies will continue to generate taxable income in the future against which the losses can be utilised. \nAny future changes in the tax law or the structure of the Group could have a significant effect on the use of the tax deductions, including the \nperiod over which the deductions can be utilised.\n165\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued\nNote 6 – Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions continued\nEstimates and assumptions continued \nImpairment of financial assets \nThe Group undertook a review of trade receivables and other financial assets, as applicable, and their expected credit losses (ECLs). The review \nconsidered the macroeconomic outlook, customer credit quality, exposure at default, and effect of payment deferral options as at the reporting date. \nThe ECL methodology and definition of default remained consistent with prior periods. The model inputs, including forward-looking information, \nscenarios and associated weightings, together with the determination of the staging of exposures, were revised. The Group’s financial assets \nconsist of trade and loans receivables and cash and cash equivalents. ECL on cash balances was considered and calculated by reference \nto Moody’s credit rating for each financial institution, while ECL on trade and loans receivables was based on past default experience and an \nassessment of the future economic environment. More details are included in Note 38. \nIn respect of the Group’s Asian licensees’ business model an additional ECL risk was identified due to increase in collection days and uncertainty \nover timing of receipt of funds. This resulted in an additional provision for bad debts of €15.4 million (2021: €7.5 million) recognised in the profit or \nloss in H1 2022 with nothing further recognised in H2 2022.\nSun Bingo agreement \nBackground\nThe News UK contract commenced in 2016 and was originally set for a five-year period to June 2021. Both parties have obligations under \nthe contract, which include News UK providing access to brand and related materials as well as other services. Playtech has the primary \nresponsibility for the operation of the arrangement, but both parties have contractual responsibilities. \nThe related brands are used in Playtech’s B2C service, where the Group acts as the principal, meaning that in the Group’s consolidated \nstatement of comprehensive income: \n•\t revenue from B2C customers is recognised as income; and \n•\t the fees paid to News UK for use of the brands are an expense as they are effectively a supplier. \nIn the original contract, the fees payable were subject to a predetermined annual minimum guarantee (MG) which Playtech had to pay \nto News UK. \nDuring the period from 2016 to 2018, performance was not in line with expectations, and as such, the MG made this operation significantly loss \nmaking for the Group. This opened the negotiations with News UK for certain amendments to the contract, which were agreed and signed in \nFebruary 2019 as follows: \n•\t the MG was still payable up until the end of the original contract period, being June 2021, with no MG payable after that; and\n•\t the contract term was extended to permit Playtech access to News UK’s brands and other related materials and other services, for a longer \nperiod, to allow Playtech to recover its MG payments and to make a commercial return as was always envisaged. The term of the contract was \nextended to end at the earlier of: a) five years from the date when Playtech had fully recovered all MG payments made; or b) 15 years from the \nrenegotiation (i.e. June 2036).\nJudgements made on recognition and measurement\nThe annual MG paid to News UK was recognised in Playtech’s profit or loss up until February 2019, essentially being expensed over the original \nterm of the contract. However, from the point at which the amended contract became effective, the timing of the MG paid (being based on the \noriginal terms) no longer reflected the period over which Playtech was consuming the use of the News UK brands and other related services \nfrom them. As such, a prepayment was recorded to reflect the amount that had been paid, as at each period end, which related to the future use \nof the brands and services. IFRS do not have a specific standard that deals with accounting for prepayments; however, the asset recognised as \na prepayment is in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.\nAt the commencement of the agreement and on renegotiation of the contract, the Directors considered whether the nature of the arrangement \ngave rise to any intangible assets. At contract inception the Directors concluded that there were no such assets to recognise as both parties \nhad contractual obligations under the agreement to deliver services, as explained above. Post the contract renegotiation, the amounts to be \npaid in the remainder of the initial period were considered to be advanced payments in respect of amounts to be earned by News UK over the \nremainder of the extended contract period. Consequently, the Directors did not believe that there was a fundamental change in the nature of \nthe arrangements and it was considered most appropriate to categorise the amounts paid as operating expense prepayments. \nAs noted above, the term of this renegotiated contract is dependent on the future profitability of the contract, and it was expected that the future \nprofitability would mean the contract would finish before the end of the fixed term period. For this reason, it was considered appropriate that the \nprepayment recognised should be released to the profit or loss in line with this expected profitability, rather than on a straight‑line basis.\nThe amounts held in non-current and current assets of €63.4 million and €3.6 million in Notes 21 and 23, respectively, are the difference between \nthe MG actually paid to News UK from February 2019 to June 2021 and the amounts recognised in the Group’s profit or loss from February 2019 \nto December 2022. \n166 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Note 6 – Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions continued\nEstimates and assumptions continued \nSun Bingo agreement continued\nJudgements made on recognition and measurement continued\nThere is always a risk with any budgeting process that the plan may not be realised. This risk increases the longer the period for which the budget \ncovers and in this instance the period is potentially up to 15 years. When producing the budget management applies reasonable assumptions \nbased on known factors, but sometimes and outside of management’s control, these factors may vary. However, management also reviews these \nforecasts at each reporting period and more regularly internally and adjusts the expense released accordingly. Based on the most recent forecasts \nand current profitability and the fact that the Group had been running the operation since 2016 and therefore has significant experience of the level \nof profitability that can be derived from the operation, it is confident that the performance of the business will allow the full recovery of this asset, \nbefore the contract ends. \nCalculation of legal provisions\nThe Group ascertains a liability in the presence of legal disputes or ongoing lawsuits when it believes it is probable that a financial outlay will take \nplace and when the amount of the losses can be reasonably estimated. The Group is subject to lawsuits regarding complex legal problems, \nwhich are subject to a differing degree of uncertainty (also due to a complex legislative framework), including the facts and the circumstances \ninherent to each case, the jurisdiction and the different laws applicable. Given the uncertainties inherent to these problems, it is difficult to predict \nwith certainty the outlay which will derive from these disputes and it is therefore possible that the value of the provisions for legal proceedings \nand disputes may vary depending on future developments in the proceedings underway. The Group monitors the status of the disputes \nunderway and consults with its legal advisers and experts on legal and tax-related matters. More details are included in Note 29.\nMeasurement of fair values of equity investments and equity call options\nThe Group’s equity investments and, where applicable (based on the judgements applied above), equity call options held by the Group, are measured \nat fair value for financial reporting purposes. The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair value.\nIn estimating the fair value of an asset and liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. Where Level 1 inputs are \nnot available, the Group engages third-party qualified valuers to perform the valuation. The Group works closely with the qualified valuers to \nestablish the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model. \nAs mentioned in Note 20, the Group has:\n•\t investments in listed securities where the fair values of these equity shares are determined by reference to published price quotations in an \nactive market;\n•\t equity investments in entities that are not listed, accounted at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9; and\n•\t derivative financial assets (call options in instruments containing potential voting rights), which are accounted at fair value through profit or loss \nunder IFRS 9.\nThe fair value of the equity investments that are not listed and of the derivative financial assets, rely on non-observable inputs that require a \nhigher level of management judgement to calculate a fair value than those based wholly on observable inputs. Valuation techniques are used \nto calculate fair values include comparisons with similar financial instruments for which market observable prices exist, discounted cash flow \nanalysis and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants. Upon the use of DCF method, the Group assumes that the \nexpected cash flows are based on the EBITDA. \nThe Group only uses models with unobservable inputs for the valuation of certain unquoted equity investments. In these cases, estimates are \nmade to reflect uncertainties in fair values resulting from a lack of market data inputs, for example, as a result of illiquidity in the market. Inputs \ninto valuations based on unobservable data are inherently uncertain because there is little or no current market data available from which to \ndetermine the level at which an arm’s length transaction would occur under normal business conditions. Unobservable inputs are determined \nbased on the best information available. Further details on the fair value of assets are disclosed in Note 20, which includes a significant \njudgement relating to the public announcement made by the Group on 6 February 2023 where Playtech plc is seeking a declaration from the \nEnglish Courts to obtain clarification on a point of disagreement between the Group and Caliplay.\nThe following table shows the carrying amount and fair value of non-current assets, as disclosed in Note 20, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy.\n \nCarrying amount\nFair value\n2022\n €’m\nLevel 1\n€’m\nLevel 2\n€’m\nLevel 3\n€’m\nNon-current assets\nOther investments (Note 20B)\n9.2\n1.4\n—\n7.8 \nDerivative financial assets (Note 20C)\n636.4\n—\n—\n636.4\n645.6\n1.4\n—\n644.2\nCarrying amount\nFair value\n2021\n €’m \nLevel 1\n€’m\nLevel 2\n€’m\nLevel 3\n€’m\nNon-current assets\nOther investments (Note 20B)\n8.1\n1.6\n—\n6.5\nDerivative financial assets (Note 20C)\n622.2\n—\n—\n622.2\n630.3\n1.6\n—\n628.7\n167\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

The reported tax expense includes \nadjustments in respect of prior years relating to current tax and deferred tax. The prior year adjustment in respect of current tax of €9.2 million \nincludes an additional provision of €8.4 million relating to uncertain overseas tax positions in respect of prior years. The prior year adjustment \nrelating to deferred tax of €8.1 million relates to the overprovision of deferred tax assets and an underprovision for deferred tax liabilities in \nrespect of goodwill. \nThe Group’s effective tax rate for the current period is 39.5%. The key reasons for the differences are: \n•\t Profits of subsidiaries located in territories where the tax rate is higher than the UK statutory tax rate, this includes Snaitech profits in Italy.\n•\t Expenses not deductible for tax purposes including professional fees, impairment of intangible assets and loss on disposal of subsidiaries. \nChanges in tax rates and factors affecting the future tax charge\nThe most significant elements of the Group’s income arise in the UK where the tax rate for the current period is 19%. It should be noted that \nthe UK tax rate is set to increase to 25% from 1 April 2023. As such, the UK statutory headline rate of corporation tax is the basis on which the \napplicable tax rate is computed.\nIn December 2022, European Union (EU) Member States unanimously adopted the Minimum Tax Directive via written procedure ensuring a \nglobal minimum level of taxation (set at 15%) for multinational enterprise groups. GLoBE Model rules were released in March 2022 and broadly \nEU Member States have until 31 December 2023 to transpose the Directive into national legislation with the rules to be applicable for fiscal years \nstarting on or after 31 December 2023. None of the countries in which the Group operates has enacted or substantively enacted Pillar Two \nModel Rules as part of their national laws as of 31 December 2022.

The internal \ncapitalisation for the year was €57.5 million (2021: €51.3 million).\nOut of the total amortisation charge of €109.8 million (2021: €109.3 million), an amount of €42.0 million (2021: €34.8 million) relates to the \nintangible assets acquired through business combinations. \nIn accordance with IAS 36, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets, including goodwill. Goodwill is allocated \nto thirteen cash-generating units (CGUs) (2021: fifteen out of which two CGUs were under held for sale).\nThe allocation of the goodwill in CGUs (excluding CGUs held for sale) is as follows:\n2022\n€’m\n2021\n€’m\nSnai\n259.7\n258.7\nSports B2B\n132.5\n132.5\nServices\n109.9\n109.9\nCasino\n50.8\n50.8\nQuickspin\n19.8\n26.8\nEyecon\n3.0\n16.6\nPoker\n15.6\n15.6\nStatscore\n—\n12.4\nBingo retail\n9.5\n9.5\nBingo VF\n—\n7.4\nVB retail\n4.6\n4.6\nIGS\n—\n3.7\nAUS GMTC\n4.4\n—\n609.8\n648.5\nManagement reviews CGUs for impairment bi-annually, or on the occurrence of an impairment indicator.

A potential risk for future impairment exists should \nthere be a significant change in the economic outlook, versus those trends management anticipates in its forecasts due to the occurrence of \nthese events. \nWith the exception of CGUs which have been fully impaired to date and CGUs deemed sensitive to impairment from a reasonably possible \nchange in key assumptions as reviewed in further detail below, management has calculated the growth estimates for years one to five by \napplying an average annual growth rate for revenue based on the underlying economic environment in which the CGU operates and the \nexpected performance over that period. Beyond this period, management has applied an annual growth rate of 2%.

      "text": "Note 19 – Intangible assets continued\nIn relation to the Bingo VF, Eyecon, Quickspin and IGS CGUs, following impairment tests completed as at 31 December 2022, partial \nimpairments have been recognised as disclosed below. Certain other CGUs, which are specifically referred to below but not impaired, \nare considered sensitive to changes in assumptions used for the calculation of value in use.\nBingo VF CGU\nThe recoverable amount of the Bingo VF CGU of €4.8 million, with carrying value of €21.1 million, has been determined using a cash flow forecast \nthat includes annual revenue growth rates between negative 1% and 10% over the one to five-year forecast period, a 2% long-term growth rate \nand a post-tax discount rate of 15.8%. Following the contract termination of a significant licensee, the CGU is currently making considerable \nefforts to recover through new geographical expansion and organic growth. However, growth is slower than expected, with new business \nplanned in new territories being delayed given the overall recessionary pressures worldwide. The impairment recognised in the current year \nwas €12.5 million which impairs the assets down to the recoverable amount. \nEyecon CGU\nThe recoverable amount of the Eyecon CGU showed signs of underperformance during H1 2022, mainly due to the fact that its operations are \nhighly concentrated in the UK online market which has seen a slowdown due to uncertain regulatory climate and as a result the recoverable \namount did not cover the carrying value, with an impairment loss of €13.6 million recognised in the profit or loss for the period ended 30 June 2022. \nNo further impairment has been recognised in the year. The recoverable amount of this CGU of €16.9 million, with a carrying value equal to \n€16.1 million at 31 December 2022, was determined using a cash flow forecast that includes annual revenue growth rates between 0% to 10.0% \nover the 1-5 year forecast period, 2% long-term growth rate and a post-tax discount rate of 15.6%. The recoverable amount would equal the \ncarrying value of the CGU if:\n•\t the discount rate applied was higher by 4.8%, i.e. reaching a post-tax discount rate of 15.6%; or\n•\t the revenue growth was lower by 0.2% when compared to the forecasted average five-year growth.\nQuickspin CGU\nThe recoverable amount of the Quickspin CGU was impaired during H1 2022, given the risk the CGU bore from the proportion of revenues being \ngenerated from Group’s B2B customers choosing to operate in areas with geopolitical tension, and the resulting 1% increase on the post-tax discount \nrate of the CGU to mitigate for that factor. As a result of the above and also the decrease in the CGU performance which went through organisational \nupdates, an impairment loss of €7.0 million was recognised in the profit or loss for the period ended 30 June 2022. No further impairment was \nrecognised in the year. The recoverable amount of this CGU of €56.2 million, with a carrying value of €46.2 million at 31 December 2022, has been \ndetermined using a cash flow forecast that includes annual revenue growth rates between 5.0% to 15.1% over the 1–5 year forecast period, 2% long-\nterm growth rate and a post-tax discount rate of 12.1%. The recoverable amount would equal the carrying value of the CGU if:\n•\t the discount rate applied was higher by 18.3%, i.e., reaching a post-tax discount rate of 14.3%; or\n•\t the revenue growth was lower by 2% when compared to the forecasted average five-year growth.\nIGS CGU\nThe recoverable amount of the IGS CGU of €1.1 million, with carrying value of €6.7 million, has been determined using a cash flow forecast that \nincludes annual revenue growth rates between 10.0% and 77.0% over the one to five-year forecast period, a 2% long-term growth rate and a \npost-tax discount rate of 22.0%. The unit was severely affected by COVID-19 and until recently it had not managed to bring revenue up to pre-COVID \nlevels with the business suffering from cancelled or postponed projects. As a result, the recoverable amount does not cover the carrying value, \nwith an impairment loss of €5.6 million recognised in the profit or loss. \nIf the revenue growth rate per annum is lower by 1%, then an additional impairment of €1.1 million would be recognised. Similarly, if the discount \nrate increases by 1% to a post-tax discount rate of 23.0%, this would result in a further impairment of €0.4 million.\nBingo retail CGU\nThe recoverable amount of the Bingo retail CGU, with carrying value of €24.9 million, which has not been impaired, has been determined using a \ncash flow forecast that includes annual revenue growth rates of 2% over the one to five-year forecast period, a 2% long-term growth rate and a \npost-tax discount rate of 14.4%. The recoverable amount would equal the carrying value of the CGU if:\n•\t the discount rate applied was higher by 8.1%, i.e. reaching a post-tax discount rate of 15.6%; or\n•\t the revenue growth was lower by 1.0% when compared to the forecasted average five-year growth.\nSports B2B CGU\nThe recoverable amount of the Sports B2B CGU, with carrying value of €232.9 million, which has not been impaired, has been determined using \na cash flow forecast that includes annual revenue growth rates of 9.2% over the one to five-year forecast period, a 2% long-term growth rate and \na post-tax discount rate of 14.9%. The recoverable amount would equal the carrying value of the CGU if:\n•\t the discount rate applied was higher by 7.6%, i.e. reaching a post-tax discount rate of 16.0%; or\n•\t the revenue growth was lower by 0.5% when compared to the forecasted average five-year growth.\n185\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

A. de C.V, which has since changed its name to Corporacion Caliente \nSAPI (“Caliente”), the majority owner of Tecnologia en Entretenimiento Caliplay, S. de R.L. de C.V (“Caliplay”), which is a leading betting and \ngaming operator in Mexico which operates the “Caliente” brand in Mexico. \nThe Group made a €16.8 million loan to September Holdings B.V (previously the 49% shareholder of Caliplay), a company which is 100% owned \nby Caliente, in return for a call option that would grant the Group the right to acquire 49% of the economic interest of Caliplay for a nominal \namount (the “Playtech Call Option”). \nDuring 2021 Caliplay redeemed its share at par from September Holdings, which resulted in Caliente becoming the sole shareholder in Caliplay. \nThe terms of the existing structured agreement were varied, with the following key changes:\n•\t A new additional option (in addition to the Playtech Call Option) was granted to the Group which allowed the Group to take up to a 49% \nequity interest in a new acquisition vehicle should Caliplay be subject to a corporate transaction – this additional option is only exercisable in \nconnection with a corporate transaction and therefore was not exercisable at 31 December 2021 or 31 December 2022 (the “Playtech M&A \nCall Option”).\n•\t Caliente received a put option which would require Playtech to acquire September Holding Company B.V. for a nominal amount (the \n“September Put Option”). This option has been exercised and the parties are in the process of transferring legal ownership of September \nHolding Company B.V. to the Group.\nThe Group has no equity holding in Caliplay or Caliente and is currently providing services to Caliplay including technical and general strategic \nsupport services for which it receives income (including an additional B2B services fee as described in Note 5). If the Playtech Call Option or \nthe Playtech M&A Call Option are exercised, the Group would no longer be entitled to receive the additional B2B services fee (and will cease to \nprovide the related services) which for the year ended 31 December 2022 was €66.3 million (2021: €49.4 million). In addition, for 45 days after \nthe finalisation of Caliplay’s 2021 accounts, Caliplay also had an option to redeem the Group’s additional B2B services fee or (if the Playtech \nCall Option had been exercised at that time) Caliente would have the option to acquire Playtech’s 49% stake in Caliplay (together the “Caliente \nCall Option”).\nAs per the public announcement made by the Group on 6 February 2023, Playtech plc is seeking a declaration from the English Courts to obtain \nclarification on a point of disagreement between the parties in relation to the Caliente Call Option. The Group believes the Caliente Call Option \nhas expired and referred to its expiry having taken place in its interim report for the six-month period ended 30 June 2022, which was published \non 22 September 2022. If the Caliente Call Option was declared as being exercisable and was exercised, this would extinguish the Playtech Call \nOption and the Playtech M&A Call Option.\nIn addition to the above, from 1 January 2025, if there is a change of control of Caliplay or any member of the Caliente group which holds a \nregulatory permit under which Caliplay operates, each of the Group and Caliente shall be entitled (but not obligated), within 60 days of the time \nof such change of control, to require that the Caliente group redeems the Group’s additional B2B services fee or (if the Playtech Call Option had \nbeen exercised at that time) acquires Playtech’s 49% stake in Caliplay. If such change of control were to take place and the right to redeem/\nacquire were to occur, this would extinguish the Playtech Call Option (to the extent not exercised prior thereto) and the Playtech M&A Call \nOption. In respect of this change of control arrangement the Group has made a judgement that as at 31 December 2022 this has no impact on \nthe fair value calculation of the Playtech M&A Call Option.\n187\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Investments in associates continued\nCaliplay continued\nAssessment of control and significant influence\nAs at 31 December 2022 and 2021 it was assessed that the Group did not have control over Caliplay, because it does not meet the criteria \nof IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, paragraph 7 due to the following: \n•\t Despite the Group previously having a nominated director on the Caliplay board in 2020 and having consent rights on certain decisions \n(in each case, removed in 2021), there was no ability to control the relevant activities. \n•\t Whilst they are not members of the board, the Group has the ability to appoint and change both the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Chief \nMarketing Officer (CMO) who form part of the management team. The COO and the CMO form part of the wider management team but not \nthe board and therefore are unable to control the relevant activities of Caliplay.\n•\t The Playtech Call Option or the Playtech M&A Call Option, if exercised, would result in Playtech having up to 49% of the voting rights and \nwould not result in Playtech having control.\n•\t Whilst the Group does receive variable returns from its structured agreement, it does not have the power to direct relevant activities so any \nvariation cannot arise from such a power.\nAs at 31 December 2022 and 2021, the Group has significant influence over Caliplay because it meets one or more of the criteria under IAS 28, \nparagraph 6 as follows:\n•\t It has the ability to appoint key members of the Caliplay management team. \n•\t The standard operator revenue by itself is not considered to give rise to significant influence; however, when combined with the additional B2B \nservices fee, this is an indicator of significant influence.\n•\t The material transaction of the historical loan funding is also an indicator of significant influence.\nAccounting for each of the options\nThe Playtech Call Option was exercisable at 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021, although it still has not been exercised. As the Group \nhas significant influence and the option is exercisable, the investment is recognised as an investment in associate using the equity accounting \nmethod which includes having current access to profits and losses. The cost of the investment was previously deemed to be the loan given \nthrough September Holdings of €16.8 million, which at the time was assessed under IAS 28, paragraph 38 as not recoverable for the foreseeable \nfuture and part of the overall investment in the entity. \nIn 2021, with the introduction of the September Put Option, the investment in associate relating to the original Playtech Call Option was reduced \nto zero and the €16.8 million original loan amount was determined by management to be the cost of the new Playtech M&A Call option and therefore \nfully offset the balance of €16.8 million against the overall fair value movement of the Playtech M&A Call Option (refer to part C of this note). \nThe Playtech M&A Call Option is not currently exercisable and therefore in accordance with IAS 28, paragraph 14 has been recognised as \nderivative financial asset, and disclosed separately under part C of this note. \nAs per the judgement in Note 6, the Group did not consider it appropriate to equity account for the share of profits as the current 100% \nshareholder is entitled to any undistributed profits. \nBelow is the financial information of Caliplay:\n \n2022 1\n€’m\n2021 1\n€’m\nCurrent assets\n96.7\n 62.9 \nNon-current assets\n30.3\n 20.2 \nCurrent liabilities\n(78.1)\n (67.5) \nNon-current liabilities\n—\n—\nEquity\n48.9\n 15.6 \nRevenue\n532.1\n 372.3 \nProfit from continuing operations\n30.4\n 23.3 \nOther comprehensive income /(loss), net of tax\n2.5\n (1.0) \nTotal comprehensive income\n32.9\n 22.3 \n1\t\nThe 2021 balances above have been extracted from Caliplay’s audited 2021 financial statements whereas the 2022 balances have been extracted from the draft unaudited Caliplay financial statements.\nInvestment in ALFEA SPA\nThe Group has held 30.7% equity shares in ALFEA SPA since June 2018.

      "text": "Note 20 – Investments and derivative financial assets continued\nA. Investments in associates continued\nInvestment in Galera \nIn June 2021, the Group entered into an agreement with Ocean 88 Holdings Ltd which is the sole holder of Galera Gaming Group (together \n“Galera”), a company registered in Brazil. Galera offers and operates online and mobile sports betting and gaming (poker, casino, etc.) in Brazil. \nThey will continue to do so under the local regulatory license, when this becomes available, and will expand to other gaming and gambling \nproducts based on the local license conditions. \nThe Group’s total consideration paid for the investment in Galera was $5.0 million (€4.2 million) in the year ended 31 December 2021, which \nwas the consideration for the option to subscribe and purchase from Galera an amount of shares equal to 40% in Galera at nominal price. \nIn addition to the investment amount paid, Playtech made available to Galera a line of credit up to $20.0 million. In 2022, an amendment was \nsigned to the original framework agreement to increase the credit line to $45.0 million. As at 31 December 2022, an amount of €26.9 million, \nwhich is included in loans receivable under other non-current assets (refer to Note 36) has been drawn down (2021: €8.1 million). An amount \nof €18.0 million has been loaned in the year ended 31 December 2022. The loan is required to be repaid to Playtech prior to any dividend \ndistribution to the current shareholders of Galera. The Group recognised an allowance for expected credit losses for the loan to Galera of \n€1.1 million as at 31 December 2022 (2021: €Nil). \nIn respect of the loan receivable from Galera even though the framework agreement does not state a set repayment term, management has \nassessed that this should still be recognised as a loan as opposed to part of the overall investment in associate in line with IAS 28. The Directors \nhave made a judgement that the loan will be settled from operational cash flows as opposed to being settled as part of an overall transaction. If \nthe Group had determined that the loan was part of the overall investment in associate an additional €3.6 million share of loss of associate would \nhave been recorded in the profit and loss. The €3.6 million has not been recognised as the investment in associate has been reduced to €Nil \n(see below).\nPlaytech has assessed whether it holds power to control the investee and it was concluded that this is not the case. Even if the option is \nexercised, it would only result in a 40% voting right over the operating entity and therefore no control. \nUnder the agreement in place:\n•\t the standard operator income to be generated from services provided to Galera when combined with the additional B2B services fee, \nthe loan and certain other contractual rights, are all indicators of significant influence; and\n•\t the Group provides standard B2B services (similar to services provided to other B2B customers) as well as additional services to Galera \nthat Galera requires to assist it in successfully running its operations, which could be considered essential technical information.\nConsidering the above factors, the Group has significant influence under IAS 28, paragraph 6 over Galera. \nAs the option is currently exercisable and gives Playtech access to the returns associated with the ownership interest, the investment is treated \nas an investment in associate. Playtech’s interest in Galera is accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated financial statements. \nGalera is still considered a start-up and therefore is currently loss making. If the call option is exercised by Playtech the Group will no longer \nprovide certain services and as such will no longer be entitled to the additional B2B service fee. The additional B2B services fee was €Nil in \nthe year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: €Nil).\nThe cost of the investment was deemed to be the price paid for the option of $5.0 million (€4.2 million). A share of the loss of €3.6 million \nwas recognised in the profit or loss in the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: €0.6 million) making the resulting value of the investment at \n31 December 2022 €Nil (2021: €3.6 million). The total share of loss from Galera was €7.2 million as at 31 December 2022 but is capped at \n€3.6 million to bring the cost of the investment to €Nil.\nInvestment in LSports\nBackground\nIn November 2022, the Group entered into the following transactions:\n•\t acquisition of 15% of Statscore for a total consideration of €1.8 million. As a result of this transaction Statscore became a 100% subsidiary \nof the Group;\n•\t disposal of 100% of Statscore to LSports Data Ltd (“LSports”) for a total consideration of €7.5 million (settled through the acquisition of \nLSports in shares) less a novated inter-company loan of €1.6 million, therefore a non-cash net consideration of €5.9 million; and \n•\t acquisition of 30.89% of LSports for a total consideration of €36.7 million, which also included an option to acquire further shares (up to 18.11%) \nin LSports. Of the total consideration, €29.2 million was paid in cash with the balance offset against the disposal proceeds of Statscore as per \nthe above. \nAs a result of the disposal of 100% of Statscore, the Group realised a loss of €8.8 million which has been recognised in the profit or loss for the \nyear ended 31 December 2022 and is made up as follows:\n2022\n€’m\nNet asset position as at the date of the disposal (including goodwill of €12.4 million)\n14.7 \nNet consideration\n(5.9)\nLoss on disposal\n8.8 \n189\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Investments in associates continued\nInvestment in LSports continued\nBackground continued\nFurthermore, the Group has an option to acquire up to 49% (so an additional 18.11%) of the equity of LSports (“LSports Option”). The LSports \nOption is exercisable under the following conditions:\n•\t within 90 days from the date of receipt of the LSports audited financial statements for each of the years ending 31 December 2024, 2025 \nand 2026; or\n•\t at any time until 31 December 2026 subject and immediately prior to the consummation of an Initial Public Offering or Merger & Acquisition \nevent of LSports.\nThe fair value of the option acquired was €1.4 million which was part of the total consideration €36.7 million. Refer to part of Note 20C; there is no \nmovement on the fair value between acquisition and year end.\nLSports is a company whose principal activity is to empower sportsbooks and media companies with the highest quality sports data on a \nwide range of events, so they can build the best product possible for their business. The company is based in Israel. The principal reason of \nthe acquisition is the attractive opportunity considered by Playtech to increase its footprint in the growing sports data market segment. \nAssessment of control and significant influence\nAs at date of acquisition and 31 December 2022 it was assessed that the Group did not have control over LSports, because it does not meet \nthe criteria of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, paragraph 7 due to the following: \n•\t despite Playtech having the right to appoint a director on the LSports board, as at 31 December 2022, one had not yet been appointed. \nMoreover, once Playtech appoints a director, there is still no ability to control the relevant activities, as the total number of directors including \npotentially one Playtech appointed director will be five;\n•\t Playtech has neither the ability to change any members of the board or of the management of LSports; and\n•\t as at 31 December 2022 the option is not exercisable and therefore can be disregarded in the assessment of power.\nPer the above assessment Playtech does not hold power over the investee and as such does not have control.\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group has significant influence over LSports because it meets one or more of the criteria under IAS 28, paragraph \n6, the main one being Playtech having the ability to appoint a member on the board of LSports enabling it to therefore participate in policy-\nmaking processes, including decisions about dividends and/or other distributions. As a result of this assessment LSports has been recognised \nas an investment in associate. \nThe LSports option, which is not currently exercisable, is fair valued as per paragraph 14 of IAS 28 and shown as a derivative financial asset in \naccordance with IFRS 9 and disclosed separately under part C of this note.\nPurchase Price Allocation (PPA)\nThe Group has prepared a PPA following the acquisition of the investment, where any difference between the cost of the investment and \nPlaytech’s share of the net fair value of the LSports’ identifiable assets and liabilities results in goodwill. \nDetails of the provisional fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, investment consideration and goodwill are as follows:\nPlaytech’s share\n of net fair value\n of the identifiable\n assets and\nliabilities acquired\n2022\n€’m\nNet book value of liabilities acquired\n(1.3) \nFair value of customer contracts and relationships\n7.8 \nFair value of technology – internally developed\n11.5 \nFair value of brand\n1.6\nDeferred tax arising on acquisition \n(2.3) \nTotal net assets\n17.3 \nTotal consideration \n35.3 \nGoodwill\n18.0\nA total of €0.4 million and €0.1 million was recognised in relation to the amortisation of intangibles and the release of the deferred tax liability \nrespectively, arising on acquisition in the profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2022, with a corresponding entry against the investment \nin associate. The net effect of €0.3 million is recognised in share of loss in profit or loss as at 31 December 2022.

Tenlot Guatemala commenced its activity \nin 2018 and it is currently growing its lottery business in Guatemala, expanding its distribution network and game offering. \nThe Group has acquired a 10% equity holding in Tenlot Guatemala for a total consideration of $5.0 million (€4.4 million) in 2020, which has been \naccounted at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9. \nThe fair value of the equity holding as at 31 December 2022 is $5.0 million (€4.4 million) with no movement in fair value from the prior year.\nIn addition, the Group was granted a 10% equity holding in Super Sports S.A. at no additional cost. The Group also has an option to acquire an \nadditional 80% equity holding in Super Sports S.A. If the option is exercised, the Group would no longer provide certain services and, as such, \nwould no longer be entitled to the additional B2B services fee. The additional B2B services fee was €Nil for the year ended 31 December 2022 \n(2021: €Nil). There are no conditions attached to the exercise of the option.\nThe right of exercising the call option at any time and the acquisition of the additional 80% in Super Sports S.A. give Playtech:\n•\t power over the investee; \n•\t exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n•\t the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. \nIt therefore satisfies all the criteria of control under IFRS 10, paragraph 7 and, as such, at 31 December 2022 Super Sports S.A. has been \nconsolidated in the consolidated financial statements of the Group, noting that this is not material from a Group perspective.\nInvestment in Tentech Costa Rica\nIn 2020, the Group entered into an agreement in Costa Rica with the Tenlot Group.

As part of the transaction, the media partner \nand certain of its shareholders were expected to invest a cash amount in the SPAC in exchange for shares and warrants issued by the SPAC, \nwhich was expected to result in them together holding a material minority equity interest. \nFurther attempts were made to complete the SPAC transaction during the year, however as per the announcement made on 29 July 2022, \nwith capital market conditions having deteriorated significantly since the transaction was initially contemplated, the transaction was no longer \nbeing pursued. \nFor this reason, a decision was taken to change the valuation methodology used as at 31 December 2022 for the Playtech M&A Call Option to \nthat of a DCF approach with a market exit multiple assumption, as opposed to 31 December 2021, where the Group has assessed the fair value \nof the Playtech M&A Call Option based on the proposed term of the expected merger with the SPAC, including the transaction value. \nAs already mentioned in part A of Note 20 the Group is seeking a declaration from the English Courts to obtain clarification on a point of \ndisagreement between the parties in relation to the Caliente Call Option and in particular, whether Caliplay still holds this option which permits \nit to redeem the additional B2B services fee element. Should it be declared that Caliplay still has the Caliente Call Option and Caliplay then \nexercises said option, this would cancel both the Playtech M&A Call Option and the Playtech Call Option. \nThe Group believes the Caliente Call Option has expired and whilst Caliplay has not sought to exercise the option to date, Caliplay has made it \nclear that it considers the option has not yet expired.\n192 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Derivative financial assets continued\nCaliplay continued\nIn arriving at the fair value of the Playtech M&A Call Option, the Group has made a judgement that the Caliente Call Option has expired and \ntherefore no probability weighted scenarios have been modelled that include an assumption that the Caliente Call Option is exercisable. Should \nthe English Courts determine that the option is exercisable and Caliplay chooses to exercise the option, the amount payable by Caliplay to the \nGroup upon exercise would either be agreed between the parties or, failing which, determined by an independent investment bank valuing the \nGroup’s remaining entitlement to receive the additional B2B services fee until 31 December 2034. There is therefore the potential that, should the \nCaliente Call Option be exercisable and then subsequently exercised, the proceeds received by the Group may be materially different (positive \nor adverse) to the fair value of the Playtech M&A Call Option recorded as at 31 December 2022. \nValuation \nThe Group has assessed the fair value of the Playtech M&A Option of the derivative financial asset as at 31 December 2022 using a discounted \ncash flow (DCF) approach with a market exit multiple assumption. The Group used a discount rate of 16% reflecting the cash flow risks given the \nhigh growth rates in place, as well as a discount for illiquidity and control until the expected Group exit date. The Group also made assumptions \non the probability of a possible transaction that may be completed on a number of exit date scenarios over a four-year period, until December \n2026. The Group used a compound annual growth rate of 17.2% over the forecasted cash flow period, an average Adjusted EBITDA margin of \n26.3% and an exit multiple of 9.6x. Due to the uncertainty as to how the exercise of the Playtech M&A Call Option may occur and the potential \nfor the shares held to not be immediately realisable, the Group included an additional discount for lack of marketability (DLOM) for two years \nof 13.8%. Furthermore, Playtech’s share in Caliplay was adjusted to reflect the rights to Caliplay shares that a service provider has under its \nservices agreement with the Group. \nAs at 31 December 2022, the fair value of the Playtech M&A Call Option was $560.6 million (2021: $574.7 million) which converted to €524.0 million \n(2021: €506.7 million). The year-on-year movement of €17.3 million recognised in the profit or loss is attributable to the favourable movement in \nthe USD to EUR foreign exchange rate of €30.6 million, offset by €13.3 million unfavourable movement in the fair value arising from the change \nin a number of variables including exit dates and loss of transaction synergies which impacted cash flows that were only partly offset by the \nincrease in the shareholding as discussed below. \nAs at 31 December 2021 the fair value of the option in Caliplay was determined using a potential transaction price where, due to incoming \nshareholders, Playtech’s share in Caliplay was being diluted down to 36%. As at 31 December 2022, a discounted cash flow valuation method \nis used with a dilution in shareholding down only to 45.8% reflecting the expected rights to Caliplay shares to be allocated to a service provider \nunder its services agreement with the Group. These rights were reduced following the exercise of a redemption option post year end as disclosed \nin Note 40, noting that the Group had assumed this option would be exercised for the purposes of the valuation performed at 31 December 2022. \nDespite the change in valuation approach, the Group considers it reasonable that the value of the Playtech M&A Call Option is broadly \nunchanged given the continued strong operational results of Caliplay for 2022.\nSensitivity analysis\nThe assumptions and judgements made in the valuation of the derivative financial asset as at 31 December 2022 include the following \nsensitivities, noting that factors and circumstances may arise that are outside the Group’s control which could impact the option value:\n•\t A different discount rate within the range of 14% to 18% will result in a fair value of the derivative financial asset in the range of €484.2 million – \n€568.3 million. \n•\t A 5% fluctuation in the Adjusted EBITDA margin will result in a fair value of the derivative financial asset within the range of €494.5 million – \n€553.3 million.\n•\t A 10% fluctuation in the Adjusted EBITDA margin will result in a fair value of the derivative financial asset within the range of €464.6 million – \n€583.3 million.\n•\t A 5% fluctuation in the revenue growth rate will result in a fair value of the derivative financial asset within the range of €487.0 million – \n€561.8 million.\n•\t A 10% fluctuation in the revenue growth rate will result in a fair value of the derivative financial asset within the range of €450.5 million – \n€601.0 million.\n•\t A 1.0 fluctuation on the market exit multiple will result in a fair value of the derivative financial asset within the range of €473.9 million – \n€573.9 million.\n•\t If the 13.8% DLOM applied for two-year period post exercise of the Playtech M&A option was removed (i.e. in the event that an M&A transaction \nincluded the acquisition of Playtech’s shares immediately post exercise) the fair value of the derivative financial asset would increase to €607.6 million. \nConversely, if we double the applied DLOM to 27.6% the fair value of the derivative financial asset would decrease to €440.2 million. \nWplay\nIn August 2019, Playtech entered into a structured agreement with Aquila Global Group SAS (“Wplay”), which has a license to operate online \ngaming activities in Colombia. Under the agreement the Group provides Wplay its technology products, where it receives standard operator \nrevenue and additional B2B services fee as per Note 5. The Group has no shareholding in Wplay.\nPlaytech has a call option to acquire a 49.9% equity holding in the Wplay business. As at 31 December 2021 this option was exercisable in August \n2022, however during 2022, the parties agreed to defer the Group’s ability to exercise this option to August 2023. If the call option is exercised \nby Playtech, the Group would no longer provide certain services and as such will no longer be entitled to the additional B2B services fee. \nThe additional B2B services fee was €Nil for the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: €Nil).\nThe payment of €22.4 million made to Wplay in 2019 and 2020 was considered to be the payment made for the option in Wplay. The Group \nhad contingent commitments totalling $6.0 million, of which $5.0 million was paid in June 2021 and $1.0 million was paid in October 2022. \n193\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Furthermore, as at 31 December 2022 the option is not exercisable and therefore can be disregarded in the \nassessment of power.\nPer the above assessment Playtech does not hold power over the investee and as such does not have control.\nWith regards to the assessment of significant influence, the following facts were considered: \n•\t Playtech has the right to appoint and remove the COO and CMO which is a potential indicator of significant influence given their relative \npositions and involvement in the day-to-day operations of Wplay. \n•\t The standard operator revenue is not considered to give rise to significant influence. However, when combined with the additional B2B \nservices fee, this is an indicator of significant influence.\n•\t The Group provides additional services to Wplay which Wplay requires to assist it in successfully running its operations, which could be \nconsidered essential technical information.\nThe Group therefore has significant influence under IAS 28, paragraph 6 over Wplay. However, as the option is not currently exercisable, we have \nan investment in associate but with no access to profits. As such the option is fair valued as per paragraph 14 of IAS 28 and shown as a derivative \nfinancial asset in accordance with IFRS 9. \nThe Group has given an interest-bearing loan of $1.7 million (€1.6 million) to Wplay, which is due for repayment in December 2023 and is included \nin loans receivable from related parties (refer to Note 36).\nValuation \nThe fair value of the option at 31 December 2022 has been estimated using a DCF approach with a market exit multiple assumption. The Group \nused a discount rate of 25% (2021: 23%) reflecting the cash flow risks given the high growth rates in place and the relative early stages of the \nbusiness, as well as a discount for illiquidity and control until the expected Playtech exit date of December 2026 (2021: expected exit date of \nDecember 2026). The Group used a compound annual growth rate of 24.7% (2021: 27.2%) over the forecasted cash flow period, an average \nAdjusted EBITDA margin of 20.6% (2021: 17.5%) and an exit multiple of 9.6x (2021: 9.8x). As part of the agreement, there is a lock-in mechanism \nthat contractually might prevent Playtech from selling the resulting shares, however an assumption was made that if the exit date assumed in the \nmodel is earlier, then both parties would be in agreement to this earlier exit point, therefore no further discounts were applied post transaction. \nFurthermore, Playtech’s share in Wplay was adjusted to reflect the rights to shares that a service provider has under its services agreement with \nthe Group.\nAs at 31 December 2022, the fair value of the Wplay derivative financial asset is €93.5 million. The difference of €3.7 million between the fair \nvalue at 31 December 2021 of €97.2 million and the fair value at 31 December 2022 has been recognised as follows:\na. \t \u0007€9.4 million derived from the fair value decrease of the derivative call option calculated using the DCF model in the profit or loss for the year \nended 31 December 2022.\nb.\t \u0007€5.7 million derived from the fair value increase due to the exchange rate fluctuation of USD to EUR (as the derivative call option is under a \nforeign subsidiary of the Group whose functional currency is USD) in other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n194 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

It was the Group’s decision to sell the asset, and subsequently \nthe prospective buyer was only interested in the land and not the buildings, which led to this impairment. \n\t\n\u0007The sale has been finalised but the disposal is expected to complete in 2024 with the movement of the trot track from La Maura area to \nSan Siro (previously it was expected that the sale would complete during 2022). \nB. \t \u0007Following the decision made by the Group in 2019 to dispose the Casual and Social Gaming businesses, the value of the divisions were \nclassified as held for sale and the results were included in discontinued operations. \n\t\n\u0007On 11 January 2021, the Group entered into an agreement for the disposal of “YoYo”, also included in this division, for a total consideration of \n$9.5 million. As a result of this transaction, the Group realised a profit of €7.6 million in the profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2021, \nincluded within the total profit from discontinued operations (refer to Note 8). \n\t\nThe Social and Casual Gaming CGU is now fully disposed. \nC.\t \u0007Following the decision made by the Board of Directors in 2020 to dispose of the Financial segment, the division was classified as held for \nsale and its results included in discontinued operations.\n\t\n\u0007In September 2021, the Group entered into an agreement to sell this division for a cash consideration of $250.0 million, with the final \nconsideration being subject to a completion accounts adjustment of up to $25.0 million in either direction, to be determined by the financial \nperformance of the Financial segment from 1 January 2021 to the completion date. \n\t\nThe disposal was completed in July 2022, with cash consideration after this adjustment of $228.1 million (€223.9 million).\n\t\n\u0007At 31 December 2020 an impairment charge of €221.2 million was recognised against this CGU as a result of comparing its carrying value to \nexpected proceeds from the disposal, less expected costs to sell. Following a review of the net assets of the unit at 31 December 2021, when \ncompared to the expected proceeds, €2.0 million of the previously recognised impairment was reversed. The impairment loss allocated \nagainst goodwill cannot be reversed.\n199\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Provisions are held for various legal and regulatory issues that relate to matters arising in \nthe normal course of business, including in particular various disputes that arose in relation to the operation of the various licenses held by the \nGroup’s subsidiary Snaitech. The uncertainty is due to complex legislative and licensing frameworks in the various territories in which the Group \noperates. The Group also operates in certain jurisdictions where legal and regulatory matters can take considerable time for the required local \nprocesses to be completed and the matters to be resolved. \nContractual claims \nThe Group is subject to historic claims relating to contractual matters that arise with customers in the normal course of business. The Group \nbelieves they have a robust defence to the claims raised and has provided for the likely settlement where an outflow of funds is probable. The \nuncertainty relates to complex contractual dealings with a wide range of customers in various jurisdictions, and because as noted above, the \nGroup operates in certain jurisdictions where contractual disputes can take considerable time to be resolved in the local legal system. \nGiven the uncertainties inherent, it is difficult to predict with certainty the outlay (or the timing thereof) which will derive from these matters. It is \ntherefore possible that the value of the provisions may vary further to future developments. The Group monitors the status of these matters and \nconsults with its advisers and experts on legal and tax-related matters in arriving at the provisions recorded. The provisions included represent \nthe Directors’ best estimate of the potential outlay and none of the matters provided for are individually material to the financial statements.\nAccounting for uncertain tax positions \nThe Group is subject to various forms of tax in a number of jurisdictions. Given the nature of the industry and the jurisdictions within which the \nGroup operates, the tax, legal and regulatory regimes are continuously changing and subject to differing interpretations. As such, the Group \nis exposed to a small number of uncertain tax positions and open audits/enquiries. Judgement is applied in order to adequately provide for \nuncertain tax positions where it is believed that it is more likely than not that an economic outflow will arise. The Group has provided for uncertain \ntax positions which meet the recognition threshold and these positions are included within tax liabilities. There is a risk that additional liabilities \ncould arise. Given the uncertainty and the complexity of application of international tax in the sector, it is not feasible to accurately quantify any \npossible range of liability or exposure, and this has therefore not been disclosed.\nNote 30 – Contingent consideration and redemption liability\n \n2022\n€’m\n2021 \n€’m\nNon-current contingent consideration and redemption liability consists of:\n \n \nNon-current redemption liability\nAcquisition of Statscore SP Z.O.O.\n—\n6.0\nNon-current contingent consideration\nAcquisition of Aus GMTC PTY Ltd\n2.1\n—\nOthers\n0.2\n—\nTotal non-current contingent consideration and redemption liability\n2.3\n6.0\nCurrent contingent consideration consists of:\nAcquisition of Eyecon Limited\n—\n3.6\nAmount payable to Aquila Global Group SAS (“Wplay”) (Note 20)\n—\n0.8\nOther acquisitions \n0.6\n0.6\nTotal current contingent consideration\n0.6\n5.0\nTotal contingent consideration and redemption liability\n2.9\n11.0\n203\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Note 38 – Financial instruments and risk management continued\nA. Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. \nThe Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables), its investing activities through loans made and from \nits financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions. After the impairment analysis performed at the reporting date, \nthe expected credit losses (ECLs) are €4.9 million (2021: €7.4 million).\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Group held cash and cash equivalents (before ECL) of €426.9 million as at 31 December 2022 (2021: €576.0 million). The cash and cash \nequivalents are held with bank and financial institution counterparties, which are rated from Caa- to AA+, based on Moody’s ratings.\nImpairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured on a 12-month expected credit loss basis and reflects the short maturities \nof the exposures. The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the \ncounterparties. The Group uses a similar approach for assessment of ECLs for cash and cash equivalents to those used for trade receivables. \nThe ECL on cash balances as at 31 December 2022 is €0.4 million (2021: €0.6 million). \nA reasonable movement in the inputs of the ECL calculation of cash and cash equivalents does not materially change the ECL to be recognised. \n \nTotal\n€’m\nFinancial institutions \nwith A- and \nabove rating\n€’m\nFinancial institutions \nwith below A- rating \nand no rating\n€’m\nContinuing operations\n \n \n \nAt 31 December 2022\n426.9\n214.2\n212.7\nAt 31 December 2021\n576.0\n291.7\n284.3\nTreated as held for sale\n \n \n \nAt 31 December 2022\n—\n—\n—\nAt 31 December 2021\n366.1\n291.9\n74.2\nTrade receivables\nThe Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also \nconsiders the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk associated with the industry and country \nin which customers operate. \nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group has trade receivables of €165.0 million (2021: €185.1 million) which is net of an allowance for ECL \nof €4.5 million (2021: €6.8 million).\nThe Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all \ntrade receivables. To measure the ECL, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. \nThe expected loss rates are calculated based on past default experience and an assessment of the future economic environment. The ECL is \ncalculated with reference to the ageing and risk profile of the balances.\nThe carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit exposure. \nSet out below is the movement in the allowance for expected credit losses of trade receivables:\n31 December 2022\nTotal\n€’m\nNot past due\n€’m\n1–2 months \noverdue\n€’m\nMore than \n2 months \npast due\n€’m\nExpected credit loss rate\n2.7%\n3.0%\n1.1%\n2.9%\nGross carrying amount\n169.5\n124.9\n27.2\n17.5\nExpected credit loss\n(4.5)\n(3.7)\n(0.3)\n(0.5)\nTrade receivables – net\n165.0\n121.2\n26.9\n17.0\n31 December 2021\nTotal\n€’m\nNot past due\n€’m\n1–2 months \noverdue\n€’m\nMore than \n2 months \npast due\n€’m\nExpected credit loss rate\n3.5%\n4.2%\n1.6%\n1.9%\nGross carrying amount\n191.9\n139.6\n32.6\n19.7\nExpected credit loss\n(6.8)\n(5.9)\n(0.5)\n(0.4)\nTrade receivables – net\n185.1\n133.7\n32.1\n19.3\nA reasonable movement in the inputs of the ECL calculation of trade receivables does not materially change the ECL to be recognised. \nImpairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets are presented as net impairment losses within the impairment of financial assets. \nSubsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.\n211\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate bonds and loans and borrowings. \nAt 31 December 2022, none of the Group’s borrowings are at a variable rate of interest (2021: 16%). \nAny reasonably possible change to the interest rate would have an immaterial effect on the interest payable.\nEquity price risk\nThe Group is exposed to market risk by way of holding some investments in other companies on a short-term basis. Variations in market value \nover the life of these investments will have an immaterial impact on the balance sheet and the statement of comprehensive income.\n213\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Notes to the Company financial statements\nNote 1 – General\nThe principal activity of Playtech plc (the “Company”) is the holding of investments and the provision of financial support to Group companies.\nNote 2 – Basis of preparation\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (March 2018) and updated for \namendments issued subsequently. Because of the disclosure reductions, financial statements prepared under FRS 101 do not comply with all \nof the requirements of adopted IFRSs. In common with UK incorporated entities preparing parent company financial statements in accordance \nwith FRS 101 the Company has not presented a statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\nThe Company, being a qualifying entity (FRS 101:8(g)), has been granted an exemption from preparing the following:\n•\t a statement of cash flows as per the requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements;\n•\t disclosure of compensation for key management personnel and amounts incurred by the Company for the provision of key management \npersonnel services provided;\n•\t disclosure requirements of IFRS 7 other than for those instruments where these disclosures are still required to comply with the law; and\n•\t disclosure requirements of IFRS 13 other than for those instruments where these disclosures are still required to comply with the law. \nDetails of the Company’s accounting policies are included in Note 5. \nGoing concern basis\nDetailed reference to the exact procedures applied by the Directors in ensuring that the Company will have adequate financial resources to \ncontinue in operational existence over the relevant going concern period are described in Note 2 of the Group consolidated financial statements. \nBased on this Note it is therefore considered appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements.\nNote 3 – Functional and presentation currency\nThe financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. All amounts have been rounded \nto the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated.\nNote 4 – New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the Group\nNew standards, interpretations and amendments adopted from 1 January 2022\nThe Company applied for the first time certain standards and amendments, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after \n1 January 2022, but do not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company. \nNew standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective\nThere a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB that are effective in future \naccounting periods that the Company has decided not to adopt early. \nThe amendments are applied retrospectively for annual periods on or after 1 January 2023: \n•\t Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Disclosure of Accounting Policies.\nThe amendments change the requirements in IAS 1 with regard to disclosure of accounting policies. The amendments replace all instances \nof the term “significant accounting policies” with “material accounting policy information”. Accounting policy information is material if, when \nconsidered together with other information included in an entity’s financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions \nthat the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.\nThe supporting paragraphs in IAS 1 are also amended to clarify that accounting policy information that relates to immaterial transactions, other \nevents or conditions is immaterial and need not be disclosed. Accounting policy information may be material because of the nature of the related \ntransactions, other events or conditions, even if the amounts are immaterial. However, not all accounting policy information relating to material \ntransactions, other events or conditions is itself material.\nThe amendments to IAS 1 are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with earlier application permitted, and are \napplied prospectively. The amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2 do not contain an effective date or transition requirements.\n•\t Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates.\nThe amendments replace the definition of a change in accounting estimates with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, \naccounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”.\nThe definition of a change in accounting estimates was deleted. However, the Board retained the concept of changes in accounting estimates \nin the standard with the following clarifications:\n•\t A change in accounting estimate that results from new information or new developments is not the correction of an error.\n•\t The effects of a change in an input or a measurement technique used to develop an accounting estimate are changes in accounting estimates \nif they do not result from the correction of prior period errors.\nThe amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 to changes in accounting policies and changes in \naccounting estimates that occur on or after the beginning of that period, with earlier application permitted.\nThe Company does not expect any other standards issued by the IASB, but not yet effective, to have a material impact on the Company.\n218 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

The Company has consistently \napplied the following accounting policies to all relevant periods, except if mentioned otherwise. \nSubsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Company “controls” an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns \nfrom its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\nInvestments in subsidiary companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value, which is recognised as an expense in the period \nin which the impairment is identified. Subsequent changes in value include employee share option additions and subsidiary capital contributions \nin the form of debt settlement.\nAssociates\nAn associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant \ninfluence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. \nThe existence of significant influence by an entity is usually evidenced in one or more of the following ways in accordance with IAS 28 Investment \nin Associates and Joint Ventures, paragraph 6:\n•\t representation on the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee;\n•\t participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or other distributions;\n•\t material transactions between the entity and its investee;\n•\t interchange of managerial personnel; or\n•\t provision of essential technical information.\nThe results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. \nUnder the equity method, an investment in associate is initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise \nthe Company’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate.\nInterest income\nInterest income is recognised over time, on a time-proportion basis, using the effective interest method.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense is charged to profit or loss over the time the relevant interest relates to.\nForeign currencies\nThe financial statements are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates, the Euro (€) \n(its functional currency). \nIn preparing the financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at \nthe rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are \nretranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are \nretranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical \ncost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\nExchange differences arising on the settlements of monetary items and on the retranslation of monetary items are included in profit or loss for \nthe period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items, carried at fair value, are included in profit or loss for the \nperiod except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised in other \ncomprehensive income and then equity. \nDividends\nDividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the year in which they are approved \nby the Company’s shareholders.\n219\nPlaytech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Notes to the Company financial statements continued\nNote 5 – Significant accounting policies continued\nFinancial instruments\n(i) Recognition\nTrade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and liabilities are initially \nrecognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. \nFinancial assets\n(ii) Classification\nThe Company classifies its financial assets at amortised cost. \nThe classification depends on the Company’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\nFinancial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Company changes its business model for managing \nfinancial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are classified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in \nbusiness model. \n(iii) Measurement\nThe classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the \nCompany’s business model for managing them. Financial assets are measured at amortised cost and arise principally through intercompany \nbalances being amounts from other Group companies in the ordinary course of business, but also incorporate other types of contractual \nmonetary assets. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. The Company holds the intercompany receivables with the \nobjective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate \nmethod, less provision for impairment.\nECL on intercompany receivables is based on past default experience and an assessment of the future economic environment. ECL and \nspecific provisions are considered and calculated with reference to the ageing and risk profile of the balances. The Company uses judgement \nin making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculations based on the Company’s past history, existing market \nconditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. Based on past experience and how the Group operates \nin relation to intercompany positions, the ECL is negligible because these balances are usually cleared, either through repayment or capital \ncontribution. \nOther receivables consist of amounts generally arising from transactions outside the usual operating activities of the Company such as the \nproceeds from disposal of investment. Due to the short-term nature of the other current receivables, their carrying amount is considered \nto be the same as their fair value. For the majority of the non-current receivables, the fair values are also not significantly different to their \ncarrying amounts.\n(iv) Derecognition\nThe Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the \nrights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset \nare transferred or in which the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain \ncontrol of the financial asset.\nThe Company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its balance sheet but retains either all or substantially all of the \nrisks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. \n(v) Impairment\nThe Company has assessed all types of financial assets that are subject to the expected credit loss model:\n•\t intercompany receivables; and\n•\t cash and cash equivalents.\nFor intercompany receivables and cash and cash equivalents, the Company applies the general approach for calculating the expected credit \nlosses. Due to the short-term nature of these assets (i.e less than 12 months), the Company recognises expected credit losses over the lifetime \nof the assets. \nFor cash and cash equivalents, ECL was considered and calculated by reference to Moody’s credit ratings for each financial institution. The \ncash and cash equivalents held with banks are all rated with A, based on Moody’s ratings. As a result, the probability of default of each institution \nis considered insignificant.\nFinancial liabilities\n(vi) Classification and measurement\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held for \ntrading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and \nlosses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost \nusing the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on \nderecognition is also recognised in profit or loss. \n(vii) Derecognition\nThe Company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired. The Company also derecognises \na financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial \nliability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.\nOn derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-\ncash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.\n220 Playtech plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Note 5 – Significant accounting policies continued\nFinancial liabilities continued\n(viii) Offsetting \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Company \ncurrently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and \nsettle the liability simultaneously. \nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in banks and demand deposits and are carried at amortised cost because: (i) they are held \nfor collection of contractual cash flows and those cash flows represent SPP; and (ii) they are not designated at FVTPL.\nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from \nsuppliers. Trade and other payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented \nas non‑current liabilities. \nTrade and other payables are recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\nShare capital\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity and are stated at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.\nShare buyback \nConsideration paid for the share buyback is recognised against the additional paid in capital. Any excess of the consideration paid over \nthe weighted average price of shares in issue is debited to the retained earnings.\nEmployee Benefit Trust\nConsideration paid/received for the purchase/sale of shares subsequently put in the Employee Benefit Trust, which is controlled by the \nCompany, is recognised directly in equity. The cost of shares held is presented as a separate reserve (the “Employee Benefit Trust reserve”). \nAny excess of the consideration received on the sale of treasury shares over the weighted average cost of the shares sold is credited to \nretained earnings.\nNote 6 – Critical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe Company makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on \nhistorical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In \nthe future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgements \nthat may potentially have a significant impact on the Company’s earnings and financial position are detailed below.\nEstimates and assumptions\nImpairment of investment in subsidiary companies\nThe Company is required to test if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of its investments may not be recoverable. \nIn making this assessment there were no indicators of impairment evident and as such no impairment of investments in subsidiary companies \nhas been recognised during the year. Please refer to Note 7 for the breakdown of the impairment to investments.\nThe assessment considered the following key points on the material investments the Company holds:\n•\t investment in Playtech Holdings Limited and its relevant subsidiaries of €905.3 million includes the Snaitech operations which comfortably \ncover the investment value; and\n•\t investment in Playtech Software Limited of €261.9 million; this company holds a significant number of key IP and major activities of the Group \nwhich is the reason why there are no factors indicating there is an impairment. \nImpairment of financial assets\nLoss allowances for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Company’s financial assets \nconsist of intercompany receivables and cash and cash equivalents. ECL on cash balances was considered and calculated by reference to \nMoody’s credit rating for each financial institution.\nNote 7 – Investments in subsidiaries\n \n2022\n €’m \n2021\n €’m \nInvestment in subsidiaries at 1 January \n1,201.4\n1,144.2\nAdditional capital contribution1\n—\n49.1\nEmployee stock options \n8.1\n13.9\nDisposals3\n(0.8)\n—\nImpairments2\n—\n(5.8)\nInvestment in subsidiaries at 31 December\n1,208.7\n1,201.4\n1\t\nDuring 2021 the Group agreed to forgive certain outstanding debt due from subsidiaries with a book value of €49.1 million which has accordingly been treated as additional capital contribution. \n2\t Impairment for the year ended 31 December 2021 relates to €1.2 million impairment of Playtech Holding Sweden AB Limited and €4.6 million of PTVB Management Limited. \n3\t \u0007In July 2022, the Company completed the disposal of its investment in Finalto Group Limited (formerly known as TradeTech Holdings Limited) realising a profit on disposal of €49.0 million.
