Going forward, we will continue to work to fulfill our social responsibility \nand create shared value in order to achieve sustainability and enrich communities together with our customers and \npartners from a long-term perspective based on our Management Philosophy. \n \n① Materialities and key sustainability topics, KPI \nAt Epson, we reference the societal issues and megatrends described in international social norms and other such \nsources, evaluated them from a company perspective and a social perspective, and identified four materialities \n(“achieve sustainability in a circular economy,” “advance the frontiers of industry,” “improve the quality of life,” and \n“fulfill our social responsibility”), which are high-priority issues that we should address to solve societal issues. We \nthen selected 12 key sustainability topics, set key performance indicators (KPIs) for initiatives, reflected them in our \nMid-Range Business Plan, and steadily took initiatives in order to make materiality initiatives effective. We \nconsidered KPIs for all materiality in the initiatives for sustainability issues, but we first focused on corporate stability, \nand disclosed the KPIs for the two ESG-related materialities (“achieve sustainability in a circular economy” and \n“fulfill our social responsibility.” We plan to disclose the KPIs for “advance the frontiers of industry” and “improve \nthe quality of life” from FY2023 onward."

We also set goals to be achieved by 2050 and established initiatives to realize \nthem. \n \nItem \nDetails \nVision statement \nEpson will become carbon negative and underground resource free by 2050 to \nachieve sustainability and enrich communities \nGoals \n2030: Reduce total emissions in line with the 1.5℃ scenario12 \n2050: Carbon negative and underground resource free \nActions \n● Reduce the environmental impacts of products and services and in supply \nchains. \n● Achieve sustainability in a circular economy and advance the frontiers of \nindustry through creative, open innovation. \n● Contribute to international environmental initiatives. \n12 Target for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that conforms with scientific knowledge based on the criteria \nof the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) \n \n③ Climate change initiatives and TCFD \nClimate change is greatly impacting society and Epson sees it as a serious social problem. The goal of the Paris \nAgreement is to limit the increase in global average temperature to well below 2℃ compared to pre-industrial levels \nand to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5℃. Epson has pledged to do its part by achieving its goal of reducing its total \nemissions in line with the 1.5℃ scenario by 2030. As stated in Environmental Vision 2050, which was announced \nalong with the Epson 25 Renewed corporate vision, Epson seeks to become carbon negative and underground \nresource13 free by 2050 by decarbonizing and closing the resource loop. We are also providing products and services \nthat have a smaller carbon footprint and are developing environmental technologies. \nSince indicating its support for the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures \n(TCFD) in October 2019, Epson has disclosed information (on governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics \nand targets) based on the TCFD framework so as to enable good communication with shareholders, investors, and a \nbroad spectrum of other stakeholders. Epson has decided to disclose the level of financial impact in 2021 in a \nquantitative manner for the first time. Furthermore, in 2022, Epson enhanced its disclosure of specific initiatives and \nachievements aimed at reducing GHG emissions in response to the update to the TCFD recommendations. \n13 Non-renewable resources such as oil and metals \n \n■ Scenario analysis findings \nWe analyzed scenarios based on the TCFD framework to quantitatively assess the financial impact of climate-related \nrisks and opportunities on Epson’s strategy. In a 1.5℃ scenario in which there is rapid decarbonization of society, \nwe found that there is transitional risk of an increase in operating costs due to market changes, policies, and legislation, \nbut we expect to limit the financial impact by strengthening products and services based on inkjet technology and \npaper recycling technology. \nEpson will spend approximately 100.0 billion yen (approximately 25.0 billion yen from 2021 to 2025 and \napproximately 75.0 billion yen from 2026 to 2030) over a period of 10 years ending in 2030 to accelerate \ndecarbonization, close the resource loop, and develop environmental technology. The solution to climate-related risks \naligns with the materialities we have set of achieving sustainability in a circular economy and advancing the frontiers \nof industry and will lead to opportunities for business expansion with Epson’s low environmental impact products \nand services that save electricity and reduce waste. These products and services will help to mitigate customers’ \nenvironmental impact and control climate change. \nBased on the results of these analyses, Epson will continue to try to maximize its opportunities while addressing \nrecognized risks in order to achieve decarbonization, which we believe is a rational goal both for society and for \nEpson."

We at Epson \ndevelop global talent and leaders who can make decisions appropriately and promptly at operating sites based on \nshared values, put in place comfortable working environments where diverse personnel can demonstrate active roles, \nand proceed to create a free and open organizational culture where workers can maximize team strength. \nIn human resource development, we provide various types of training so that all our employees understand their roles \nand what is expected of them as members of the Epson team. Training helps employees to work and communicate \nmore effectively, enhance their ability to solve problems and achieve goals, and experience personal and professional \ngrowth. In addition, Epson seeks to put itself in the optimal position by adapting organizations to best serve its \nbusiness strategies and the ever-changing business environment. At the same time, we acquire specialists and promote \npriority placement in growth areas while taking a global perspective in developing and training leaders in each \norganization around the globe to drive business forward. Once a year and in each business, function and company, \nwe evaluate and refine the roles and job requirements needed for important posts and organizations, and we review \nthe human resources who can accomplish those roles. Candidates for future executive management and middle \nmanagement positions as well as global positions are thereby identified, and a list is created. Succession plans are \nformulated, and training and education are provided to develop the needed skills. Training opportunities are also \nprovided to prospective leaders and young employees, and a company-wide rotation program ensures that they gain \na broader knowledge and experience. \nEpson is promoting diversity and inclusion with the goal of being a company where all employees can maximize \ntheir abilities regardless of gender or other attributes. In particular, Epson recognizes the advancement of women in \nthe workplace as a priority issue and is working to alleviate the gender gap. Our goal is to achieve gender equality \nand have women at each level of middle and executive management. The ratio of women in management should be \nthe same as the ratio of women in our workforce. We look forward to achieving this naturally, even without being \nconscious of gender. To achieve this goal, we are taking a phased approach for improvement by hiring more women, \nincreasing women who take on supervisory and leader positions, and ultimately increasing female managers, while \nputting in place comfortable working environments for women. In addition, the Board of Directors and corporate \nmanagement bodies check promotion plans, the status of implementation and relevant indicators while discussing \ncourses of action. \nIn promoting health management, we at Epson believe that the health of our employees is of the utmost importance \nto us as a company. Accordingly, we want to see employee health improve and to create a positive, energetic \nworkplace that is conducive to job satisfaction in line with the Management Philosophy and Basic Occupational \nHealth and Safety Policy. We believe this will ultimately result in better financial performance and higher corporate \nvalue. To promote health management activities, we established a Health Management Office to drive initiatives \nunder the president, who is responsible for health and productivity management. The Health Management Office \ndirector is an executive officer who participates in Corporate Management Meetings. The office director, who \nconcurrently serves as the general administrative manager of the Human Resources Division, the chair of the Health \nInsurance Association, and overall health and safety controller, is responsible for the general management of health \nand productivity.

Risks related to Epson’s business operations \n \nAt present, we have identified the following significant risks that could have a materially adverse effect on our future \nbusiness, financial condition or operating results and that should thus be taken into account by investors. For these \nrisks, although matters that may possibly become risk factors are described, they do not cover all risks, and risks that \nwere not assumed as of the filing date of the Annual Securities Report and risks that are of low significance may also \nhave an effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows in the future. \nFurthermore, while as our policy, we strive to recognize, prevent, and control potential risks and to address risks that \nmaterialize, there is no assurance we will succeed in these efforts, and if we are unable to effectively counteract the \nrisks, our financial position, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. \nAll forward-looking statements hereunder were made at Epson’s discretion as of the date we submitted our Annual \nSecurities Report. \n \n(1) Risk management system \nOverall responsibility for risk management in the Epson Group, including subsidiaries, belongs to the president of \nSeiko Epson. Group-wide risk management is carried out by Head Office supervisory departments with the \ncooperation of the operations divisions and subsidiaries. Risks unique to an individual business are managed by the \nchief operating officer of that business, including at subsidiaries consolidated under them. The Company has also \nset up the risk management department, monitors overall risk management Group-wide, makes corrections and \nadjustments thereto, and ensures the effectiveness of risk management programs. The risk management organization \nis defined in the Epson Group Risk Management Basic Regulations. \nEpson identifies serious risks that could materially impact the company. Risks that could have serious adverse effects \non Epson Group management are considered “serious Group-wide risks.” Risks that could have serious adverse \neffects on business operations are considered “serious business risks.” And risks that could have serious adverse \neffects on subsidiaries’ management are considered “serious Group company risks.” Epson drafts and executes plans \nto control these serious risks and periodically monitors their progress. The company also strives to ensure control \nplan effectiveness by evaluating “serious Group-wide risks” every quarter, evaluating “serious business risks” and \n“serious Group company risks” every six months, and revising the plans as needed. The president of Seiko Epson \nreports important risk management affairs to the Board of Directors quarterly. \n \n(2) Risks related to Epson’s business operations \n① Our operating results, etc. could be adversely affected by fluctuations in printer sales. \nThe ¥779.9 billion in revenue in the printing solutions segment in the year ended March 31, 2022 accounted for \nabout 70% of Epson’s ¥1,128.9 billion in consolidated revenue. Inkjet printers (including printer consumables) for \nthe office and home and for commercial and industrial applications accounted for a large majority of our revenue \nand profit. Consequently, a decrease in revenue from printers and printer consumables could have a materially \nadverse effect on our operating results, etc. \n \n② Our financial performance could be adversely affected by competition. \nAdverse effects of competition on sales \nAll of our products, including our core printer and projector products, are subject to the effects of vigorous \ncompetition, which could cause, among other things, prices to fall, demand to shift toward lower-priced products, \nand unit shipments to decline. \nWe are taking strategic action to address the risk of declines in prices, a shift of demand toward lower-priced products, \nand declines in unit shipments. On one hand, we must provide products tailored to customer needs in each market \nalong with high-value products and services. On the other hand, we must reduce manufacturing costs by increasing \ndesign and development efficiency and by reducing fixed costs. \nHowever, there is no assurance we will succeed in these efforts, and if we are unable to effectively counteract \ndownward pressure on prices, our operating results, etc. could be adversely affected. \n \nAdverse effects of competition on technology \nSome of the products that we sell contain technology that places Epson in competition against other companies. For \nexample: \n- The Micro Piezo technology1 that we use in our inkjet printers competes with the thermal inkjet technologies2 of \nother companies;"

      "text": "37 \n- The 3LCD technology3 that we use in our projectors competes with other companies’ DLP technologies4, and \nEpson’s projectors also compete against flat panel displays (FPDs)5 of other companies. \nWe believe that the technologies we use in these products have competitive advantage over the alternative \ntechnologies of other companies. However, if consumer opinion with respect to our technologies changes, or if other \nrevolutionary technologies appear on the market and compete with our technologies, we could lose our competitive \nadvantage in technology and our operating results could be adversely affected. \n1  Micro Piezo technology is an inkjet technology created by Epson that manipulates piezoelectric elements to fire small droplets \nof ink from nozzles. \n2  Thermal inkjet technology (also known as bubble-jet technology) is a printer technology in which the ink is heated to create \nbubbles and the pressure from the bubbles is used to fire the ink. \n3  3LCD technology uses high-temperature polysilicon TFT liquid-crystal panels as light valves. The light from the light source is \ndivided into the three primary colors (red, green and blue) using special mirrors, the picture is created on separate LCDs for each \ncolor, and then the picture is recombined without loss and projected on the screen. \n4  DLP technology uses a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) as a display device. A DMD is a semiconductor on which a large \nnumber of micro mirrors are arranged, each mirror directing light onto its own individual pixel. An image is formed by the light \nfrom the light source being reflected from the mirrors onto the screen. DLP and DMD are registered trademarks of Texas \nInstruments Incorporated. \n5 FPD encompasses a variety of thin electronic display technologies. \n \nThe emergence of new competitors \nWe presently face competition from powerful companies that have advanced technological capabilities, abundant \nfinancial resources, or strong financial compositions. We also face competition from companies around the world \nthat have market recognition, strong supply capacities, or the ability to compete on price. There is, therefore, a \npossibility that other companies could use their brand power, technological strength, ability to procure funds, \nmarketing power, sales skills, low-cost production ability, or other advantages to enter business areas where we are \nactive. \n \n③ Sudden changes, etc. in the business environment could affect Epson. \nEpson seeks to drive office & home printing innovation, commercial & industrial printing innovation, manufacturing \ninnovation, visual innovation, and lifestyle innovation. We are looking to create value truly sought by customers and \nachieve our vision for each business by making each innovation happen. Epson is executing plans and strategies \nbased on a long-range corporate vision Epson 25 Renewed and each business strategy that we believe will enable us \nto establish a competitive advantage in technology, which we believe will be crucial for increasing our \ncompetitiveness. We are evolving product technologies, including digital technologies and our original core \ntechnologies, such as Micro Piezo inkjet technology, microdisplays, sensing, and robotics, all of which arose from \nEpson’s rich legacy of efficient, compact, and precision technologies, as well as the core technologies that underpin \nthese. In this way, we are developing, manufacturing, and selling products and providing services that match \ncustomer needs. \nHowever, in the product markets and businesses where Epson is concentrating its management resources the pace of \ntechnological innovation is typically rapid, and product life cycles are short. In addition, demand and investment \ntrends in Epson’s major markets could change along with global economic conditions and progress of digitalization, \nand could affect sales of Epson products. Moreover, there is no guarantee that Epson’s current long-range corporate \nvision, business strategies, and actions specified therein will succeed or be realized. \nUnder these business circumstances, Epson will also continue to strive to make rapid and smooth transition from \nexisting products to new products by understanding market and customer needs, investing and conducting research \nand development from a medium- and long-range view based on product market forecasts, and creating development \nand design platforms. \nHowever, if Epson cannot suitably respond to technological innovations in its main markets, or if competition with \nother companies intensifies, or if economic downturns or other factors prevent a recovery in demand, or if Epson is \nunable to adequately meet sudden fluctuations in demand in a major market, its operating results, etc. could be \nadversely affected. \n \n④ Our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted by sales of third-party inkjet printer consumables. \nInk cartridges etc., which comprise the bulk of consumables sold for inkjet printers, are an important source of \nrevenue and profit for Epson. However, third parties also supply ink cartridges and other inkjet printer consumables"

      "text": "38 \nthat can be used in Epson printers. These alternative products are typically sold for less than genuine Epson brand \nconsumables and are more prevalent in emerging markets compared to the markets of developed countries. \nTo counter sales of third-party consumables for inkjet printers, we must emphasize the quality of genuine Epson \nproducts and must look to continuously realize customer value by further enhancing customer convenience with \ninkjet printers tailored to the needs of customers in each market. Printer models equipped with high-capacity ink \ntanks are an example of such products. We also take legal measures if any of the patent rights or trademark rights we \nhold over our ink cartridges are infringed upon. \nHowever, there is no assurance that any of these efforts will be effective, and if we experience revenue and profit \ndeclines in businesses such as our ink cartridge business as a result of shrinking unit shipments in response to an \nexpansion of sales of third-party alternative products and drop of the market share of genuine Epson products, or if \nwe must lower the prices of Epson brand products to stay competitive, our operating results, etc. could be adversely \naffected. \n \n⑤ Expanding businesses overseas entails risks for Epson. \nWe continue to expand our businesses overseas, and overseas revenue accounted for 75% or more of our consolidated \nrevenue for the year ended March 31, 2022. We have production sites all over Asia, including China, Indonesia, \nSingapore, Malaysia and the Philippines, as well as in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries. \nWe have also established many sales companies all over the world. As of the end of March 2022, our overseas \nemployees accounted for approximately 75% of our total workforce. \nWe believe that our global presence provides many advantages. For example, it enables us to undertake marketing \nactivities aligned with the market needs of individual regions. It also makes us cost-competitive by reducing \nmanufacturing costs and lead times. There are, however, unavoidable risks associated with overseas manufacturing \nand sales operations. These include but are not limited to changes in national laws, ordinances, or regulations related \nto manufacturing and sales; social, political or economic changes; transport delays; damage to infrastructure such as \nelectrical power and communications; currency exchange restrictions; insufficient skilled labor; changes in regional \nlabor environments; changes in tax systems overseas and uncertainty with regard to tax administration by tax \nauthorities; protectionist trade regulations; geopolitical risks; and laws, ordinances, regulations or the like that could \naffect the import and export of Epson products. \n \n⑥ Procuring parts from certain suppliers entail risks for Epson. \nWe procure some parts and materials from third parties, but we generally conduct ongoing transactions without \nentering into long-term purchase agreements. We try to have multi-source relating to parts and materials. However, \ncertain parts and materials are procured from a single source because procuring them from an alternative supplier is \nnot possible. We must have procurement operations that are stable and efficient, so we work with our suppliers to \nmaintain product quality, improve products, and reduce costs. However, if our manufacturing and sales activities \nwere to be disrupted due to things such as supplier’s parts shortages or quality problems of supplier’s parts, our \noperating results, etc. could adversely be affected. \n \n⑦ Problems could arise relating to quality issues. \nThe existence of quality guarantees on Epson products and the details of those guarantees differ from one customer \naccount to another, depending on the agreement we have entered into with them. If an Epson product is defective or \ndoes not conform to the required standard, it may have to be replaced or repaired or otherwise reworked at Epson’s \nexpense. Or, if the product causes personal injury or property damage, we could bear product liability or hold other \nliability. \nWe could also be liable to a customer and could incur expenses for repairs or corrections on the grounds that we did \nnot adequately display or explain an Epson product’s features or performance. Furthermore, product quality problems \ncould cause loss of trust in Epson products, and we could lose major accounts or see a drop in demand for our \nproducts, any of which might adversely affect our operating results, etc. \n \n⑧ Epson’s intellectual property rights activities expose Epson to certain risks. \nPatent rights and other intellectual property rights are extremely important for maintaining our competitiveness. We \nhave independently developed many of the technologies we need, and we acquire patent rights, trademark rights, and \nother forms of intellectual property rights for them both in Japan and overseas. We also license the intellectual \nproperty rights for products and technologies by entering into agreements with other companies. We have \nstrengthened our intellectual property portfolio by placing personnel in key positions to manage our intellectual \nproperty."

      "text": "39 \nIf any of the situations envisioned below relating to intellectual property were to occur, our operating results, etc. \ncould adversely be affected. \n- An objection might be raised to, or an application to invalidate might be filed with respect to, an intellectual \nproperty right of Epson, and as a result, that right might be recognized as invalid. \n- A third party to whom we originally had not granted a license could come to possess a license as a result of a \nmerger with or acquisition by another party, potentially causing us to lose the competitive advantage conferred \nby that intellectual property. \n- New restrictions could be imposed on an Epson business as a result of a buyout or a merger with a third party, \nand we could be forced to spend money to find a solution to those restrictions. \n- Intellectual property rights that we hold might not give us a competitive advantage, or we might not be able to \nuse them effectively. \n- We or any of our customers could be accused by a third party of infringing on intellectual property rights, which \ncould force us to spend a large amount of time and money to resolve this and associated issues, or which could \ninterfere with our efforts to focus our management resources. \n- If a third-party’s claim of intellectual property right infringement were to be upheld, we could incur material \ndamage if required to pay large amounts in compensation or royalties or if forced to stop using the applicable \ntechnology. \n- A suit could be brought against Epson by an employee or other person seeking remuneration for an invention or \nthe like, potentially forcing us to spend significant time and money to resolve the issue and, depending on the \noutcome, potentially requiring us to pay a large sum as remuneration. \n \n⑨ Epson is vulnerable to environmental risks. \nEpson is subject, both in Japan and overseas, to various environmental regulations concerning industrial waste and \nemissions into the atmosphere that arise from manufacturing processes. In addition, with heightened concern about \nthe response to global climate change accompanying the Paris Agreement, which was adopted at the 21st Conference \nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, companies increasingly need to set \nmore ambitious goals for emissions reductions and strive to accomplish these goals. \nGiven this situation, Epson is proactively engaged in environmental conservation efforts on multiple fronts in line \nwith “Environmental Vision 2050,” through which we aim to become carbon negative and underground resource6 \nfree by 2050. For example, we have programs to develop and manufacture products that have a small environmental \nfootprint and programs to develop environmental technologies. We also have programs to reduce energy use, promote \nthe recovery, recycling and reusing of end-of-life products, ensure compliance with international substance \nregulations (primarily the RoHS Directive and REACH regulations in the EU), and improve environmental \nmanagement systems. For our goals for GHG emissions reduction, we obtained approval from the Science Based \nTargets initiative (SBTi), and we are working on activities to reduce GHG emissions over the medium to long term, \nincluding activities to drive the use of renewable energy, with the aim of achieving the global RE100 in 2023. \nAs a result of these efforts, Epson has reduced its GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) for the 2021 fiscal year to 350,000 \ntons. This represents an approximately 41% reduction since the 2017 fiscal year, a base fiscal year. In addition, we \nhave completed the transition to renewable energy for electricity used at sites in Japan, and this has increased our \nrenewable energy ratio to approximately 49% globally (on an electric power basis). \nWe have not had any serious environmental issues to date. In the future, however, it is possible that an environmental \nproblem could arise that would require us to pay damages and/or fines, bear costs for cleanup, or force a halt of \nproduction. Moreover, new regulations could be enacted that would require major expenditures, and, if such a \nsituation should occur, Epson’s operating results, etc. could be adversely affected. \nOn the other hand, Epson is advancing initiatives that take addressing the environment as an opportunity. In particular, \nwe have confirmed that there is an opportunity to expand business through products and services that can contribute \nto customer environmental impact mitigation, and will continue management that takes maximum advantage of \nopportunities. Specifically, we expect revenue growth through printing, commercial & industrial printing and \nprinthead sales using inkjet technology that realizes the reduction of environmental impacts, higher productivity and \nthe reduction of printing costs as well as the promotion of production systems through the expansion of new \nproduction devices that realize the reduction of environmental impacts. In addition, we expect to develop \nenvironmental businesses through the application of dry fiber technology, establishment of raw material recycling, \netc. as effective solutions for global warming countermeasures and the shift to a circular economy. \n6 Non-renewable resources such as oil and metals"

      "text": "40 \n⑩ Epson faces risks concerning the hiring and retention of personnel. \nWe must hire and retain talented personnel both in Japan and overseas to develop advanced new technologies and \nmanufacture advanced new products, but the competition for such personnel is becoming increasingly intense. We \nmust foster a corporate culture that enables diverse personnel to demonstrate their abilities, create comfortable \nworking environments, and hire and retain talented personnel by, for example, introducing compensation and benefit \npackages that are commensurate with roles, nurturing talent, implementing diversity initiatives, promoting work-\nstyle reform and health management, and proactively promoting people with the right skills overseas. If we are \nunable to continue to hire and keep enough of such employees, or if we are unable to pass along technologies and \nskills, our business plans, etc. could be adversely affected. \n \n⑪ Fluctuations in foreign currency exchanges create risks for Epson. \nA significant portion of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars or the euro. We expanded our overseas \nprocurement and moved our production sites overseas, so our dollar-denominated expenses currently exceed our \ndollar-denominated revenue. On the other hand, our euro-denominated revenue is still significantly greater than our \neuro-denominated expenses. On the whole, our revenues in other foreign currencies also significantly exceed our \nexpenses in those currencies. Also, although we use currency forwards and other means to hedge against the risks \ninherent in foreign currency exchanges, unfavorable movements in the exchange rates of foreign currencies such as \nthe U.S. dollar, euro, or other foreign currencies against the yen could adversely affect our financial position and \noperating results, etc. \n \n⑫ There are risks inherent in pension systems. \nWe have a defined-benefit pension plan and a lump-sum retirement payment plan as defined-benefit plans. \nWe revised the defined-benefit retirement pension plan in April 2014 in response to a drop in the rate of return on \npension assets and an increase in the number of beneficiaries. The revisions are designed to enable us to adapt to \nfuture market changes and maintain stable operations into the future. However, if there is a change in the operating \nresults of the pension assets or in the ratio used as the basis for calculating retirement allowance liabilities, our \nfinancial position and operating results, etc. could be adversely affected. \n \n⑬ Concerning regulatory investigations and investigations conducted by relevant authorities, etc. \nEpson develops its business globally, and it could become the subject of various regulatory investigations or \ninvestigations conducted by relevant authorities, etc. in any of its businesses in any country or region. For example, \nin addition to Epson currently being subject in Japan and overseas to proceedings relating to antitrust laws and \nregulations, such as those prohibiting private monopolies and those protecting fair trade, Epson will in the future be \nrequired even more to respond to various laws and regulations and compliance relating to activities pertaining to its \nefforts to strengthen its sales activities directed at new customers, which will include public organizations, etc. \nUnder these circumstances, in Epson, we consider compliance to be one of the most important management policies, \nand for a long time, we have been conducting appropriate, preventive and controlled activities, including worker \nprotection activities as a member of the RBA (Responsible Business Alliance) and further promotion of \nenvironmental conservation efforts. Going forward, overseas agencies related to competition law have been \nconducting investigations or information gathering that have been targeting specific industries, etc., and as part of \nsuch investigation, Epson also is being investigated in relation to the market situation and marketing methods in \ngeneral. Furthermore, sometimes inconsistencies or potential inconsistencies arise in relation to not only anti-bribery \nregulations, advertising and labeling regulations, personal information protection and privacy regulations but also \nsecurity trade control, and stricter laws and regulations may get introduced or a strengthening of the operation of \nlaws and regulations may be carried out by the relevant authorities. \nShould violations occur in regard to these related laws and regulations, or should investigations or proceedings be \ncarried out by the relevant authorities, such events could interfere with Epson’s sales activities. They could also \npotentially damage Epson’s credibility, result in a large civil fine, or result in constraints being placed on Epson’s \nsales activities. Any of these, as well as the added costs to comply with the relevant regulations could adversely affect \nEpson’s operating results and its future business expansion, etc. \nAs of the date we submitted our Annual Securities Report, investigations into laws and regulations, etc. targeting \nEpson are provided below. \nRegarding the inkjet printer products sold in France, authorities have initiated investigations following an allegation \nmade by a consumer organization in the country in 2017, pursuant to consumer protection law. The consumer \norganization alleges that Epson shortens the life of its products, which was never Epson’s intention. Giving the \nhighest priority to quality and environment, Epson will continue to offer designs that meet customer needs."

We are engaged primarily in the development, manufacture and sales of \nproducts related to printing solutions, visual communications, and manufacturing-related & wearables, as well as the \nprovision of services related thereto. Given the nature of these businesses, there is a possibility that an action could \nbe brought or legal proceedings could be started against Epson regarding, for example, intellectual property rights, \nproduct liability, antitrust laws or environmental regulations. \nAs of the date we submitted our Annual Securities Report, Epson was contending with the following material actions. \nIn 2010, Epson Europe B.V. (“EEB”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, brought a civil suit against La SCRL \nReprobel (“Reprobel”), a Belgium-based group that collects copyright royalties, seeking restitution for copyright \nroyalties for multifunction printers. With Reprobel subsequently filing a suit against EEB, the two lawsuits were \nadjoined. EEB’s claims were rejected at the first trial, but EEB, dissatisfied with the decision, intends to appeal. \nIt is difficult at this time to predict the outcome of these civil actions and when they may be settled, but our operating \nresults and future business development, etc. could be affected, depending on the outcomes of suits and legal \nproceedings. \n \n⑮ Epson is vulnerable to certain risks in internal control related to financial reporting. \nWe are building and using internal controls to ensure the reliability of financial reporting. With the establishment and \noperation of internal controls for financial reporting high on our list of important management issues, we have been \npursuing a Group-wide effort to audit and improve corporate oversight of our Group companies. However, since \nthere is no assurance that we will be able to establish and operate an effective internal control system on a continuous \nbasis, and since there are inherent limitations to internal control systems, if the internal controls that Epson \nimplements fail to function effectively, or if there are deficiencies in internal control related to financial reporting or \nmaterial weaknesses to be disclosed in the internal controls, it might adversely affect the reliability of our financial \nreporting. \n \n⑯ Epson is vulnerable to risks inherent in its tie-ups with other companies. \nOne of our business strategy options is to enter into business tie-ups with other companies. However, the parties may \nreview the arrangements of tie-ups, and there is a possibility that tie-ups could be dissolved or be subject to changes. \nThere is also no assurance that the business strategy of tie-ups will succeed or contribute to our operating results, etc. \nexactly as expected. \n \n⑰ Epson could be severely affected in the event of a natural disaster or an infectious disease, etc. \nWe have research and development, procurement, manufacturing, logistics, sales and service sites around the globe, \nand our operating results and future business development, etc. could be adversely affected by any number of \nunpredictable events, including but not limited to natural disasters, pandemics involving new infectious diseases such \nas COVID-19 infection, supply chain disruptions mainly caused by natural disasters on suppliers, and acts of \nterrorism or war. \nThe central region of Nagano Prefecture, home to some of our key plants and offices, is an area that is at \ncomparatively high risk of earthquakes due to the presence of an active fault zone along the Itoigawa-Shizuoka \ngeotectonic line. Accordingly, in addition to earthquake-proofing its equipment and facilities, Epson conducts disaster \ndrills, has prepared earthquake disaster management and response plans, and has established business continuity \nplans to mitigate the effects of disasters to the extent possible. \nHowever, if a major earthquake occurs in the central region of Nagano Prefecture, it is possible that, despite these \ncountermeasures, the effect on Epson could be extreme. Although Epson is insured against losses arising from \nearthquakes, the scope of indemnification is limited. \nIn addition, the spread of the COVID-19 infection will affect Epson. If stoppages or long delays in procurement, \nproduction, shipping, and logistics due to government imposed measures such as lockdowns and closures; weak \nconsumer spending; a drop in capital expenditure demand; delays in B2B business and tender opportunities; and \nother factors are prolonged or expanded, Epson’s financial position and operating results could be affected. \nUnder these circumstances, Epson gives the highest priority to safety and health of its employees and their family, \nand all stakeholders including customers and shareholders, and works to promptly advance measures to normalize \nproduction and sales operations to get out of these confusions as early as possible. Moreover, although adequate"

In response to these major changes to be faced by society, we will further \naccelerate our initiatives based on the long-range corporate vision Epson 25 Renewed and each business strategy, \nand proactively work on business opportunities by addressing anticipated social issues in a proactive manner as our \npolicy in order to minimize these risks. \n \n⑱ Epson faces risks concerning the information security \nThe scope of what Epson’s network of information systems are used for and frequency of use continue to grow, and \nthis network is becoming increasingly important. Also, in our global business activities, we handle the personal \ninformation of customers and confidential data of business partners. Security threats are increasing year on year and \nour operating results and future business development, etc. could be adversely affected by occurrences such as \ncomputer virus infections, leaks of customer data, failures of key internal systems, cyber-attacks, and reputational \ndamage through social media. \nWe are responding to this by carrying out information security training for all employees, as well as establishing a \ngrand design that specifies policies concerning cyber security measures, and we are implementing various measures \nunder this. We also plan to engage in initiatives such as establishing a global security incident response structure, \nplanning and implementing cyber security response measures, and strengthening product security."

Management analysis of financial position, operating results and cash flows \n(1) Operating results overview \n \n① Operating results \nGlobal growth, negative in the prior year, surged during the year under review as demand rebounded with the \nrelaxation of lockdowns in many countries. Even as the world economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 \npandemic, however, shortages of semiconductors and other components and disruptions of global supply chains due \nto logistics delays persist. The turmoil in global supply chains could both expand and persist due to China’s zero-\nCOVID policy (and lockdowns) and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The global economic recovery is expected to \ndecelerate, with many countries tightening their monetary policies in the face of expanding and persistent inflationary \npressures. \nThe average exchange rates of the yen against the U.S. dollar and of the yen against the euro during the year were \n¥112.37 and ¥130.55, respectively. This represents a 6% depreciation of the yen against the dollar and a 6% \ndepreciation of the yen against the euro compared to the prior period. The yen also weakened against the currencies \nof some emerging countries, in places such as China and Latin America. \n \nIn this business environment, operating results in the fiscal year under review are as follows. \n \n \n \n \n \n(Billions of yen) \n \nYear ended \nMarch 31, \n2021 \nYear ended \nMarch 31, \n2022 \nChange \nPercentage of \nchange \nMain reason(s) for change \nRevenue \n995.9 \n1,128.9 \n132.9 \n13.4% \n[Revenue] \nPrinting Solutions Segment \n88.7 \nVisual Communications Segment \n \n17.5 \nManufacturing-related and wearables\n \n26.5 \n[Business profit] \nPrinting Solutions Segment \n0.2 \nVisual Communications Segment \n \n 14.0 \nManufacturing-related and wearables\n \n17.7 \nCost of sales \n(643.5) \n(710.4) \n(66.8) \n– \nGross profit \n352.3 \n418.4 \n66.0 \n18.8% \nSelling, general \nand administrative \nexpenses \n(290.7) \n(328.8) \n(38.0) \n– \nBusiness profit * \n61.6 \n89.6 \n27.9 \n45.4% \nOther operating \nincome and Other \noperating expense \n(13.9) \n4.8 \n18.8 \n– \nIncreases in foreign exchange gains \nProfit from \noperating activities \n47.6 \n94.4 \n46.8 \n98.3% \n \nFinance income \nand Finance costs \n(2.8) \n2.5 \n5.3 \n– \nIncreases in foreign exchange gains \nProfit before tax \n44.9 \n97.1 \n52.2 \n116.2% \n \nIncome taxes \n(13.9) \n(4.8) \n9.0 \n– \nDecrease mainly due to an increase in \ndeferred tax assets \nProfit for the \nperiod \n30.9 \n92.3 \n61.3 \n197.8% \n \nProfit for the \nperiod attributable \nto owners of the \nparent company \n30.9 \n92.2 \n61.3 \n198.4% \n \n* Business profit is calculated after deducting cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses from \nrevenue. \n \nA breakdown of operating results in each reporting segment is provided below.

Consolidated financial statements, \netc., (1) Consolidated financial statements, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, 7. Segment Information.” \n \n \nPrinting Solutions Segment \nRevenue in the office and home printing business increased. High-capacity ink tank printer and ink cartridge printer \nsales sharply increased. Print demand from people working and learning from home has been settling down compared \nto last fiscal year but still carried over into the current fiscal year. Revenue also rose because we were able to grow \nunit sales of high-capacity ink tank printers in North America and elsewhere while also sustaining higher selling \nprices, though revenue was tempered somewhat by constrained product supply associated with logistics delays and \ncomponent shortages. Sales of consumables decreased compared to the prior period, when sales sharply increased on \nextra demand from those working and learning from home. \nRevenue in the commercial and industrial printing business sharply increased. Large-format inkjet printer revenue \nincreased owing largely to a rebound in demand in Europe and the Americas and to the launch of new products, \nthough the increase was modulated by product shortages and an economic slowdown in China, which resulted in a \ndeceleration of the signage market. Sales of consumables increased in Europe, the Americas, and China. Small printer \nsales were hit hard by component shortages, which limited our ability to supply products, but we increased sales by \nmeeting increased demand from the retail and food service industry in Europe, the Americas, and China. Printhead \nsales increased primarily on continued strong sales in China. \nSegment profit in the printing solutions segment was in line with the prior period despite a decrease in sales of ink \ncartridge printer consumables and soaring transport costs and component prices, which hurt profitability. The increase \nin segment profit was primarily the result of a combination of increased revenue from sales of high-capacity ink tank \nprinters, large-format inkjet printers, and small printers, pricing measures taken in response to the balance between \nsupply and demand, ongoing reductions of advertising and promotion costs and other fixed costs, and positive foreign \nexchange effects. \nAs a result of the foregoing factors, revenue in the printing solutions segment was ¥779.9 billion, up 12.8% compared \nto the prior period. Segment profit was ¥106.4 billion, up 0.2% compared to the prior period. \n \nVisual Communications Segment \nThe visual communications business was unable to fully meet the robust demand due to product shortages, yet \nrevenue grew primarily through pricing measures and an improved model mix. \nSegment profit in visual communications sharply increased primarily due to a combination of higher revenue, \ncontinued cost containment associated with business restructuring, and positive foreign exchange effects. \nAs a result of the foregoing factors, revenue in the visual communications segment was ¥159.0 billion, up 12.4% \ncompared to the prior period. Segment profit was ¥15.3 billion, up 1,038.4% compared to the prior period. \n \nManufacturing-Related & Wearables Segment \nRevenue in the manufacturing solutions business increased despite a loss of sales associated with the transfer of the \nIC test handler business. Revenue increased mainly due to an increase in sales to customers in China in the lithium-\nion battery manufacturing industry, a recovery in demand for automotive products in Europe, and the capture of \nmedical market demand in the Americas. \nRevenue in the wearable products business increased on strong sales of luxury products and on sales of watch \nmovements as demand recovered. \nRevenue in the microdevices business as a whole sharply increased. Crystal device revenue sharply increased on a \ncontinuing rise in demand for in-vehicle applications and a wider range of other applications. Meanwhile, \nsemiconductor sales also increased on robust demand. \nSegment profit in the manufacturing-related and wearables segment sharply increased owing to higher revenue and \ncost containment associated with business restructuring in the wearable products business. \nAs a result of the foregoing factors, revenue in the manufacturing-related and wearables segment was ¥191.9 billion, \nup 16.0% compared to the prior period. Segment profit was ¥23.0 billion, up 336.0% prior period. \n \nAdjustments \nAdjustments to the total profit of reporting segments amounted to negative ¥55.2 billion. (Adjustments in the previous \nfiscal year were negative ¥51.2 billion.) The main components of the adjustment were basic technology research and \ndevelopment expenses that do not correspond to the reporting segments and earnings and expenses associated with \nthings such as new businesses and corporate functions."

These statements may differ from actual results and are not guarantees of \nthe achievement. \n \n① Operating results, etc. \nFinancial position \nTotal assets at the end of the fiscal year were ¥1,266.4 billion, an increase of ¥105.1 billion from the previous fiscal \nyear end. This increase was mainly due to a ¥52.0 billion increase in inventories, a ¥31.2 billion increase in cash and \ncash equivalents, and a ¥10.9 billion increase in deferred tax assets. \nTotal liabilities were ¥600.6 billion, a decrease of ¥7.6 billion compared to the end of the last fiscal year. Although \ntrade and other payables increased by ¥12.0 billion, total liabilities decreased mainly due to a ¥22.7 billion decrease \nin bonds issued, borrowings and lease liabilities. \nThe equity attributable to owners of the parent company totaled ¥665.6 billion, a ¥114.7 billion increase compared \nto the previous fiscal year end. While Epson recorded ¥92.2 billion in profit for the period attributable to owners of \nthe parent company and recorded ¥43.9 billion in other comprehensive income, the primary component of which was \nexchange differences on translation of foreign operations, there were ¥21.4 billion in dividend payments. \nWorking capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was ¥502.4 billion, an increase of ¥68.3 billion \ncompared to the end of the previous fiscal year. \n \nOperating results \nThe operating results are provided in “(1) Operating results overview ① Operating results.” \n \nCash flow performance \nThe cash flow performance is provided in “(1) Operating results overview ② Cash flow performance.” \n \n② Capital resources and liquidity \nEpson plans to allocate ¥71.0 billion to capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, and the \nrequired funds will be covered by internal funds. \nThe amount of planned capital expenditures for each segment is as described in “III. Information About Facilities 3. \nPlans for new additions or disposals.” The above amount of planned capital expenditures includes capital \nexpenditures through leases. \nIn order to stably secure funds necessary for business activities such as capital expenditures, Epson raises funds \nthrough utilization of internal funds as well as borrowings from financial institutions and issuance of bonds. \nThe balance of interest-bearing debt at the end of the fiscal year under review was ¥243.1 billion, down ¥22.7 billion \ncompared to the previous fiscal year end, due to redemption of bonds. The balance of cash and cash equivalents at \nthe end of the fiscal year under review totaled ¥335.2 billion, up ¥31.2 billion compared to the end of the last fiscal \nyear, giving Epson sufficient liquidity. \nIn addition, amid an uncertain outlook due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company entered into a commitment \nline contract for an environmentally conscious financing product with a main partner bank in May 2020, as part of \nits efforts to strengthen the financial foundation in preparation for emergencies. There is no outstanding balance of \nexecuted borrowings based on the said commitment line contract as of March 31, 2022. \nEpson has earned a credit rating from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. The rating was A (single A) as at the \nend of the fiscal year under review. \n \n③ Management policy, corporate strategy, objective indices to assess the status of achievement of \nmanagement goals, etc. \nAs stated in “II. Overview of Business 1. Management policy, business environment and issues to be addressed, etc.,” \nEpson boldly undertakes challenges and strives to make innovations beyond its own conventions and vision in order \nto solve social issues, based on the Company’s unique strengths of efficient, compact, and precision technologies \nsince the time of its founding.

Research and development activities \n \nEpson seeks to co-create sustainability and enrich communities to connect people, things, and information by \nleveraging efficient, compact, and precision technologies that have been an Epson strength since its founding in \naddition to digital technologies. To this end, Epson places research and development activities as a part of \ninitiatives to strengthen the business infrastructure, and promotes the evolution of foundational technologies, core \ntechnologies and product technologies to realize innovation. Going forward, the corporate R&D division and the \nR&D units of the operations divisions are teaming up to strengthen materials, AI and digital technologies in \nparticular and strengthen the manufacturing foundation, primarily in growth areas and new areas. Together, they \nare laying a technological foundation to create new businesses, strengthen existing ones, and increase the \ncompetitiveness of all Epson products. Epson considers co-creation is an important factor in technology \ndevelopment. We are pursuing “front-loading of development,” with knowledgeable people from all functions \nparticipating from the start of development (the trial-and-error stage) and verifying quality at each subsequent \nstage. By front-loading development to speed up the problem-solving cycle and increase the quality of \ndevelopment, we will speed up productization and commercialization. \nTotal R&D spending during the fiscal year was ¥46.0 billion. The printing solutions segment accounted for ¥18.3 \nbillion, the visual communications segment for ¥5.5 billion, and the manufacturing-related and wearables segment \nfor ¥5.9 billion. The “other” segment and corporate segment accounted for the remaining ¥16.1 billion. \nThe main R&D accomplishments in each segment are described below. \n \nPrinting solutions segment \nIn commercial and industrial printing, Epson launched in its SureColor Series, two large ink-jet printers as the first \nsix-color models suitable for poster printing. The SC-T7750D model supports B0+ paper and comes with a vivid \nred ink suitable for POP applications. The SC-P8550D model supports B0+ paper and comes with a gray ink \nsuitable for high-grade posters that value tonality of colors such as in human skin. Loaded with a PS unit1 with a \nnew engine as a standard feature, the models enable fast, accurate printing of PDF files with special processing, \nsuch as a clear, special color layer and over-printing processing. Both of these printers have a thin box shape and \na depth of 500 mm, achieving a reduction of roughly 25%2 in installation space from the conventional model. \nEpson launched the ML-64000 for textile printing as a new product in the Mona Lisa series of inkjet digital textile \nprinters. In the apparel and fashion industries, initiatives toward sustainable fashion that take into account \nenvironmental impacts are rapidly expanding. Also in the textile printing market, the shift to digital textile printing \nis progressing to achieve production processes that reduce environmental impacts and contribute to reducing \nprocessing burden in an effort to realize a sustainable society. The ML-64000 model is equipped with 64 of the \nlatest PrecisionCore printheads and realizes high productivity with a fast printing speed of 774 m2 per hour \n(600×600 dpi – 2Pass) while using the standard mode. Epson’s Dynamic Alignment Stabilizer (DAS) technology \nensures stable print quality by controlling waveforms on each printhead chip for higher dot placement accuracy \nand more uniform dot density on each pass. \nEpson launched T3200 printheads for signage applications, easily allowing printers to deliver high print quality at \na fast speed. T3200 enables simultaneous, high-quality four-color CMYK printing at high speed from a single \nprinthead. Furthermore, incorporating a heater in the printhead makes printing possible even with highly viscous \nUV ink, and thus can provide an optimal digital printing environment especially for printing signage and product \npackages. \nEpson also launched the SD-10 spectrophotometer as a product to help solve issues in color matching in a wide \nrange of design-related operations. The product uses nine light sources lined in a ring-shaped manner and measures \ncolor quickly and accurately. The time needed for color matching could be reduced since the product does not \ncatch the unevenness of the media surface and produces accurate figures at once. Conventionally, the task of \naccurately matching colors was dependent on the experience and sensory perception of specified operators in many \ncases. The use of spectrophotometer enables even persons without special knowledge to measure and match colors \nbased on numerical output, and this helps to standardize operations. \n1 Compatible with Adobe® PostScript®. Can be used with both a PS unit and SSD. If only the PS unit is \napplied, reprinting is not available. \n2 In comparison with SC-P8050."

      "text": "51 \nVisual communications segment \nEpson launched eight models of six laser business projectors that realize high-contrast visual projection. These \nmodels enable bright, sharp large-screen projections that provide excellent visuals even when seen from the back \nof a spacious room such as a medium or large conference room of a company or a school auditorium. The standard \nmodels are equipped with a function to shift the lens up-down (50%) and right-left (20%), offering greater freedom \nin the place of installation. The high-brightness models realize a screen resolution of a 4K level based on our 4K \nEnhancement Technology that shifts each pixel diagonally by 0.5 pixels, providing high-definition, high-resolution \nimages suitable for large spaces. \nEpson also released two new products in the dreamio series of 3LCD home projectors: EH-LS12000 and EH-\nTW5825. The EH-LS12000 model delivers 2,700 lm of brightness and high-contrast laser images, enabling users \nto enjoy super-sharp 4K3 big-screen images. In addition, we newly installed an automatic contrast enhancement \nfeature that automatically adjusts the contrast and makes a certain part of the image sharp and explicit, as well as \na scene-based gamma adjustment feature that optimizes the tone projection by scene to deliver explicit images. \nThe EH-TW5825 model delivers 2,700 lm of brightness, enabling full HD image projection and targets users who \nenjoy video distribution services, etc. on large screens. \n3 Screen resolution that adopts dual-axis shift technology \n \nManufacturing-related and wearables segment \nIn the manufacturing solutions business, Epson developed a new industrial 3D printer that can use commonly \navailable materials. The printer employs a unique material extrusion method that is achieved using a flat screw4 \nlike that found in Epson’s compact injection molding machines. This extrusion method enables the printer to be \nused with a variety of common third-party materials, such as resin or metal pellets, which are generally available \nat lower cost than other materials, environmentally considerate biomass pellets, and PEEK materials, which can \nprovide high heat resistance. In addition, the amount of material injected is precisely controlled by regulating the \npressure within the head and by regulating the action of a valve in concert with the modeling speed. The \ntemperature at the surface of a piece being printed is also controlled to obtain the required strength. Epson employs \na unique mechanism to precisely control this temperature and achieve both strength and accuracy. This 3D printer \nis thus engineered to manufacture strong, accurate objects with commonly available materials, facilitating printer \nuse in the production of industrial parts for final products. It contributes to promoting mass customization, as it \ncan produce small batches of parts tailored to customers’ needs with high quality, shorter lead times, and at lower \ncosts. \nIn the microdevices business, Epson developed M-G370PDS0, an inertial measurement unit (IMU)5 equipped with \na high-performance 6-axis sensor. In recent years, IMU use has expanded into fields such as surveying and aerial \nand underwater video photography by unmanned systems, creating a growing need for more accurate position and \nattitude control. Accordingly, demand is rising for IMUs that offer greater precision, which is crucial in attitude \ncontrol, and especially noise performance. The M-G370PDS0 can more accurately detect very slight changes in \nthe attitude of equipment and systems, since they do not get lost in sensor noise. Furthermore, the small size, light \nweight and lower power consumption of this IMU will also help customers make their own products smaller and \nlighter. \n4 An inline screw with a flattened configuration. \n5 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is a device that is used for sensing inertial motion. It is comprised of \ntriaxial angular rate sensors and triaxial accelerometers."

The Plan is intended to heighten \ndirectors’ sense of shared interest with shareholders and to show a commitment to sustaining growth and increasing \ncorporate value over the mid- to long-term. The Company resolved at the meeting of its Board of Directors held \non May 16, 2019 to continue the Plan with three years from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 to the fiscal year \nended March 31, 2022 as the period covered by the Plan.  \nThe Company introduced a restricted stock compensation plan in place of the Plan at the 80th Ordinary General \nMeeting of Shareholders held on June 28, 2022. Accordingly, no additional contribution shall be made under the \nPlan, and the Plan shall be terminated as soon as we complete issuing ordinary shares of the Company \ncorresponding to the points awarded and deliver cash equivalent to the amounts obtained through converting such \nshares into cash. \n \n1. Summary of the Plan \nThe Plan has employed a framework referred to as the officer compensation BIP (Board Incentive Plan) trust \n(hereinafter referred to as the “BIP trust”) and is designed to deliver a variable number of shares to Eligible Officers \nbased on the levels of achievements of mid- to long-term operating performance targets for the Company’s \nbusiness profit, ROS, ROE, etc., and other factors. The BIP trust is, like the U.S. Performance Share and Restricted \nStock systems, a stock compensation plan for officers under which the Company’s shares and cash equivalent to \nthe amounts obtained through the conversion of such shares into cash are delivered and paid based on position, the \nlevels of achievement of operating performance targets and other factors."

Such points fluctuate depending \non the levels of achievement of the mid- to long-term operating performance targets of the Company. \nFurthermore, the Company’s shares, which correspond to a certain proportion of such points, will be delivered \nto the Eligible Officers, in principle, after the lapse of three years following the awarding of points. As regards \nthe Company’s shares corresponding to the remaining portion of points, the Eligible Officers will receive cash \nequivalent to the amounts obtained through the conversion of such shares into cash within the Trust as prescribed \nin the trust agreement. \n7) If residual shares remain in the Trust at the expiry of the trust period in the event that operating performance \ntargets are not met during the trust period, the Company may continue to use the Trust by amending the trust \nagreement and making additional contribution. Otherwise, the Company will acquire such residual shares, \nthrough gratis transfer, and retire them by resolution of the Board of Directors. \n8) Upon the termination of the Trust, residual assets remaining after allocation to beneficiaries are to be attributed \nto the Company within the scope of trust expense reserve after subtracting funds for acquiring shares from the \ntrust money.

Dividend policy \n \nThe Company strives to sustain business growth through the creation of customer value and to generate stable cash \nflow by improving profitability and using management resources efficiently. While the top priority is on strategic \ninvestment in growth, the Company also actively returns profits in parallel with its efforts to build a robust financial \nstructure that is capable of withstanding changes in the business environment. \nIn line with this policy, the Company has set a consolidated dividend payout ratio in the range of 40% as a medium-\nterm target, the ratio based on profit after an amount equivalent to the statutory effective tax rate is deducted from \nbusiness profit, a profit category that shows profit from the Company’s main operations (and which is very similar \nto operating income under Japanese accounting standards, both conceptually and numerically). The Company \nintends to be more active in giving back to shareholders by agilely purchasing treasury shares as warranted by \nshare price, the capital situation, and other factors. \n \nThe Company’s dividend policy is to pay cash dividends twice a year. The year-end dividend is determined by \nresolution of the general shareholders’ meeting and the interim dividend is determined at a meeting of the board \nof directors. \n \nBased on its dividend policy and the perspective of stable dividend, the Company has paid an annual dividend of \n¥62 per share. \n \nThe Company’s Articles of Incorporation allow the Company to issue an interim dividend with a record date of \nSeptember 30 every year by resolution of the board of directors. \n \nThe Company’s distribution of retained earnings for the fiscal year under review is as follows. \n \nDistribution of retained earnings for the fiscal year under review \n \nDate approved \nCash dividends \n(Millions of yen) \nCash dividend per share \n(Yen) \nOctober 29, 2021, by resolution \nof the board of directors \n10,731 \n31 \nJune 28, 2022, by resolution of \nthe general shareholders’ meeting \n10,731 \n31 \n(Notes) \n1.

Corporate governance \n(1) Overview of corporate governance \n① Basic corporate governance principles \nThe general principles of corporate governance at the Company are as follows: \n▪ Respect the rights of shareholders, and ensure equality. \n▪ Bear in mind the interests of, and cooperate with, stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, local \ncommunities, business partners, and Epson personnel. \n▪ Appropriately disclose company information and maintain transparency. \n▪ Directors, Executive Officers, and Special Audit & Supervisory Officers shall be aware of their fiduciary duties \nand shall fulfill the roles and responsibilities expected of them. \n▪ Engage in constructive dialogue with shareholders. \nTo achieve the goals declared in the Management Philosophy, promote sustainable growth, and increase corporate \nvalue over the medium and long term, the Company strives to continuously enhance and strengthen corporate \ngovernance so as to realize transparent, fair, fast, and decisive decision-making. \nUnder a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee, to further increase the effectiveness of corporate \ngovernance, the Company further improves the supervisory function of the Board of Directors, further enhances \ndeliberation and speeds up management decision-making. \n \n② Overview of and reasons for adopting the current system of corporate governance \nThe Company is structured as a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee. It has a Board of Directors, an \nAudit & Supervisory Committee, and a financial auditor. It has also voluntarily established advisory committees \nfor matters such as the Director nomination and compensation. \nThis governance system was adopted to further increase the effectiveness of corporate governance by \nstrengthening supervision over management and by enabling the Board of Directors to devote more time to \ndiscussions while speeding up decision-making by management. \nThe main corporate management bodies and their aims are described below: \n \nBoard of Directors \nThe Board of Directors, with a mandate from shareholders, is responsible for realizing efficient and effective \ncorporate governance, through which the Company will accomplish its social mission, sustain growth, and \nmaximize corporate value over the medium and long term. To fulfill these responsibilities, the Board of Directors \nwill exercise a supervisory function over general management affairs, maintain management fairness and \ntransparency, and make important business decisions, including decisions on things such as management plans, \nbusiness plans, and investments exceeding a certain amount. \nThe Board of Directors is composed of 10 Directors, including five Outside Directors described in “(2) Officers.” \nMeetings of the Board of Directors are, as a rule, held once per month and as needed. In FY2021, the Company \nheld a total of 13 meetings of the Board of Directors with 87.5% attendance by Director Shigemoto1 and 100% by \nall the other Directors. Chairman of the Board, who is a non-executive director, acts as the chairman of the Board \nmeetings. \nThe Board of Directors makes decisions on basic business policies, important business affairs, and other matters \nthat the Board of Directors is responsible for deciding as provided for in internal regulations. Business affairs that \nthe Board of Directors is not responsible for deciding are delegated to executive management, and the Board \nmonitors these. To speed up management decisions and increase business agility as a company with an Audit & \nSupervisory Committee, the Company has expanded the scope of affairs delegated to executive management from \nthe Board of Directors, including capital investments below a certain threshold; and has limited board deliberations \nonly to the most important issues, including governance, capital policy, compliance, risk management and \nmegatrend and medium- to long-term strategies. Corporate Governance Policy states that at least one-third of the \nboard members should be outside directors. \n1 \nMr. Shigemoto retired from the position of Director and Executive Officer on January 31, 2022 by resignation."

Therefore, the \ndecision as to whether to accept a takeover offer that would allow another party to acquire a controlling share of \nthe Company and thus gain power over the Company’s financial and business decisions (hereinafter referred to as \n“large-scale acquisitions”) should ultimately be put before the shareholders. \nHowever, shareholders’ decisions on whether to allow large-scale acquisitions need to be made appropriately. In \norder to ensure this, the Company believes that information and opinions necessary for shareholders should be \nprovided by both persons seeking to do large-scale acquisitions of the Company’s shares and the Board of Directors \nof the Company, and time necessary to examine the information and opinions needs to be secured. \nThe Company believes that persons who control its financial and business policy decisions need to fully understand \nthe Company’s businesses and sources of corporate value, and to understand the importance of the Company’s \ndirectors, managers, and employees working as a team to create value, pursuing the Company’s tradition of \ncreativity and challenge, and earning and keeping the trust of its customers. \n \n2) Summary of measures in support of the basic policy \na.

In relation to the \nstructure of the Audit & Supervisory Committee Office and the coordination system with internal audit \ndepartments, if circumstances hindering the effectiveness of the audit by the Audit & Supervisory Committee are \nfound, the Audit & Supervisory Committee requests the representative directors or the Board of Directors to rectify \nthem. Furthermore, prior consent from the Audit & Supervisory Committee should be obtained for the appointment \nand dismissal of the head of the internal audit control departments. As part of a structure that can continuously \npursue the maintenance and improvement of efforts to strengthen coordination between the Audit & Supervisory \nCommittee and internal audit departments, etc., we have put in place a structure in which the head of the internal \naudit control departments can attend, as an observer, meetings of a Compliance Committee, which is made up of \nOutside Directors and a Director who is a member of the Audit & Supervisory Committee. \nThe Company’s internal audit departments regularly report their audit plans, audit results and improvement plans \nfor audited companies based on the audit findings to the Audit & Supervisory Committee. In response, the Audit \n& Supervisory Committee can, when it deems necessary, ask internal audit departments to investigate affairs or \ncan provide specific instructions regarding the performance of their duties. Through these measures, Epson has \nsecured the effectiveness of systematic audit performed by the Audit & Supervisory Committee. \nInternal audit departments are seen as a keystone for internal control functions built by the President and operations \ndepartments. On the other hand, to ensure the effectiveness and independence of audits by the Audit & Supervisory \nCommittee and internal audit departments, if the instructions issued to internal audit departments by the Audit & \nSupervisory Committee and the President are in conflict, the instructions issued by the Audit & Supervisory \nCommittee are given priority. \nThe division in charge of whistleblowing regularly keeps the Audit & Supervisory Committee updated on \ncompliance violation matters. The division provides the Committee with detailed reports especially on matters of \nmaterial importance immediately after it is notified of such matters, and the Committee examines whether it should \ndeal with the matter based on the detailed report. Also, controls are in place to protect whistleblowers from reprisal \nfor having made a report. Allegations shall be reported to the Board of Directors, the Audit & Supervisory \nCommittee, the Compliance Committee composed primarily of Outside Directors, and the Corporate Strategy \nCouncil in a way that whistleblowers cannot be identified; and the identity of the reporter shall be protected even \nif the president or a Board of Directors, for example, is asked to correct the matter based on the report. \nThe Audit & Supervisory Committee and financial auditors work together to enhance the effectiveness of audit by \nsharing the results of their risk assessment at the beginning of each fiscal year and then confirm the audit plan of \nfinancial auditors, and also periodically discuss issues during the period. Financial auditors have the right to \nobserve meetings of the Compliance Committee, which is made up of Outside Directors and a Director who is a \nmember of the Audit & Supervisory Committee."

Through these measures, the Company \nhas secured the effectiveness of systematic audit performed by the Audit & Supervisory Committee. \nAs for appropriateness of audits of the financial auditor, the Audit & Supervisory Committee confirms the audit \nplan of the financial auditor after risk assessment is shared between each other at the beginning of the fiscal year, \nand checks the implementation of audits by regularly holding discussion during the fiscal year, while increasing \neffectiveness of audits of the both. In addition, the Audit & Supervisory Committee assesses multiple audit firms \nthat have overseas network, including the current financial auditor, based on a wide variety of items such as audit \nquality, governance system, and global audit system. \nWith regard to the effectiveness assessment of the Audit & Supervisory Committee, which has been implemented \neach year since FY2017 after the transition to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee, reporting to \nand sharing with the Board of Directors have been regularized from FY2019.

As part of a structure that can continuously \npursue the maintenance and improvement of efforts to strengthen coordination between the Audit & Supervisory \nCommittee and internal audit departments, etc., we have put in place a structure in which the head of the internal \naudit control departments can attend, as an observer, meetings of a Compliance Committee, which is made up of \nOutside Directors and a Director who is a member of the Audit & Supervisory Committee. \nThe Company’s internal audit departments regularly report their audit plans, audit results and improvement plans \nfor audited companies based on the audit findings to the Audit & Supervisory Committee.

Through these measures, the Company \nhas secured the effectiveness of systematic audit performed by the Audit & Supervisory Committee. \nInternal audit departments are seen as a keystone for internal control functions built by the President and operations \ndepartments. On the other hand, to ensure the effectiveness and independence of audits by the Audit & Supervisory \nCommittee and internal audit departments, if the instructions issued to internal audit departments by the Audit & \nSupervisory Committee and the President are in conflict, the instructions issued by the Audit & Supervisory \nCommittee are given priority. \nThe division in charge of whistleblowing regularly keeps the Audit & Supervisory Committee updated on \ncompliance violation matters. The division provides the Committee with detailed reports especially on matters of \nmaterial importance immediately after it is notified of such matters, and the Committee examines whether it should \ndeal with the matter based on the detailed report. Also, controls are in place to protect whistleblowers from reprisal \nfor having made a report. Allegations shall be reported to the Board of Directors, the Audit & Supervisory \nCommittee, the Compliance Committee composed primarily of Outside Directors, and the Corporate Strategy \nCouncil in a way that whistleblowers cannot be identified; and the identity of the reporter shall be protected even \nif the president or a Board of Directors, for example, is asked to correct the matter based on the report. \nThe Audit & Supervisory Committee and financial auditors enhance the effectiveness of audits by sharing the \nresults of their risk assessment at the beginning of each fiscal year and then confirming the audit plan of financial \nauditors, and also periodically discuss issues during the period. Financial auditors have the right to observe \nmeetings of the Compliance Committee, which is made up of Outside Directors and a Director who is a member \nof the Audit & Supervisory Committee."

Under this plan, the Company contributes money up to 500 million yen in \ntotal for each target period, which covers a period of three consecutive fiscal years, to the trust as \ncompensation for officers eligible for this plan. During each target period, the said trust uses the entrusted \nmoney to acquire up to 300,000 shares (in the event of a share split, share consolidation, etc., the said \nmaximum number of shares will fluctuate in proportionate to the ratio of split or consolidation) of the \nCompany’s ordinary shares from the stock market or the Company (disposal of treasury shares). Every July \nduring the trust period, basic points are granted based on positions and other factors.

In principle, after the \nelapse of three years from the date of grant of basic points, approximately 50% of the Company’s ordinary \nshares equivalent to the number of points after multiplying the performance-based coefficient determined \nbased on the achievement level of the Company’s medium-term performance targets, which include \nbusiness profit, ROS, and ROE, are delivered from the trust, and the remainder is paid as money equivalent \nto the cash value of the Company’s ordinary shares for the purpose of appropriating it as funds to pay \nwithholding taxes and other taxes. \nThe plan is designed such that the ratio of stock compensation to base compensation ranges between 10% \nand 22% depending on position, while the number of shares issued depends on the achievement level of \nfinancial indicators during a target period (three years). Under the stock compensation plan, mechanisms \n(malus and clawback clauses) have been established with which the Company may cause officers to forfeit \nthe right to receive delivery of shares and demand a refund of the amount equivalent to the shares already \ndelivered by the Company in the event of violations of laws and regulations, internal regulations, etc. by \nofficers."

To ensure that the said authority is exercised appropriately, Outside \nDirectors account for the majority of members of the Director Compensation Committee and the \nchairperson of the Committee is selected among the Outside Directors by the members. \n \n(vii) Other important matters regarding decisions on the details of compensation for individual Directors who \nare not Audit & Supervisory Committee members \nThe Company establishes provisions (malus and clawback clauses) to acquire without contribution some or \nall of the allotted shares to eligible Directors or ordinary shares of the Company for which transfer \nrestrictions have been lifted, or to be paid an amount equivalent to the value of the allotted shares or ordinary \nshares of the Company for which transfer restrictions have been lifted. This applies in cases where the \nCompany’s Board of Directors recognizes that eligible Directors have violated laws, regulations, or internal \nrules, etc. in any material aspect and when certain circumstances determined by the Board of Directors have \noccurred, including serious accounting irregularities or large losses. \n \n<Reasons why the Board of Directors has determined that the details of compensation for individual Directors \nwho are not Audit & Supervisory Committee members for the fiscal year under review comply with the said \ndecision-making policies> \nThe Board of Directors has confirmed the following points and determined that the compensation for Directors \nwho are not Audit & Supervisory Committee members for the fiscal year under review complies with the said \npolicies. \n- A fair, transparent, and rigorous reporting by the Director Compensation Committee, which is chaired by an \nOutside Director, and the majority of whose members are Outside Directors has been conducted. \n- The Audit & Supervisory Committee shared and discussed the details that were discussed by the Director \nCompensation Committee and reported that there were no items to be stated at the General Meeting of \nShareholders. \n \n2) Decision-making policies, etc. on compensation for individual Directors who are Audit & Supervisory \nCommittee members \nThe Company has established its decision-making policies on compensation for individual Directors who are \nAudit & Supervisory Committee members. \n \n<Method of determining the decision-making policies> \nDecision-making policies are determined by the Audit & Supervisory Committee."

In \naddition, basic stance for such fixed compensation is as stated in “Compensation for non-executive officers,” \nand it is determined by the Board of Directors upon deliberation of its contents at the Director Compensation \nCommittee, which is chaired by an Outside Director, and the majority of whose members are Outside Directors. \n \n3) Resolutions by the General Meeting of Shareholders on compensation for Directors \nBase compensation \nUpon the resolution at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of June 28, 2016, the maximum base \ncompensation was set at 62 million yen per month for Directors who are not Audit & Supervisory Committee \nmembers (including 10 million yen per month for Outside Directors). At the conclusion of the said Ordinary \nGeneral Meeting of Shareholders, the number of Directors who are not Audit & Supervisory Committee \nmembers was eight (including two Outside Directors). \nIn addition, upon the resolution at the said Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders, the maximum base \ncompensation was set at 20 million yen per month for Directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee \nmembers.

At the conclusion of the said Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders, the number \nof Directors who are not Audit & Supervisory Committee members was three. \n \nPerformance-linked stock compensation (officer compensation BIP trust) \nUpon the resolution at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of June 28, 2016, the maximum amount \nof performance-linked stock compensation for Directors who are not Audit & Supervisory Committee members \n(excluding those who are independent from business execution, such as Outside Directors, as well as those \nresiding overseas) was set at 500 million yen in total over a period of three fiscal years, with the maximum \nnumber of total points to be granted per year set at 100,000 points (one point is equivalent to one share in the \nCompany). Upon the resolution at the Board of Directors meeting held on May 16, 2019, these standards have \nbeen continued. At the conclusion of the said Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders, the number of \nDirectors who are not Audit & Supervisory Committee members was six. The officer compensation BIP trust \nwill no longer make additional contributions, and we plan to terminate the plan as soon as we complete issuing \nordinary shares of the Company corresponding to the points awarded and delivering cash equivalent to the \namounts obtained through converting such shares into cash."

      "text": "112 \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n1. Reporting Entity \n \nSeiko Epson Corporation (the “Company”) is a stock corporation domiciled in Japan. The addresses of the \nCompany’s registered head office and principal business offices are available on the Company’s website \n(global.epson.com). The details of businesses and principal business activities of the Company and its affiliates \n(“Epson”) are stated in “7. Segment Information.” \n \n \n2. Basis of Preparation \n \n(1) Compliance with IFRS \nEpson’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting \nStandards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board which are applied based on the \nprovision of Article 93 of Ordinance on Terminology, Forms and Preparation Methods of Consolidated Financial \nStatements, as Epson meets the criteria of a “Specified Companies applying Designated IFRS” defined under Article \n1-2 of Ordinance on Terminology, Forms and Preparation Methods of Consolidated Financial Statements. \n \n(2) Basis of Measurement \nExcept for the financial instruments stated in “3. Significant Accounting Policies,” Epson’s consolidated financial \nstatements are prepared on the cost basis. \n \n(3) Functional Currency and Presentation Currency \nEpson’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Japanese yen (“yen” or “¥”), which is the functional \ncurrency of the Company. The units are in millions of yen unless otherwise noted, and figures less than one million \nyen are rounded down. \nThe translations of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for the convenience of readers \noutside Japan and have been made at the rate of ¥122.290 to U.S. $1 at the end of the reporting period. \n \n(4) Reporting Period of Subsidiaries \nThe fiscal year end date of certain overseas subsidiaries is December 31, and the subsidiaries prepare, for \nconsolidation purposes, additional financial information as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. \n \n \n3. Significant Accounting Policies \n \n(1) Basis of Consolidation \nConsolidated financial statements of Epson include financial statements of the Company and subsidiaries, and \ninterests in investments in associates and joint ventures. \n \n(A) Subsidiaries \nA subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by Epson. Epson controls the entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to \nvariable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over \nthe entity. The acquisition date of a subsidiary is the date on which Epson obtains control of the subsidiary, and the \nsubsidiary is included in the consolidation from the date of acquisition until the date on which Epson loses control. \nAll intergroup balances, transactions, unrealised profit or loss arising from intergroup transaction are eliminated on \nconsolidation. Comprehensive income for subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the parent company and to the \nnon-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. \n \n(B) Associates \nAn associate is an entity over which Epson has significant influence that is the power to participate in the financial \nand operating policy decisions of the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method \nfrom the date on which Epson has the significant influence until the date on which it ceases to have the significant \ninfluence. \n \n(C) Joint Ventures \nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby Epson and the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement"

The joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an \narrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities, that significantly affect the returns of \nthe arrangement, require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Epson accounts for that investment \nusing the equity method. \n \n(2) Business Combinations \nEach business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a \nbusiness combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of \nthe assets transferred by Epson, the liabilities incurred by Epson to former owners of the acquiree and the equity \ninterests issued by Epson. Goodwill is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, as the excess \nof the transferred consideration over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and \nthe liabilities assumed. If the difference is a negative monetary value, the resulting gain is immediately recognised \nas profit. Acquisition-related costs incurred are recognised as expenses except for the costs to issue debt or equity \nsecurities. \n \n(3) Foreign Currency Translation \nConsolidated financial statements of Epson are presented in Japanese yen, which is the functional currency of the \nCompany. Each company in Epson determines its functional currency and measures its results and financial position \nin that currency. \nA foreign currency transaction is translated into the functional currency at a spot exchange rate at the date of the \ntransaction or a rate that approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary items \nare translated using the closing rate. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on \ntranslating monetary items are recognised in profit or loss. However, exchange differences arising on financial \ninstruments designated as hedging instruments for net investments in foreign operations, financial assets measured \nat fair value through other comprehensive income, and cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive \nincome. \nAssets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen at the closing date, while income and \nexpenses of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or a \nrate that approximates the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. All resulting exchange differences are \nrecognised in other comprehensive income. On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the \nexchange differences relating to that foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss in the period of disposition. \n \n(4) Financial Instruments \n \n(A) Financial Assets \n \n(i) Initial Recognition and Measurement \nEpson measures financial assets at their fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the \nacquisition of the financial assets at initial recognition. However, in the measurement after initial recognition \n(subsequent measurement), the transaction costs of financial assets classified as subsequently measured at fair value \nthrough profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss. \nFinancial assets are initially recognised on the trade date when Epson becomes party to the contractual provisions \nof the financial instrument. \n \n(ii) Classification and Subsequent Measurement \nAt initial recognition, Epson classifies financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss. \n \n(a) Financial assets are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions \nare met: \n1) the financial assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to \ncollect contractual cash flows and \n2) the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments \nof principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. \n \n(b) Financial assets are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income \nif both of the following conditions are met:  \n1) the financial assets are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual \ncash flows and selling financial assets and"

The cumulative gain or loss previously \nrecognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to retained earnings when the financial assets are \nderecognised or the decline in their fair values is significant. Dividends on the financial assets are recognised in \nprofit or loss for each fiscal year. \n \n(iii) Derecognition \nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from them expire or when \nsubstantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of them are transferred. \n \n(iv) Impairment \nFor impairment of financial assets, loss allowance for expected credit losses are recognised. \nAt each reporting date, Epson assesses whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly \nsince initial recognition. \nIf the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the loss allowance \nfor that financial instrument is measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses. Meanwhile, if the \ncredit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the loss allowance for that \nfinancial asset is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. However, the loss allowance \nfor trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables are measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected \ncredit losses. \nExpected credit losses of a financial instrument are measured in a way that reflects: \n(a) an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes; \n(b) the time value of money; and \n(c) reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date \nabout past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. \nWhen impairment is recognised, the carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced through an allowance account \nfor credit losses and the amount of expected credit losses is recognised as impairment loss in profit or loss. If the \namount of the impairment loss decreases due to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the \npreviously recognised impairment loss is reversed in profit or loss through an allowance account for credit losses. \n \n(B) Financial Liabilities \n \n(i) Initial Recognition and Measurement \nFinancial liabilities are measured at fair value at initial recognition. However, financial liabilities measured \nsubsequently at amortised cost are measured at their fair value less transaction costs that are directly attributable to \nthe issuance of the financial liabilities. \nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date when Epson becomes party to the contractual \nprovisions of the financial instrument. \n \n(ii) Classification and Subsequent Measurement \nFinancial liabilities are classified into financial liabilities measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss \nand financial liabilities measured at amortised cost at initial recognition. \nAfter initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured based on the classification as follows: \n \n(a) Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss \nThe financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and include \nfinancial liabilities designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition. \n \n(b) Financial Liabilities Measured at Amortised Cost \nThe financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest \nmethod."

These derivatives are initially measured at fair value when the contract is \nentered into, and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. \nA gain or loss on a derivative is recognised in profit or loss. However, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging \ninstruments that is determined to be an effective hedge of cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign \noperations are recognised in other comprehensive income. \n \n(E) Hedge Accounting \nAt the inception of a hedge, Epson formally designates and documents the hedging relationship to which hedge \naccounting is applied and the objectives and strategies of risk management for undertaking the hedge. The \ndocumentation includes identification of hedging instruments, the hedged items or transactions, the nature of the \nrisks being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness is assessed in offsetting the exposure to changes \nin the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risks. Even though these hedges are expected \nto be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows, they are assessed on an ongoing basis and \ndetermined actually to have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedges \nwere designated. \nEpson classifies hedging relationships that meet the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting in the following \ncategories and applies hedge accounting to the hedging relationships. \n \n(i) Fair Value Hedge \nA gain or loss on a derivative is recognised in profit or loss. The hedging gain or loss on the hedged items \nattributable to the hedged risks adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognised in profit or loss. \n \n(ii) Cash Flow Hedge \nThe portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised \nin other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The \namounts of hedging instruments recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss when \nthe transactions of the hedged items affect profit or loss. In cases where hedged items result in the recognition of \nnon-financial assets or liabilities, the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are accounted for as \nadjustments to the initial carrying amount of non-financial assets or liabilities. \nWhen forecast transactions or firm commitments are no longer expected to occur, any related cumulative gains or \nlosses that have been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. When hedging \ninstruments expire, are sold, terminated or exercised without the replacement or rollover of other hedging \ninstruments, or when the hedge designation is revoked, amounts that have been recognised in other comprehensive \nincome continue to be recognised in equity until the forecast transactions or firm commitments occur. \n \n(iii) Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation \nHedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. The portion of \nthe gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in other \ncomprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. On the disposal of the foreign \noperation, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge that \nhas been recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss. \n \n(F) Fair Value of Financial Instruments \nFair value of financial instruments that are traded in an active market as of the end of the fiscal year refers to quoted \nmarket prices or dealer quotations. \nIf there is no active market, fair value of financial instruments is determined using appropriate valuation models. \n \n(5) Cash and Cash Equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term, highly liquid investments that \nare readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value"

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of \nbusiness less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. \n \n(7) Property, Plant and Equipment \nThe cost of property, plant and equipment includes any costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and \ndismantlement, removal and restoration costs, as well as borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. \nAfter recognition as an asset, property, plant and equipment is measured by using the cost model and is carried at its \ncost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. \nExcept for asset that is not subject to depreciation such as land, asset is depreciated using the straight-line method \nover its estimated useful life. The estimated useful life of major asset is as follows: \n• Buildings and structures: 10 to 35 years \n• Machinery and vehicles: 2 to 17 years \nThe estimated useful life, depreciation method and residual value are reviewed at each fiscal year end and, if \nexpectations differ from previous estimates, the effect of changes in accounting estimates is recognised prospectively. \n \n(8) Intangible Assets \n \n(A) Goodwill \nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is measured at the amount recognised at the acquisition date less any \naccumulated impairment losses. \nGoodwill is not amortised and allocated to a cash-generating unit that is identified according to business. The cash-\ngenerating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an \nindication that the unit may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss and not reversed in a \nsubsequent period. \n \n(B) Intangible Assets \nThe cost of a separately acquired intangible asset is measured initially at cost, and the cost of intangible asset acquired \nin a business combination is its fair value at the acquisition date. The cost of internally generated intangible asset is \nthe sum of expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria. \nAfter initial recognition, an intangible asset is measured by using the cost model and is carried at its cost less any \naccumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. \nAn intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortised using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. \nThe estimated useful life of major intangible asset with a finite useful life is as follows: \n• Software: 3 to 10 years \nThe estimated useful life and amortisation method of an asset are reviewed at each fiscal year end and, if expectations \ndiffer from previous estimates, the effect of changes in accounting estimates is recognised prospectively. \nAn intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet available for use is not amortised and \ntested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. \n \n(9) Leases \nAt inception of a contract, Epson assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the \nright to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration, and recognises lease \nliabilities and right-of-use assets at the commencement date. \nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, \ndiscounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s \nincremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets are measured at the amount of the initial measurement of lease \nliabilities adjusted for any initial direct costs, the prepaid lease payments, restoration costs and other costs. Right-of-\nuse assets are usually depreciated using the straight-line method over the lease term. Interest expenses on lease \nliabilities are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income separately from the depreciation \nexpenses for right-of-use assets. Epson presents right-of-use assets as “Property, plant and equipment” in the \nconsolidated statement of financial position."

      "text": "117 \nEpson does not recognise lease liabilities and right-of-use assets to either short-term leases that have a lease term of \n12 months or less, or low-value leases. Epson recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an \nexpense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n \n(10) Investment Property \nInvestment property is property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both. \nAfter recognition as an asset, investment property is measured by using the cost model and is carried at its cost less \nany accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. \nExcept for asset that is not subject to depreciation such as land, investment property is depreciated using the straight-\nline method over its estimated useful life. The estimated useful life of major investment properties that is subject to \ndepreciation is 35 years. \nThe estimated useful life, depreciation method and residual value are reviewed at each fiscal year end and, if \nexpectations differ from previous estimates, the effect of changes in accounting estimates is recognised prospectively. \n \n(11) Impairment of Non-financial Assets \nEpson assesses whether there is any indication that property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, \ninvestment property and right-of-use assets (“asset”) may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or irrespective \nof whether there is any indication of impairment, where impairment testing is required, the recoverable amount of \nthe asset is estimated. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount for each asset, the recoverable amount \nof the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined. The recoverable amount is measured at the \nhigher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If carrying amount \nof an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised and the carrying \namount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. In \ndetermining an asset’s value in use, an estimate of the future cash flows expected to derive from the asset are \ndiscounted to the present value, using pretax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value \nof money and the risks specific to the asset. \nAn impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in profit or loss and not reversed in a subsequent period. Epson \nassesses whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods for an asset other than \ngoodwill may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of that \nasset is estimated. If the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is reversed \nto the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) if no impairment loss \nhad been recognised for the asset in prior years. \n \n(12) Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations \nEpson classifies a non-current asset or disposal group as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered \nprincipally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. The non-current asset or disposal group as \nheld for sale is available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale is highly probable when Epson \nmanagement commits to a plan to sell the asset or disposal group. \nEpson measures the non-current asset or disposal group classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount \nand fair value less costs to sell. The non-current asset is not depreciated or amortised while it is classified as held for \nsale or while it is part of a disposal group classified as held for sale. \nA discontinued operation is a component of an entity, that is a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating \nunits, that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and (a) represents a separate major line of \nbusiness or geographical area of operations, (b) is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major \nline of business or geographical area of operations or (c) is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. \n \n(13) Post-employment Benefits \nEpson has defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans as post-employment benefits plans. For each defined \nbenefit plan, Epson calculates the present value of defined benefit obligations and the related current service cost and \npast service cost, using the projected unit credit method. For a discount rate, a discount period is set based on the \nestimated timing of benefit payments in each period, and the discount rate is determined by reference to market yields \nas of the end of the fiscal year on high quality corporate bonds for the period corresponding to the discount period. \nThe net defined benefit liability (asset) is measured by deducting the fair value of any plan assets (including \nadjustments of the net defined benefit asset and the asset ceiling, if necessary) from the present value of the defined \nbenefit obligation. Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) is recognised in profit or loss. \nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognised in other comprehensive income and \ntransferred to retained earnings immediately. Past service cost is recognised as an expense at the earlier of when a \nplan amendment or curtailment occurs and when any related restructuring costs or termination benefits are recognised. \nThe contribution payable to a defined contribution plan is recognised as an expense."

The shares of the Company held by the trust are \nrecognised as treasury shares. The Company measures the service received at the fair value of its shares granted at \nthe grant date and recognises the consideration as expenses over the vesting period while the corresponding amount \nis recognised as an increase in equity. \n \n(15) Provisions \nEpson recognises a provision when it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is \nprobable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a \nreliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. \nWhere the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a provision is measured at the present value \nof the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. \n \n(16) Revenue \nEpson recognises revenue by applying the following five steps approach. \nStep 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer \nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract \nStep 3: Determine the transaction price \nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract \nStep 5: Recognise revenue when Epson satisfies a performance obligation \nEpson is mainly engaged in the manufacture and sale of products of Printing Solutions, Visual Communications, and \nManufacturing-related & Wearables. Revenue is recognised when control of a promised good has been transferred \nto the customer and Epson satisfied its performance obligation. For sales of the products, this generally occurs when \na good is physically delivered to a customer. Revenue is measured at the amount of consideration promised in a \ncontract with a customer taking into consideration the effects of price discount, sales rebate, etc. When two or more \nperformance obligations are included in a contract with a customer, Epson allocates the transaction price to each \nidentified performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling price of each product. When the stand-alone \nselling prices are not directly observable, Epson estimates the selling price, assuming that the products are sold \nindividually and allocates the transaction price based thereon. \n \n(17) Government Grants \nA government grant is recognised at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that Epson will comply with the \nconditions attaching to it, and that the grant will be received. \nGrants related to assets are deducted in calculating the carrying amount of the asset. \nGrants related to income are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which Epson \nrecognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. \n \n(18) Borrowing Costs \nBorrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. \nThe borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, \nthat necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of \nthe cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period when they are incurred. \n \n(19) Income Taxes \nIncome taxes are presented as the total of current tax expense and deferred tax expense. \nCurrent tax is the amount of income taxes payable or recoverable and is recognised as an expense or income and \nincluded in profit or loss for the period, except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction which is recognised \neither in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, or a business combination. For the calculation of the tax \namount, Epson uses the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of fiscal \nyear. \nDeferred tax expense is calculated based on a temporary difference that is the difference between the carrying amount \nof the assets or liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and their tax bases. A deferred tax asset is \nrecognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to \nthe extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which they can be utilised. A deferred \ntax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences. \nA deferred tax liability is not recognised for taxable temporary differences when the deferred tax liability arises from \nthe initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a"

No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss \non the purchase, sale or cancellation of the treasury shares. Any difference between the carrying amount and the \nconsideration paid is recognised in equity. \n \n(21) Earnings per Share \nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company \nby the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusting by the number of \ntreasury shares. For the purpose of the calculation, the shares of the Company held by BIP trust are excluded because \nthe shares are accounted as treasury shares. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the rights for \nthe treasury shares held by the trust to be received by eligible officers are adjusted. \n \n(22) Dividends \nYear-end dividend distributions to the shareholders of the Company are recognised as liabilities in the period in \nwhich the distribution is approved at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. Interim dividend distributions are recognised \nas liabilities in the period in which the distribution is approved by Epson’s Board of Directors. \n \n \n4. Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgments \n \nThe preparation of Epson’s consolidated financial statements includes management estimates and assumptions for \nmeasurements of income, expenses, assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingencies as of the end of the fiscal \nyear. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best judgment of management in light of historical experience \nand various factors including impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic deemed to be reasonable as of the end of the fiscal \nyear. Given their nature, actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. \nThe estimates and assumptions are continuously reviewed by management. The effects of a change in estimates and \nassumptions are recognised in the period of the change and subsequent periods. \nAmong the above estimates and assumptions, the following were items that may have a material effect on the amounts \nrecognised in Epson’s consolidated financial statements: \n \n(1) Impairment of Non-financial Assets \nEpson performs an impairment test for property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, investment \nproperty and right-of-use assets (“asset”) when there is any indication that the recoverable amount has fallen below \nthe carrying amount of the assets or when it is required annually. \nThe impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying amount and the recoverable amount of assets or cash-\ngenerating units. If the recoverable amount falls below the carrying amount, impairment losses are recognised. \nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use of assets or cash-generating \nunits with certain assumptions of useful life, future cash flow of an asset, discount rate and long-term growth rate. \nValue in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from assets or cash-generating units \nand in measuring the value in use, Epson bases cash flow projections on the most recent business plan and others \napproved by management which includes assumptions such as projected growth in revenue. If an estimate is required \nfor the periods beyond the period covered by the business plan, etc., Epson takes future uncertainties into \nconsideration. The future cash flows include net cash flows from the disposal of the assets or cash-generating units. \nThese assumptions are based on the best estimates and judgments of management, but they could be affected by \nvariable and uncertain future economic conditions. Any changes in these assumptions could have a material impact"

Property, Plant and \nEquipment,” “14. Intangible Assets,” “15. Investment Property,” “16. Impairment of Non-financial Assets” and “21. \nLease.” \n \n(2) Post-employment Benefits \nEpson has several types of post-employment benefit plans, including defined benefit plans. \nThe present value of defined benefit obligations on each of these plans and the related service costs and others are \ncalculated based on actuarial assumptions. These actuarial assumptions require estimates and judgments on variables, \nsuch as discount rates. \nThe actuarial assumptions are determined based on the best estimates and judgments of management, but they could \nbe affected by variable and uncertain future economic conditions. Any changes in these assumptions could have a \nmaterial impact on Epson’s consolidated financial statements in future periods. \nThese actuarial assumptions and related sensitivity analysis are stated in “23. Post-employment Benefits.” \n \n(3) Provisions \nEpson recognises various provisions, including provisions for product warranties and asset retirement obligations. \nThese provisions are recognised based on the best estimates of the expenditures required to settle the obligations, \ntaking into account risks and uncertainty related to the obligations as of the end of the fiscal year. \nExpenditures necessary for settling the obligations are calculated by taking all possible future results into account. \nHowever, they may be affected by unexpected events or changes in conditions which may have a material impact on \nEpson’s consolidated financial statements in future periods. \nThe nature and amount of recognised provisions are stated in “20. Provisions.” \n \n(4) Income Taxes \nEpson, which conducts business around the world, makes reasonable estimates of income tax to be paid to local tax \nauthorities in accordance with local laws and regulations, and recognises income taxes payable and current tax \nexpense based on these estimates. \nCalculating income taxes payable and current tax expense requires estimates and judgments on various factors, \nincluding, for example, the interpretation of tax regulations by taxable entities and the tax authority in the jurisdiction \nor experience of prior tax investigation. \nTherefore, there may be differences between the amount recognised as income taxes payable and current tax expense \nand the amount of actual income taxes. These differences may have a material impact on Epson’s consolidated \nfinancial statements in future periods. \nIn addition, deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be available \nagainst which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. \nIn recognising the deferred tax assets, Epson judges the possibility of future taxable income and reasonably estimate \nthe timing and amount of future taxable income based on factors such as the business plan which includes \nassumptions such as projected growth in revenue. \nThe timing and amount of taxable income may be affected by variable and uncertain future economic conditions, and \nchanges could have a material impact on Epson’s consolidated financial statements in future periods. \nThe content and amounts related to income taxes are stated in “17. Income Taxes.” \n \n(5) Contingencies \nWith regard to contingencies, any items that may have a material impact on business in the future are disclosed in \nlight of all the available evidence as of the fiscal year end date and by taking into account the probability of these \ncontingencies and their impact on financial reporting. \nThe content of contingencies is stated in “39. Contingencies.” \n \n \n5. Changes in Accounting Estimates \n \nChange of Useful Life \nFrom the year ended March 31, 2022, Epson changed the useful life of machinery of the visual communications \nbusiness based on actual usage of the assets, as reviewing its production strategy in its business structural reform and \nothers. \nAs a result of this change, profit from operating activities and profit before tax for the year ended March 31, 2022 \nincreased by ¥2,567 million ($20,991 thousand) compared to the previous estimates."

Impairment of Non-financial Assets \n \nEpson’s business assets are generally grouped by business segment under the Company’s management accounting \nsystem, and their cash flows are continuously monitored. Assets to be disposed of (i.e., assets planned to be disposed \nor sold etc.) and idle assets are separately assessed for impairment on the individual asset level. \n \nTotal amount of impairment losses recognised for the year ended March 31, 2021 was ¥7,823 million, mainly \ncomprised “Machinery and equipment” of ¥4,362 million, “Buildings and structures” of ¥1,214 million and “Tools, \nfurniture and fixtures” of ¥937 million. \nImpairment loss recognised in the year ended March 31, 2021, was mainly for business assets that belong to the \nwearable products business which is a part of the Wearable & Industrial Products Segment (Current: Manufacturing-\nrelated & Wearables) by reviewing its business strategy at the end of the consolidated fiscal year as reflecting a \ndecline in profitability of the business. An impairment loss of ¥7,516 million was recognised, including the amount \nwhich had been already recognised during the consolidated fiscal year. The recoverable amount of ¥9,704 million \nwas determined at value in use by estimating future cash flows over 5 years, based on the business plan, etc. approved \nby management and net cash inflows from the disposal of assets and by discounting the future cash flows to the \npresent value at the pretax discount rate (7.5%). \n \nTotal amount of impairment losses recognised for the year ended March 31, 2022 was ¥1,460 million ($11,938 \nthousand), mainly comprised “Land, buildings and structures” of ¥1,316 million ($10,761 thousand) and “Machinery \nand equipment” of ¥79 million ($646 thousand). \nImpairment losses recognised in the year ended March 31, 2022, represent the losses related to assets to be disposed \nof and idle assets that Epson has no plan to use in the future, and the carrying amounts were reduced to the recoverable \namounts. The recoverable amounts of these assets were measured at value in use or fair value less costs of disposal. \nThe fair value less costs of disposal was based on the estimated selling price, etc. and was classified as Level 3 in the \nfair value hierarchy. \n \nImpairment losses were recognised as “Other operating expense” in the consolidated statement of comprehensive \nincome."

Income Taxes \n \n(1) Deferred Tax Assets and Deferred Tax Liabilities \nThe breakdown of “Deferred tax assets” and “Deferred tax liabilities” by major causes of their occurrence were as \nfollows: \n \n(Note) The difference between the net amount of deferred tax assets recognised in the years ended March 31, 2021 \nand 2022, less the respective net amounts of deferred tax assets recognised directly in equity and in other \ncomprehensive income, is mainly attributable to the impact of foreign exchange movements. \n \nEpson assesses its ability to utilise carryforward of unused tax losses in future periods based on the Mid-Range \nBusiness Plan and financial forecasts approved by the Board of Directors annually. This takes account of Epson’s \nmedium and long-term strategy and financial plans and the expected future economic outlook. The ability to utilise \ndeductible temporary differences and carryforward of unused tax losses in future periods for recognising deferred \ntax assets also takes account of material tax adjusting items, the expected future taxable income and the period (if \nany) in which carryforward of unused tax losses might expire. Epson believes that the recognised deferred tax assets \nare probable and the tax benefits can be realised based on the prior taxable income and the expected future taxable \nincome when the deferred tax assets can be recognised. \nEpson does not recognise deferred tax assets for some carryforward of unused tax losses and some deductible \ntemporary differences. Epson reduces the amount of the deferred tax assets to the extent that it is no longer probable \nthat the tax benefits can be realised based on an individual analysis of each company’s condition as a result of \nassessing the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. \nThe amounts of carryforward of unused tax losses, for which deferred tax assets have not been recognised, as of \nMarch 31, 2021 and 2022, were ¥26,954 million and ¥9,419 million ($77,021 thousand), respectively.

Also, it is based on the assumption that \ncurrencies other than the currencies used for the calculation do not fluctuate. \n \n \n \n(6) Interest Rate Risk \nEpson’s interest rate risk arises from cash equivalents and interest-bearing debt. Borrowings and bonds issued with \nfloating rates are subject to the effects of changes in future cash flows caused by the fluctuation of market interest \nrates; while, borrowings and bonds issued with fixed rates are subject to the effects of changes in the fair value caused \nby the fluctuation of market interest rates. \nIn response to the fluctuation of market interest rates, Epson reduces the interest rate risk by implementing an interest \nrate swap and adjusting appropriate proportion of financing between floating rates and fixed rates. \nIn accordance with Epson’s Capital Management Regulation, the interest rate swap is approved by the finance officer \nof the Company. \n \nInterest Rate Sensitivity Analysis \nIn cases where the interest rate of financial instruments held by Epson as of March 31, 2022 increases by 100bp, the \nimpact on profit before tax in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income was as follows: \nThe analysis included financial instruments affected by interest rate fluctuation and based on the assumption that \nother factors, including the impacts of foreign exchange fluctuation, were constant. \n \n \n(7) Market Price Fluctuation Risk \nWith respect to equity securities, Epson regularly assesses the fair value and financial conditions of the issuers, and \nreviews the portfolio held by taking into account the relationship with counterparty entities. Epson intends to hold \nequity instruments not for short-term trading but for long-term investment. Therefore, Epson does not sell the \ninstruments actively.  \nThe equity price fluctuation risks are calculated based on the price of equity instruments at the fiscal year end. In \ncases where the equity price changes by 5% in value, the impact on other comprehensive income before tax effects \nas of March 31, 2022 was ¥652 million ($5,331 thousand) due to the changes in the fair value. \n \n \n \nMillions of yen \nThousands of \nU.S. dollars \n \nMarch 31, \nMarch 31, \n \n2022 \n2022 \nProfit before tax \n14,297 \n116,910 \n \nMillions of yen \nThousands of \nU.S. dollars \n \nMarch 31, \nMarch 31, \n \n2022 \n2022 \nProfit before tax \n940 \n7,686"

For non-current borrowings with floating rates, it is assumed that the \nfair value is equal to the carrying amounts, because the rates are affected in the short term by fluctuations in market \ninterest rates, and because Epson’s credit status has not greatly changed since they were implemented. The fair values \nof non-current borrowings with fixed rates are calculated by the total sum of the principal and interest discounted by \nusing the interest rates that would be applied if similar new borrowings were conducted. \n \n(Bonds issued) \nThe fair values are calculated based on prices obtained from financial institutions. \n \n(B) Fair value hierarchy \nThe fair value hierarchy of financial instruments is categorised from Level 1 to Level 3 as follows: \n \nLevel 1: Fair value measured at quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities \nLevel 2: Fair value calculated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, \neither directly or indirectly \nLevel 3: Fair value calculated using valuation techniques including unobservable inputs for the assets and liabilities \nThe transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting \nperiod."
