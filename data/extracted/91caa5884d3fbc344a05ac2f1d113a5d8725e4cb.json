      "text": "1 \nDear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:  \nWe are living through a period of historic economic, societal, and geopolitical change. The world in 2022 looks nothing like \nthe world in 2019. As I write this, inflation is at a 40-year high, supply chains are stretched, and the war in Ukraine is \nongoing. At the same time, we are entering a technological era with the potential to power awesome advancements \nacross every sector of our economy and society. As the world’s largest software company, this places us at a historic \nintersection of opportunity and responsibility to the world around us.  \nOur mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more has never been more \nurgent or more necessary. For all the uncertainty in the world, one thing is clear: People and organizations in every \nindustry are increasingly looking to digital technology to overcome today’s challenges and emerge stronger. And no \ncompany is better positioned to help them than Microsoft.  \nEvery day this past fiscal year I have had the privilege to witness our customers use our platforms and tools to connect \nwhat technology can do with what the world needs it to do.  \nHere are just a few examples:  \n• \nFerrovial, which builds and manages some of the world’s busiest airports and highways, is using our cloud \ninfrastructure to build safer roads as it prepares for a future of autonomous transportation.  \n• \nPeace Parks Foundation, a nonprofit helping protect natural ecosystems in Southern Africa, is using Microsoft \nDynamics 365 and Power BI to secure essential funding, as well as our Azure AI and IoT solutions to help \nrangers scale their park maintenance and wildlife crime prevention work.  \n• \nOne of the world’s largest robotics companies, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, is using the breadth of our tools—\nfrom Azure IoT and HoloLens—to create an industrial metaverse solution that brings its distributed workforce \ntogether with its network of connected equipment to improve productivity and keep employees safe.  \n• \nGlobo, the biggest media and TV company in Brazil, is using Power Platform to empower its employees to \nbuild their own solutions for everything from booking sets to setting schedules.  \n• \nAnd Ørsted, which produces a quarter of the world’s wind energy, is using the Microsoft Intelligent Data \nPlatform to turn data from its offshore turbines into insights for predictive maintenance.  \nAmid this dynamic environment, we delivered record results in fiscal year 2022: We reported $198 billion in revenue and \n$83 billion in operating income. And the Microsoft Cloud surpassed $100 billion in annualized revenue for the first time.  \nOUR RESPONSIBILITY  \nAs a corporation, our purpose and actions must be aligned with addressing the world’s problems, not creating new ones. \nAt our very core, we need to deliver innovation that helps drive broad economic growth. We, as a company, will do well \nwhen the world around us does well.  \nThat’s what I believe will lead to widespread human progress and ultimately improve the lives of everyone. There is no \nmore powerful input than digital technology to drive the world’s economic output. This is the core thesis for our being as a \ncompany, but it’s not enough. As we drive global economic growth, we must also commit to creating a more inclusive, \nequitable, sustainable, and trusted future.  \nSupport inclusive economic growth  \nWe must ensure the growth we drive reaches every person, organization, community, and country. This starts with \nincreasing access to digital skills. This year alone, more than 23 million people accessed digital skills training as part of \nour global skills initiative."

      "text": "2 \n  \nBut skills alone aren’t enough—we need to help people better prepare for and connect to jobs. That’s why we’ve \ncommitted to equip 10 million people from underserved communities with skills for jobs in the digital economy by 2025.  \nOne area of digital skills has become especially critical: cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is a significant threat for \ngovernments, businesses, and individuals around the world, yet there simply aren’t enough people with cybersecurity \nskills to fill open jobs.  \nTo help address this, we’ve committed to skill and recruit 250,000 people into the US cybersecurity workforce by 2025—\nespecially those underrepresented in the field. And we’re helping an additional 24 countries with substantial cybersecurity \nworkforce shortages close their gaps too.  \nWe also continue to deliver affordable, relevant cloud technology and industry-specific solutions to nonprofit organizations \naddressing the world’s most pressing issues. This year, we provided $3.2 billion in donated and discounted technology to \n302,000 nonprofits serving over 1.2 billion people globally. And earlier this month, we announced that Microsoft will \ndouble the number of nonprofits we reach worldwide over the next five years.  \nProtect fundamental rights  \nWe unequivocally support the fundamental rights of people, from defending democracy, to protecting human rights, to \naddressing racial injustice and inequity. And, as people’s access to education, healthcare, jobs, and other critical services \nbecomes increasingly dependent on technology, it’s clear that access to broadband and accessible technology is also \nfundamental to building a more equitable future.  \nSince 2017, we’ve helped more than 50 million people in unserved rural communities globally gain access to affordable \nbroadband coverage. Building on our work in eight US cities, we’re now partnering with five US states with significant \nbroadband adoption gaps to increase access, adoption, and equity. And—given the importance of current data to \nbroadband planning—the new Microsoft Digital Equity Dashboard will help US policymakers and communities identify \nneighborhoods where funding and programmatic investment can achieve measurable impact.  \nThis year, we continued our journey to address racial injustice and inequity by increasing representation within Microsoft, \nengaging our ecosystem, and strengthening our communities.  \nAcross our ecosystem, we are more than 90% of the way toward our commitment to spend an incremental $500 million \nwith Black- and African American-owned suppliers. We’ve coordinated over 80 justice reform partnerships to help 145 \ncommunities expand access to data-driven insights that advance a more equitable system of justice and public safety. \nAnd we’ve expanded our Technology Education and Learning Support (TEALS) program to 290 high schools in cities with \nlarge Black and African American communities—to promote more equitable access to computer science education.  \nOur work to help preserve, protect, and advance democracy by promoting a healthy information ecosystem and \nsafeguarding electoral processes is as salient as ever in today’s geopolitical climate. Our AccountGuard nation-state \nthreat notification service protects more than 4 million accounts of election officials, human rights organizations, \njournalists, and other organizations. Our efforts to preserve and protect journalism in the United States and Mexico have \nbeen extended globally through new partnerships with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Report for the World, and \nothers.  \nThis year, we responded to six humanitarian emergencies in five countries through donations, technology, services, and \nemployee giving. As of July 2022, we’ve committed $257 million in financial and technology assistance to the global \nresponse to the war in Ukraine, including support for government, businesses, nonprofits, and humanitarian assistance for \nrefugees. And, through our AI for Humanitarian Action initiative, we’re helping organizations harness the power of AI to \nimprove their disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.  \nFinally, we continued working toward our five-year commitment to bridge the disability divide for the more than 1 billion \npeople around the world with disabilities, seeking to expand accessibility in technology, the workforce, and"

And, along with partner companies, we launched the Neurodiversity Career \nConnector, a jobs marketplace for neurodivergent job seekers. \nCreate a sustainable future  \nWe must ensure that economic growth does not come at the expense of our planet. Addressing climate change requires \nswift, collective action and technical innovation. We’re continuing our pursuit of our own ambitious commitments and \nhelping others achieve their climate goals, aided by technology.  \nIn March, we released our second annual sustainability report, sharing our progress, challenges, and learnings as we \npursue our commitments to become carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste. Although we continued to make \nprogress on several of our goals with an overall reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions \nincreased, due in large part to significant global datacenter expansions and the growth in Xbox sales and usage. Despite \nthese increases, we remain dedicated to achieving a net-zero future. We recognize that progress won’t always be linear, \nand the rate at which we can implement emissions reductions is dependent on many factors that can fluctuate over time.  \nOn the path to becoming water positive, we invested in 21 water replenishment projects that are expected to generate \nover 1.3 million cubic meters of volumetric benefits in nine water basins around the world. Progress toward our zero waste \ncommitment included diverting more than 15,200 metric tons of solid waste otherwise headed to landfills and incinerators, \nas well as launching new Circular Centers to increase reuse and reduce e-waste at our datacenters.  \nWe contracted to protect over 17,000 acres of land (50% more than the land we use to operate), thus achieving our \ncommitment to protect more land than we use by 2025.  \nAnd with Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, we’re expanding our work to help customers meet their ambitious \nsustainability goals by enabling them to better collect, track, and analyze the metrics of their sustainability strategy.  \nEarn trust  \nTo drive positive impact and growth with technology, people need to be able to trust the technologies they use and the \ncompanies behind them. We are committed to earning trust—both trust in business model alignment with our customers \nand partners, and trust in technology, spanning privacy, security, digital safety, the responsible use of AI, and \ntransparency.  \nWe’re dedicated to preserving our customers’ privacy and their ability to control their own data. We advocate for strong \nprivacy laws that require companies, including ours, to be accountable and responsible in their collection and use of \npersonal data. That’s why we supported the new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework and committed to meet or \nexceed all the requirements it outlines. And through the Microsoft privacy dashboard, millions of people each year can \nmake meaningful choices about how their data is used.  \nSecurity and digital safety are foundational to trust in today’s complex threat landscape. We analyze 43 trillion security \nsignals daily and use the insights to inform increased protections. This year, we blocked 34.7 billion identity threats and \n37 billion email threats. Over the past four years, we’ve sent over 67,000 nation-state-related threat notifications to \ncustomers to help them protect themselves from digital threats.  \nThis comprehensive capability has been critical during recent world events, including the war in Ukraine. Our efforts have \ninvolved both defending key infrastructure in the country—including assisting with the detection and disruption of \ncyberattacks and cyberinfluence operations and evacuating data to the cloud—as well as supporting people, \ncommunities, and organizations on the ground as part of our humanitarian and disaster response."

      "text": "4 \n  \nOur commitment to responsibly develop and use technologies like AI is core to who we are. We put our commitment into \npractice, not only within Microsoft but by empowering our customers and partners to do the same and by advocating for \npolicy change. We released our Responsible AI Standard, which outlines 17 goals aligned to our six AI principles and \nincludes tools and practices to support them. And we share our open-source tools, including the new Responsible AI \nDashboard, to help developers building AI technologies identify and mitigate issues before deployment.  \nFinally, we provide clear reporting and information on how we run our business and how we work with customers and \npartners, delivering the transparency that is central to trust. Our annual Impact Summary shares more about our progress \nand learnings across these four commitments, and our Reports Hub provides detailed reports on our environmental data, \nour political activities, our workforce demographics, our human rights work, and more. \nWe should all be proud of this work—and I am. But it’s easy to talk about what we’re doing well. As we look to the next \nyear and beyond, we’ll continue to reflect on where the world needs us to do better.  \nOUR OPPORTUNITY  \nNow, let me turn to how we are positioned to capture the massive opportunities ahead. Over the past few years, I’ve \nwritten extensively about digital transformation, but now we need to go beyond that to deliver on what I call the ―digital \nimperative.‖  \nTechnology is a deflationary force in an inflationary economy. Every organization in every industry will need to infuse \ntechnology into every business process and function so they can do more with less. It’s what I believe will make the \ndifference between organizations that thrive and those that get left behind.  \nIn the coming years, technology as a percentage of GDP will double from 5% to 10% and beyond, as technology moves \nfrom a back-office cost center to a defining feature of every product and service. But even more important will be \ntechnology’s influence on the other 90% of the world’s economy. From communications and commerce, to logistics, \nfinancial services, energy, healthcare, and entertainment, digital technology will power the entire global economy as every \ncompany becomes a software company in its own right.  \nAcross our customer solution areas, we are delivering powerful platforms, tools, and services that expand our opportunity \nto help every organization in every industry deliver on the digital imperative—with a business model that is trusted and \nalways aligned with their success.  \nApps and infrastructure  \nWe are building Azure as the world’s computer, with more than 60 datacenter regions—more than any other provider—\ndelivering faster access to cloud services while addressing critical data residency requirements. With Azure Arc, we’re \nbringing Azure anywhere, meeting customers where they are and enabling them to run apps across on-premises, edge, or \nmulticloud environments. And we’re extending our infrastructure to the 5G network edge with Azure for Operators, \nintroducing new solutions to help telecom operators deliver ultra-low-latency services closer to end users.  \nAs the digital and physical worlds come together, we’re also leading in the industrial metaverse. From smart factories, to \nsmart buildings, to smart cities, we’re helping organizations use Azure IoT, Azure Digital Twins, and Microsoft Mesh to \ndigitize people, places, and things, in order to visualize, simulate, and analyze any business process.  \nData and AI  \nFrom best-in-class databases and analytics to data governance, we have the most comprehensive data stack to help \nevery organization turn its data into predictive and analytical power.

Cosmos DB \nis the go-to database powering the world’s most demanding, mission-critical workloads, at any scale. With Azure \nSynapse, we’re removing traditional barriers between enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics so anyone can \ncollaborate, build, and manage analytics solutions. And we’re creating an entirely new market category with Microsoft \nPurview, as we help organizations govern, protect, and manage their data estate across platforms and clouds.  \nWhen it comes to AI, we’re seeing a paradigm shift as the world’s large AI models become platforms themselves. And we \nare helping organizations apply the world’s most advanced coding and language models to a variety of use cases, such \nas writing assistance, code generation, and reasoning over data with our new Azure OpenAI Service.  \nDigital and app innovation  \nWe have the most popular developer tools for any cloud and any platform to help organizations modernize existing apps \nand build new ones. GitHub is the most complete developer platform to build, scale, and deliver secure software. This \nyear, we introduced GitHub Copilot, a first-of-its-kind AI pair programmer, to help developers write better code faster. And \norganizations are increasingly turning to both Visual Studio and our Azure PaaS services to streamline development and \ncreate modern, more resilient cloud-native applications.  \nLow-code/no-code tools are rapidly becoming a priority for every organization’s digital capability. With Power Platform, we \nare helping domain experts rapidly drive productivity gains when it’s never been more important. We have nearly \n25 million monthly active users. And we’re innovating to make it even easier for teams of professional and citizen \ndevelopers to automate workflows, create apps, build virtual agents, and analyze data.  \nBusiness applications  \nWith our expanding portfolio of business applications, we are helping every business become a hyperconnected \nbusiness—unifying data, process, and teams across the organization. New Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces helps \norganizations across diverse industries—from real estate and retail, to factories and construction—manage their physical \noperations. And with new integrations between Dynamics 365 and Teams, we are creating a new category of \ncollaborative applications that helps businesses surface data and insights right in the flow of work.  \nOur industry clouds bring together capabilities across the Microsoft Cloud with industry-specific customizations to help \norganizations improve time to value, increase agility, and lower costs. We completed our acquisition of Nuance \nCommunications this year, adding new cloud and enterprise AI capabilities for healthcare, as well as other industries. And \nas sustainability becomes an existential priority not just for our society but for every organization, our new Microsoft Cloud \nfor Sustainability, which I mentioned earlier, is helping our customers record, report, and ultimately reduce their \nenvironmental impact.  \nModern work  \nHybrid work is now just work. Every organization is looking to reconnect and reengage the workforce at home, in the \noffice, and everywhere in between. Microsoft Teams is the most used and most advanced platform for work, surpassing \n270 million monthly active users this year. It’s the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business \nprocess automation in one place.  \nTeams Rooms is bringing Teams to a growing ecosystem of devices to help organizations rethink their approach to space \nand help employees participate fully in meetings from anywhere. And with Microsoft Viva, we’re building an employee \nexperience platform that brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights in the flow of work \nto empower employees and strengthen their connection to their company’s mission and culture."

It reimagines everything from the user experience to the store to help people and \norganizations be more productive, connected, and secure, and to build a more open ecosystem for developers and \ncreators. There are now more than 1.4 billion monthly active devices running Windows 10 or Windows 11. We launched \nnew Surface devices to support every person and work style. And we have nearly 60 million Microsoft 365 consumer \nsubscriptions as we help people create, connect, and share wherever they go.  \nSecurity  \nCybersecurity is the number one threat facing every business today. To keep our customers secure, we build security by \ndesign into every product we sell, and we deliver end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, device \nmanagement, and privacy across clouds and platforms. We are the only cloud provider with multicloud protection for the \nindustry’s top three cloud platforms. Our new Entra product family includes tools for permissions management, identity \ngovernance, and identity verification. And we now offer managed threat detection and response with Microsoft Security \nExperts.  \nLinkedIn  \nLinkedIn has become mission critical to connect creators with their communities, job seekers with jobs, learners with \nskills, and marketers with buyers. LinkedIn now has more than 850 million members, and our Sales, Talent, Marketing, \nand Premium Subscriptions lines of business have all surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue over the past 12 months.  \nSearch, advertising, and news  \nWhen it comes to advertising, we are creating a new monetization engine for the web—an alternative that offers \nmarketers and publishers more long-term viable ad solutions—while upholding consumer privacy and strong data \ngovernance. We’re focused on increasing our share and engagement across our browser Microsoft Edge, our search \nengine Microsoft Bing, and our personalized content feed Microsoft Start.  \nAnd with our acquisition of Xandr, we now power one of the largest marketplaces for premium advertising. Netflix chose \nus this summer as its exclusive technology and sales partner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of \nthe differentiated value we provide to publishers looking for a flexible partner to build and innovate with them. I couldn’t be \nmore excited about our expansive opportunity ahead in this space.  \nGaming  \nThe big bets we have made across content, community, and cloud over the past few years continue to pay off. We’ve sold \nmore Xbox Series S and Series X consoles life-to-date than any previous generation of Xbox, and with Xbox Cloud \nGaming, we’re bringing games to entirely new endpoints. In the past year, we’ve made many of our most popular titles \naccessible on phones, tablets, TVs, and low-spec PCs for the first time. Our Xbox Game Pass subscription service now \nincludes access to hundreds of games. And with our planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard, we aim to give players \nmore choice to play great games wherever, whenever, and however they want. Choice is equally important to developers, \nwho we want to support with a diversity of distribution and business models for their games. We believe the acquisition \nwill unlock opportunities for innovation and enable the industry to grow.  \nOUR CULTURE  \nOur culture is the foundation on which our mission and strategy stand, and cultivating it is our greatest priority.

Essential to this is our commitment to continually exercise our growth mindset and \nconfront our fixed mindset with humility, curiosity, compassion, and the recognition that, while none of us will ever be \nperfect, we can always be better than we are today.  \nThis growth mindset served us well through the historic changes of the past few years. It sustains our everyday practice of \ncustomer obsession. It helps us care for our colleagues and collaborate more effectively across the company. And it \ndeeply informs our longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion.  \nIf we want to serve the world, we need to represent the world. Each year we strive to increase representation, and 2022 \nwas no exception. We saw the strongest progress in years across several demographic groups, as you can see in our \nlatest Diversity & Inclusion Report. We are one of the most transparent companies of our size when it comes to the data \nwe share, and we continually challenge ourselves to increase visibility into where we’re succeeding and where we need to \naddress gaps. We’ve added new data, such as military status, gender representation by geography, employee exits, and \nadditional pay data, to reflect our workforce more broadly. As we make meaningful progress, we continue our commitment \nto meet the increasing expectations for driving innovation, welcoming diverse perspectives, and leading global change.  \nGiving is also core to our culture at Microsoft. In 2022, our employees gave $255 million (with company match) to over \n32,000 nonprofits. And more than 29,000 employees volunteered over 720,000 hours to causes they care about.  \nI’m constantly in awe of how our employees bring their passion to work each day—for each other, for our customers, and \nfor their communities.  \n***  \nI want to close by thanking you for your continued investment in Microsoft. Our growth and impact this past year would not \nhave been possible without your commitment to the company and belief in its mission.  \nThe opportunity to apply technology to make a real difference for every customer, community, and country has never \nbeen greater.

      "text": "15 \n  \nCorporate Social Responsibility  \nCommitment to Sustainability  \nWe work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward \na more sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers build \nsustainable solutions, and advocating for policies that benefit the environment. In January 2020, we announced a bold \ncommitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon \nwe have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1 billion over four years in new \ntechnologies and innovative climate solutions. We built on this pledge by adding commitments to be water positive by \n2030, zero waste by 2030, and to protect ecosystems by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers \nand customers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon footprint.  \nFiscal year 2021 was a year of both successes and challenges. While we continued to make progress on several of our \ngoals, with an overall reduction in our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased, due \nin substantial part to significant global datacenter expansions and growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. Despite these Scope 3 increases, we will continue to build the foundations and do the work to \ndeliver on our commitments, and help our customers and partners achieve theirs. We have learned the impact of our work \nwill not all be felt immediately, and our experience highlights how progress won’t always be linear.  \nWhile fiscal year 2021 presented us with some new learnings, we also made some great progress. A few examples that \nilluminate the diversity of our work include:  \n• \nWe purchased the removal of 1.4 million metrics tons of carbon.  \n• \nFour of our datacenters received new or renewed Zero Waste certifications.  \n• \nWe granted $100 million to Breakthrough Energy Catalyst to accelerate the development of climate solutions \nthe world needs to reach net-zero across four key areas: direct air capture, green hydrogen, long duration \nenergy storage, and sustainable aviation fuel.  \n• \nWe joined the First Movers Coalition as an early leader and expert partner in the carbon dioxide removal \nsector, with a commitment of $200 million toward carbon removal by 2030.  \nSustainability is an existential priority for our society and businesses today. This led us to create our Microsoft Cloud for \nSustainability, an entirely new business process category to help organizations monitor their carbon footprint across their \noperations. We also joined with leading organizations to launch the Carbon Call – an initiative to mobilize collective action \nto solve carbon emissions and removal accounting challenges for a net zero future.  \nThe investments we make in sustainability carry through to our products, services, and devices. We design our devices, \nfrom Surface to Xbox, to minimize their impact on the environment. Our cloud and AI services and datacenters help \nbusinesses cut energy consumption, reduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products.  \nAddressing Racial Injustice and Inequity  \nWe are committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity in the United States for Black and African American \ncommunities and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in employees’ communities, and beyond. Our Racial \nEquity Initiative focuses on three multi-year pillars, each containing actions and progress we expect to make or exceed by \n2025.  \n• \nStrengthening our communities: using data, technology, and partnerships to help improve the lives of Black \nand African American people in the United States, including our employees and their communities.  \n• \nEvolving our ecosystem: using our balance sheet and relationships with suppliers and partners to foster \nsocietal change and create new opportunities."

We are 90 percent of the way to our \n2025 commitment to double the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual contributors, \nand senior leaders in the U.S., and 50 percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx people managers, senior individual \ncontributors, and senior leaders in the U.S.  \nWe exceeded our goal on increasing the percentage of transaction volumes with Black- and African American-owned \nfinancial institutions and increased our deposits with Black- and African American-owned minority depository institutions, \nenabling increased funds into local communities. Additionally, we enriched our supplier pipeline, reaching more than \n90 percent of our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of Black and African American-owned suppliers. We \nalso increased the number of identified partners in the Black Partner Growth Initiative and continue to invest in the partner \ncommunity through the Black Channel Partner Alliance by supporting events focused on business growth, accelerators, \nand mentorship.  \nProgress does not undo the egregious injustices of the past or diminish those who continue to live with inequity. We are \ncommitted to leveraging our resources to help accelerate diversity and inclusion across our ecosystem and to hold \nourselves accountable to accelerate change – for Microsoft, and beyond.  \nInvesting in Digital Skills  \nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to record unemployment, disrupting livelihoods of people around the world. After helping \nover 30 million people in 249 countries and territories with our global skills initiative, we introduced a new initiative to \nsupport a more skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and accessible learning paths to develop the right skills \nneeded for the most in-demand jobs. Our skills initiative brings together learning resources, certification opportunities, and \njob-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn’s Economic \nGraph. We previously invested $20 million in key non-profit partnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies to help people \nfrom underserved communities that are often excluded by the digital economy.  \nWe also launched a national campaign with U.S. community colleges to help skill and recruit into the cybersecurity \nworkforce 250,000 people by 2025, representing half of the country’s workforce shortage. To that end, we are making \ncurriculum available free of charge to all of the nation’s public community colleges, providing training for new and existing \nfaculty at 150 community colleges, and providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students.  \nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES  \nOverview  \nMicrosoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds. To foster their and \nour success, we seek to create an environment where people can thrive, where they can do their best work, where they \ncan proudly be their authentic selves, guided by our values, and where they know their needs can be met. We strive to \nmaximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work \nenvironment that enables our global employees to create products and services that further our mission to empower every \nperson and every organization on the planet to achieve more."

Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.  \nOur Culture  \nMicrosoft’s culture is grounded in the growth mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow. \nWe believe potential can be nurtured and is not pre-determined, and we should always be learning and curious – trying \nnew things without fear of failure. We identified four attributes that allow growth mindset to flourish:  \n• \nObsessing over what matters to our customers.  \n• \nBecoming more diverse and inclusive in everything we do.  \n• \nOperating as one company, One Microsoft, instead of multiple siloed businesses.  \n• \nMaking a difference in the lives of each other, our customers, and the world around us.  \nOur employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and \nemployee needs globally. Seventy percent of employees globally participated in our fiscal year 2022 Employee Signals \nsurvey, which covers a variety of topics such as thriving, inclusion, team culture, wellbeing, and learning and \ndevelopment. Throughout the fiscal year, we collect over 75,000 Daily Pulse employee survey responses. During fiscal \nyear 2022, our Daily Pulse surveys gave us invaluable insights into ways we could support employees through the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, addressing racial injustice, the war in Ukraine, and their general wellbeing. In addition to Employee \nSignals and Daily Pulse surveys, we gain insights through onboarding, internal mobility, leadership, performance and \ndevelopment, exit surveys, internal Yammer channels, employee Q&A sessions, and AskHR Service support.  \nDiversity and Inclusion  \nAt Microsoft we have an inherently inclusive mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to \nachieve more. We think of diversity and inclusion as core to our business model, informing our actions to impact \neconomies and people around the world. There are billions of people who want to achieve more, but have a different set \nof circumstances, abilities, and backgrounds that often limit access to opportunity and achievement. The better we \nrepresent that diversity inside Microsoft, the more effectively we can innovate for those we seek to empower.  \nWe strive to include others by holding ourselves accountable for diversity, driving global systemic change in our workplace \nand workforce, and creating an inclusive work environment. Through this commitment we can allow everyone the chance \nto be their authentic selves and do their best work every day. We support multiple highly active Employee Resource \nGroups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military, people with disabilities, and employees who identify as \nLGBTQIA+, where employees can go for support, networking, and community-building. As described in our 2021 Proxy \nStatement, annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team include an evaluation of their \ncontributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly disclose our progress on a \nmultitude of workforce metrics including:  \n• \nDetailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in our employee population, with \ndata by job types, levels, and segments of our business.  \n• \nOur EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity).  \n• \nDisability representation.  \n• \nPay equity (see details below)."

Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for \nexample, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our colleagues. We monitor pay equity \nand career progress across multiple dimensions.  \nAs part of our effort to promote a One Microsoft and inclusive culture, in fiscal year 2021 we expanded stock eligibility to \nall Microsoft employees as part of our annual rewards process. This includes all non-exempt and exempt employees and \nequivalents across the globe including business support professionals and datacenter and retail employees. In response \nto the Great Reshuffle, in fiscal year 2022 we announced a sizable investment in annual merit and annual stock award \nopportunity for all employees below senior executive levels. We also invested in base salary adjustments for our \ndatacenter and retail hourly employees and hourly equivalents outside the U.S. These investments have supported \nretention and help to ensure that Microsoft remains an employer of choice.  \nPay Equity  \nIn our 2021 Diversity and Inclusion Report, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined \nearn $1.006 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.002 for every $1.000 \nearned by their counterparts in the U.S. who are men, and women in the U.S. plus our twelve other largest employee \ngeographies representing 86.6% of our global population (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, \nIsrael, Japan, Romania, Singapore, and the United Kingdom) combined earn $1.001 for every $1.000 by men in these \ncountries.

We developed hybrid guidelines for managers and employees to support the transition and continue to \nidentify ways we can support hybrid work scenarios through our employee listening systems.  \nWe have invested significantly in holistic wellbeing, and offer a differentiated benefits package which includes many \nphysical, emotional, and financial wellness programs including counseling through the Microsoft CARES Employee \nAssistance Program, mental wellbeing support, flexible fitness benefits, savings and investment tools, adoption \nassistance, and back-up care for children and elders.

We have over 27,000 people managers, all of whom must complete between \n20-33 hours of required manager capability and excellence training and are assigned ongoing required training each year. \nIn addition, all employees complete skills training based on the profession they are in each year.  \nNew Ways of Working  \nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our capabilities and culture with respect to flexible work. We introduced a Hybrid \nWorkplace Flexibility Guide to better support managers and employees as they adapt to new ways of working that shift \nparadigms, embrace flexibility, promote inclusion, and drive innovation. Our ongoing survey data shows employees value \nthe flexibility related to work location, work site, and work hours, and while many have begun returning to worksites as \nconditions have permitted, they also continue to adjust hours and/or spend some of workweeks working at home, another \nsite, or remotely. We are focused on building capabilities to support a variety of workstyles where individuals, teams, and \nour business can deliver success.  \nOPERATING SEGMENTS  \nWe operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business \nProcesses, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive \nfinancial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the \ndevelopment, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational \nallocation of resources within businesses.  \nAdditional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 19 – \nSegment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K.  \nOur reportable segments are described below."

Our devices are designed to enable people and \norganizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and \nservices. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more productive. Growth in Devices is \ndependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product roadmap, and expanding into new \ncategories.  \nGaming  \nOur gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content, \ncommunity, and cloud. Our exclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of first-party \nstudios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios and content to \nexpand our IP roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of \nXbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and \nthird-party console and PC titles.  \nThe gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We continue to open new opportunities for gamers to engage \nboth on- and off-console with both the launch of Xbox Cloud Gaming, our game streaming service, and continued \ninvestment in gaming hardware. Xbox Cloud Gaming utilizes Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology to allow direct and on-\ndemand streaming of games to PCs, consoles, and mobile devices, enabling gamers to take their favorite games with \nthem and play on the device most convenient to them.  \nXbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-\nenabled devices, and other devices. Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified \napplications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer \nbase. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising. \nGrowth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability \nof games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used \nto access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through first-party content creators.  \nSearch and News Advertising  \nOur Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to a \nglobal audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Yahoo, through which we provide and \nmonetize search queries.

We also compete with other providers \nof entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from \nNintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is \neffectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant \ninnovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and \ncontinued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.  \nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like \nMeta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.  \nOPERATIONS  \nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, \ncredit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland \nsupports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater \nChina, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, \nWashington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also \noperate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa.  \nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international \nmarkets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require \nmodifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.  \nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have \nthe ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. \nHowever, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these \ncomponents, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is \nunable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar \ndisruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.  \nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  \nProduct and Service Development, and Intellectual Property  \nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.  \n• \nCloud and AI, focuses on making IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and \nefficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development \ntools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and \nservices for enterprises.  \n• \nExperiences and Devices, focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and \ndevices, including Office, Windows, Teams, consumer web experiences (including search and news \nadvertising), and the Surface line of devices.  \n• \nSecurity, Compliance, Identity, and Management, focuses on cloud platform and application security, identity \nand network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.   \n• \nTechnology and Research, focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and \ndevelopment efforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.  \n• \nLinkedIn, focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn."

It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and \nenhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as \npossible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before \nreleasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application \nvendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product \ndocumentation internally.  \nWe protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to \nensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and \nhardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing \npatents and currently have a portfolio of over 69,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 19,000 pending \nworldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property exclusively in our products and \nservices, we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ \nproducts. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering \nentire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. \nAt times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as \npromoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting \nand enabling our external development community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause \nus to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.  \nWhile it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, services, \nand business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be \nobtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not \nmaterially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our \nproducts.  \nInvesting in the Future  \nOur success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to \ninitiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad \nadoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we \nbelieve offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the Company. Based on our \nassessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide \nspectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, \nand operating systems.  \nWhile our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate \nresearch and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us remain \ncompetitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.  \nWe plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities, and \nas appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results \nacross the Company. \nIn addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is \none of the world’s largest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around \nthe world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines, providing us a unique \nperspective on future trends and contributing to our innovation."

Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and \npublic-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements; \nmanaging OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who \nengage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services.  \nOEMs  \nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. \nThe largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell \ndevices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to \nsubscribe to Office 365.  \nThere are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is \nmanaged through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or \nmore of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many \nregional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC \nmanufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft \ndistributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.  \nDirect  \nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and \nEnterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, \nand partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (―Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors‖ \nor ―ESA‖). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to \nthose offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.  \nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and \ngaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. In fiscal year 2021, we closed our Microsoft Store physical \nlocations and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper \nengagement with our partners and customers across industries.  \nDistributors and Resellers  \nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (―LSP‖), \ndistributors, value-added resellers (―VAR‖), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations \nof all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically \nreach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other \nvolume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.  \nWe distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized \nreplicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We \ndistribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support \npersonnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.  \nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing \nvertical solutions and specialized services."

Each \nindustry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the \nindustry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research \nand development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry \ntrends, and competitive forces.  \nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks  \nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are \ndeveloping new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and \nbusinesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in \nthe cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve \nand adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure \nand devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.  \nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and \nindustry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, \nbroad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, \nand competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to \nglobal macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.  \nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components \nfor which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other \nmanufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at \nthese suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to \nmeet consumer demand.  \nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and \nexpenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may \nsignificantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have \na material impact on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022.  \nRefer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.  \nSeasonality  \nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second \nquarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by \nconsumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the \nperiod.  \nReportable Segments  \nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent \nCloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with \nour internal management reporting. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 – Segment \nInformation and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K.  \nMetrics  \nWe use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of \nresources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into \nperformance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services.

Interest expense decreased due to a decrease \nin outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities.

The decrease in our effective tax \nrate was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer \nof intangible properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and \nforeign countries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in \nthe case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellent Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax, an agreement \nbetween the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (―TCJA‖) \nregulations.  \nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the \nU.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year \n2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed \nincome tax.  \nWe have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit \nassessments in India. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, \nsome dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a \nparty to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we \nrecorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India \nSupreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.  \nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to \nthe transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and \ndistributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to \nstock-based compensation."

In fiscal year \n2021, our U.S. income before income taxes was $35.0 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was \n$36.1 billion.  \nUncertain Tax Positions  \nWe settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (―IRS‖) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In \nFebruary 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 \nand reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in \nfiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of \nfiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of \n$1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.  \nAs of June 30, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a \nmaterial impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for \nincome tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer \npricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information \ncurrently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within \nthe next 12 months.  \nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject \nto examination for tax years 1996 to 2021, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution \nof each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  \nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  \nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the net tax benefit \nrelated to the transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the net income tax benefit related \nto an India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. We believe these non-\nGAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends \naffecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with \nGAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be \nconsidered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  \nThe following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results:  \n  \n(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) \n2022 \n2021 \nPercentage\nChange\n  \nNet income \n$  72,738  $  61,271  \n19% \nNet income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties \n \n(3,291)  \n0   \n* \nNet income tax benefit related to India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes \n \n0   \n(620)  \n* \n  \n  \n  \nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) \n$ 69,447  $ 60,651   \n15% \n  \n  \n  \n  \nDiluted earnings per share \n$ \n9.65  $ \n8.05   \n20% \nNet income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties \n \n(0.44)  \n0   \n* \nNet income tax benefit related to India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes \n \n0   \n(0.08)  \n* \n  \n  \n  \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) \n$ \n9.21  $ \n7.97   \n16% \n  \n  \n  \n  \n* \nNot meaningful."

Equity investments were $6.9 billion and $6.0 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our \nshort-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of \nhighly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The \ninvestments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated \nsecurities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk \nand average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain \nfixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term \ninvestments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.  \nValuation  \nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the \nfair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. \ngovernment securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical \nassets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or \ninputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our \nLevel 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, \nmortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are \nvalued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a \nrecurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  \nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these \nvendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without \napplying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not \npriced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment \ntrades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these \ninvestments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced \ninvestments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these \ninvestments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. \nThese controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and \nindependent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  \nCash Flows  \nCash from operations increased $12.3 billion to $89.0 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to an increase in cash \nreceived from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees. Cash used in financing \nincreased $10.4 billion to $58.9 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $5.3 billion increase in common stock \nrepurchases and a $5.3 billion increase in repayments of debt. Cash used in investing increased $2.7 billion to \n$30.3 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $13.1 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of \ncash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $3.3 billion increase in additions to property and \nequipment, offset in part by a $15.6 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities."

Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% \ndue in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax \nof $6.2 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2022.

      "text": "42 \n  \nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  \nRefer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K for further \ndiscussion.  \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  \nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing \nconsolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a \nsignificant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of \noperations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment \nsecurities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  \nRevenue Recognition  \nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. \nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for \nseparately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises \nsoftware licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered \ndistinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized \nover time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and \ninterrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance \nobligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  \nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (―SSP‖) for each distinct performance obligation. We use \na single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or \nsoftware updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the \nproducts and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative \nSSP of the various products and services.  \nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we \ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have \nmore than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by \ncustomers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and \ngeographic region in determining the SSP.  \nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, \nincluding the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  \nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances \nwe estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when \ndetermining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at \nthe end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable \nconsideration were not material for the periods presented.  \nImpairment of Investment Securities  \nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, \nwe evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to \nwhich the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this"

      "text": "43 \njudgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in \nevaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the \nfinancial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not \nthat we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an \nimpairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, \nindustry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  \nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment \nindicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a \nqualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the \namount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in \nother income (expense), net.  \nGoodwill  \nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We \nevaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation \napproach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating \nsegment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that \nwould more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or \ncircumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, \ncompetition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  \nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of \nassets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of \neach reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow \nmethodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent \non internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which \ncash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  \nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, \nmarket conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the \ndetermination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  \nResearch and Development Costs  \nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until \ntechnological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs \nare capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when \ntechnological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software \nproducts is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this \noccurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of \nrevenue over the estimated life of the products.  \nLegal and Other Contingencies       \nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss \nfrom a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an \nasset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In \ndetermining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an \nunfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could \nmaterially impact our consolidated financial statements."

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more \nlikely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical \nmerits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on \nthe largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature \nalso provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets \nand liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is \nrequired in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial \nstatements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our \nconsolidated financial statements.  \nInventories  \nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, \nand manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated \nselling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on \nhand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include \nanalysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, \nand component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a \nnew cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  \nCHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE  \nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in \nsoftware that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in \ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four \nyears to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying \namount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, it is estimated this \nchange will increase our fiscal year 2023 operating income by $3.7 billion. We had previously increased the estimated \nuseful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020."

      "text": "52 \nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  \nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES  \nAccounting Principles  \nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles \ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (―GAAP‖).  \nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior \nperiod amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated \ncash flows statements.  \nPrinciples of Consolidation  \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany \ntransactions and balances have been eliminated.  \nEstimates and Assumptions  \nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue \nrecognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone \nselling price (―SSP‖) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and \nrefunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible \nassets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful \naccounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when \ntechnological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been \nrecognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments \nfor investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and \nuncertainties.  \nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in \nsoftware that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in \ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four \nyears to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. We had previously \nincreased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.  \nForeign Currencies  \nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. \nRevenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments \nresulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.  \nRevenue  \nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue  \nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, \nbusiness solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and \nhardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories."

We enter into contracts that can \ninclude various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as \nseparate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from \ncustomers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  \nNature of Products and Services  \nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available \nto the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the \nsame functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from \ndistinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the \ncustomer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no \nadditional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of \nthe related device or license.  \nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with \nSoftware Assurance (―SA‖). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and \nprovides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses \nare considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized \nratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises \ndistinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.  \nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the \nsoftware, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a \nsubscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a \nconsumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of \nsuch resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the \nindividual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services \nare provided.  \nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action \nnecessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are \nprovided.  \nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot \nfunction without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single \nperformance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or \ndirectly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.  \nRefer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant \nproduct and service offering.  \nSignificant Judgments  \nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. \nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be"

      "text": "54 \naccounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-\npremises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is \nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and \nrecognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, \ninterdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together \nas one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services \nare provided.  \nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate \nSSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at \nno additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services \nseparately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various \nproducts and services.  \nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we \ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have \nmore than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by \ncustomers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and \ngeographic region in determining the SSP.  \nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, \nincluding the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  \nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances \nwe estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when \ndetermining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at \nthe end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable \nconsideration were not material for the periods presented.  \nContract Balances and Other Receivables  \nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue \nis recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year \nagreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a \nreceivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice \nand receive payment in the future related to those licenses.  \nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and \ncloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year \nagreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting \nservices to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows \npost-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn \nthe revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.  \nRefer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in \nunearned revenue during the period.  \nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 \nto 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing \nfrom our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription \nterm with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced \nannually with revenue recognized upfront."

These costs include our internal sales force compensation \nprogram and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate \nwith annual sales activities.  \nCost of Revenue  \nCost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs \nrelated to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold \nby original equipment manufacturers (―OEM‖), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online"

Capitalized software development costs are amortized over \nthe estimated lives of the products.  \nProduct Warranty  \nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the \nrelated revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product \nfailure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific \nhardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, \nbut generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, \nwe estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly \nreevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as \nnecessary.  \nResearch and Development  \nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other \nheadcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include \nthird-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, \nand the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are \nincluded in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our \nsoftware products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is \nreached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  \nSales and Marketing  \nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other \nheadcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, \ntrade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was \n$1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  \nStock-Based Compensation  \nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (―RSUs‖) and performance stock units (―PSUs‖), \nis measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related \nservice or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the \ngrant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value \nof PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method \nand for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.  \nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (―ESPP‖) is measured as the discount the employee is \nentitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  \nIncome Taxes  \nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. \nCertain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of \nsuch temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation \nallowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as \nlong-term in our consolidated balance sheets."

      "text": "57 \n  \nFinancial Instruments  \nInvestments  \nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to \nbe cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with \noriginal maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term \ninvestments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid \nnature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.  \nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific \nidentification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other \ncomprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates \ndetermined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general \nmarket conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To \ndetermine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative \nevidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, \nthe investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security \nbefore recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), \nnet and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we \nmay incur future impairments.  \nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily \ndeterminable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable \nchanges in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a \nperiodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less \nthan carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.  \nDerivatives  \nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for \nchanges in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  \nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), \nnet with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded \nfrom the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.  \nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of \nother comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged \nitem. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in \nother income (expense), net.  \nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily \nrecognized in other income (expense), net.  \nFair Value Measurements  \nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the \nextent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value \nmeasurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement \nin its entirety. These levels are:  \n• \nLevel 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our \nLevel 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our \nLevel 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges."

      "text": "58 \n  \n• \nLevel 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for \nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the \nBlack-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by \nobservable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these \nmodels project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based \nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot \nprices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency \nsecurities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, \nand municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain over-the-counter forward, \noption, and swap contracts.  \n• \nLevel 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that \nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using \nmodel-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 \nassets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill \nand intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable \ninputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.  \nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these \ninvestments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted \nmarket prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.  \nInventories  \nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, \nand manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated \nselling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on \nhand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a \nreduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  \nProperty and Equipment  \nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method \nover the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and \nequipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; \ncomputer equipment, two to four years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to \n20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.  \nLeases  \nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use \n(―ROU‖) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases \nare included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance \nsheets.  \nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation \nto make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at \ncommencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not \nprovide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for \ncollateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU \nasset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to \nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease \npayments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term."

For \ncertain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease \ncomponent. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the \noperating lease ROU assets and liabilities.  \nGoodwill  \nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) \non an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more \nlikely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  \nIntangible Assets  \nOur intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated \nperiod of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking \ninto account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be \nimpaired.  \nRecent Accounting Guidance  \nAccounting for Income Taxes  \nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for \nincome taxes. The guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the \nmethodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside \nbasis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. The guidance \nalso simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the \naccounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. We adopted the standard effective July 1, \n2021. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  \nNOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE  \nBasic earnings per share (―EPS‖) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock \noutstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common \nstock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. \nDilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.  \nThe components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:  \n  \n(In millions, except earnings per share) \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nYear Ended June 30, \n2022 \n2021\n2020 \n \n \n \n \nNet income available for common shareholders (A) \n$ 72,738 $ 61,271 $ 44,281 \n \n \n \n \nWeighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) \n \n7,496  \n7,547  \n7,610 \nDilutive effect of stock-based awards \n \n44  \n61  \n73 \n  \n  \n  \nCommon stock and common stock equivalents (C) \n \n7,540  \n7,608  \n7,683 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nEarnings Per Share \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nBasic (A/B) \n$ \n9.70 $ \n8.12 $ \n5.82 \nDiluted (A/C) \n$ \n9.65 $ \n8.05 $ \n5.76 \n  \nAnti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods \npresented."

Our objectives for holding derivatives include \nreducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our \nderivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  \nForeign Currencies  \nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign \ncurrency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.  \nForeign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange \nforward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-\ndenominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging \ninstruments.  \nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign \nexchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.  \nInterest Rate  \nInterest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value \nhedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates."

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal \nyear 2020 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing \nour products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, and tax benefits \nrelating to stock-based compensation.

      "text": "76 \n  \nAs of June 30, 2022, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet \ncommenced of $7.2 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively. These operating and finance leases will commence between \nfiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2028 with lease terms of 1 year to 18 years.  \nNOTE 15 — CONTINGENCIES  \nAntitrust Litigation and Claims  \nChina State Administration for Market Regulation Investigation  \nIn 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Agency for Market Regulation (―SAMR‖) (formerly State Administration \nfor Industry and Commerce) had begun a formal investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAMR \nconducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. In 2019, the SAMR \npresented preliminary views as to certain possible violations of China’s Anti-Monopoly Law.  \nProduct-Related Litigation  \nU.S. Cell Phone Litigation  \nMicrosoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a \ndefendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs \nwho allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We \nassumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have \nbeen substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial \nproceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. \nFederal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (―FCC Guidelines‖) are pre-empted by federal \nlaw. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the \nFCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and \ntesting around emission guidelines.  \nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on \nthe basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ \nmotion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of \nColumbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court \nof Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial \ncourt for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which \nthe defendants have moved to strike. In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs’ \nexpert reports. A hearing on general causation is scheduled for September of 2022.  \nOther Contingencies  \nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our \nbusiness. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not \nhave a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent \nuncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.  \nAs of June 30, 2022, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $364 million. While we intend to defend these matters \nvigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded \namounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material \nadverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable."

We are a public accounting firm registered with the \nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities \nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material \nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material \nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those \nrisks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made \nby management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits \nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  \nCritical Audit Matters  \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements \nthat were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or \ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex \njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, \ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the \ncritical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate."

The Company \noffers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, \nin its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs.  \nSignificant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, \nand includes the following:  \n• \nDetermination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be \naccounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-\nbased services.  \n• \nThe pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.  \n• \nIdentification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., \nvariable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).  \n• \nDetermination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that \nare not sold separately.  \nGiven these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management’s judgments \nin determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor \njudgment.  \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit  \nOur principal audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the \nfollowing:  \n• \nWe tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the \ndetermination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.  \n• \nWe evaluated management’s significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for \nreasonableness.  \n• \nWe selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:  \n- \nObtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents \nthat were part of the agreement.  \n- \nTested management’s identification and treatment of contract terms.  \n- \nAssessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management’s application of \ntheir accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.  \n• \nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services \nthat are not sold separately.  \n• \nWe tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue \nrecognized in the financial statements."

The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS \naudit, for tax years subsequent to 2003.

Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain \nunresolved with the IRS, evaluating management’s estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions \nrequired extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.  \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit  \nOur principal audit procedures to evaluate management’s estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved \ntransfer pricing issues included the following:  \n• \nWe evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions used in the \nidentification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the \neffectiveness of the related internal controls.  \n• \nWe read and evaluated management’s documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information \nobtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.  \n• \nWe tested the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax \npositions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.  \n• \nFor those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had \nappropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure \nof the uncertain tax positions.  \n• \nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes, \nregulations and case law, impacted management’s judgments.  \n/S/    DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP  \nSeattle, Washington  \nJuly 28, 2022  \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1983."
