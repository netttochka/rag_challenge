The Company has also reported adjusted EBITDA of +$2.2mil. \nThe growth was largely driven by the expansion of the Company’s Platform and Managed Trading Services offering under the \nGlobal Betting Services division; the expansion of content distribution rights and delivery to licensed wagering operators under \nits Global Racing Network division; and the full year recognition of revenues associated with the acquisition of the racing and \ndigital assets acquired from Sportech PLC on 17 June 2021 as a part of the Global Tote division. \nFinishing the year with an annualised run-rate revenue in excess of $100 million1 places the Company in a strong position for \nfuture growth. \nPEOPLE \nIn FY22, BetMakers invested in the development and growth of its team and will start the new year with almost 500 employees. \nThe culmination of this growth in talented people across geographies has given the Company the ability to successfully \nexecute on the foundations that have been built – and the deals that have been executed –  over the past number of years.   \nKey appointments for FY22 included the addition of two new Board members, Rebekah Giles and Anna Massion. These \nappointments were made in line with BetMakers’ intentions to ensure highest levels of governance with a board composition \nthat is diverse in its skillset and is aligned with the Company’s global strategy.  \nDuring the year, the Company appointed former Caesars senior executive Christian Stuart to the key role of Chief Executive \nOfficer of North America to help drive opportunities throughout this important market. \nIn addition, BetMakers also added to its Key Executive team across Legal and Technology with the appointments of former \nRacing Queensland Acting CEO Sam Adams (Chief Legal Officer) and highly experienced wagering executive Dan McDonald \n(Chief Digital Officer). \n \n \n1 Annualised run-rate revenue based on Q4 revenue.  \nFor personal use only"

This section outlines some of the key risks identified by the Group. They are not listed in order or \nimportance or likelihood to materialise. \n \nRisk Area \nDescription \nLicensing and \nRegulatory \nThe Group operates in heavily regulated industries and jurisdictions. Accordingly, there is an exposure \nto a range of risks relating to compliance with, changes to, or uncertainty in, the relevant legal and \nregulatory regimes in those jurisdictions. Changes to laws and regulations or failure to comply may have \na material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position and prospects, or lead to license \nsuspension or cancellation. \nThe Group’s contracts with customers may require approval or consent of one or more Australian or \nforeign governments, gambling regulators or other regulators. There is a risk that such approval or \nconsent may not be granted and, in such circumstances, the Group or the customer may become unable \nto comply with contractual obligations, potentially having a material adverse impact on financial \nperformance.  \nTechnology and \nSoftware \nThe Group’s business is based largely on the software, source code, technology and computer \nprograms which comprise of its online wagering platforms.  There is a risk that this technology and/or \nsoftware may be superseded or displaced in the market by new technology offerings or software which \ncustomers perceive have advantages over the Group’s offerings. Furthermore, the Group’s systems can \nbe affected by numerous factors including but not limited to data losses, computer system faults, failure \nof or suspension from key data feeds, data network failures, and catastrophic event such as natural \ndisaster, computer viruses of power failure. \nIntellectual Property \nand Obligations \nThere is a risk that failure or inability to protect intellectual property rights may have a significant adverse \neffect on operations, financial performance and competitive advantage. Further, there is a risk that \noperations, products, services or platforms may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. If \nany claim or litigation is brought against the Group which alleges an infringement on another party’s \nintellectual property rights, this could result in the Group being subject to significant liability for damages \nor losing the right to use the intellectual property. \nSecurity Software, \nTechnology \nBreaches and \nImproper Access to \nPersonal Data \nBy their nature, information technology systems are susceptible to cyber-attacks with third parties \nseeking unauthorised access to data, networks, systems and databases. Further, third party suppliers \nmay receive and store information from the Group or its customers and although this information is \nlimited and subject to confidentiality obligations, if third party suppliers fail to adopt or adhere to robust \nsecurity practices, any such information may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.  \nReliance on \nAgreements with \nSports and Racing \nControlling Bodies \nThe Group has in place various approvals and authorities granted by racing controlling bodies which \npermits the publishing and/or use of relevant race field information associated with those racing \ncontrolling bodies. There is a requirement to comply with certain terms and conditions, provisions, rules \nand regulations provided under the relevant State/Territory laws.  Under such legislation, rules and \nregulations, the racing controlling bodies have the discretion to determine the types of bets the Group \nis permitted to take.  A removal of one or more of these bet types may materially adversely affect \nbusiness operations and financial position. \nFor personal use only"

The buy-back commenced \non 12 July 2022. At the time of this report, the company had purchased 1,572,022 ordinary shares at an average price of \n$0.385 per share. \n \nOn 12 August 2022 the company announced that it had entered into a deed of variation to amend the contract with NTD Pty \nLimited to provide technology and services to the new NTD wagering venture. In addition, NTD has agreed to purchase certain \nassets pertaining to the wagering business owned and operated by O’Shea Bookmaking Pty Ltd (trading as “TexBet”) with \nBetMakers’ support. Under the amended terms, the company will increase the Annual Fee payable by NTD to OM Apps by \n$2 million per annum, BetMakers will contribute a total of $2.5 million over two tranches towards the purchase of TexBet by \nNTD.  \n \nNo other matter or circumstance has arisen since 30 June 2022 that has significantly affected, or may significantly affect the \nGroup's operations, the results of those operations, or the Group's state of affairs in future financial years. \n \n \n \n \nFor personal use only"

General information \n  \nThe financial statements cover BetMakers Technology Group Ltd as a group consisting of BetMakers Technology Group Ltd \n(the 'company' or 'parent entity') and the entities it controlled at the end of, or during, the year (referred to in these financial \nstatements as the 'group'). The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is BetMakers Technology \nGroup Ltd's functional and presentation currency. \n  \nBetMakers Technology Group Ltd is a listed public company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. Its \nregistered office and principal place of business is: \n  \nSuite 19, Level 2 \n50 Glebe Road \nThe Junction, NSW 2291 \n  \nA description of the nature of the group's operations and its principal activities are included in the directors' report, which is \nnot part of the financial statements. \n  \nThe financial statements were authorised for issue, in accordance with a resolution of directors, on 26 August 2022. \n  \nNote 2. Significant accounting policies \n  \nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out either in the respective \nnotes or below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. \n  \nNew or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted \nThe group has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian \nAccounting Standards Board ('AASB') that are mandatory for the current reporting period. The adoption of these Accounting \nStandards and Interpretations did not have any significant impact on the financial performance or position of the group during \nthe financial year. \n  \nAny new or amended Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted. \n  \nBasis of preparation \nThese general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and \nInterpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') and the Corporations Act 2001, as appropriate \nfor for-profit oriented entities. These financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards as \nissued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB'). \n  \nHistorical cost convention \nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for, where applicable, deferred \nconsideration liability.  \n  \nCritical accounting estimates \nThe preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires \nmanagement to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group's accounting policies. The areas involving a \nhigher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial \nstatements, are disclosed in note 3. \n  \nParent entity information \nIn accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, these financial statements present the results of the group only. \nSupplementary information about the parent entity is disclosed in note 28. \n  \nPrinciples of consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of BetMakers Technology Group \nLtd as at 30 June 2022 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended. \n  \nSubsidiaries are all those entities over which the group has control. The group controls an entity when the group is exposed \nto, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its \npower to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to \nthe group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. \n  \nFor personal use only"

Significant accounting policies (continued) \n  \n  \n31 \nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the group are eliminated. \nUnrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. \nAccounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by \nthe group. \n  \nThe acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. A change in ownership interest, \nwithout the loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, where the difference between the consideration \ntransferred and the book value of the share of the non-controlling interest acquired is recognised directly in equity attributable \nto the parent. \n  \nWhere the group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets including goodwill, liabilities and non-controlling \ninterest in the subsidiary together with any cumulative translation differences recognised in equity. The group recognises the \nfair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained together with any gain or reduction in \nprofit or loss. \n  \nForeign currency translation \nThe financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is BetMakers Technology Group Ltd's functional and \npresentation currency. \n  \nForeign currency transactions \nForeign currency transactions are translated into the company's functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at \nthe dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from \nthe translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are \nrecognised in profit or loss. \n  \nForeign operations \nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting \ndate. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the average exchange \nrates, which approximate the rates at the dates of the transactions, for the period. All resulting foreign exchange differences \nare recognised in other comprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in equity. \n  \nThe foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of. \n  \nRevenue recognition \nRevenue from contracts with customers \nRevenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the group is expected to be entitled in exchange \nfor transferring goods or services to a customer. For each contract with a customer, the group: identifies the contract with a \ncustomer; identifies the performance obligations in the contract; determines the transaction price which takes into account \nestimates of variable consideration and the time value of money; allocates the transaction price to the separate performance \nobligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service to be delivered; and \nrecognises revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied in a manner that depicts the transfer to the customer \nof the goods or services promised. \n  \nVariable consideration within the transaction price, if any, reflects concessions provided to the customer such as discounts, \nrebates and refunds, any potential bonuses receivable from the customer and any other contingent events. Such estimates \nare determined using either the 'expected value' or 'most likely amount' method. The measurement of variable consideration \nis subject to a constraining principle whereby revenue will only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a \nsignificant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. The measurement constraint continues \nuntil the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Amounts received that are subject \nto the constraining principle are recognised as a refund liability. \n  \nGlobal Racing Network  \nGlobal Racing Network ('GRN') revenue is recognised in the profit or loss once the service has been rendered. The provision \nof GRN services includes working with racing bodies and rights holders to produce and distribute racing content. Revenue \nis derived as a percentage of turnover derived from the racing content. Revenue is therefore recognised in-line with the \ndelivery of services, based on the contracted fee or reported turnover. \n  \nFor personal use only"

The provision \nof GBS includes the provision of racing data to customers, the provision of analytical tools to assist in consuming racing data \nand wagering products to bookmakers such as platforms and managed trading services.

All other liabilities \nare classified as non-current. \n  \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current. \n  \nLease make good provision \nA provision has been made for the present value of anticipated costs for future restoration of leased premises. The provision \nincludes future cost estimates associated with closure of the premises. The calculation of this provision requires assumptions \nsuch as application of closure dates and cost estimates. The provision recognised for each site is periodically reviewed and \nupdated based on the facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes to the estimated future costs for sites are \nrecognised in the statement of financial position by adjusting the asset and the provision. Reductions in the provision that \nexceed the carrying amount of the asset will be recognised in profit or loss. \n  \nGoods and Services Tax ('GST') and other similar taxes \nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not \nrecoverable from the tax authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of the acquisition of the asset or as part of \nthe expense. \n  \nReceivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST \nrecoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included in other receivables or other payables in the statement of \nfinancial position. \n  \nCash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities \nwhich are recoverable from, or payable to the tax authority, are presented as operating cash flows. \n  \nCommitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority. \n  \nFor personal use only"

      "text": "BetMakers Technology Group Ltd \nNotes to the financial statements \n30 June 2022 \n  \nNote 2. Significant accounting policies (continued) \n  \n  \n33 \nRounding of amounts \nThe company is of a kind referred to in Corporations Instrument 2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and \nInvestments Commission, relating to 'rounding-off'. Amounts in this report have been rounded off in accordance with that \nCorporations Instrument to the nearest thousand dollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar. \n  \nNew Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted \nAustralian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, \nhave not been early adopted by the group for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2022. The group's assessment of \nthe impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations, most relevant to the group, are set out below. \n  \nAmending accounting standards issued are not considered to have a significant impact on the financial statements of the \ngroup as their amendments provide either clarification of existing accounting treatment or editorial amendments. \n  \nAASB 2020-1 Classification of liabilities as current or non-current \nAASB 2020-1 was issued in March 2020 and is applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, as \nextended by AASB 2020-6. Early adoption is permitted. This standard amends AASB 101 ‘Presentation of Financial \nStatements’ to clarify requirements for the presentation of liabilities in the statement of financial position as current or \nnoncurrent. The amendments clarify that a liability is classified as non-current if an entity has the right at the end of the \nreporting period to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. If the deferral right is \nconditional, the right only exists if, at the end of the reporting period, those conditions have been complied with. Classification \nof a liability as non-current is unaffected by the likelihood that the entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of the liability \nfor at least 12 months after the reporting date or even if the entity settles the liability prior to issue of the financial statements. \nThe meaning of settlement of a liability is also clarified. \n  \nNote 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions \n  \nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that \naffect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in \nrelation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and \nassumptions on historical experience and on other various factors, including expectations of future events, management \nbelieves to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal \nthe related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material \nadjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within the next financial year are \ndiscussed below. \n  \nCOVID-19 \nJudgement has been exercised in considering the impacts that COVID-19 has had, or may have, on the group based on \nknown information. This consideration extends to the nature of the products and services offered, customers, supply chain, \nstaffing and geographic regions in which the group operates. Other than as addressed in specific notes, there does not \ncurrently appear to be either any significant impact upon the financial statements or any significant uncertainties with respect \nto events or conditions which may impact the group unfavourably as at the reporting date or subsequently as a result of \nCOVID-19. \n  \nShare-based payment transactions \nThe group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees and third parties by reference to the fair value of \nthe equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by using either the Binomial or \nBlack-Scholes model, depending on the equity-settled transaction, and takes into account the terms and conditions upon \nwhich the instruments were granted. The accounting estimates and assumptions relating to equity-settled share-based \npayments would have no impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period but \nmay impact profit or loss and equity. \n  \nAllowance for expected credit losses \nThe allowance for expected credit losses assessment requires a degree of estimation and judgement. It is based on the \nlifetime expected credit loss, grouped based on days overdue, and makes assumptions to allocate an overall expected credit \nloss rate for each group. These assumptions include recent sales experience, historical collection rates, the impact of COVID-\n19 and forward-looking information that is available. The allowance for expected credit losses, as disclosed in note 9, is \ncalculated based on the information available at the time of preparation. The actual credit losses in future years may be \nhigher or lower. \n  \nFor personal use only"

      "text": "BetMakers Technology Group Ltd \nNotes to the financial statements \n30 June 2022 \n  \nNote 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued) \n  \n  \n34 \nGoodwill \nThe group tests annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment, whether goodwill \nhas suffered any impairment, in accordance with the stated accounting policy. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating \nunits have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of assumptions, including \nestimated discount rates based on the current cost of capital and growth rates of the estimated future cash flows. \n  \nIncome tax \nThe group is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgement is required in determining \nthe provision for income tax. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business \nfor which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based \non the group's current understanding of the tax law. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the carrying \namounts, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is \nmade. Refer to note 7 for further details.   \n  \nRecovery of deferred tax assets \nDeferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses and deductible temporary differences only if the group considers it is \nprobable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses, and that the company \ncontinues to meet the Same Business Test and Similar Business Test rules as applicable. With changes to corporate tax \nrates in Australia in future financial years, there is judgement regarding the tax rate expected to apply when assets are \nrecovered. \n  \nDuring the year, the group incurred a net loss after tax of $89,234,000 (2021: $17,459,000) and net operating cash outflows \nof $18,224,000 (2021: outflows of $2,023,000). The company has prepared cash flow forecasts as at 30 June 2022 to \ndetermine the recoverability of the group’s intangibles and deferred tax assets. \n  \nThe key assumptions underlying these forecasts are as follows: \n● \nLaunch of fixed odds wagering in the USA; \n● \nContinuation of existing domestic operations and expansion of associated revenues (including the NTD platform); and \n● \nThe successful expansion of the global racing network. \n  \nDeferred consideration \nThe deferred consideration liability is the difference between the total purchase consideration, usually on an acquisition of a \nbusiness combination or assets, and the amounts paid or settled up to the reporting date, discounted to net present value. \nThe group applies provisional accounting for any business combination. Any reassessment of the liability during the earlier \nof the finalisation of the provisional accounting or 12 months from acquisition-date is adjusted for retrospectively as part of \nthe provisional accounting rules in accordance with AASB 3 'Business Combinations'. Thereafter, at each reporting date, the \ndeferred consideration liability is reassessed against revised estimates and any increase or decrease in the net present value \nof the liability will result in a corresponding gain or loss to profit or loss. The increase in the liability resulting from the passage \nof time is recognised as a finance cost. \n  \nPerformance payments \nManagement makes estimates and judgements as part of calculating the performance payment liabilities accounted for at \nreporting date. Any reassessment of the liability during the earlier of the finalisation of the provisional accounting or 12 months \nfrom acquisition-date is adjusted for retrospectively as part of the provisional accounting rules in accordance with AASB 3 \n'Business Combinations'. Thereafter, at each reporting date, the performance payment liability is reassessed against revised \nestimates and any increase or decrease in the net present value of the liability will result in a corresponding gain or loss to \nprofit or loss. Refer to note 28 for performance payment liabilities accounted for at reporting date. \n  \nRetirement benefit obligation \nThe group operates a defined benefits pension scheme. A liability or asset in respect of defined benefit superannuation plans \nis recognised in the statement of financial position, and is measured at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at \nthe reporting date less the fair value of the superannuation fund's assets at that date and any unrecognised past service \ncost. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is based on expected future payments which arise from membership \nof the fund to the reporting date, calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. \nConsideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. \n  \nFor personal use only"

Intangibles (continued) \n  \n  \n48 \nSensitivity analysis \nAs disclosed in note 3, the directors have made judgements and estimates about the future in respect of impairment testing \nof goodwill. Should these judgements and estimates not occur as approximated, the resulting goodwill carrying amount may \ndecrease. The sensitivities of the carrying value of goodwill to such judgements and estimates are as follows: \n● \nExpected revenues from the three operating segments would need to decrease in excess of 15% in the cash flow \nmodelling before goodwill and the intangible assets noted above would become impaired, with all other assumptions \nremaining constant. \n  \nThe Board believes that other reasonable changes in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount of goodwill is \nbased would not cause the recoverable amount to fall below the carrying amount. \n  \nAccounting policy for goodwill \nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortised. Instead, goodwill is tested annually for impairment, \nor more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less \naccumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are taken to profit or loss and are not subsequently reversed. \n  \nIntellectual property \nIntellectual property primarily consists of the cost of acquiring the software code for the wholesale wagering business. \nSignificant costs associated with the acquisition of additional intellectual property are deferred and amortised on a straight-\nline basis over the period of their expected benefit, being their finite life of five years.   \n  \nCustomer contracts \nCustomer contracts acquired in a business combination are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their \nexpected benefit, being their finite life of fifteen years. \n  \nSoftware \nSignificant costs associated with software purchases are deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of \ntheir expected benefit, being their finite life of five years. \n  \nAccounting policy for impairment of other non-financial assets \nOther non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the \ncarrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying \namount exceeds its recoverable amount. \n  \nRecoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. The value-in-use is the \npresent value of the estimated future cash flows relating to the asset using a pre-tax discount rate specific to the asset or \ncash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Assets that do not have independent cash flows are grouped together to \nform a cash-generating unit. \n  \nNote 13.

The carrying amounts are remeasured \nif there is a change in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate used; residual \nguarantee; lease term; certainty of a purchase option and termination penalties.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present \nobligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.

This scheme is administered by an \ninsurance company in the US and provides retirement benefits to employees who are members of a collective bargaining \nunit represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

Retirement benefit obligations (continued) \n  \n  \n54 \nUnder the adopted mortality tables, if the future life expectancy were to be decreased by one year the liabilities would \ndecrease by US$11,851 (2021: US$11,645). \n  \nIf the discount rate were to be increased to 5.25% (2021: 3.25%) the liabilities would decrease by US$195,988 (2021: \nUS$283,787). \n  \nThe qualified actuaries that valued the scheme are The Prudential Insurance Company. \n  \nRisk exposure \nThrough the defined benefits plan, the group is exposed to a number of risks. The significant risks are detailed below: \n  \nAsset volatility \nThe plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to the Pru Above Mean Curve; If plan assets \nunderperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The US pension scheme assets are invested in a guaranteed return fund. \nThe plan purchases annuities under the GR-03607 contract at retirement. Under this contract, annuities are purchased based \non a table of fixed factors that are not subject to the rate environment at retirement, which removes volatility and risk on asset \nvalues. \n  \nChanges in the Pru Above Mean Curve \nA decrease in the Above Mean Curve will increase plan liabilities. \n  \nLife Expectancy \nThe plan’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an \nincrease in the plans’ liabilities. \n  \nAccounting policy for retirement benefit obligations \nThe group operates various pension schemes. \n  \nThe group has a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section within its plan. A defined contribution plan is a \npension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The group pays contributions to privately \nadministered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The contributions are recognised as \nan employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash \nrefund or a reduction in future payments is available.  \n  \nThe defined benefit section provides defined lump sum benefits based on years of service and final average salary.  \n  \nA liability or asset in respect of defined benefit superannuation plans is recognised in the statement of financial position, and \nis measured at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of the \nsuperannuation fund's assets at that date and any unrecognised past service cost. The present value of the defined benefit \nobligation is based on expected future payments which arise from membership of the fund to the reporting date, calculated \nannually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage \nand salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. \n  \nExpected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds with \nterms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. \n  \nActuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised, in the \nperiod in which they occur, in other comprehensive income. \n  \nPast service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the changes to the superannuation fund are conditional \non the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time ('the vesting period'). In this case, the past service costs \nare amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. \n  \nFor personal use only"

Based on this exposure, had the \nAustralian dollars weakened by 5%/strengthened by 5% (2021: weakened by 5%/strengthened by 5%) against these foreign \ncurrencies with all other variables held constant, the group's profit before tax for the year would have been $24,700 \nlower/$24,700 higher (2021: $28,000 lower/$28,000 higher). The percentage change is the expected overall volatility of the \nsignificant currencies, which is based on management's assessment of reasonable possible fluctuations taking into \nconsideration movements over the last 12 months and the spot rate at each reporting date.

Indicators of this include \nthe failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan, no active enforcement activity and a failure to make contractual \npayments for a period greater than 1 year. \n  \nThe group has adopted a lifetime expected loss allowance in estimating expected credit losses to trade receivables through \nthe use of a provisions matrix using fixed rates of credit loss provisioning.

It is measured at the present value of the estimated liability. The fair \nvalue of contingent consideration is calculated on the expected future cash outflows. Generally, the contingent consideration \nis a performance based payment. These are reviewed at the reporting date to provide the expected future cash outflows for \neach contract. Upon completion of the review the future cash outflows are then discounted to present value using the group’s \nincremental borrowing rate. \n  \nFor personal use only"

For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement is based on its highest and \nbest use. Valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to \nmeasure fair value, are used, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable \ninputs. \n  \nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified into three levels, using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the \nsignificance of the inputs used in making the measurements. Classifications are reviewed at each reporting date and transfers \nbetween levels are determined based on a reassessment of the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value \nmeasurement. \n  \nFor recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements, external valuers may be used when internal expertise is either not \navailable or when the valuation is deemed to be significant. External valuers are selected based on market knowledge and \nreputation. Where there is a significant change in fair value of an asset or liability from one period to another, an analysis is \nundertaken, which includes a verification of the major inputs applied in the latest valuation and a comparison, where \napplicable, with external sources of data. \n  \nFor personal use only"

These entities, and their 100% \nowned subsidiaries, are the Racing, Tote and Digital operations formerly owned by Sportech PLC.

As part of the transaction consideration, the group and \nSportech PLC are to review the completion balance sheet and make requisite payments for the net debt and net working \ncapital position. As at 30 June 2022, the group paid the remaining net payment to Sportech PLC of $5,741,000 (refer to note \n13 and note 23).  \n  \nThe values identified in relation to the acquisition of Sportech have now been finalised. This has resulted in an increase in \nsoftware by $6,859,000 and an increase in customer contracts by $10,000,000. As a result, goodwill on acquisition decreased \nby $16,092,000.

To determine whether a set of activities and \nassets constitutes a business, the group has the choice to apply a ‘concentration test’, which is met if substantially all of the \nfair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. \nAlternatively, to determine if a business has been acquired, the group assesses whether (as a minimum) an input and \nsubstantive process has been acquired and whether there is an ability to produce outputs from these. \n  \nThe consideration transferred is the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred, equity instruments \nissued or liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the amount of any non-controlling interest \nin the acquiree. For each business combination, the non-controlling interest in the acquiree is measured at either fair value \nor at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred to profit \nor loss. \n  \nOn the acquisition of a business, the group assesses the financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed for appropriate \nclassification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic conditions, the group's operating or \naccounting policies and other pertinent conditions in existence at the acquisition-date. \n  \nFor personal use only"

Share-based payments \n  \nShares are granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan ('LTIP'), which has been established by the group. Subject to the \nASX listing rules and under the terms of the LTIP, the Board may grant options and/or performance rights (options with a \nzero exercise price and performance conditions) and/or service rights (options with a zero exercise price and only service \nconditions) to eligible participants (‘awards’). Each award granted represents a right to receive one share once the award \nvests and is exercised by the relevant participant. The vesting of the options are contingent upon various company \nperformance and term-of-service metrics. \n  \nFor personal use only"

No account is taken of any other vesting conditions. \n  \nThe cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting \nperiod. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the best estimate \nof the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. The amount recognised in profit \nor loss for the period is the cumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts already recognised in previous \nperiods. \n  \nFor personal use only"

If the condition is not within the control of the group or employee and is not satisfied during the vesting period, \nany remaining expense for the award is recognised over the remaining vesting period, unless the award is forfeited. \n  \nIf equity-settled awards are cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any remaining expense \nis recognised immediately. If a new replacement award is substituted for the cancelled award, the cancelled and new award \nis treated as if they were a modification. \n  \nNote 35. Events after the reporting period \n  \nThe group announced the intention to undertake an on-market share buy-back on 24 June 2022. The buy-back commenced \non 12 July 2022. At the time of this report, the company had purchased 1,572,022 ordinary shares at an average price of \n$0.385 per share. \n  \nOn 12 August 2022, the company announced that it had entered into a deed of variation to amend the contract with NTD Pty \nLimited to provide technology and services to the new NTD wagering venture.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit \nconducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement \nwhen it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individual or \nin aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on \nthe basis of this financial report. \n \nAs part of an audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional \njudgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n \n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud \nor error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence \nthat is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material \nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve \ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \n \n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \neffectiveness of the consolidated entity’s internal control. \n \n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and other related disclosures made by the Directors. \n \n• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the consolidated entity’s ability to continue as a going \nconcern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our \nauditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, \nto modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of \nour auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the consolidated entity to cease \nto continue as a going concern. \n \n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the \ndisclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a \nmanner that achieves fair presentation. \n \nFor personal use only"
