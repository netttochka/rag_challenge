      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nPART I\nItem 1.  Business.\nSonic Automotive, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1997. References to “Sonic,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” used throughout this Annual Report on Form\n10-K refer to Sonic Automotive, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We are one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States (the “U.S.”) (as measured by reported total revenue).\nAs a result of the way we manage our business, we had three reportable segments as of December 31, 2022: (1) the Franchised Dealerships Segment; (2) the EchoPark Segment;\nand (3) the Powersports Segment. For management and operational reporting purposes, we group certain businesses together that share management and inventory (principally\nused vehicles) into “stores.” As of December 31, 2022, we operated 111 stores in the Franchised Dealerships Segment, 52 stores in the EchoPark Segment, and eight stores in the\nPowersports Segment. The Franchised Dealerships Segment consists of 142 new vehicle franchises (representing 28 different brands of cars and light trucks) and 17 collision\nrepair centers in 18 states.\nReportable Segments\nThe Franchised Dealerships Segment provides comprehensive sales and services, including: (1) sales of both new and used cars and light trucks; (2) sales of replacement\nparts and performance of vehicle maintenance, manufacturer warranty repairs, and paint and collision repair services (collectively, “Fixed Operations”); and (3) arrangement of\nthird-party financing, extended warranties, service contracts, insurance and other aftermarket products (collectively, “finance and insurance” or “F&I”) for our guests. The\nEchoPark Segment sells used cars and light trucks and arranges third-party F&I product sales for our guests in pre-owned vehicle specialty retail locations, and does not offer\ncustomer-facing Fixed Operations services. The Powersports Segment offers guests: (1) sales of both new and used powersports vehicles (such as motorcycles, personal watercraft\nand all-terrain vehicles); (2) Fixed Operations activities; and (3) F&I services. All three segments generally operate independently of one another, with the exception of certain\nshared back-office functions and corporate overhead costs.\nThe majority of our revenue is related to our Franchised Dealerships Segment. In 2022, EchoPark Segment revenue represented approximately 17.6% of total revenue\n(compared to 18.9% in 2021). In 2022, Powersports Segment revenue represented approximately 0.4% of total revenue (compared to 0.0% in 2021) as a result of two business\nacquisitions during the year. See Note 14, “Segment Information,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional financial information regarding our three\nreportable segments.\nAcquisition of RFJ Auto\nOn December 6, 2021, Sonic completed the acquisition of RFJ Auto Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “RFJ Auto”). In connection with the acquisition of RFJ\nAuto (the “RFJ Acquisition”), Sonic acquired, 33 automotive retail locations in seven states and a portfolio of 16 automotive brands. Beginning on December 6, 2021, the results\nof our Franchised Dealerships Segment include 22 stores acquired in the RFJ Acquisition and our EchoPark Segment include 11 Northwest Motorsport pre-owned vehicle stores\nacquired in the RFJ Acquisition.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic began negatively impacting the global economy in the first quarter of 2020 and continued to affect the global economy and supply chain\nthroughout 2022. The pandemic has affected both consumer demand and the global supply of automobiles and automobile parts, increasing demand for vehicles at times, while\nalso negatively impacting automobile manufacturers' ability to produce enough inventory to meet demand.\nThe global automotive supply chain has been significantly disrupted since the onset of the pandemic, primarily related to the production of semiconductors that are used in\nmany components of new vehicles, in addition to workforce-related production delays and stoppages. As a result, automobile manufacturing has operated at lower than usual\nproduction levels since the first quarter of 2020, reducing the amount of new vehicle inventory and certain parts inventory available to our dealerships. These inventory\nconstraints, coupled with strong consumer demand, have led to low new and used vehicle inventory and a high new and used vehicle pricing environment, which has driven retail\nnew vehicle unit sales volumes lower across the industry since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. New vehicle and certain parts production levels began to improve in late\n2022; however, there is a risk that higher production levels and new vehicle inventory on hand may not result in incremental retail new vehicle sales volume, which could result\nin vehicle price discounts that could adversely impact our revenues and other financial results.\n1"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nIn the future, we may acquire dealerships or open new stores that we believe will strengthen our brand portfolio and divest dealerships or close stores that we believe will\nnot yield acceptable returns over the long term. The retail automotive industry remains highly fragmented, and we believe that further consolidation may occur. We believe that\nattractive acquisition opportunities continue to exist for dealership groups with the capital and experience to identify, acquire and integrate new dealership acquisitions. Our\nability to complete acquisitions and open new stores in the future will depend on many factors, including the availability of financing and the existence of any contractual\nprovisions that may restrict our acquisition activity.\nSee “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a discussion of our plans for\nthe use of capital generated from operations.\nBusiness Strategy\nMaintain Diverse Revenue Streams. We have multiple diverse revenue streams among our three operating segments. In addition to new automobile sales, our revenue\nsources include used automobile sales (including through our EchoPark Segment), which we believe are generally less sensitive to economic cycles and other factors that may\naffect new automobile sales. Our Powersports Segment further diversifies our vehicle sales offerings to include motorcycles, personal watercraft and all-terrain vehicles. Our\nFixed Operations sales carry a higher gross margin than new and used vehicle sales and generally are not as sensitive to economic conditions as new or used vehicle sales. We\nalso offer guests assistance in obtaining third-party financing and a range of automobile-related warranty, insurance and other aftermarket products.\nExecute Our EchoPark Expansion Plan. We have developed a diversified business model by augmenting our manufacturer-franchised dealership operations with our\nEchoPark pre-owned vehicle specialty retail business. Our EchoPark business generally operates independently from our franchised dealerships business (except for certain\nshared back-office functions and corporate overhead costs) and offers consumers a modern omnichannel guest experience and a wide selection of quality pre-owned vehicle\ninventory at low prices. Sales operations for EchoPark began in the fourth quarter of 2014, and, as of December 31, 2022, we operated 52 stores in the EchoPark Segment in 21\nstates. Under our current EchoPark growth strategy, we plan to continue to enhance our nationwide EchoPark distribution network, which is expected to reach 90% of the U.S.\npopulation by 2025.\nExpand Our Omnichannel Capabilities. Automotive consumers have become increasingly more comfortable using technology to research their vehicle buying\nalternatives, communicate with store personnel, and complete a portion or all of a vehicle purchase online. The internet presents a marketing, advertising and sales channel that\nwe will continue to utilize to drive value for our stores and enhance the guest experience. Our existing platforms give us the ability to leverage new technology to integrate\nsystems, customize our dealership websites and use our data to improve the effectiveness of our advertising and interaction with our guests. These platforms also allow us to\nmarket all of our products and services to a national audience and, at the same time, support the local market penetration of our individual stores.\nFocus on the Guest Experience. We focus on providing a high-quality guest experience and maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction. Our personalized sales\nprocess is designed to appeal to our guests by providing high-quality vehicles and service through a positive, “guest-centric” experience. Several manufacturers offer specific\nfinancial incentives on a per vehicle basis if certain Customer Satisfaction Index (“CSI”) levels (which vary by manufacturer) are achieved by a dealership. In addition, all\nmanufacturers consider CSI scores in approving acquisitions or awarding new dealership open points. To keep dealership and executive management focused on customer\nsatisfaction, we include CSI results as a component of our incentive-based compensation programs for certain groups of associates and executive management.\nTrain, Develop and Retain Our Teammates. We believe our teammates are the cornerstone of our business and crucial to our financial success. Our goal is to develop our\nteammates and foster an environment where our teammates can contribute and grow with the Company. Teammate satisfaction is very important to us, and we believe a high\nlevel of teammate satisfaction reduces turnover and enhances our guests’ experience at our stores by pairing our guests with well-trained support personnel. We believe that our\ncomprehensive training of our teammates provides us with an advantage over other competitors in retaining talent and providing a high-quality guest experience.\nOptimize Our Capital Structure. As we generate cash through operations, we may opportunistically repurchase our Class A Common Stock or our outstanding debt in\nopen-market or structured transactions to maintain our targeted capital structure.\n3"

We have developed standardized operating processes that are documented in operating playbooks for our stores.\nThrough the continued implementation of our operating playbooks, we believe organic growth opportunities exist by offering a more favorable buying experience to our guests\nand creating efficiencies in our business processes. We believe the development, refinement and implementation of these operating processes will enhance the guest experience,\nmake us more competitive in the markets we serve and drive profit growth across each of our revenue streams.\nOptimize Our Brand Portfolio. Our long-term growth and acquisition strategy is primarily focused on acquiring desirable businesses in markets that meet certain strategic\ncriteria for population growth and vehicle registration rates, among other considerations. A majority of our franchised dealerships are either luxury or mid-line import brands. For\n2022, approximately 82.7% of our total new vehicle revenue was generated by luxury and mid-line import dealerships, which typically have higher operating margins, more\nstable Fixed Operations departments, lower associate turnover and lower inventory levels than other brand categories. We actively evaluate acquisition opportunities and other\nstrategic transactions that we believe will strengthen or diversify our brand portfolio.\nThe following table depicts the breakdown of our Franchised Dealerships Segment new vehicle revenues by brand:\nPercentage of New Vehicle Revenues\nYear Ended December 31,\nBrand\n2022\n2021\n2020\nLuxury:\nBMW\n25.7 %\n26.3 %\n24.4 %\nMercedes\n12.5 %\n12.4 %\n12.9 %\nAudi\n5.8 %\n6.4 %\n6.5 %\nLexus\n4.5 %\n5.0 %\n4.9 %\nPorsche\n3.9 %\n3.8 %\n3.6 %\nLand Rover\n3.1 %\n3.8 %\n4.9 %\nCadillac\n2.3 %\n2.3 %\n2.3 %\nMINI\n1.0 %\n1.1 %\n1.1 %\nOther luxury (1)\n1.7 %\n2.5 %\n2.6 %\nTotal Luxury\n60.5 %\n63.6 %\n63.2 %\nMid-line Import:\nToyota\n8.8 %\n8.2 %\n9.0 %\nHonda\n8.5 %\n13.0 %\n13.5 %\nVolkswagen\n1.9 %\n1.6 %\n1.0 %\nHyundai\n1.5 %\n0.9 %\n1.0 %\nOther mid-line imports (2)\n1.5 %\n0.8 %\n0.5 %\nTotal Mid-line Import\n22.2 %\n24.5 %\n25.0 %\nDomestic:\nGeneral Motors (3)\n7.3 %\n4.6 %\n5.8 %\nChrysler Dodge Jeep RAM\n5.5 %\n1.1 %\n— %\nFord\n4.5 %\n6.2 %\n6.0 %\nTotal Domestic\n17.3 %\n11.9 %\n11.8 %\nTotal\n100.0 %\n100.0 %\n100.0 %\n(1) Includes Acura, Alfa Romeo, Infiniti, Jaguar, Maserati and Volvo.\n(2) Includes Mazda, Nissan and Subaru.\n(3) Includes Buick, Chevrolet and GMC.\n4"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nIncrease Sales of Higher-Margin Products and Services. We continue to pursue opportunities to increase our sales of higher-margin products and services by expanding\nthe following:\nFinance, Insurance and Other Aftermarket Products. Each sale of a new or used vehicle gives us an opportunity to provide our guests with third-party financing and\ninsurance options and earn financing fees and insurance and other aftermarket product commissions. We also offer our guests the opportunity to purchase extended warranties,\nservice contracts and other aftermarket products from third-party providers whereby we earn a commission for arranging the contract sale. We currently offer a wide range of\nnon-recourse financing, leasing, other aftermarket products, extended warranties, service contracts and insurance products to our guests. We emphasize menu-selling techniques\nand other best practices to increase our sales of F&I products at all of our stores.\nParts, Service and Collision Repair. Each of our franchised dealerships offers a fully integrated service and parts department. Manufacturers permit warranty repair work\nto be performed only at franchised dealerships such as ours. As a result, our franchised dealerships are uniquely qualified and positioned to perform work covered by\nmanufacturer warranties on increasingly complex vehicles. We believe we can continue to grow our profitable parts and service business over the long term by increasing service\ncapacity, investing in sophisticated equipment and well-trained technicians, using competitive variable-rate pricing structures, focusing on the guest experience, and efficiently\nmanaging our parts inventory. In addition, we believe our emphasis on selling extended service contracts and maintenance contracts associated with retail new and used vehicle\nsales will drive further service and parts business in our franchised dealerships as we increase the potential to retain current service and parts guests beyond the term of the\nstandard manufacturer warranty period.\nCertified Pre-Owned Vehicles. Various manufacturers provide franchised dealers the opportunity to sell certified pre-owned (“CPO”) vehicles. This certification process\nextends the standard manufacturer warranty on the CPO vehicle, which we believe increases our potential to retain the pre-owned purchaser as a future parts and service\ncustomer. As CPO vehicles can only be sold by franchised dealerships and CPO warranty repair work can only be performed at franchised dealerships, we believe CPO vehicles\nadd additional sales volume and will increase our Fixed Operations business over the long term.\nRelationships with Manufacturers\nEach of our Franchised Dealerships Segment and Powersports Segment locations operates under a separate franchise or dealer agreement that governs the relationship\nbetween the dealership and the manufacturer. Each franchise or dealer agreement specifies the location of the dealership for the sale of vehicles and for the performance of certain\napproved services in a specified market area. The designation of such areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory. In addition, most manufacturers\nallocate vehicles on a “turn and earn” basis that rewards high unit sales volume. A franchise or dealer agreement incentivizes the dealer to meet specified standards regarding\nshowrooms, facilities and equipment for servicing vehicles, inventories, minimum net working capital, personnel training and other aspects of the business. Each franchise or\ndealer agreement also gives the related manufacturer the right to approve the dealer operator and any material change in management or ownership of the dealership. Each\nmanufacturer may terminate a franchise or dealer agreement under certain circumstances, such as a change in control of the dealership without manufacturer approval, significant\ndamage to the reputation or financial condition of the dealership, the death, removal or withdrawal of the dealer operator, the conviction of the dealership or the dealership’s\nowner or dealer operator of certain crimes, the failure to adequately operate the dealership or maintain new vehicle inventory or financing arrangements, insolvency or bankruptcy\nof the dealership or a material breach of other provisions of the applicable franchise or dealer agreement.\nMany automobile manufacturers have developed and implemented policies regarding public ownership of dealerships, which include the ability to force the sale of their\nrespective franchises and deny transfer approval requests:\n•\nupon a change in control of the Company or a material change in the composition of our Board of Directors;\n•\nif an automobile manufacturer or distributor acquires more than 5% of the voting power of our securities; or\n•\nif an individual or entity (other than an automobile manufacturer or distributor) acquires more than 20% of the voting power of our securities, and the manufacturer\ndisapproves of such individual’s or entity’s ownership interest.\nTo the extent that new or amended manufacturer policies restrict the number of dealerships that may be owned by a dealership group or the transferability of our common\nstock, such policies could have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that we will continue to be able to renew at expiration all of our existing franchise and dealer\nagreements.\n5"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMany states have placed limitations upon manufacturers’ and distributors’ ability to sell new motor vehicles directly to customers in their respective states in an effort to\nprotect dealers from practices they believe constitute unfair competition. In general, these statutes make it unlawful for a manufacturer or distributor to compete with a new motor\nvehicle dealer in the same brand operating under an agreement or franchise from the manufacturer or distributor in the relevant market area. Certain states, including Florida,\nGeorgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, limit the amount of time that a manufacturer or distributor may temporarily operate a dealership. These statutes have been\nincreasingly challenged by new entrants into the retail automotive industry and, to the extent that these statutes are repealed or weakened, such changes could have a material\nadverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, each of the states in which our dealerships currently do business requires manufacturers or distributors to show “good cause” for terminating or failing to\nrenew a dealer’s franchise or dealer agreement. Further, each of these states provides some method for dealers to challenge manufacturer attempts to establish dealerships of the\nsame brand in their relevant market area.\nWhile in any individual period conditions may vary, historically we have acquired a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory directly from consumers\nthrough our appraisal process, in addition to third-party vehicle auctions. We also acquire used vehicle inventory from wholesalers, franchised and independent dealers and fleet\nowners, such as leasing companies and rental car companies. The supply of late-model used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors, including the total number of vehicles in\noperation; the volume of new vehicle sales, which in turn generate used car trade-ins; and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels, wholesale\ntransactions and automotive auctions. During 2022, low levels of new and used vehicle inventory resulted in higher demand for used vehicle inventory by dealers, wholesalers\nand consumers, which drove significant increases in the cost to acquire used vehicle inventory and generally lower levels of salable used vehicle inventory. According to industry\nsources, there were approximately 283.0 million light vehicles in operation in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. During calendar year 2022, approximately 13.7 million new cars\nand 36.0 million used cars were sold at retail, many of which were accompanied by trade-ins that could then be resold as used vehicles. Notwithstanding the challenges to new\nand used vehicle supply experienced in 2022, we continue to believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs based on the\nlarge number of vehicles remarketed each year, consumer acceptance of our appraisal process, our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources,\nand the large size of the U.S. auction market relative to our needs.\nCompetition\nThe retail automotive industry is highly competitive. Depending on the geographic market, we compete both with dealers offering the same brands and product lines as\nours and dealers offering other manufacturers’ vehicles. We also compete for vehicle sales with auto brokers, leasing companies and services offered on the internet that provide\nreferrals to other dealerships, broker vehicle sales between customers and other dealerships or sell vehicles directly to customers via online purchase transactions and delivery. We\ncompete with small, local dealerships and with large multi-franchise and pre-owned automotive dealership groups.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors in vehicle sales are the location of stores, the ability of stores to offer an attractive selection of the most popular vehicles\nat competitive market pricing (including the effect of applicable manufacturer rebates, below-market financing from manufacturers or their captive finance subsidiaries, and other\nspecial offers), the successful interplay between the digital and physical aspects of car buying, the marketing campaigns conducted by manufacturers and the quality of services\nand guest experience at our stores. In particular, pricing has become more important as a result of well-informed customers using a variety of sources available on the internet to\ndetermine current retail market prices. Other competitive factors include customer preference for makes of automobiles, vehicle brand reputation, and coverage under\nmanufacturer warranties.\nIn addition to competition for vehicle sales, we also compete with other auto dealers, service and repair centers, auto parts retailers and independent mechanics in\nproviding vehicle parts and service work. We believe that the principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are price, the use of factory-approved replacement parts,\nfactory-trained technicians, the familiarity with a manufacturer’s makes and models and the quality of the guest experience. A number of regional and national chains offer\nselected parts and services at prices that may be lower than our prices.\nIn arranging third-party financing for our guests’ vehicle purchases, we compete with a broad range of financial institutions outside of our preferred lender network. In\naddition, certain financial institutions are now offering financing and other F&I products directly to consumers through the internet. We believe that the principal competitive\nfactors in arranging third-party financing are convenience, interest rates and contract terms.\n6"

Risk Factors.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects and the prevailing market price and performance of our Class A Common Stock may be\nadversely affected by a number of factors, including the material risks noted below. Our stockholders and prospective investors should consider these risks, uncertainties and\nother factors prior to making an investment decision.\nRisks Related to Our Growth Strategy\nOur investment in new business strategies, services and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our ongoing business or have a material adverse effect on our\noverall business and results of operations.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new business strategies, services and technologies, including our EchoPark and powersports businesses. Such\nendeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including allocating management resources away from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset expenses\nassociated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings.\nBecause these ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not have a material adverse effect on our\nreputation, financial condition and operating results.\nOur ability to make acquisitions, execute our growth strategy for our EchoPark business and grow organically may be restricted by our ability to obtain capital, the terms of\nthe instruments governing our long-term debt and the need to obtain consent from manufacturers.\nWe intend to finance future real estate and dealership acquisitions with cash generated from operations, through issuances of our stock or debt securities and through\nborrowings under credit arrangements. We may not be able to obtain additional financing by issuing stock or debt securities due to the market price of our Class A Common\nStock, overall market conditions or certain covenants under the instruments that govern our long-term debt that restrict our ability to issue additional indebtedness, or the need for\nmanufacturer consent to the issuance of equity securities. In recent months, financial markets have experienced increases in interest rates, which may make it more difficult for us\nto obtain financing on attractive terms. Using cash to complete acquisitions could substantially limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe amount of capital presently available to us is limited to the liquidity available under our existing debt agreements and cash flows generated through operating\nactivities. Pursuant to the 2021 Credit Facilities (as defined below), we are restricted from making dealership acquisitions without lender consent in any fiscal year if the\naggregate cost of all such acquisitions is in excess of certain amounts. Our ability to obtain additional sources of financing may be limited by the fact that substantially all of the\nassets of our dealerships are pledged to secure the indebtedness under the 2021 Credit Facilities and the Silo Floor Plan Facilities (as defined below). These pledges may impede\nour ability to borrow from other sources. Our pace and scale of growing our EchoPark business may be limited in the event other sources of capital are unavailable.\nIn addition, we are dependent to a significant extent on our ability to finance our new and certain of our used vehicle inventory under the 2021 Floor Plan Facilities (as\ndefined below) or the Silo Floor Plan Facilities (collectively, “Floor Plan Financing”). Floor Plan Financing arrangements allow us to borrow money to buy a particular new\nvehicle from the manufacturer or a used vehicle on trade-in or at auction and pay off the loan when we sell that particular vehicle. We must obtain Floor Plan Financing or obtain\nconsents to assume existing floor plan notes payable in connection with our acquisition of dealerships. In the event that we are unable to obtain such financing, our ability to\ncomplete dealership acquisitions could be limited.\nWe are required to obtain the approval of the applicable manufacturer before we can acquire an additional franchise of that manufacturer. Certain manufacturers also limit\nthe number of its dealerships that we may own in total, the number of dealerships we may own in a particular geographic area, or our national market share of that manufacturer’s\nsales of new vehicles. In addition, under an applicable franchise or dealer agreement or under state law, a manufacturer may have a right of first refusal to acquire a dealership\nthat we seek to acquire. We cannot assure you that manufacturers will approve future acquisitions or do so on a timely basis, which could impair the execution of our acquisition\nstrategy.\n10"

Failure to effectively integrate acquired businesses\nwith our existing operations could adversely affect our future operating results.\nOur future operating results depend on our ability to integrate the operations of acquired businesses with our existing operations. Our growth strategy has focused on the\npursuit of strategic acquisitions or brand development that either expand or complement our business. We face risks growing through acquisitions or expansion. These risks\ninclude, but are not limited to: incurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses; failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of acquired\ndealerships; entering new markets with which we are unfamiliar; incurring potential undiscovered liabilities and operational difficulties at acquired dealerships; disrupting our\nongoing business; diverting our management resources; failing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies; impairing relationships with employees, manufacturers and\ncustomers as a result of changes in management; the challenge of retaining or attracting appropriate dealership management personnel; incurring increased expenses for\naccounting and computer systems, as well as integration difficulties; failing to obtain a manufacturer’s consent to the acquisition of one or more of its franchises or to renew the\nfranchise or dealer agreement on terms acceptable to us; and incorrectly valuing entities to be acquired or assessing markets entered.\nThe operating and financial condition of acquired businesses cannot be determined accurately until we assume control. Although we conduct what we believe to be a\nprudent level of due diligence regarding the operating and financial condition of the businesses we purchase, in light of the circumstances of each transaction, an unavoidable\nlevel of risk remains regarding the actual operating condition of these businesses. Similarly, many of the dealerships we acquire, including some of our largest acquisitions, do not\nhave financial statements audited or prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). We may not have an accurate understanding of\nthe historical financial condition and performance of our acquired entities. Until we actually assume control of business assets and their operations, we may not be able to\nascertain the actual value or understand the potential liabilities of the acquired entities and their operations.\n11"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to the Retail Automotive Industry\nOur business is dependent on global supply chains that could be adversely affected by natural and man-made disasters, including the effects of pandemics like the COVID-\n19 pandemic.\nThe automotive manufacturing supply chain spans the globe. As such, supply chain disruptions resulting from widespread public health crises, armed conflict, natural\ndisasters, adverse weather and other events may affect the flow of new vehicle or parts inventory to us or our manufacturing partners. Beginning in 2020, the worldwide spread of\nCOVID-19 led to widespread reductions in travel and economic activity, including automobile manufacturing and supply chain disruptions and production delays. These supply\nchain disruptions and production delays continued in 2022 and significantly impacted the supply of new vehicles, parts and accessories that we sell. In addition, these disruption\nand delays led to low new and used vehicle inventory levels through much of 2022, which led to increases in the sales prices and costs to acquire new and used vehicles. We\nexpect that low levels of inventory due to supply chain disruptions and production delays will begin to improve as early as the first half of 2023. The extent to which these supply\nchain disruptions and production delays continue to impact our business depends on the effectiveness of actions taken globally, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. Any\nresulting operational or financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations\nand cash flows. We also cannot reasonably predict the timing or magnitude of impacts to our business due to any economic recession or depression that may develop or related\neconomic challenges, including higher inflation or increases in interest rates.\nOur facilities and operations are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations. If we are found to be in violation of, or subject to liabilities under, any of these laws\nor regulations or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, then our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows and\nprospects could suffer.\nThe retail automotive industry, including our facilities and operations, is subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, such as those relating to\nmotor vehicle sales, retail installment sales, leasing, sales of finance, insurance and vehicle protection products, licensing, consumer protection, consumer privacy, employment\npractices, escheatment, anti-money laundering, environmental, vehicle emissions and fuel economy, and health and safety. With respect to motor vehicle sales, retail installment\nsales, leasing, and sales of finance, insurance and vehicle protection products at our dealerships and stores, we are subject to various laws and regulations, the violation of which\ncould subject us to consumer class action or other lawsuits or governmental investigations and adverse publicity, in addition to administrative, civil or criminal sanctions. With\nrespect to employment practices, we are subject to various laws and regulations, including complex federal, state and local wage and hour and anti-discrimination laws. We are\nalso subject to lawsuits and governmental investigations alleging violations of these laws and regulations, including purported class action lawsuits, which could result in\nsignificant liability, fines and penalties. The violation of other laws and regulations to which we are subject also can result in administrative, civil or criminal sanctions against us,\nwhich may include a cease and desist order against the subject operations or even revocation or suspension of our license to operate the subject business, as well as significant\nliability, fines and penalties. We devote significant resources to comply with applicable federal, state and local regulation of health, safety, environmental, zoning and land use\nregulations, and we may need to spend additional time, effort and money to keep our operations and existing or acquired facilities in compliance. In addition, we may be subject\nto broad liabilities arising out of contamination at our currently and formerly owned or operated facilities, at locations to which hazardous substances were transported from such\nfacilities, and at such locations related to entities formerly affiliated with us. Although for some such liabilities we believe we are entitled to indemnification from other entities,\nwe cannot assure that such entities will view their obligations as we do or will be able to satisfy them. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may have an\nadverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, established the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), a new independent federal agency funded by the U.S. Federal Reserve with broad regulatory powers and limited oversight from the\nU.S. Congress. Although automotive dealers are generally excluded, the Dodd-Frank Act has led to additional, indirect regulation of automotive dealers, in particular, their sale\nand marketing of finance and insurance products, through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions. The CFPB has recommended that\nfinancial institutions under its jurisdiction take steps to ensure compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which may include imposing controls on discretionary markup\nof wholesale rates offered by financial institutions (“dealer markup”), monitoring and addressing the effects of dealer markup policies and eliminating dealer discretion to markup\nbuy rates and fairly compensating dealers using a different mechanism that does not result in disparate impact to certain groups of consumers.\n12"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nRISK FACTORS\nIncreasing competition among automotive retailers and the use of the internet reduces our profit margins on vehicle sales and related businesses.\nAutomotive retailing is a highly competitive business. Our competitors include publicly and privately owned dealerships, some of which are larger and have greater\nfinancial and marketing resources than we do. Many of our competitors sell the same or similar makes and models of new and used vehicles that we offer in our markets at\ncompetitive prices. We do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers due to economies of scale or otherwise. We typically rely on advertising,\nmerchandising, sales expertise, customer service reputation and dealership location to sell new vehicles. In addition, our F&I business and other related businesses, which have\nhigher margins than sales of new and used vehicles, are subject to competition from various financial institutions and other third parties. Our revenues and profitability could be\nmaterially adversely affected if certain state dealer franchise laws are relaxed to permit manufacturers to enter the retail market directly.\nMoreover, consumers are using the internet to compare pricing for vehicles and related F&I services, which may further reduce margins for new and used vehicles and\nprofits for related F&I services. If internet-based new vehicle sales are allowed to be conducted without the involvement of franchised dealers, our business could be materially\nadversely affected. In addition, other dealership groups have aligned themselves with services offered on the internet or are investing heavily in the development of their own\ninternet sales capabilities, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChallenges to the business model of our franchised dealerships from manufacturers and the effect of companies entering into the automotive space may affect our ability to\ngrow or maintain the business over the long term.\nLarge and well-capitalized technology-focused companies have continued to enter into the automotive space in recent years. Companies including, but not limited to,\nAlphabet Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Apple Inc., Lucid Group, Inc., Lyft, Inc., Rivian Automotive, Inc., Tesla, Inc. and Uber Technologies, Inc. may challenge the existing\nautomotive manufacturing, retail sales, maintenance and repair, and transportation models. For example, Tesla, Inc. has been challenging state dealer franchise laws in many\nstates with mixed results, but it has achieved success with new vehicle sales business model and its vehicles have been accepted by many consumers, even in states where dealer\nfranchise laws appear to preclude such vehicle sales. In addition, other manufacturers whose new vehicles we sell have recently announced their intentions to implement an\n“agency” model of direct manufacturer to consumer sales in certain European markets. Although the long-term impact of the participation of vehicle manufacturers in direct sales\nis undetermined, these other large companies may continue to change consumers’ view on how automobiles should be manufactured, equipped, retailed, maintained and utilized\nin the future. Because these companies have the ability to connect with each individual consumer easily through their existing or future technology platforms, we may ultimately\nbe at a competitive disadvantage in marketing, selling, financing and servicing vehicles. In addition, certain automobile manufacturers have expressed interest in or begun selling\ndirectly to customers. The franchised dealer’s participation in that potential future transaction type is unclear and our operations and financial results may be negatively impacted\nif the role of franchised dealers diminishes.\nOur dealers depend upon new vehicle sales and, therefore, their success depends in large part upon consumer demand for and manufacturer supply of particular vehicles.\nThe success of our dealerships depends in large part on the overall success of the vehicle lines they carry. New vehicle sales generate the majority of our total revenue and\nlead to sales of higher-margin products and services such as finance, insurance, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products, and parts and service operations. Our\nnew vehicle sales operations are comprised primarily of luxury and mid-line import brands, which exposes us to manufacturer concentration risks. Although our parts and service\noperations and used vehicle and powersports businesses may serve to offset some of this risk, changes in automobile manufacturers’ vehicle models and consumer demand for\nparticular vehicles may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer demand and preferences. Events such as manufacturer recalls and negative publicity or legal proceedings related to these\nevents may have a negative impact on the products we sell. If such events are significant, the profitability of our dealerships related to those manufacturers could be adversely\naffected and we could experience a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n13"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nRISK FACTORS\nFurther, manufacturers typically allocate their vehicles among dealerships based on the sales history of each dealership. Supplies of popular new vehicles may be limited\nby the applicable manufacturer’s production capabilities. Popular new vehicles that are in limited supply typically produce the highest profit margins. We depend on\nmanufacturers to provide us with a desirable mix of popular new vehicles. In addition, supply chain disruptions and production delays for new vehicles experienced since the\nonset of the COVID-19 pandemic have directly impacted new vehicle inventories and sales volume. Further disruptions and delays could impact new vehicle inventory levels and\nshift or delay demand for particular vehicles. Our operating results may be materially adversely affected if we do not obtain a sufficient supply of these vehicles on a timely basis.\nOur business is dependent upon access to quality sources of used vehicle inventory. Our business sales and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by\nobstacles that prevent the efficient acquisition and liquidation of used vehicle inventory.\nA reduction in the availability of, or access to, sources of desirable, high-quality used vehicle inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and\nresults of operations at all of our locations. In 2022, we experienced record low used vehicle inventory levels, which led to an increase in the cost to acquire high-quality used\nvehicle inventory. To the extent that used vehicle inventory levels remain low and the costs to acquire high-quality inventory remain high, we may experience decreased sales\nvolume and margins on sales of our used vehicle inventory, which may have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations and profitability, particularly in the\nEchoPark Segment.\nWe obtain a significant percentage of our used vehicle inventory through our proprietary appraisal system as this sourcing outlet is generally more profitable and more\nconvenient for our guests and potential guests. A significant portion of our used vehicle inventory is sourced through trade-ins for purchases of new vehicles, which remain\nlimited in supply. Accordingly, if we fail to make appraisal offers in line with broader market trade-in offer trends, or fail to recognize those trends, it could adversely affect our\nability to acquire used vehicle inventory and increase the risk of loss of business to our competitors. Loss of sale, involving trades and insufficient levels of inventory, could also\nforce us to purchase a greater percentage of used vehicle inventory from third-party auctions, which is generally less profitable due to high bidding costs and additional costs\nassociated with transporting the acquired used vehicles to our store locations. Our inability to source high-quality used vehicle inventory from third-party auctions could reduce\nthe demand for our used vehicle inventory offerings. See “Increasing competition among automotive retailers and the use of the internet reduces our profit margins on vehicle\nsales and related businesses” above in this “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.\nUsed vehicle inventory is subject to depreciation risk. Accordingly, if we develop excess inventory, the inability to liquidate such inventory at prices that allow us to meet\ndesirable profit margins or to recover our costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA decline of available financing or rising financing costs in the consumer automotive lending market may adversely affect our vehicle unit sales volume.\nA significant portion of vehicle buyers finance their purchases of automobiles. Sub-prime lenders have historically provided financing for consumers who, for a variety of\nreasons including poor credit histories and lack of down payment, do not have access to more traditional finance sources. In the fourth quarter of 2022, higher consumer retail\nautomotive lending rates negatively impacted finance and insurance product penetration rates and new and used retail unit volumes industry-wide. In the event that interest rates\nrise further, lenders tighten their credit standards, or there is a decline in the availability of credit in the consumer lending market, the costs of financing could influence consumer\nbuying decisions and the ability of consumers to purchase vehicles could be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues and profitability.\n14"

In\naddition, armed conflict and increased international political or economic instability may cause disruptions to foreign and domestic supply chains and manufacturing operations—\nincluding as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S.—or result in price increases that adversely impact automotive manufacturers or our new vehicle business. The\nU.S. or the countries from which our products are imported may, from time to time, impose new quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions, or adjust presently prevailing quotas,\nduties or tariffs, which may affect our operations and our ability to purchase imported vehicles and/or parts at reasonable prices, which may negatively affect affordability to\nconsumers of certain new vehicles and reduce demand for certain vehicle makes and models.\nChanges in customer demand toward fuel-efficient plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles, and resulting shifts by manufacturers to meet demand, could\ndisrupt our ongoing business or have a material adverse effect on our overall business and results of operations.\nVariability in customer behavior, including volatile fuel prices and initiatives to increase the use of fuel-efficient and electric vehicles, has affected and may continue to\naffect customer purchases of new and used vehicles. Manufacturers have also announced increased production focus on the manufacture of fuel-efficient plug-in hybrid electric\nvehicles (“PHEVs”) and battery electric vehicles (“BEVs”). The rate at which our customers will demand such vehicles, as well as the ability of manufacturers to accurately\npredict and meet such demand, is dependent on various factors. The inability of manufacturers to produce such vehicles to meet customer demand, or our inability to maintain\nadequate vehicle inventories to meet demand or tailor our selling plans to meet fluctuations in demand for these vehicles, could disrupt our ongoing business or have a material\nadverse effect on our overall business and results of operations.\nCertain PHEVs and BEVs may require less frequent or less costly maintenance and repairs than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles due to their mechanical\ndesign and features. In addition, advances in technology by manufacturers and their suppliers and their continued research and development investments have contributed to a\ngeneral increase in the overall reliability, longevity and efficiency of automobiles. The long-term effects of increased market share for PHEVs and BEVs are uncertain and may\ninclude reduced maintenance and repairs revenues, changes in manufacturer warranties and complimentary maintenance programs from which we realize parts, service and\ncollision repair revenues, and changes in the level of sales or profitability of certain warranty and maintenance products we offer our customers. To the extent that the market\nshare for PHEVs, BEVs and other non-internal combustion engine vehicles increases rapidly or such vehicles comprise a significant percentage of new or used vehicles being\nsold or operated nationwide, we may experience a disruption in our parts, service and collision repair revenues or revenues from certain warranty and maintenance products that\nwe sell, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our overall business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Vehicle Manufacturers\nOur operations may be adversely affected if one or more of our manufacturer franchise or dealer agreements is terminated or not renewed.\nEach of our franchised dealerships operates under a separate franchise or dealer agreement with the applicable automobile manufacturer. Without a franchise or dealer\nagreement, we cannot obtain new vehicles from a manufacturer or advertise as an authorized factory service center. As a result, we are significantly dependent on our\nrelationships with the manufacturers.\nMoreover, manufacturers exercise a great degree of control over the operations of our dealerships through the franchise and dealer agreements. The franchise and dealer\nagreements govern, among other things, our ability to purchase vehicles from the manufacturer and to sell vehicles to customers. Our franchise and dealer agreements do not grant\nus the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer’s product within a given geographic area. Our revenues or profitability could be materially adversely affected if any of our\nmanufacturers award franchises to others in the same markets where we operate or if existing franchised dealers increase their market share in our markets. Each of our franchise\nor dealer agreements provides for termination or non-renewal for a variety of causes, including certain changes in the financial condition of the dealerships and any unapproved\nchange of ownership or management. Manufacturers may also have a right of first refusal if we seek to sell dealerships.\n15"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our existing franchise and dealer agreements will be renewed or that the terms and conditions of such renewals will be favorable to us.\nActions taken by manufacturers to exploit their superior bargaining position in negotiating the terms of franchise and dealer agreements or renewals of these agreements or\notherwise could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn recent years, certain manufacturers whose new vehicles we sell have announced plans to develop an “agency” model of selling new vehicles in certain European\nmarkets, which is intended to facilitate sales directly by the manufacturer to the customer, using the existing franchised dealership as a logistics and delivery partner. Under\ncurrently proposed agency models, our franchised dealerships would receive a fee or similar compensation for facilitating the sale by the manufacturer of a new vehicle, but the\npurchased new vehicle would not be held in inventory. The timing and extent of implementation and relative success of agency sales models in European markets is uncertain and\ndifficult to predict. Further, it is difficult to predict whether such a model may be adopted by manufacturers or permitted by state laws in the U.S. Adoption of this sales model by\nmanufacturers in the geographic markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur failure to meet a manufacturer’s customer satisfaction, financial and sales performance or facility requirements may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to\nacquire new dealerships.\nA manufacturer may condition its allotment of vehicles, our participation in bonus programs or our acquisition of additional franchises upon our compliance with its brand\nand facility standards. These standards may require investments in technology and facilities that we otherwise would not make. This may put us in a competitive disadvantage\nwith other competing dealerships and may ultimately result in our decision to sell a franchise when we believe it may be difficult to recover the cost of the required investment to\nreach the manufacturer’s brand and facility standards.\nIn addition, many manufacturers attempt to measure customers’ satisfaction with their sales and warranty service experiences through manufacturer-determined CSI\nscores. The components of CSI vary by manufacturer and are modified periodically. Franchise and dealer agreements may also impose financial and sales performance standards.\nUnder our agreements with certain manufacturers, a dealership’s CSI scores, and financial and sales performance standards may be considered as factors in evaluating\napplications for additional dealership acquisitions. From time to time, some of our dealerships have had difficulty meeting various manufacturers’ CSI requirements or\nperformance standards. We cannot assure you that our dealerships will be able to comply with these requirements or performance standards in the future. A manufacturer may\nrefuse to consent to our acquisition of one of its franchises if it determines our dealerships do not comply with its CSI requirements or performance standards, which could impair\nthe execution of our acquisition strategy. In addition, we receive incentive payments from the manufacturers based, in part, on CSI scores, which could be materially adversely\naffected if our CSI scores decline.\nIf state dealer laws are repealed or weakened, our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination, non-renewal or renegotiation of their franchise and dealer\nagreements.\nState dealer laws generally provide that a manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a franchise or dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with\nwritten notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non-renewal. Some state dealer laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or to attempt to\ncomply with the manufacturer’s criteria within the notice period to avoid the termination or non-renewal. Manufacturers’ lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of\nstate dealer laws. If dealer laws are repealed or weakened in the states in which we operate, manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance\nnotice, an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause. Without the protection of state dealer laws, it may also be more difficult for our dealerships to renew their franchise or\ndealer agreements upon expiration.\nThe ability of a manufacturer to grant additional franchises is based on several factors which are not within our control. If manufacturers grant new franchises in areas near\nor within our existing markets, this could significantly impact our revenues and/or profitability. In addition, current state dealer laws generally restrict the ability of automobile\nmanufacturers to enter the retail market and sell directly to consumers. However, if manufacturers obtain the ability to directly retail vehicles and do so in our markets, such\ncompetition could have a material adverse effect on us.\n16"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur sales volume and profit margin on each sale may be materially adversely affected if manufacturers reduce or discontinue their incentive programs.\nOur dealerships depend on the manufacturers for certain sales incentives or employee pricing promotions, vehicle warranties, customer rebates, new and used vehicle\nfinancing or leasing incentives, dealer incentives on new vehicles, manufacturer floor plan interest and advertising assistance, and sponsorship of CPO vehicle sales by authorized\nnew vehicle dealers that are intended to promote and support dealership new vehicle sales. Manufacturers routinely modify their incentive programs in response to changing\nmarket conditions. A reduction or discontinuation of a manufacturer’s incentive programs may materially adversely impact vehicle demand and affect our results of operations.\nOur sales volume may be materially adversely affected if manufacturer captives change their customer financing programs or are unable to provide floor plan financing.\nOne of the primary finance sources used by consumers in connection with the purchase or lease of a new or used vehicle is the manufacturer captive finance companies.\nThese captive finance companies rely, to a certain extent, on the public debt markets to provide the capital necessary to support their financing programs. In addition, the captive\nfinance companies will occasionally change their loan or lease underwriting criteria to alter the risk profile of their loan or lease portfolio or as a result of changes in interest rates\nor projected vehicle residual values. A limitation or reduction of available consumer financing for these or other reasons could affect consumers’ ability to purchase or lease a\nvehicle and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume. Any deterioration of our relationship with the particular manufacturer-affiliated finance source could\nadversely affect our relationship with the affiliated manufacturer, and vice versa.\nOur parts and service sales volume and margins are dependent on manufacturer warranty programs.\nFranchised automotive retailers perform factory authorized service work and sell original replacement parts on vehicles covered by warranties issued by the automotive\nmanufacturer. Dealerships which perform work covered by a manufacturer warranty are reimbursed at rates established by the manufacturer. For 2022, approximately 14.7% of\nour Fixed Operations revenues was for work covered by manufacturer warranties and complimentary maintenance programs. To the extent a manufacturer reduces the labor rates\nor markup of replacement parts for such warranty repair work, our Fixed Operations revenues and margins could be adversely affected.\nAdverse conditions affecting one or more key manufacturers or lenders may negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur results of operations depend on the products, services, and financing and incentive programs offered by major automobile manufacturers and could be negatively\nimpacted by any significant changes to these manufacturers’ financial condition, marketing strategy, vehicle design, production capabilities, management, labor relations or\nincreased labor costs, or negative publicity or reputation impacts concerning a particular manufacturer or vehicle model.\nEvents such as labor strikes or other disruptions in production, including those caused by natural disasters, that may adversely affect a manufacturer may also adversely\naffect us. In particular, labor strikes at a manufacturer that continue for a substantial period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, the delivery of\nvehicles from manufacturers at a time later than scheduled due to supply chain disruptions or other delays, which may occur during critical periods of new product introductions,\ncould limit sales of those vehicles during those periods. We experienced such delays in 2022 and currently expect such delays to improve in 2023. Adverse conditions affecting\nthese and other important aspects of manufacturers’ operations and public relations may adversely affect our ability to sell their automobiles and, as a result, significantly and\ndetrimentally affect our business and results of operations.\nMoreover, our business could be materially adversely impacted by the bankruptcy of a major vehicle manufacturer or related lender. We may be unable to collect some or\nall of our significant receivables that are due from such manufacturer or lender, and we may be subject to preference claims relating to payments made by such manufacturer or\nlender prior to bankruptcy. Consumer demand for such manufacturer’s products could be substantially reduced and such manufacturer may be relieved of its indemnification\nobligations with respect to product liability claims. In addition, a manufacturer in bankruptcy could attempt to terminate all or certain of our franchises, in which case, we may not\nreceive adequate compensation for our franchises and a manufacturer that acts as a lender could attempt to terminate our floor plan financing and demand repayment of any\namounts outstanding. We may be unable to arrange financing for our guests for their vehicle purchases and leases through such lender, in which case, we would be required to\nseek financing with alternate financing sources, which may be difficult to obtain on similar terms, if at all. Additionally, any such bankruptcy may result in us being required to\nincur impairment charges with respect to the inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets related to certain dealerships, which could adversely impact our results of operations and\nfinancial condition and our ability to remain in compliance with the financial ratios contained in our debt agreements.\n17"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nRISK FACTORS\nManufacturer stock ownership restrictions may impair our ability to maintain or renew franchise or dealer agreements or to issue additional equity.\nSome of our franchise and dealer agreements prohibit transfers of any ownership interests of a dealership and, in some cases, its parent, without prior approval of the\napplicable manufacturer. Our existing franchise and dealer agreements could be terminated if a person or entity acquires a substantial ownership interest in us or acquires voting\npower above certain levels without the applicable manufacturer’s approval. While the holders of our Class B Common Stock currently maintain voting control of Sonic, their\nfuture investment decisions as well as those of holders of our Class A Common Stock are generally outside of our control and could result in the termination or non-renewal of\nexisting franchise or dealer agreements or impair our ability to negotiate new franchise or dealer agreements for dealerships we acquire in the future. In addition, if we cannot\nobtain any requisite approvals on a timely basis, we may not be able to issue additional equity or otherwise raise capital on terms acceptable to us. These restrictions may also\nprevent or deter a prospective acquirer from acquiring control of us.\nRisks Related to Our Sources of Financing and Liquidity\nOur significant indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial health, limit our ability to finance future acquisitions, expansion plans and capital expenditures\nand prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our total outstanding indebtedness was approximately $3.0 billion, which includes floor plan notes payable, long-term debt and short-term debt.\nWe have up to $350.0 million of maximum borrowing availability under an amended and restated syndicated revolving credit facility (the “2021 Revolving Credit\nFacility”) and up to $2.6 billion of maximum borrowing availability for combined syndicated new and used vehicle inventory floor plan financing (the “2021 Floor Plan\nFacilities” and, together with the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, the “2021 Credit Facilities”). As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $292.9 million available for\nadditional borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility based on the borrowing base calculation, which is affected by numerous factors, including eligible asset balances.\nWe are able to borrow under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility only if, at the time of the borrowing, we have met all representations and warranties and are in compliance with\nall financial and other covenants contained therein. We have capacity to finance new and used vehicle inventory purchases under floor plan agreements with various\nmanufacturer-affiliated finance companies and other lending institutions (the “Silo Floor Plan Facilities”) as well as the 2021 Floor Plan Facilities. We have up to $500.0 million\nof maximum borrowing commitment under our delayed draw-term loan credit agreement entered into in November 2019 (the “2019 Mortgage Facility”), which varies in\nborrowing limit based on the appraised value of the collateral underlying the 2019 Mortgage Facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $173.0 million of total\nremaining commitment, pending appraised collateral value, under the 2019 Mortgage Facility based on the borrowing base calculation. In addition, our 4.625% Senior Notes due\n2029 (the “4.625% Notes”), our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2031 (the “4.875% Notes”) and our other debt instruments allow us to incur additional indebtedness, including secured\nindebtedness, as long as we comply with the terms thereunder.\nThe majority of our dealership properties are subject to long-term operating lease arrangements that commonly have initial terms of 10 to 20 years with renewal options\ngenerally ranging from five to 10 years. Many of these operating leases require compliance with financial and operating covenants similar to those under the 2021 Credit Facilities\nand require monthly payments of rent that may fluctuate based on interest rates and local consumer price indices. The total future minimum lease payments related to these\noperating leases and certain equipment leases are significant and are disclosed in Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements.\nOur failure to comply with certain covenants in these agreements could materially adversely affect our ability to access our borrowing capacity, subject us to acceleration\nof our outstanding debt, result in a cross default on other indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our business.\n18"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe may not have sufficient funds to meet our obligation to repay all or a substantial portion of the outstanding principal amount of our indebtedness when it becomes due.\nThe instruments that govern our long-term indebtedness contain certain provisions that may cause all or a substantial portion of the outstanding principal amount of our\nindebtedness to become immediately due and payable. The 2021 Credit Facilities, the 2019 Mortgage Facility, the indentures governing the 4.625% Notes and the 4.875% Notes,\nand many of our operating leases contain numerous financial and operating covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable\nagreement. In addition, a default under one agreement could result in a cross default and acceleration of our repayment obligations under the other agreements or prevent us from\nborrowing under such other agreements. If a default or cross default were to occur, we may not be able to pay our debts or to borrow sufficient funds to refinance them. Even if\nnew financing were available, it may not be on terms acceptable to us. If a default were to occur, we may be unable to adequately finance our operations because of acceleration\nand cross-default provisions and the value of our common stock would be materially adversely affected. As a result of this risk, we could be forced to take actions that we\notherwise would not take, or not take actions that we otherwise might take, in order to comply with the covenants in these agreements.\nMoreover, many of our mortgage notes’ principal and interest payments are based on an amortization period longer than the actual terms (maturity dates) of the notes. We\nwill be required to repay or refinance the remaining principal balances for certain of our mortgages with balloon payments at the notes’ maturity dates, which range from 2023 to\n2033. The amounts to be repaid or refinanced at the maturity dates could be significant. We may not have sufficient liquidity to make such payments at the notes’ maturity dates.\nIn addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the indentures governing the 4.625% Notes and the 4.875% Notes), holders of such notes will have\nthe right to require us to purchase all or any part of such holders’ notes at an applicable premium. The events that constitute a change of control under the indentures governing\nthe 4.625% Notes and the 4.875% Notes may also constitute a default under the 2021 Credit Facilities and the 2019 Mortgage Facility. The agreements or instruments governing\nany future debt that we may incur may contain similar provisions regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event.\nThere can be no assurance that we would have sufficient resources available to satisfy all of our obligations under these debt instruments should all or substantial portions\nof the principal become immediately due and payable. In the event we do not have sufficient liquidity to repay the principal balances, we may not be able to refinance the debt at\ninterest rates that are acceptable to us or, depending on market conditions, at all. Our inability to repay or refinance these notes could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make interest and principal payments when due to holders of our debt securities depends upon our future performance and our receipt of sufficient funds from\nour subsidiaries.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, domestic and foreign\neconomic conditions, the regulatory environment and other factors, many of which we are unable to control. Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our\nsubsidiaries and substantially all of our consolidated cash flow and net income are generated by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our cash flow and ability to service debt depend to\na substantial degree on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and upon the ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with cash. We may receive cash from our subsidiaries in\nthe form of dividends, loans or distributions, which we may use to service our debt obligations or for working capital. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and\nhave no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to distribute cash to us or to make funds available to service debt.\nOur use of hedging transactions could limit our financial gains or result in financial losses.\nTo reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flow due to interest rate fluctuations, we have entered into, and in the future expect to enter into, certain derivative\ninstruments (or hedging agreements). No hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, we had\ninterest rate cap agreements related to a portion of our Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)-based variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates.\nSee the heading “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” under Note 6, “Long-Term Debt,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We intend to hedge\nas much of our interest rate risk as management determines is in our best interests given the cost of such hedging transactions.\n19"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur hedging transactions expose us to certain risks and financial losses, including, among other things: counterparty credit risk; available interest rate hedging may not\ncorrespond directly with the interest rate risk for which we seek protection; the duration or the amount of the hedge may not match the duration or the amount of the related\nliability; the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value, downward adjustments\nor “mark-to-market losses,” which would affect our recorded stockholders’ equity amounts; and all of our hedging instruments contain terms and conditions with which we are\nrequired to meet. A failure on our part to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nReforms to and uncertainty regarding LIBOR may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for the calculation\nof the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). In March 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (the “IBA”), LIBOR’s\nadministrator, stated it would cease publication of certain LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021. U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates that did not cease on December 31, 2021 will continue\nto be published through June 30, 2023. The FCA Announcement and the IBA statements create uncertainties surrounding the discontinuation or availability of LIBOR and other\nfinancial benchmarks beyond June 2023, and future changes in the rules or methodologies used to calculate benchmarks. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $116.0 million\nof our outstanding LIBOR-based variable-rate mortgage notes payable extend beyond June 2023. In addition, certain of our dealership operating lease agreements contain\nLIBOR-based rent adjustments if LIBOR rises above specified minimum floors. While we have already amended several of our previously LIBOR-based agreements to move to a\nTerm SOFR-based interest rate, the discontinuation of LIBOR or other benchmarks may have an unpredictable impact on the contractual mechanics of financial contracts\n(including, but not limited to, interest rates to be paid to or by us), require renegotiation of outstanding financial assets and liabilities, cause significant disruption to financial\nmarkets, increase the risk of litigation and/or increase expenses related to the transition to alternative reference rates or benchmarks, among other adverse consequences.\nAdditionally, any transition from current benchmarks may alter the Company’s risk profiles and models, valuation tools, cost of financing and effectiveness of hedging strategies.\nReforms to and uncertainty regarding transitions from current benchmarks may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nConcentration of voting power and anti-takeover provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws, Delaware law and\nour franchise and dealer agreements may reduce the likelihood of a potential change of control from a third party. At the same time, such voting power concentration also\ncould increase the likelihood of a change of control notwithstanding other factors.\nOur common stock is divided into two classes with different voting rights. This dual class stock ownership allows the present holders of the Class B Common Stock to\nexercise voting control of the Company. Holders of Class A Common Stock have one vote per share on all matters. Holders of Class B Common Stock have 10 votes per share on\nall matters, except that they have only one vote per share on any transaction proposed or approved by our Board of Directors or a Class B common stockholder or otherwise\nbenefiting the Class B common stockholders constituting a: “going private” transaction; disposition of all or substantially all of our assets; transfer resulting in a change in the\nnature of our business; or merger or consolidation in which current holders of our common stock would own less than 50% of the common stock following such transaction.\nThe holders of Class B Common Stock (which include SFC and the OBS Family, LLC, entities which David Bruton Smith, Sonic’s Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and his family members, including B. Scott Smith and Marcus Smith, both directors of Sonic, control) currently hold less than a majority of our outstanding common\nstock, but a majority of our voting power. As a result, the holders of Class B Common Stock may be able to control fundamental corporate matters and transactions, subject to the\nabove limitations. The concentration of voting power may also discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us from a third party even if the action was favored by holders\nof Class A Common Stock. In addition, a sale or transfer of shares by one or more of the holders of Class B Common Stock could result in a change of control or put downward\npressure on the market price of our Class A Common Stock. The perception among the public that these sales or transfers will occur could also contribute to a decline in the\nmarket price of our Class A Common Stock.\n20"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws make it more difficult for our stockholders to take corporate actions at\nstockholders’ meetings. In addition, stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the Sonic Automotive, Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan or the Sonic\nAutomotive, Inc. 2012 Formula Restricted Stock and Deferral Plan for Non-Employee Directors and other obligations become immediately exercisable or automatically vest\nupon a change in control. Delaware law also makes it difficult for stockholders who have recently acquired a large interest in a company to consummate a business combination\ntransaction with the company against its directors’ wishes. Finally, our franchise and dealer agreements allow the manufacturers the right to terminate the agreements upon a\nchange of control of the Company and impose restrictions upon the transferability of any significant percentage of our stock to any one person or entity that may be unqualified,\nas defined by the manufacturer, to own one of its dealerships. The inability of a person or entity to qualify with one or more of our manufacturers may prevent or seriously\nimpede a potential takeover bid. In addition, there may be provisions of our lending arrangements that create an event of default upon a change in control. These agreements,\ncorporate governance documents and laws may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control or preventing stockholders from realizing a premium\non the sale of their shares if we were acquired.\nPotential conflicts of interest between us and our officers or directors could adversely affect our future performance.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Bruton Smith, also serves as a director of Speedway Motorsports. Accordingly, we compete with Speedway\nMotorsports for the management time of Mr. Smith. Further, Mr. Smith, members of his family and certain trusts, the beneficiaries of which are members of the Smith family,\ndirectly and indirectly control a substantial majority of our voting stock.\nWe will likely in the future enter into transactions with Mr. Smith, entities controlled by Mr. Smith and his family or our other affiliates. We believe that all of our existing\narrangements with affiliates are as favorable to us as if the arrangements were negotiated between unaffiliated parties, although the majority of these transactions have neither\nbeen verified by third parties in that regard nor are likely to be so verified in the future. Potential conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us and our officers or\ndirectors in the enforcement, amendment or termination of arrangements existing between them.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws designate the state and federal courts of Delaware as the exclusive forums\nfor certain claims against the Company, which could increase the costs of bringing a claim or limit the ability of a stockholder to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by\na stockholder as favorable.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and\nexclusive forum for claims for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Sonic (other than derivative actions brought to enforce any duty or liability created by\nthe Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder); (2) any action asserting a claim of a breach of, or based on, a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director,\nofficer or other employee of Sonic to Sonic or Sonic’s stockholders; (3) any action asserting a claim against Sonic or any current or former director, officer, or other employee or\nstockholder of Sonic arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our\nAmended and Restated Bylaws; or (4) any action asserting a claim against Sonic governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware. Our Amended and Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws also provide that, unless the Board otherwise consents in writing, to the extent permitted by applicable law,\nthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the Exchange Act or any ancillary claims related thereto which are subject to the ancillary jurisdiction of the federal\ncourts.\nThe exclusive forum provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws may increase the costs to bring a claim,\ndiscourage claims or limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that he, she or it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company’s directors,\nofficers or other employees. Such provisions may also discourage lawsuits against the Company or the Company’s directors, officers and other employees. The Delaware courts\nor the United States District Court for the District of Delaware may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder\nconsidering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than to our stockholders.\n21"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nRISK FACTORS\nWhile the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions requiring claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are\n“facially valid” under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether courts in other jurisdictions will enforce provisions such as those contemplated in our Amended and\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws, including whether a court would enforce the provision requiring claims arising under the Securities\nAct or the Exchange Act to be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. If the exclusive forum provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate\nof Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws are found to be unenforceable in a particular action, we or a stockholder may incur additional costs associated with\nresolving such an action or the validity of the exclusive forum clause on appeal.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business will be harmed if overall consumer demand suffers from a severe or sustained downturn.\nOur business is heavily dependent on consumer demand and preferences. Retail new vehicle sales are cyclical and historically have experienced periodic downturns\ncharacterized by oversupply and weak demand. Recently, we have experienced an imbalance between consumer demand for new vehicles and available supply of new vehicle\ninventory due to supply chain disruptions and manufacturing delays, and it is uncertain when new vehicle inventories will stabilize and at what level. Retail vehicle sales cycles\nare often correlated with changes in overall economic conditions, consumer confidence, the level of discretionary personal income and credit availability. Deterioration in any of\nthese conditions from current levels may have a material adverse effect on our retail business, particularly sales of new and used automobiles. In addition, our business may be\nadversely affected by isolated unfavorable conditions or events in our local markets. Due to the provisions and terms contained in our franchise or dealer agreements or operating\nlease agreements, we may not be able to relocate a dealership operation to a more favorable location without incurring significant costs or penalties, if permitted at all. In addition,\nsevere or sustained changes in gasoline prices or overall shifts in consumer sentiment toward alternative fuel vehicles may lead to a shift in consumer buying patterns. Availability\nof preferred models may not exist in sufficient quantities to satisfy consumer demand and allow our stores to meet sales expectations.\nThe outcome of legal and administrative proceedings we are or may become involved in could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows or prospects.\nWe are involved, and expect to continue to be involved, in various legal and administrative proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business, including regulatory\ninvestigations and private civil actions brought by plaintiffs purporting to represent a potential class or for which a class has been certified. Although we vigorously defend\nourselves in all legal and administrative proceedings, the outcomes of pending and future proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business, including litigation with\ncustomers, employment-related lawsuits, contractual disputes, class actions, purported class actions and actions brought by governmental authorities, cannot be predicted with\ncertainty. An unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or\nprospects.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the vehicles we sell.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has adopted rules under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that require: (1) a reduction in emissions of\ngreenhouse gases from motor vehicles; (2) certain construction and operating permit reviews for greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources; and (3)\nmonitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified sources on an annual basis. The adoption of any laws or regulations requiring significant increases in fuel\neconomy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of greenhouse gases from our operations or on vehicles and automotive fuels in the U.S. could adversely\naffect demand for those vehicles and require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations.\nEmployee attrition, the loss of key personnel and limited management and personnel resources could adversely affect our operations and growth.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, President, other senior\nmanagement, and sales and service personnel. Additionally, franchise or dealer agreements may require the prior approval of the applicable manufacturer before any change is\nmade in dealership general managers. We do not have employment agreements with most members of our senior management team, our dealership general managers and other\nkey dealership personnel. Consequently, the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n22"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe U.S. labor market experienced substantial tightening in 2021 and 2022, leading to increased labor costs and, at times, shortages of qualified employees in the industry\nand in the regions in which we operate, particularly for general managers and sales and service personnel. The market for qualified employees remains highly competitive, may\nimpact our ability to identify and attract new employees and retain existing employees, and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods, such as was experienced in\n2021 and 2022, of high inflation and tight labor supply. The loss of the services of key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified managers could have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the lack of qualified management or employees employed by potential acquisition candidates may limit our ability to\nconsummate future acquisitions.\nNatural disasters, adverse weather and other events can disrupt our business.\nOur dealerships are concentrated in certain states, including California, Colorado, Florida and Texas, in which actual or threatened natural disasters and severe weather\nevents (such as earthquakes, wildfires, landslides, hail storms, floods and hurricanes) may disrupt our store operations, which may adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition to business interruption, the automotive retailing business is subject to substantial risk of property loss due to the\nsignificant concentration of property values at store locations. Although we have substantial insurance, subject to certain deductibles, limitations and exclusions, we may be\nexposed to uninsured or under insured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe have invested in internal and external business applications to execute our strategy of employing technology to benefit our business. In the ordinary course of business,\nwe collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally\nidentifiable information of our customers and employees. Moreover, significant technology-related business functions of ours are outsourced. The frequency and severity of\ncyber-security incidents has increased in recent years and adversely impacted organizations of varying sizes. Although we have attempted to mitigate the cyber-security risk of\nboth our internal and outsourced functions by implementing various cyber-security controls and other security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be\nvulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.\nThese cyber-security risks include vulnerability to cyber-attack of our internal or externally hosted business applications; interruption of service or access to systems may\naffect our ability to deliver vehicles or complete transactions with customers; unauthorized access or theft of customer or employee personal confidential information, including\nfinancial information, or strategically sensitive data; disruption of communications (both internally and externally) that may affect the quality of information used to make\ninformed business decisions; and damage to our reputation as a result of a breach in security that could affect the financial security of our customers. Any cyber-security breach or\nother loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties or damage to our\nreputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our services, which could materially adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\n23"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe may be subject to substantial withdrawal liability assessments in the future related to a multiemployer pension plan to which certain of our dealerships make\ncontributions pursuant to collective bargaining agreements.\nThree of our dealership subsidiaries in northern California currently make fixed-dollar contributions to the Automotive Industries Pension Plan (the “AI Pension Plan”)\npursuant to collective bargaining agreements between our subsidiaries and the International Association of Machinists (the “IAM”) and the International Brotherhood of\nTeamsters (the “IBT”). The AI Pension Plan is a “multiemployer plan” as defined under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and our three\ndealership subsidiaries are among approximately 146 employers that are obligated to make contributions to the AI Pension Plan pursuant to collective bargaining agreements with\nthe IAM, the IBT and other unions. In March 2008, the Board of Trustees of the AI Pension Plan notified participants, participating employers and local unions that the AI\nPension Plan’s actuary had issued a certification that the AI Pension Plan was in critical status. In conjunction with the AI Pension Plan’s critical status, all participating\nemployers were required to increase employer contributions to the AI Pension Plan for a seven-year period which commenced in 2013. As of April 2019, the AI Pension Plan’s\nactuary certified that the AI Pension Plan remained in critical status for the plan year commencing January 1, 2019 and is projected to become insolvent in 2031. Under\napplicable federal law, any employer contributing to a multiemployer pension plan that completely ceases participating in the plan while the plan is underfunded is subject to\npayment of such employer’s assessed share of the aggregate unfunded vested benefits of the plan. In certain circumstances, an employer can be assessed withdrawal liability for a\npartial withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan. If any of these adverse events were to occur in the future, it could result in a substantial withdrawal liability assessment\nthat could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTax positions may exist related to our tax filings that could be challenged by governmental agencies and result in higher income tax expenses and affect our overall liquidity\nif we are unable to successfully defend these tax positions.\nWe are subject to audits by federal and state governmental income tax agencies on a continual basis. During the course of those audits, the agencies may disagree with or\nchallenge tax positions taken on tax returns filed for Sonic and its subsidiaries. As a result of these audits, the agencies may issue assessments and penalties based on their\nunderstanding of the underlying facts and circumstances. In the event we are not able to arrive at an agreeable resolution, we may be forced to litigate these matters. If we are\nunsuccessful in litigation, our results of operations and financial position may be negatively impacted.\nImpairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our earnings.\nGoodwill is subject to impairment assessments at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have\noccurred. Pursuant to applicable accounting pronouncements, we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances\nchange that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We describe the process for testing goodwill and other intangible\nassets more thoroughly under the heading “Use of Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations.” A significant amount of our goodwill is related to our franchised dealerships reporting unit, and we have significant other intangible assets associated with\nacquisitions of franchised dealerships. If we determine that the amount of our goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired at any point in time, we are required to reduce the\nbalances recorded on our balance sheet. If goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired based on a future impairment test, we will be required to record a significant non-cash\nimpairment charge that may also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets occurs.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our balance sheet reflected a carrying amount of approximately $231.0 million in goodwill and approximately $396.7 million in other intangible assets,\nnet.\n24"

The financial and statistical data contained in the following\ndiscussion for all periods presented reflects our December 31, 2022 classification of dealerships between continuing and discontinued operations in accordance with “Presentation\nof Financial Statements” in the Accounting Standards Codification (the “ASC”). For comparison and discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021\n(“2021”) to our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 (“2020”), please refer to “Item 7.

The following discussion of\nFranchised Dealerships Segment new vehicles, used vehicles, wholesale vehicles, parts, service and collision repair, and finance, insurance and other, net is on a same store basis,\nexcept where otherwise noted. All currently operating franchised dealership stores are included within the same store group as of the first full month following the first\nanniversary of the store’s opening or acquisition. All currently operating EchoPark stores in a local geographic market are included within the same market group as of the first\nfull month following the first anniversary of the market’s opening. The following discussion of Powersports Segment new vehicles, used vehicles, wholesale vehicles, parts,\nservice and collision repair, and finance, insurance and other, net is on a reported basis.\nOverview\nWe are one of the largest automotive retailers in the U.S. (as measured by reported total revenue). As a result of the way we manage our business, we had three reportable\nsegments as of December 31, 2022: (1) the Franchised Dealerships Segment; (2) the EchoPark Segment; and (3) the Powersports Segment. For management and operational\nreporting purposes, we group certain businesses together that share management and inventory (principally used vehicles) into “stores.” As of December 31, 2022, we operated\n111 stores in the Franchised Dealerships Segment, 52 stores in the EchoPark Segment, and eight stores in the Powersports Segment. The Franchised Dealerships Segment consists\nof 142 new vehicle franchises (representing 28 different brands of cars and light trucks) and 17 collision repair centers in 18 states. The EchoPark Segment operates in 21 states,\nincluding 11 Northwest Motorsport pre-owned vehicle stores acquired in the RFJ Acquisition in December 2021 that are included in the EchoPark Segment. Under our current\nEchoPark growth plan, we plan to continue to increase our physical and digital footprint as we build out a nationwide EchoPark distribution network expected to reach 90% of the\nU.S. population by 2025.\nThe Franchised Dealerships Segment provides comprehensive sales and services, including: (1) sales of both new and used cars and light trucks; (2) sales of replacement\nparts and performance of vehicle maintenance, manufacturer warranty repairs, and paint and collision repair services (collectively, “Fixed Operations”); and (3) arrangement of\nthird-party financing, extended warranties, service contracts, insurance and other aftermarket products (collectively, “finance and insurance” or “F&I”) for our guests. The\nEchoPark Segment sells used cars and light trucks and arranges third-party F&I product sales for our guests in pre-owned vehicle specialty retail locations, and does not offer\ncustomer-facing Fixed Operations services. The Powersports Segment offers guests: (1) sales of both new and used powersports vehicles (such as motorcycles, personal watercraft\nand all-terrain vehicles); (2) Fixed Operations activities; and (3) F&I services. All three segments generally operate independently of one another with the exception of certain\nshared back-office functions and corporate overhead costs.\n29"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Summary\nRetail Automotive Industry Performance\nThe U.S. retail automotive industry’s total new vehicle (retail and fleet combined) unit sales volume was approximately 13.7 million vehicles in 2022, a decrease of 9%,\ncompared to approximately 15.0 million vehicles in 2021, according to the Power Information Network (“PIN”) from J.D. Power. We currently estimate the 2023 new vehicle\nindustry volume will be between 14.0 million vehicles (an increase of 2.2% compared to 2022) and 15.0 million vehicles (an increase of 9.5% compared to 2022). The ongoing\neffects of supply chain disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, availability of new and used vehicle inventory, interest rates, changes in consumer confidence,\navailability of consumer financing, manufacturer inventory production levels, incentive levels from automotive manufacturers or shifts in such levels, or timing of consumer\ndemand as a result of natural disasters or other unforeseen circumstances could cause the actual 2023 new vehicle industry volume to vary from expectations. Many factors,\nincluding brand and geographic concentrations as well as the industry sales mix between retail and fleet new vehicle unit sales volume, have caused our past results to differ from\nthe industry’s overall trend. Our new vehicle sales strategy focuses on our retail new vehicle sales (as opposed to fleet new vehicle sales) and, as a result, we believe it is\nappropriate to compare our retail new vehicle unit sales volume to the retail new vehicle industry volume (which excludes fleet new vehicle sales). According to PIN from J.D.\nPower, industry retail new vehicle unit sales volume decreased 11%, to approximately 11.7 million vehicles, in 2022, from approximately 13.1 million vehicles in 2021.\nImpact of COVID-19 and Supply Chain Disruptions\nThe global automotive supply chain has been significantly disrupted since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily related to the production of semiconductors\nand other components that are used in many modern automobiles, in addition to workforce-related production delays and stoppages. As a result, automobile manufacturing has\noperated for multiple years at lower than usual production levels, reducing the amount of new vehicle inventory and certain parts inventory available to our dealerships. These\ninventory constraints have led to low new and used vehicle inventory and a high new and used vehicle pricing environment, which drove retail new vehicle unit sales volumes\nlower across the industry since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. New vehicle and certain parts production levels began to improve in late 2022; however, there is a risk that\nhigher production levels and new vehicle inventory on hand may not result in incremental retail new vehicle sales volume, which could cause actual 2023 new vehicle industry\nvolume to vary from our expectations.\nImpairment Charges\nImpairment charges were approximately $320.4 million and $0.1 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Impairment charges for 2022 include approximately $202.9\nmillion of goodwill impairment charges related to the EchoPark Segment, approximately $116.4 million of franchise asset impairment charges, of which approximately $114.4\nmillion is related to the Franchised Dealerships Segment and approximately $2.0 million is related to the EchoPark Segment, and approximately $1.1 million of charges related to\nthe abandonment of certain construction projects in the Franchised Dealerships Segment. Impairment charges for 2021 include approximately $0.1 million of charges related to\noperating lease right-of-use asset impairment for a former EchoPark location.\nFranchised Dealerships Segment\nAs a result of the acquisition, disposition, termination or closure of several franchised dealership stores in 2021 and 2022, the change in consolidated reported amounts\nfrom period to period may not be indicative of the current or future operational or financial performance of our current group of operating stores. Unless otherwise noted, all\ndiscussion of increases or decreases are for 2022 compared to 2021. The following discussion is on a same store basis (which excludes results from disposed stores), except where\notherwise noted. All currently operating franchised dealership stores are included within the same store group as of the first full month following the first anniversary of the\nstore’s opening or acquisition.\n30"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRetail new vehicle revenue decreased 2% in 2022, primarily driven by a 14% decrease in retail new vehicle unit sales volume, offset partially by a 14% increase in retail\nnew vehicle average selling price. Retail new vehicle gross profit increased 25% in 2022, as a result of higher retail new vehicle gross profit per unit, offset partially by lower\nretail new vehicle unit sales volume. Retail new vehicle gross profit per unit increased $2,060 per unit, or 45%, to $6,630 per unit, due primarily to higher retail new vehicle\naverage selling prices due in part to inventory shortages as a result of vehicle manufacturer supply chain disruptions and production delays. Many of our new vehicles are being\npre-ordered and delivered to customers shortly after the vehicles arrive at our stores. On a trailing quarter cost of sales basis, our reported Franchised Dealerships Segment new\nvehicle inventory days’ supply was approximately 24 days as of December 31, 2022, compared to 16 days as of December 31, 2021 (11 days excluding the effect of the RFJ\nAcquisition in December 2021, which contributed less than one month of trailing cost of sales to the days’ supply calculation). The level of new vehicle inventory on hand\ncontinues to be below our target level as a result of the ongoing vehicle manufacturer supply chain disruptions and production delays described above, and while we anticipate\nthat manufacturer production and new vehicle inventory levels will begin to improve in 2023, we expect that new vehicle inventory levels will remain lower than historical levels\nthroughout 2023.\nRetail used vehicle revenue increased 3% in 2022, driven by a 16% increase in retail used vehicle average selling price, offset partially by an 11% decrease in retail used\nvehicle unit sales volume. Retail used vehicle gross profit decreased 19% in 2022, due to a decrease in retail used vehicle gross profit per unit of $164 per unit, or 9%, to $1,605\nper unit, in addition to lower retail used vehicle unit sales volume. Wholesale vehicle gross profit (loss) worsened by approximately $13.1 million, to gross loss of $5.1 million\nduring 2022, due primarily to a $584 per unit, or 181%, decrease in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit as a result of changes in pricing and demand for vehicles at wholesale\nauction. We generally focus on maintaining used vehicle inventory days’ supply in the 25- to 35-day range, which may fluctuate seasonally, in order to limit our exposure to\nmarket pricing volatility. On a trailing quarter cost of sales basis, our reported Franchised Dealerships Segment used vehicle inventory days’ supply was approximately 26 days as\nof December 31, 2022, compared to 42 days as of December 31, 2021 (36 days excluding the effect of the RFJ Acquisition in December 2021, which contributed less than one\nmonth of trailing cost of sales to the days’ supply calculation).\nFixed Operations revenue increased 10% and Fixed Operations gross profit increased 9% in 2022. Fixed Operations gross margin decreased 40 basis points, to 49.8%, in\n2022, driven primarily by a decrease in warranty and internal, sublet and other revenue contribution and lower customer pay gross margin.\nF&I revenue decreased 1% in 2022, driven primarily by a 12% decrease in combined retail new and used vehicle unit sales volume, offset partially by higher F&I gross\nprofit per retail unit. F&I gross profit per retail unit increased $264 per unit, or 12%, to $2,415 per unit, in 2022. We believe that our proprietary software applications, playbook\nprocesses and guest-centric selling approach enable us to optimize F&I gross profit and penetration rates (the number of F&I products sold per vehicle) across our F&I product\nlines.\nEchoPark Segment\nUnless otherwise noted, all discussion of increases or decreases are for 2022 compared to 2021. The following discussion is on a reported basis, except where otherwise\nnoted as being on a same market basis. All currently operating EchoPark stores in a local geographic market are included within the same market group as of the first full month\nfollowing the first anniversary of the market’s opening.\nReported total revenues increased 5% in 2022, driven primarily by continued expansion of our nationwide distribution network and a 26% increase in retail used vehicle\naverage selling price. Reported total gross profit increased 18% in 2022, primarily due to higher retail used vehicle gross profit per unit, offset partially by a decrease in retail\nused vehicle unit sales volume.\nReported retail used vehicle revenue increased approximately $84.2 million, or 4%, due to a 26% increase in retail used vehicle revenue per unit, partially offset by an\n18% decrease in retail used vehicle unit sales volume. F&I revenue decreased 14% in 2022, driven primarily by an 18% decrease in retail used vehicle unit sales volume, offset\npartially by higher retail used vehicle average selling prices. Combined retail used vehicle and F&I gross profit per unit increased $884 per unit, or 50%, to $2,657 per unit in\n2022. The increase in combined retail used vehicle and F&I gross profit per unit was primarily due to strategic actions taken to diversify our inventory sourcing mix and to reduce\nused vehicle inventory acquisition costs, benefiting retail used vehicle gross profit per unit.\n31"

During 2022,\nreported total revenue was $53.5 million and reported total gross profit was $16.8 million.\nReported retail new vehicle revenue was $31.8 million and reported retail new vehicle gross profit was $6.4 million, based on a retail new vehicle average selling price of\napproximately $20,000 and a retail new vehicle gross profit per unit of $3,974 per unit. On a trailing quarter cost of sales basis, our reported Powersports Segment new vehicle\ninventory days’ supply was approximately 119 days as of December 31, 2022. We believe that in a normal production environment, the level of new vehicle inventory days’\nsupply in our Powersports Segment should be in the 90- to 120-day range, depending on seasonality.\nReported retail used vehicle revenue was $7.1 million and reported retail used vehicle gross profit was $2.0 million, based on a retail used vehicle average selling price of\n$12,093 and a retail used vehicle gross profit per unit of $3,349 per unit. On a trailing quarter cost of sales basis, our reported Powersports Segment used vehicle inventory days’\nsupply was approximately 141 days as of December 31, 2022. Going forward, we generally expect to maintain a used vehicle inventory days’ supply in our Powersports Segment\nin the 75- to 100-day range, depending on seasonality.\nReported Fixed Operations revenue was $11.7 million and reported Fixed Operations gross profit was $5.8 million. Customer pay revenue was $5.5 million and customer\npay gross profit was $3.3 million. Warranty revenue was $0.7 million and warranty gross profit was $0.4 million. Wholesale parts revenue was $0.3 million and there was no\nwholesale parts gross profit. Internal, sublet and other revenue was $5.2 million and internal, sublet and other gross profit was $2.1 million.\nReported F&I revenue was $2.6 million, based on F&I gross profit per retail unit of $1,205.\n32"

New vehicle revenues and gross profit can be influenced by vehicle manufacturer incentives to consumers (which vary from cash-back incentives to low interest\nrate financing, among other things), the availability of consumer credit and the level and type of manufacturer-to-dealer incentives, as well as manufacturers providing adequate\ninventory allocations to our dealerships to meet consumer demand. The automobile manufacturing industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns\ncharacterized by oversupply and weak demand, both within specific brands and in the industry as a whole. As an automotive retailer, we seek to mitigate the effects of this sales\ncycle by maintaining a diverse brand mix of dealerships. Our brand diversity allows us to offer a broad range of products at a wide range of prices from lower-priced economy\nvehicles to luxury vehicles and powersports vehicles.\nThe U.S. retail automotive industry’s new vehicle unit sales volume below reflects all brands marketed or sold in the U.S. This industry sales volume includes brands we\ndo not sell and markets in which we do not operate, therefore changes in our new vehicle unit sales volume may not trend directly in line with changes in the industry new vehicle\nunit sales volume. We believe that the retail new vehicle industry sales volume is a more meaningful metric for comparing our new vehicle unit sales volume to the industry due to\nour minimal fleet vehicle business.\nU.S. retail new vehicle industry volume, fleet new vehicle industry volume, and total new vehicle industry volume were as follows:\n33"

Used vehicle revenues are directly\naffected by a number of factors, including consumer demand for used vehicles, the pricing and level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles, the number and quality of trade-\nins and lease turn-ins available to our dealerships, the availability and pricing of used vehicles acquired at wholesale auction, and the availability of consumer credit.\nAs a result of low levels of new vehicle inventory and a heightened demand for used vehicles (both by retail consumers and dealers at wholesale auction), used vehicle\nprices reached an all-time high during the first half of 2022, and remained at elevated levels during the second half of 2022. Depending on the mix of inventory sourcing (trade-in\nversus wholesale auction), the days’ supply of used vehicle inventory, and the pricing strategy employed by the dealership, retail used vehicle gross profit per unit and retail used\nvehicle gross profit as a percentage of revenue may vary significantly from historical levels given the current used vehicle environment.\nOur consolidated reported retail used vehicle results were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\nBetter / (Worse)\n2022\n2021\nChange\n% Change\n(In millions, except unit and per unit data)\nReported retail used vehicle:\nRevenue\n$\n5,515.4 \n$\n4,933.6 \n$\n581.8 \n12 %\nGross profit\n$\n180.8 \n$\n133.0 \n$\n47.8 \n36 %\nUnit sales\n173,209 \n183,292 \n(10,083)\n(6) %\nRevenue per unit\n$\n31,842 \n$\n26,609 \n$\n5,233 \n20 %\nGross profit per unit\n$\n1,044 \n$\n720 \n$\n324 \n45 %\nGross profit as a % of revenue\n3.3 %\n2.7 %\n60 \nbps\nFor further analysis of used vehicle results, see the tables and discussion under the headings “Used Vehicles - Franchised Dealerships Segment,” “Used Vehicles and F&I\n- EchoPark Segment” and “Used Vehicles - Powersports Segment” in the Franchised Dealerships Segment, EchoPark Segment and Powersports Segment sections, respectively,\nbelow.\nWholesale Vehicles - Consolidated\nWholesale vehicle revenues are affected by retail new and used vehicle unit sales volume and the associated trade-in volume, as well as short-term, temporary and seasonal\nfluctuations in wholesale auction pricing.

We believe that\nthe current wholesale vehicle price environment is not sustainable in the long term and expect that average wholesale vehicle pricing and related gross profit (loss) may begin to\nreturn toward long-term normalized levels in 2023.

Internal, sublet and other primarily relates to\npreparation and reconditioning work performed on vehicles in inventory that are later sold to a third party and may vary based on used vehicle inventory and sales volume from\nperiod to period. When that work is performed by one of our dealerships or stores, the work is classified as internal. In the event the work is performed by a third party on our\nbehalf, it is classified as sublet. Parts and service revenue is driven by the volume and mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs, available service capacity (a\ncombination of service bay count and technician availability), vehicle quality, manufacturer recalls, customer loyalty, and prepaid or manufacturer-paid maintenance programs.\nWe believe that, over time, vehicle quality will continue to improve, but vehicle complexity and the associated demand for repairs by qualified technicians at\nmanufacturer-affiliated dealerships may result in market share gains that could offset any revenue lost from improvement in vehicle quality. We also believe that, over the long\nterm, we have the ability to continue to optimize service capacity and customer retention at our dealerships and stores to further increase Fixed Operations revenues.\nManufacturers continue to extend new vehicle warranty periods (in particular for BEVs) and have also begun to include regular maintenance items in the warranty or\ncomplimentary maintenance program coverage. These factors, over the long term, combined with the extended manufacturer warranties on CPO vehicles, should facilitate growth\nin our parts and service business. Barriers to long-term growth may include reductions in the rate paid by manufacturers to dealers for warranty repair work performed, as well as\nthe improved quality and design of vehicles that may affect the level and frequency of future customer pay or warranty-related repair revenues.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic initially had a negative effect on our consolidated Fixed Operations revenues, as travel restrictions, government-imposed stay-at-home and\nshelter-in-place orders, and fewer workers undertaking a daily commute combined to substantially decrease the number of miles driven in the U.S., which decreased the demand\nfor maintenance, repairs and collision services beginning in March 2020. As government-imposed restrictions were relaxed and consumers resumed normal levels of driving, we\nexperienced a recovery in Fixed Operations revenues and are currently operating at or above pre-pandemic levels in the majority of our markets.\n36"

In connection with vehicle financing, extended warranties and service contracts, other aftermarket products\nand insurance contracts, we receive commissions from the third-party providers for originating these contracts. F&I revenues are recognized net of actual and estimated future\nchargebacks and other costs associated with originating contracts (as a result, reported F&I revenues and F&I gross profit are the same amount, resulting in a 100% gross margin\nfor F&I). F&I revenues are affected by the level of new and retail used vehicle unit sales volume, the age and average selling price of vehicles sold, the level of manufacturer\nfinancing specials or leasing incentives, and our F&I penetration rates for each type of F&I product. The F&I penetration rate represents the number of finance contracts,\nextended warranties and service contracts, other aftermarket products or insurance contracts that we are able to originate per vehicle sold, expressed as a percentage.\nYield spread premium is another term for the commission earned by our dealerships for arranging vehicle financing for consumers. The amount of the commission could\nbe zero, a flat fee or an actual spread between the interest rate charged to the consumer and the interest rate provided by the third-party direct financing source (e.g., a commercial\nbank, credit union or manufacturer captive finance company). We have established caps on the potential yield spread premium our dealerships can earn with all finance sources.\nWe believe the yield spread premium we earn for arranging vehicle financing represents value to the consumer in numerous ways, including the following:\n•\nlower cost, below-market financing is often available only from the manufacturers’ captives and franchised dealers;\n•\nease of access to multiple high-quality lending sources;\n•\nlease-financing alternatives are largely available only from manufacturers’ captives or other indirect lenders;\n•\nguests with substandard credit frequently do not have direct access to potential sources of sub-prime financing; and\n37"

Retail new vehicle gross profit per unit increased $2,060 per unit, or 45%, to $6,630 per unit, due primarily to inventory shortages\nas a result of vehicle manufacturer supply chain and production delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which have generally increased the average selling prices of such\nvehicles.\nOn a trailing quarter cost of sales basis, our reported Franchised Dealerships Segment new vehicle inventory days’ supply was approximately 24 and 16 days as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively (note that the December 31, 2021 days’ supply was 11 days excluding the effect of the RFJ Acquisition in December 2021, which\ncontributed less than one month of trailing cost of sales to the days’ supply calculation). The level of new vehicle inventory on hand continues to be below our target level as a\nresult of the ongoing vehicle manufacturer supply chain disruptions and production delays described above, and while we anticipate that manufacturer production and new\nvehicle inventory levels will begin to improve in 2023, we expect that new vehicle inventory levels will remain lower than historical levels throughout 2023.\n41"

F&I gross profit per retail\nunit increased $264 per unit, or 12%, to $2,415 per unit, primarily due to an increase in gross profit per finance contract. Finance contract revenue decreased 6%, primarily due to\nlower retail new and used vehicle unit sales volume and a 490-basis point decrease in the combined new and used vehicle finance contract penetration rate. Service contract\nrevenue decreased 2%, primarily due to lower retail new and used vehicle unit sales volume, offset partially by a 290-basis point increase in the service contract penetration rate\nand a 4% increase in gross profit per service contract. Other aftermarket contract revenue increased 9%, driven primarily by an 11% increase in gross profit per other aftermarket\ncontract and a 1,770-basis point increase in the other aftermarket contract penetration rate, offset partially by lower retail new and used vehicle unit sales volume.\nResults of Operations - EchoPark Segment\nAll currently operating EchoPark stores in a local geographic market are included within the same market group as of the first full month following the first anniversary of\nthe market’s opening. Due to the ongoing expansion of our EchoPark Segment, same market results may vary significantly from reported results due to newly opened markets\nthat began operations in the last 13 months.\nUsed Vehicles and F&I - EchoPark Segment\nOur EchoPark operating strategy focuses on maximizing total used vehicle-related gross profit (based on a combination of retail used vehicle unit sales volume, front-end\nretail used vehicle gross profit (loss) per unit and F&I gross profit per retail unit) rather than realizing traditional levels of front-end retail used vehicle gross profit (loss) per unit.\nAs such, we believe the best per unit measure of gross profit performance at our EchoPark stores is a combined total gross profit per retail unit, which includes both front-end\nretail used vehicle gross profit (loss) and F&I gross profit per retail unit sold. See the discussion under the heading “Results of Operations - Consolidated” for additional\ndiscussion of the macro drivers of used vehicle revenues and F&I revenues.\nAll Fixed Operations activity at our EchoPark stores supports our used vehicle inventory reconditioning operations and EchoPark stores do not currently perform customer\npay repairs or maintenance work and are not permitted to perform manufacturer-paid warranty repairs. As such, reconditioning amounts that are classified as Fixed Operations\nrevenues and cost of sales in our Franchised Dealerships Segment are presented as used vehicle cost of sales for the EchoPark Segment.\n48"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWithin F&I revenue, reported finance contract gross profit decreased approximately $3.5 million, or 6%, due to lower retail used vehicle unit sales volume and a 1,200-\nbasis point decrease in finance contract penetration rate. Reported service contract gross profit decreased approximately $15.5 million, or 15%, due to lower retail used vehicle\nunit sales volume and a 780-basis point decrease in service contract penetration rate. Reported other aftermarket product contract gross profit decreased approximately $7.6\nmillion, or 22%, due to lower retail used vehicle unit sales volume and a 940-basis point decrease in other aftermarket product contract penetration rate. We believe that the\ndecrease in penetration rates across F&I products was driven by the rapid increase in interest rates in 2022 amid near-record high used vehicle prices, which combined to create\naffordability concerns for our guests and limited their ability to obtain a desirable finance rate or to purchase and finance additional F&I products. We believe this trend is\ntransitory and expect F&I product penetration rates to normalize once the interest rate environment becomes more stable.\nOn a trailing quarter cost of sales basis, our reported used vehicle inventory days’ supply in our EchoPark Segment was approximately 40 and 70 days as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively (note that the December 31, 2021 days’ supply was 39 days excluding the effect of the RFJ Acquisition in December 2021, which contributed less\nthan one month of trailing cost of sales to the days’ supply calculation). We generally focus on maintaining EchoPark Segment used vehicle inventory days’ supply in the 30- to\n40-day range, which may fluctuate seasonally, in order to limit our exposure to market pricing volatility. The elevated level of used vehicle inventory days’ supply as of\nDecember 31, 2022 was due primarily to the acquisition of 11 Northwest Motorsport pre-owned vehicle stores in the RFJ Acquisition in December 2021 that have not been fully\nintegrated into the EchoPark inventory management strategy and typically carry a higher days’ supply of inventory.\nSame market retail used vehicle revenue decreased approximately $370.7 million, or 19%, due to a 33% decrease in retail used vehicle unit sales volume. Same market\ncombined retail used vehicle gross profit and F&I revenue decreased approximately $25.3 million, or 19%, due to lower retail used vehicle unit sales volume. The increase in total\nretail used vehicle and F&I gross profit per unit was due primarily to improvement in inventory acquisition cost as a result of sourcing a higher percentage of inventory from non-\nauction sources, in addition to expanding our inventory to include older vehicles, which typically earn a higher gross profit per unit.\nWholesale Vehicles - EchoPark Segment\nSee the discussion under the heading “Results of Operations - Consolidated” for additional discussion of the macro drivers of wholesale vehicle revenues.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EchoPark Segment reported basis, same market basis and new market basis for wholesale vehicles:\nYear Ended December 31,\nBetter / (Worse)\n2022\n2021\nChange\n% Change\n(In millions, except unit data)\nTotal wholesale vehicle revenue:\nSame market\n$\n149.3 \n$\n108.7 \n$\n40.6 \n37 %\nNew markets\n21.3 \n1.3 \n20.0 \nNM\nTotal as reported\n$\n170.6 \n$\n110.0 \n$\n60.6 \n55 %\nTotal wholesale vehicle gross profit (loss):\nSame market\n$\n3.7 \n$\n9.4 \n$\n(5.7)\n(61)%\nNew markets\n(0.5)\n(0.2)\n(0.3)\n(150)%\nTotal as reported\n$\n3.2 \n$\n9.2 \n$\n(6.0)\n(65)%\nTotal wholesale vehicle unit sales:\nSame market\n9,466 \n11,546 \n(2,080)\n(18)%\nNew markets\n1,770 \n121 \n1,649 \nNM\nTotal as reported\n11,236 \n11,667 \n(431)\n(4)%\n51"

For 2021, amount includes approximately $15.5 million of pre-tax net loss on the extinguishment of debt and\napproximately $3.0 million of pre-tax net loss on the acquisition of franchised dealerships, partially offset by approximately $1.8 million of pre-tax net gain on the disposal\nof franchised dealerships.\n(3) For 2021, amount includes approximately $6.5 million of pre-tax net loss for long-term compensation-related expenses.\n(4) For 2022, amount includes approximately $115.5 million of pre-tax franchise asset and property and equipment impairment charges for the Franchised Dealerships Segment\nand approximately $204.9 million of pre-tax goodwill and franchise asset impairment charges for the EchoPark Segment. For 2021, amount includes approximately $0.1\nmillion of pre-tax property and equipment impairment charges for the EchoPark Segment.\nSelling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses - Consolidated\nConsolidated SG&A expenses are comprised of four major groups: compensation expense, advertising expense, rent expense and other expense. Compensation expense\nprimarily relates to store personnel who are paid a commission or a salary plus commission and support personnel who are generally paid a fixed salary. Commissions paid to\nstore personnel typically vary depending on gross profits realized and sales volume objectives. Due to the salary component for certain store and corporate personnel, gross profits\nand compensation expense do not change in direct proportion to one another. Advertising expense and other expense vary based on the level of actual or anticipated business\nactivity and the number of dealerships in operation. Rent expense typically varies with the number of store locations owned, investments made for facility improvements and\ninterest rates. Other expense includes various fixed and variable expenses, including gain on disposal of franchises, certain customer-related costs such as gasoline and service\nloaners, and insurance, training, legal and IT expenses, which may not change in proportion to gross profit levels.\nThe following table sets forth information related to our consolidated reported SG&A expenses:\nYear Ended December 31,\nBetter / (Worse)\n2022\n2021\nChange\n% Change\n(In millions)\nSG&A expenses:\nCompensation\n$\n1,014.8 \n$\n834.5 \n$\n(180.3)\n(22) %\nAdvertising\n95.4 \n61.6 \n(33.8)\n(55) %\nRent\n51.0 \n53.2 \n2.2 \n4 %\nOther\n393.9 \n325.4 \n(68.5)\n(21) %\nTotal SG&A expenses\n$\n1,555.1 \n$\n1,274.7 \n$\n(280.4)\n(22) %\nSG&A expenses as a % of gross profit:\nCompensation\n43.8 %\n43.6 %\n(20)\nbps\nAdvertising\n4.1 %\n3.2 %\n(90)\nbps\nRent\n2.2 %\n2.8 %\n60 \nbps\nOther\n17.0 %\n17.0 %\n— \nbps\nTotal SG&A expenses as a % of gross profit\n67.1 %\n66.6 %\n(50)\nbps\nOverall SG&A expenses increased in both dollar amount and as a percentage of gross profit, primarily due to an increase in compensation expense as a result of higher\nlevels of gross profit and increased advertising expense related to our EchoPark Segment expansion.

Advertising expense increased in both dollar amount and as a\npercentage of gross profit, due primarily to higher levels of advertising spend at EchoPark to support our growth strategy. Rent expense decreased in both dollar amount and as a\npercentage of gross profit, primarily due to the purchase of several properties that were previously leased.

The average new vehicle floor plan interest rate was 1.09% in 2022, an\nincrease from 0.74% in 2021, the effect of which resulted in an increase in new vehicle floor plan interest expense of approximately $4.1 million. The average new vehicle floor\nplan notes payable balance increased approximately $93.3 million, the effect of which increased new vehicle floor plan interest expense by approximately $0.7 million.\nInterest expense, floor plan for used vehicles increased approximately $12.8 million, or 144.1%. The average used vehicle floor plan interest rate was 3.87% in 2022, up\nfrom 1.75% in 2021, the effect of which resulted in an increased in used vehicle floor plan interest expense of approximately $11.9 million. The average used vehicle floor plan\nnotes payable balance increased approximately $52.0 million, the effect of which increased used vehicle floor plan interest expense by approximately $0.9 million.\nInterest Expense, Other, Net - Consolidated\nInterest expense, other, net is summarized in the table below:\nYear Ended December 31,\nBetter / (Worse)\n2022\n2021\nChange\n% Change\n(In millions)\nStated/coupon interest\n$\n72.3 \n$\n37.0 \n$\n(35.3)\n(95) %\nDeferred loan cost amortization\n5.2 \n3.3 \n(1.9)\n(58) %\nInterest rate hedge expense (benefit)\n0.7 \n1.5 \n0.8 \n53 %\nCapitalized interest\n(1.6)\n(1.8)\n(0.2)\n(11) %\nInterest on finance lease liabilities\n13.1 \n7.4 \n(5.7)\n(77) %\nOther interest\n0.2 \n0.6 \n0.4 \n67 %\nTotal interest expense, other, net\n$\n89.9 \n$\n48.0 \n$\n(41.9)\n(87) %\nInterest expense, other, net increased approximately $41.9 million, or 87.3%, primarily due an increase in principal borrowings related to the issuance of the 4.625% Notes\nand the 4.875% Notes in October 2021, as well as an increase in borrowings under the 2019 Mortgage Facility in October 2022.\n58"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nProvision for Income Taxes - Consolidated\nThe overall effective tax rate from continuing operations was 53.4% and 23.9% for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Income tax expense for 2022 includes the effect of a\nfederal charge of $47.2 million primarily related to the non-deductible portion of the $319.3 million goodwill and franchise asset impairment charges, a $4.1 million charge\nrelated to non-deductible executive compensation and a $1.4 million charge related to the increase of the valuation allowance for state net operating loss carryforwards, partially\noffset by a $4.9 million benefit related to vested or exercised stock compensation awards, a $0.2 million benefit related to changes in uncertain tax positions and a $0.1 million\nbenefit related to tax credits. Our effective tax rate varies from year to year based on the level of taxable income, the distribution of taxable income between states in which the\nCompany operates and other tax adjustments.\nUse of Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Sonic’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting policies are those that management has determined are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require\nthe most subjective judgments or estimates. See Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements for additional discussion regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,” we test goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of October 1 of each year) or more\nfrequently if indications of impairment exist. The ASC also states that if an entity determines, based on an assessment of certain qualitative factors, that it is not more likely than\nnot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary.\nFor purposes of goodwill impairment testing, we have three reporting units, which consist of (1) our traditional franchised dealerships, (2) our EchoPark stores and (3) our\npowersports stores (these reporting units also represent our reportable segments). In evaluating goodwill for impairment, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its\ncarrying value, the difference would represent the amount of the required goodwill impairment. As a result of our October 1, 2022 annual test, we determined that the carrying\nvalue of the EchoPark reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the reporting unit. We tested our reporting units for impairment using the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method\nthat utilizes inputs, including, projected revenues, margin, terminal growth rates, discount rates and a market capitalization reconciliation. We determined that the franchised\ndealership reporting unit passed by significant margin, but the EchoPark reporting unit was impaired. Based on this assessment, we determined that the EchoPark reporting unit\ngoodwill amount of $202.9 million should be fully impaired and recorded such impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of\n2022. We determined that no impairment existed for either the franchised dealerships or powersports reporting units as of October 1, 2022. After the effect of impairment\ncharges, the carrying value of our goodwill totaled approximately $231.0 million at December 31, 2022, approximately $221.8 million of which was related to our franchised\ndealership reporting unit and approximately $9.2 million of which was related to our powersports reporting unit. See Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n59"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,” we evaluate franchise assets for impairment annually (as of October 1 of each year) or more\nfrequently if indicators of impairment exist. We estimate the fair value of our franchise assets using a multi-period excess earnings method (“MPEEM”) model. The MPEEM\nmodel used contains inherent uncertainties, including significant estimates and assumptions related to projected revenue, projected operating margins, a discount rate (and\nestimates in the discount rate inputs) and residual growth rates. We are subject to financial risk to the extent that our franchise assets become impaired due to deterioration of the\nunderlying businesses. The risk of a franchise asset impairment charge may increase to the extent the underlying businesses’ actual earnings or projected earnings experience a\nsignificant decline, or the required discount rate increases (reducing the fair value of expected future cash flows). As a result of our impairment testing as of October 1, 2022, we\ndetermined that several of our franchise assets’ fair values did not exceed the carrying value, resulting in $116.4 million in franchise asset impairment charges recorded in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2022. After the effect of impairment charges, the carrying value of our franchise assets totaled\napproximately $396.7 million at December 31, 2022, and is included in other intangible assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of such date. See Note 1,\n“Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. More recently acquired\nfranchise assets are at a greater risk of impairment than older franchise assets which have significant clearance between fair value and recorded balances. Many factors affect the\nvaluation of franchise assets such as the discount rate and projected revenue amounts. Unfavorable changes in these factors increases the risk of future impairments.\nFinance, Insurance and Service Contracts\nWe arrange financing for our guests through various financial institutions and receive a commission from the financial institution either in a flat fee amount or in an\namount equal to the difference between the interest rates charged to our guests and the predetermined interest rates set by the financial institution. We also receive commissions\nfrom the sale of various insurance contracts and non-recourse third-party extended service contracts. Under these contracts, the applicable manufacturer or third-party warranty\ncompany is directly liable for all warranties provided within the contract. Retrospective finance and insurance revenues (“F&I retro revenues”) are recognized when the product\ncontract has been executed with the end customer and the transaction is estimated each reporting period based on the expected value method using historical and projected data.\nF&I retro revenues can vary based on a variety of factors, including numbers of contracts and history of cancellations and claims. Accordingly, we utilize this historical and\nprojected data to constrain the consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue will not occur when the uncertainty\nassociated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Receivables, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 include\napproximately $38.7 million and $34.9 million, respectively, related to contract assets from F&I retro revenue recognition. Changes in contract assets from December 31, 2021 to\nDecember 31, 2022 were primarily due to ordinary business activity, including the receipt of cash for amounts earned and recognized in prior periods. Historically, our actual F&I\nretro revenue amounts earned have not been materially different from our recorded estimates.\nIn the event a customer terminates a financing, insurance or extended service contract prior to the scheduled maturity date, we may be required to return a portion of the\ncommission revenue originally recorded as income by Sonic to the third-party provider (known as a “chargeback”). The commission revenue for the sale of these products and\nservices is recorded net of estimated chargebacks at the time of sale. Our estimate of future chargebacks is established based on our historical chargeback rates, termination\nprovisions of the applicable contracts and data provided by the third-party underwriter of the contracts. While expected chargeback rates vary depending on the type of contract\nsold, a 100-basis point change in the estimated chargeback rates used in determining our estimates of future chargebacks would have changed our estimated reserve for\nchargebacks at December 31, 2022 by approximately $3.4 million. Our estimate of chargebacks was approximately $54.1 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to\napproximately $60.5 million as of December 31, 2021, primarily driven by higher F&I revenues and the RFJ Acquisition included beginning in December 2021. Our chargeback\nreserve estimate is influenced by the level of F&I revenues and the timing and number of early contract termination events, such as vehicle repossessions, loan refinancing, and\nearly pay-offs. If these events become more or less common, or if there is a shift in the timing of these cancellations, the resulting impact could affect our estimated reserve for\nchargebacks and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial position and cash flows. Historically, our actual chargeback experience has not been\nmaterially different from our recorded estimates.\n60"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIncome Taxes\nAs a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and, from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate\nresolution may result in us owing additional taxes. Management believes that our tax positions comply, in all material respects, with applicable tax law and that we have\nadequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. From time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject\nto uncertainty. Examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals, including consideration paid or received in connection with such transactions.\nSignificant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be\nsustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position\nhas met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant\ninformation. A tax position that does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We adjust our estimates periodically\nbecause of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent.\nAt December 31, 2022, there were approximately $5.6 million in reserves that we had provided for these matters (including estimates related to possible interest and\npenalties) with approximately $0.5 million included in other accrued liabilities and approximately $5.1 million recorded in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheet as of such date. The effects on our consolidated financial statements of income tax uncertainties are discussed in Note 7, “Income Taxes,” to the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe periodically review all deferred tax asset positions (including state net operating loss carryforwards) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred\ntax assets will be realized. Certain factors considered in evaluating the potential for realization of deferred tax assets include the time remaining until expiration (related to state\nnet operating loss carryforwards) and various sources of taxable income that may be available under the tax law to realize a tax benefit related to a deferred tax asset. This\nevaluation requires management to make certain assumptions about future profitability, the execution of tax strategies that may be available to us and the likelihood that these\nassumptions or execution of tax strategies would occur. This evaluation is highly judgmental. The results of future operations, regulatory framework of the taxing authorities and\nother related matters cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, actual realization of these deferred tax assets may be materially different from management’s estimate.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had recorded a valuation allowance amount of approximately $5.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively, related to certain state\nnet operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets as we determined that we would not be able to generate sufficient state taxable income in the related entities to realize the\naccumulated net operating loss carryforward balances.\nWe make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions in the calculation of our provision for income taxes, in the resulting tax liabilities and in the recoverability of\ndeferred tax assets. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are updated quarterly by our management based on available information and take into consideration estimated\nincome taxes based on prior year income tax returns, changes in income tax law, our income tax strategies and other factors. If our management receives information which\ncauses us to change our estimate of the year-end liability, the amount of expense or expense reduction required to be recorded in any particular quarter could be material to our\noperating results, financial position and cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (ASC Topic\n848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease potential\naccounting impact associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued, such as LIBOR. The amendments in this ASU apply only to\ncontracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 were\neffective through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01 which clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in ASC Topic 848 for\ncontract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. Certain of our existing contracts have been modified, amended or\nrenegotiated to accommodate a transition to a new reference rate, and we will continue to evaluate any such modifications or amendments to our contracts to determine the\napplicability of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and related financial statement disclosures.\n61"

We rely on cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit and floor plan\nborrowing arrangements, real estate mortgage financing, asset sales and offerings of debt and equity securities to meet these requirements. We were in compliance with all\nrestrictive covenants under our debt agreements as of December 31, 2022 and expect to be in compliance for at least the next 12 months. We closely monitor our available\nliquidity and projected future operating results in order to remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants under the 2021 Credit Facilities, the 2019 Mortgage Facility, the\nindentures governing the 4.625% Notes and the 4.875% Notes, and our other debt obligations and lease arrangements. However, our liquidity could be negatively affected if we\nfail to comply with the financial covenants in our existing debt or lease arrangements. After giving effect to the applicable restrictions on the payment of dividends under our debt\nagreements, as of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $331.0 million of net income and retained earnings free of such restrictions. Cash flows provided by our dealerships\nare derived from various sources. The primary sources include individual consumers, automobile manufacturers, automobile manufacturers’ captive finance subsidiaries and\nother financial institutions. Disruptions in these cash flows could have a material adverse impact on our operations and overall liquidity.\nBecause the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries, the majority of our cash flows from operations are generated by these subsidiaries.\nAs a result, our cash flows and our ability to service our obligations depend to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries, their contractual obligations\nand capital requirements, and their ability to provide us with cash.\nWe had the following liquidity resources available as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\n(In millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n229.2 \n$\n299.4 \nAvailability under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility\n292.9 \n281.4 \nAvailability under the 2019 Mortgage Facility (1)\n— \n22.2 \nFloor plan deposit balance\n272.0 \n99.8 \nTotal available liquidity resources\n$\n794.1 \n$\n702.8 \n(1) There are $173.0 million of additional lender commitments available under the 2019 Mortgage Facility subject to the appraisal and pledging of additional collateral.\nWe participate in a program with two of our lender partners wherein we maintain a floor plan deposit balance (as shown in the table above) with the lender that earns\ninterest based on the agreed upon rate, effectively reducing the net new vehicle floor plan interest expense with the lender. This deposit balance is not designated as a prepayment\nof notes payable - floor plan, nor is it our intent to use this amount to offset principal amounts owed under notes payable - floor plan in the future, although we have the right and\nability to do so. The deposit balances of approximately $272.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and approximately $99.8 million as of December 31, 2021 are classified as other\ncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n62"

In addition, the Company may\nredeem on or before November 15, 2026 up to an aggregate of 35% of the aggregate principal of the 4.875% Notes at a price equal to 104.875% of the aggregate principal amount\nthereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings.\n2019 Mortgage Facility\nOn November 22, 2019, we entered into a delayed draw-term loan credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature on November 22, 2024 (the “2019 Mortgage\nFacility”). On October 11, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the 2019 Mortgage Facility to permit the consummation of the RFJ Acquisition and the issuance of the 4.625%\nNotes and the 4.875% Notes. On November 17, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the 2019 Mortgage Facility to, among other things, extend the scheduled maturity date to\nNovember 17, 2027.\nOn November 17, 2022, in connection with the closing of the amendment, the Company incurred a term loan under the 2019 Mortgage Facility with a principal amount of\n$320.0 million, with a portion of the proceeds used to repay the entire $77.6 million principal amount of the prior term loan. In addition, the lenders under the 2019 Mortgage\nFacility committed to providing, upon the terms set forth in the amendment and upon the pledging of sufficient collateral by the Company, delayed draw-term loans in an\naggregate principal amount up to $85.0 million (the “Delayed Draw Credit Facility”), and revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $95.0 million\noutstanding. On November 18, 2022, the Company incurred a term loan under the Delayed Draw Credit Facility with a principal amount of $7.0 million. The aggregate\ncommitments of the lenders under the 2019 Mortgage Facility equal a total of $500.0 million, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the 2019 Mortgage Facility. The\namendment also amended the 2019 Mortgage Facility to, among other things: (1) replace the 2019 Mortgage Facility’s LIBOR-based Eurodollar reference interest rate option\nwith a reference interest rate option based upon one-month Term SOFR (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility); and (2) make changes to the pricing grid for loans incurred\nunder the 2019 Mortgage Facility, which price is based on an incremental interest margin calculated based on the Company’s Consolidated Total Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio\n(as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility).\nUnder the 2019 Mortgage Facility, Sonic has a maximum borrowing limit of $500.0 million, which varies based on the appraised value of the collateral underlying the\n2019 Mortgage Facility. Based on balances as of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $327.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2019 Mortgage Facility and\nadditional lender commitments of $173.0 million subject to the appraisal and pledging of additional collateral.\nAmounts outstanding under the 2019 Mortgage Facility bear interest at: (1) a specified rate above one-month Term SOFR (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility),\nranging from 1.25% to 2.25% per annum according to a performance-based pricing grid determined by the Company’s Consolidated Total Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio as of\nthe last day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter (the “Performance Grid”); or (2) a specified rate above the Base Rate (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility), ranging\nfrom 0.25% to 1.25% per annum according to the Performance Grid. Interest on the 2019 Mortgage Facility is paid monthly in arrears calculated using the Base Rate plus the\nApplicable Rate (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility) according to the Performance Grid. Scheduled repayment of outstanding principal is paid quarterly commencing on\nMarch 31, 2023 through December 31, 2024 at a rate of 1.25% of the aggregate initial principal amount, and increases to 1.875% in March 2025 until the maturity date at\nNovember 17, 2027. A balloon payment of the remaining balance will be due at the November 17, 2027 maturity date. Prior to the November 17, 2027 maturity date, the\nCompany reserves the right to prepay the principal amount outstanding at any time without premium or penalty provided the prepayment amount exceeds $0.5 million. Additional\ndividends are permitted subject to the limitations on restricted payments set forth in the 2021 Credit Facilities.\n65"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe 2019 Mortgage Facility contains usual and customary representations and warranties, and usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including\ncovenants which could restrict or prohibit indebtedness, liens, the payment of dividends and other restricted payments, capital expenditures and material dispositions and\nacquisitions of assets, as well as other customary covenants and default provisions. Specifically, the 2019 Mortgage Facility permits quarterly cash dividends on our Class A and\nClass B Common Stock up to $0.12 per share so long as no Event of Default (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility) has occurred and is continuing and provided that we\nremain in compliance with all financial covenants under the 2019 Mortgage Facility.\nMortgage Notes to Finance Companies\nAs of December 31, 2022, the weighted-average interest rate of our other outstanding mortgage notes (excluding the 2019 Mortgage Facility) was 5.14% (an increase from\n3.50% as of December 31, 2021) and the total outstanding mortgage principal balance of these notes (excluding the 2019 Mortgage Facility) was approximately $302.6 million.\nThese mortgage notes require monthly payments of principal and interest through their respective maturities, are secured by the underlying properties and contain certain cross-\ndefault provisions. Maturity dates for these mortgage notes range from 2023 to 2033.\nFloor Plan Facilities\nWe finance all of our new and certain of our used vehicle inventory through standardized floor plan facilities with: (1) certain manufacturer captive finance companies\n(classified as notes payable - floor plan - trade in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets) and (2) a syndicate of manufacturer-affiliated finance companies and\ncommercial banks (classified as notes payable - floor plan - non-trade in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets). These floor plan facilities are due on demand and\ncurrently bear interest at variable rates based on either one-month Term SOFR or prime plus an additional spread, as applicable. The weighted-average interest rate for our new\nand used vehicle floor plan facilities was 1.99% and 1.06% for 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe receive floor plan assistance in the form of direct payments or credits from certain manufacturers. Floor plan assistance received is capitalized in inventory and\nrecorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. We received approximately $52.2 million and $43.5 million in manufacturer assistance in 2022 and\n2021, respectively, and recognized in cost of sales approximately $51.5 million and $46.5 million in manufacturer assistance in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest payments\nunder each of our floor plan facilities are due monthly and we are generally not required to make principal repayments prior to the sale of the associated vehicles. The total notes\npayable - floor plan balance of approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 is classified as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of such\ndate.\nCovenants and Default Provisions\nNon-compliance with covenants, including a failure to make any payment when due, under the 2021 Credit Facilities, the 2019 Mortgage Facility, our floor plan\nagreements with various manufacturer-affiliated finance companies, operating lease agreements, mortgage notes to finance companies and the 2029 Indenture and the 2031\nIndenture (collectively, the “Significant Debt Agreements”) could result in a default and an acceleration of our repayment obligation under the 2021 Credit Facilities. A default\nunder the 2021 Credit Facilities or the 2019 Mortgage Facility would constitute a default under the floor plan facilities we have in place with affiliates of Ford Motor Company\n(collectively, the “Ford Floor Plan Facilities”) and could entitle these lenders to accelerate our repayment obligations under one or more of the floor plan facilities. Certain\ndefaults under the 2021 Credit Facilities, the 2019 Mortgage Facility and one or more of the Ford Floor Plan Facilities or certain other debt obligations would not result in a\ndefault under the 2029 Indenture or the 2031 Indenture, unless our repayment obligations under the 2021 Credit Facilities, the 2019 Mortgage Facility, one or more of the Ford\nFloor Plan Facilities or such other debt obligations were accelerated. An acceleration of our repayment obligation under any of the Significant Debt Agreements could result in an\nacceleration of our repayment obligations under our other Significant Debt Agreements. The failure to repay principal amounts of the Significant Debt Agreements when due\nwould create cross-default situations related to other indebtedness. The 2021 Credit Facilities and the 2019 Mortgage Facility include the following financial covenants:\n66"

As of December 31, 2022, the ratio\nwas 13.66 to 1.00.\nWe were in compliance with all of the restrictive and financial covenants in all of our floor plan agreements, long-term debt facilities and lease agreements as of December\n31, 2022. After giving effect to the applicable restrictions on the payment of dividends and certain other transactions under our debt agreements, as of December 31, 2022, we\nhad at least $331.0 million of net income and retained earnings free of such restrictions. See Note 6, “Long-Term Debt,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements\nfor further discussion of the 2021 Credit Facilities.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nDuring 2022, we acquired two businesses in our Franchised Dealerships Segment and two businesses (consisting of eight locations) in our Powersports Segment for\napproximately $102.3 million, including inventory acquired and subsequently funded by floor plan notes payable. We did not dispose of any businesses in 2022. See Note 2,\n“Business Acquisitions and Dispositions,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures include the purchase of land and buildings, the construction of new franchised dealerships, EchoPark and powersports stores and collision repair\ncenters, building improvements and equipment purchased for use in our franchised dealerships and EchoPark and powersports stores. We selectively construct or improve new\nfranchised dealership facilities to maintain compliance with manufacturers’ image requirements. We typically finance these projects through cash flows from operations, new\nmortgages or our credit facilities.\nCapital expenditures for 2022 were approximately $227.1 million, including approximately $130.3 million related to our Franchised Dealerships Segment, approximately\n$96.6 million related to our EchoPark Segment and approximately $0.2 million related to our Powersports Segment. Of the total capital expenditures, approximately $109.8\nmillion was related to facility construction projects, approximately $72.9 million was related to acquisitions of real estate (land and buildings), and approximately $44.4 million\nwas for other fixed assets utilized in our operations. All of the $227.1 million in gross capital expenditures in 2022 was funded through mortgage financing with borrowings under\nthe 2019 Mortgage Facility. As of December 31, 2022, commitments for facility construction projects totaled approximately $28.8 million.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock. Historically, we have used our share repurchase authorization to offset\ndilution caused by the exercise of stock options or the vesting of equity compensation awards and to maintain our desired capital structure. During 2022, we repurchased\napproximately 5.6 million shares of our Class A Common Stock for approximately $261.9 million in open-market transactions at prevailing market prices and in connection with\ntax withholding on the vesting of equity compensation awards. During 2022, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500.0 million of share repurchase authorization. As\nof December 31, 2022, our total remaining repurchase authorization was approximately $464.3 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we repurchased an additional 194,294\nshares of Class A Common Stock for approximately $9.6 million, resulting in current remaining availability of approximately $454.8 million. Under the 2021 Credit Facilities,\nshare repurchases are permitted to the extent that no event of default exists and we do not exceed the restrictions set forth in our debt agreements. After giving effect to the\napplicable restrictions on share repurchases and certain other transactions under our debt agreements, as of December 31, 2022, we had at least $331.0 million of net income and\nretained earnings free of such restrictions.\n67"

These factors\nare considered each quarter and will be scrutinized as our Board of Directors and management determine our share repurchase policy in the future.\nDividends\nOur Board of Directors approved four quarterly cash dividends on all outstanding shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock totaling $1.03 per share during 2022.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on all outstanding shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock of $0.28 per share for\nstockholders of record on March 15, 2023 to be paid on April 14, 2023. The 2021 Credit Facilities permit quarterly cash dividends on our Class A and Class B Common Stock up\nto $0.12 per share so long as no Event of Default (as defined in the 2021 Credit Facilities) has occurred and is continuing and provided that we remain in compliance with all\nfinancial covenants under the 2021 Credit Facilities. Additional dividends are permitted subject to the limitations on restricted payments set forth in the 2021 Credit Facilities.\nThe 2029 Indenture and the 2031 Indenture also contain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. After giving effect to the applicable restrictions on share repurchases and\ncertain other transactions under our debt agreements, as of December 31, 2022, we had at least $331.0 million of net income and retained earnings free of such restrictions. The\ndeclaration and payment of any future dividend is subject to the business judgment of our Board of Directors, taking into consideration our historical and projected results of\noperations, financial condition, cash flows, capital requirements, covenant compliance, share repurchases, the current economic environment and other factors considered by our\nBoard of Directors to be relevant. These factors are considered each quarter and will be scrutinized as our Board of Directors determines our future dividend policy. There is no\nguarantee that additional dividends will be declared and paid at any time in the future. See Note 6, “Long-Term Debt,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for\na description of restrictions on the payment of dividends.\nCash Flows\nCash Flows from Operating Activities - Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $406.1 million and $306.3 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe cash provided by operations for 2022 consisted primarily of net income (less non-cash items), a decrease in inventories, and an increase in notes payable - floor plan - trade,\noffset partially by an increase in receivables and an increase in the floor plan deposit balance. The cash provided by operations for 2021 consisted primarily of net income (less\nnon-cash items) and a decrease in inventories, offset partially by a decrease in notes payable - floor plan - trade (as a result of the amendment to the 2021 Credit Facilities, which\nreclassified certain notes payable - floor plan balances from trade to non-trade).\nWe arrange our inventory floor plan financing through both manufacturer captive finance companies and a syndicate of manufacturer-affiliated finance companies and\ncommercial banks. Our floor plan financed with manufacturer captives is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as notes payable - floor plan - trade (with the change in\nbalance being reflected in operating cash flows). Our dealerships that obtain floor plan financing from a syndicate of manufacturer-affiliated finance companies and commercial\nbanks record their obligation in the consolidated balance sheets as notes payable - floor plan - non-trade (with the change in balance being reflected in financing cash flows).\nDue to the presentation differences for changes in trade floor plan financing and non-trade floor plan financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows, decisions\nmade by us to move dealership floor plan financing arrangements from one finance source to another may cause significant variations in operating and financing cash flows\nwithout affecting our overall liquidity, working capital or cash flows. Upon entering into the 2021 Floor Plan Facilities in April 2021, the majority of our outstanding floor plan\nliabilities were reclassified from trade floor plan liabilities to non-trade floor plan liabilities, resulting in a significant reclassification of related floor plan liability cash flows\nfrom operating activities to financing activities.\nNet cash used in combined trade and non-trade floor plan financing was approximately $40.8 million and $55.8 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Accordingly, if all\nchanges in floor plan notes payable were classified as an operating activity (to align changes in floor plan liability balances with the associated changes in inventory balances for\ncash flow classification), the result would have been net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $340.2 million and $745.9 million for 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\n68"

The use of\ncash during 2022 was comprised primarily of purchases of businesses, net of cash acquired, and purchases of land, property and equipment, offset partially by proceeds from the\nsale of property and equipment. The use of cash during 2021 was comprised primarily of purchases of businesses, net of cash acquired, and purchases of land, property and\nequipment, offset partially by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and proceeds from the sale of franchised dealerships. See Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and\nDispositions,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.\nThe significant components of capital expenditures relate primarily to dealership renovations, the purchase of certain existing dealership facilities which had previously\nbeen financed under long-term operating leases, and the purchase and development of new real estate parcels for the relocation of existing dealerships and the construction of\nEchoPark stores. During 2022 and 2021, we generated net proceeds from mortgage financing (excluding the effects of any refinancing with zero net proceeds) in the amount of\napproximately $327.0 million and $16.5 million, respectively, to purchase certain existing dealership facilities and to fund certain capital expenditures.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $176.6 million for 2022. Net cash provided by financing activities was\napproximately $1.1 billion for 2021. For 2022, cash used in financing activities was comprised primarily of the repurchases of treasury stock, scheduled principal payments and\nrepayments of long-term debt, the reduction of finance lease liabilities and net repayments on notes payable - floor plan - non-trade, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance\nof long-term debt. For 2021, cash provided by financing activities was comprised primarily of proceeds from the issuance of the 4.625% Notes and the 4.875% Notes, net\nborrowings on notes payable - floor plan - non-trade (as a result of the reclassification of certain floor plan liabilities from trade to non-trade) and proceeds from mortgage notes,\noffset partially by the extinguishment of the 6.125% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2027, repurchases of treasury stock and scheduled principal payments of long-term debt.\nOne metric that management uses to measure operating performance is Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) for each of our reportable segments and on a\nconsolidated basis.

Because the\nmajority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries, the majority of our cash flows from operations are generated by these subsidiaries. As a result, our\ncash flows and our ability to service our obligations depend to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries, their contractual obligations and capital\nrequirements, and their ability to provide us with cash.\nSeasonality\nOur operations are subject to seasonal variations. Due in part to our franchised dealerships brand mix, the first quarter historically has contributed less operating profit than\nthe second and third quarters, while the fourth quarter historically has contributed the highest operating profit of any quarter. Due to the abnormal effects of the COVID-19\npandemic on the automotive supply chain and inventory levels, in addition to the effects of a potential economic recession, this historical seasonality did not play out in 2022 and\nmay not hold true in 2023. Weather conditions and the timing of manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers cause seasonality and may adversely affect vehicle\ndemand and, consequently, our profitability. Comparatively, parts and service demand has historically remained stable throughout the year.\n70"

When we sell dealerships, we\nattempt to assign any related lease to the buyer of the dealership to eliminate any future liability. However, if we are unable to assign the related leases to the buyer, we will\nattempt to sublease the leased properties to the buyer at a rate equal to the terms of the original leases. In the event we are unable to sublease the properties to the buyer with terms\nat least equal to our leases, we may be required to record lease exit accruals. As of December 31, 2022, our future gross minimum lease payments related to properties subleased\nto buyers of sold dealerships totaled approximately $10.4 million. Future sublease payments expected to be received related to these lease payments were approximately $10.3\nmillion at December 31, 2022.\nIn accordance with the terms of agreements entered into for the sale of our dealerships, we generally agree to indemnify the buyer from certain liabilities and costs arising\nsubsequent to the date of sale, including environmental exposure and exposure resulting from the breach of representations or warranties made in accordance with the agreements.\nThese indemnifications typically expire within a period of one to three years following the date of sale. While our exposure with respect to environmental remediation and repairs\nis difficult to quantify, we did not have any remaining exposure as of December 31, 2022 and had exposure of $4.0 million as of December 31, 2021.\nWe also guarantee the floor plan commitments of our 50%-owned joint venture, and the amount of such guarantee was approximately $4.3 million at December 31, 2022.\nWe expect the aggregate amount of the obligations we guarantee to fluctuate based on dealership disposition activity. Although we seek to mitigate our exposure in connection\nwith these matters, these guarantees and indemnification obligations, including environmental exposures and the financial performance of lease assignees and sublessees, cannot\nbe predicted with certainty. An unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources. See Note 12,\n“Commitments and Contingencies,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these guarantees and indemnification obligations.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are involved, and expect to continue to be involved, in various legal and administrative proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business, including regulatory\ninvestigations and private civil actions brought by plaintiffs purporting to represent a potential class or for which a class has been certified. Although we vigorously defend\nourselves in all legal and administrative proceedings, the outcomes of pending and future proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business, including litigation with\ncustomers, employment-related lawsuits, contractual disputes, class actions, purported class actions and actions brought by governmental authorities, cannot be predicted with\ncertainty. An unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or\nprospects.\nIncluded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 were approximately $0.4\nmillion and $0.3 million, respectively, in reserves that we were holding for pending proceedings. Included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 were approximately $1.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for such reserves. Except as reflected in such\nreserves, we are currently unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, or a range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, for pending proceedings.\nSee Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these legal matters.\n71"

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur variable rate floor plan facilities, the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, the 2019 Mortgage Facility and our other variable rate notes expose us to risks caused by\nfluctuations in the applicable interest rates. The total outstanding balance of such variable instruments, after considering the effect of outstanding cash flow hedge instruments,\nwas approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021. A change of 100 basis points in the underlying interest rate would have caused a\nchange in interest expense of approximately $20.1 million in 2022 and approximately $20.6 million in 2021. Of the total change in interest expense, approximately $16.8 million\nand $18.1 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, would have resulted from our floor plan facilities.\nIn addition to our variable rate debt, as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, certain of our dealership lease facilities had monthly lease payments that fluctuated based on\nLIBOR or one-month Term SOFR interest rates. An increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would not have had a significant impact on rent expense in 2022 and 2021 due to\nthe leases containing interest rate floors which were above the actual interest rate in effect during 2022 and 2021.\nAs of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had interest rate cap agreements designated as hedging instruments to limit our exposure to increases in one-month Term\nSOFR (as of December 31, 2022) or LIBOR (as of December 31, 2021) rates above certain levels. Under the terms of the interest rate cap agreements, interest rates reset\nmonthly. The fair value of the outstanding interest rate cap position at December 31, 2022 was a net asset of approximately $0.5 million, included in other assets in the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheet as of such date. The fair value of the outstanding interest rate cap position at December 31, 2021 was not material. Under the terms of\nthese agreements, we will receive and pay interest based on the following:\nNotional Amount\nCap Rate (1)\nReceive Rate (1) (2)\nStart Date\nMaturing Date\n(In millions)\n$\n250.0 \n3.000%\none-month LIBOR\nJuly 1, 2021\nJuly 1, 2022\n$\n250.0 \n5.000%\none-month Term SOFR\nOctober 26, 2022\nOctober 25, 2023\n$\n125.0 \n5.000%\none-month Term SOFR\nOctober 26, 2023\nOctober 26, 2024\n(1) Under these interest rate caps, no payment from the counterparty will occur unless the stated receive rate exceeds the stated cap rate, in which case a net payment to us from\nthe counterparty, based on the spread between the receive rate and the cap rate, will be recognized as a reduction of interest expense, other, net in the accompanying\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n(2) The one-month SOFR rate was approximately 4.062% at December 31, 2022.\nThe interest rate caps have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and, as a result, changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in total other\ncomprehensive income (loss) before taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive operations and are disclosed in the supplemental schedule of non-cash\nfinancing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.\n72"

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and our Chief\nFinancial Officer (“CFO”), we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange\nAct) as of December 31, 2022. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and our CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,\n2022.\nOur CEO and our CFO have each concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries in conformity with GAAP.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and\nour CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework published in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting is set forth in ‘‘Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data’’ in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and\nmay not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods is subject to risk that those\ninternal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we identified a material weakness in certain internal controls over financial reporting related to the revenue recognition\nprocess at a single dealership acquired in December 2021. We have determined that the material weakness existed as of September 30, 2022. The acquired entity did not have an\nadequate risk assessment process to ensure appropriate internal controls were in place for all of their revenue streams. Specifically, the internal controls at this single dealership\nwere not designed to assess principal-agent considerations in accordance with ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.  The deficiency was identified in\nconjunction with our integration of this dealership’s processes and controls into our internal control framework during the year following acquisition. The material weakness\nresulted in an overstatement of both new vehicle fleet revenues and fleet cost of sales for the same amount for the three months ended September 30, 2022. This material\nweakness was remediated as of December 31, 2022.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Except as noted in the immediately preceding paragraph where additional controls were implemented to remediate\nthe material weakness that existed as of September 30, 2022, there was no change during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

      "text": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nSonic Automotive, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sonic Automotive, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022,\nand the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,\n2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles\nused and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken\nas a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it\nrelates.\nFair value of franchise assets\nAs discussed in Notes 1, 2, and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the franchise asset balance as of December 31, 2022 was $396.7 million, a portion of which related\nto the franchise assets obtained in 2021 as part of the acquisition of RFJ Auto Partners, Inc. (RFJ Auto). These franchise assets are tested for impairment annually on October\n1, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a franchise asset has declined below its carrying value. To estimate the fair value\nof franchise assets, the Company uses significant assumptions including projected revenues, projected operating margins, discount rates, and residual growth rates. In\nconnection with the annual impairment test, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $116.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, a portion of which\nrelated to franchise assets acquired in the RFJ Auto acquisition.\nWe identified the evaluation of the fair value of the franchise assets obtained in the RFJ Auto acquisition as a critical audit matter. Specifically, subjective and complex\nauditor judgment was required to evaluate the projected revenue growth rates, operating margins, and discount rates used to value the franchise assets in connection with the\nannual impairment test. Changes in these assumptions could have had a significant impact on the fair value of these franchise assets and the resulting impairment charge.\nValuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were also required to assess the discount rates.\nF-1"

      "text": "The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal\ncontrols related to the Company’s annual impairment test for franchise assets. This included controls related to the development of projected revenue growth rates, operating\nmargins, and the discount rates used in determining the fair value of the franchise assets obtained in the acquisition of RFJ Auto. We evaluated the reasonableness of the\nCompany’s projected revenue growth rates and operating margins by comparing them to publicly available market data for the industry as well as the Company’s historical\nresults. We performed sensitivity analyses over the projected revenue growth rate, operating margin, and discount rate assumptions to assess the impact of changes in those\nassumptions on the Company’s determination of fair value. We also involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the\nCompany’s discount rates by comparing them to discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nFebruary 17, 2023\nF-2"

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the\nCompany as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the\nyears in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 17, 2023\nexpressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of\ninternal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;\nand (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nFebruary 17, 2023\nF-3"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Business - Sonic Automotive, Inc. (“Sonic,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States (“U.S.”)\n(as measured by reported total revenue). As a result of the way we manage our business, we had three reportable segments as of December 31, 2022: (1) the Franchised\nDealerships Segment; (2) the EchoPark Segment; and (3) the Powersports Segment. For management and operational reporting purposes, we group certain businesses together\nthat share management and inventory (principally used vehicles) into “stores.” As of December 31, 2022, we operated 111 stores in the Franchised Dealerships Segment, 52\nstores in the EchoPark Segment and eight stores in the Powersports Segment. The Franchised Dealerships Segment consists of 142 new vehicle franchises (representing 28\ndifferent brands of cars and light trucks) and 17 collision repair centers in 18 states. The EchoPark Segment operates in 21 states, including 11 Northwest Motorsport pre-owned\nvehicle stores acquired in the RFJ Acquisition in December 2021 that are included in the EchoPark Segment. Under our current EchoPark growth plan, we plan to continue to\nincrease our physical and digital footprint as we build out a nationwide EchoPark distribution network expected to reach 90% of the U.S. population by 2025.\nThe Franchised Dealerships Segment provides comprehensive sales and services, including: (1) sales of both new and used cars and light trucks; (2) sales of replacement\nparts and performance of vehicle maintenance, manufacturer warranty repairs, and paint and collision repair services (collectively, “Fixed Operations”); and (3) arrangement of\nthird-party financing, extended warranties, service contracts, insurance and other aftermarket products (collectively, “finance and insurance” or “F&I”) for our guests. The\nEchoPark Segment sells used cars and light trucks and arranges third-party F&I product sales for our guests in pre-owned vehicle specialty retail locations, and does not offer\ncustomer-facing Fixed Operations services. The Powersports Segment offers guests: (1) sales of both new and used powersports vehicles (such as motorcycles, personal watercraft\nand all-terrain vehicles); (2) Fixed Operations activities; and (3) F&I services. All three segments generally operate independently of one another, with the exception of certain\nshared back-office functions and corporate overhead costs.\nCOVID 19 - The COVID-19 pandemic began negatively impacting the global economy in the first quarter of 2020 and continued to affect the global economy and supply\nchain throughout 2022. The pandemic has affected both consumer demand and the global supply of automobiles and automobile parts, increasing demand for vehicles at times,\nwhile also negatively impacting automobile manufacturers’ ability to produce enough inventory to meet demand. The global automotive supply chain has been significantly\ndisrupted since the onset of the pandemic, primarily related to the production of semiconductors that are used in many components of new vehicles, in addition to workforce-\nrelated production delays and stoppages. As a result, automobile manufacturing has operated at lower than usual production levels since the first quarter of 2020, reducing the\namount of new vehicle inventory and certain parts inventory available to our dealerships. These inventory constraints, coupled with strong consumer demand, a period of low\ninterest rates and record levels of consumer savings, have led to low new and used vehicle inventory and a high new and used vehicle pricing environment, which drove retail\nnew vehicle unit sales volumes lower across the industry in 2020, 2021 and 2022.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements - In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04,\n“Reference Rate Reform (Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” ASU 2020-04\nprovides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential accounting impact associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be\ndiscontinued, such as the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). The amendments in this ASU apply only to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that\nreference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 were effective through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the\nFASB issued ASU 2021-01 which clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in ASC Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to\nderivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. Certain of our existing contracts have been modified, amended or renegotiated to accommodate a transition to a new\nreference rate, and we will continue to evaluate any such modifications or amendments to our contracts to determine the applicability of this standard on our consolidated\nfinancial statements and related financial statement disclosures. See Note 6, “Long-Term Debt,” for a discussion of amendments to our debt agreements related to conversion\nfrom LIBOR to a new reference rate.\nPrinciples of Consolidation - All of our dealership and non-dealership subsidiaries are wholly owned and consolidated in the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements, except for one 50%-owned dealership that is accounted for under the equity method. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements.\nF-9"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires Sonic’s management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates, particularly\nrelated to intangible asset values, deferred tax asset values and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits, reserves for legal matters, insurance reserves, reserves for future\ncommission revenue to be returned to the third-party provider for early termination of finance and insurance contracts (“chargebacks”), and estimates of certain retrospective\nfinance and insurance revenue.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - We classify cash and all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, including short-term time\ndeposits and government agency and corporate obligations, as cash and cash equivalents.\nRevenue Recognition - Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and in an amount that reflects the consideration that the\nentity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We do not include the cost of obtaining contracts within the related revenue streams since we elected the\npractical expedient to expense the costs to obtain a contract when incurred.\nManagement has evaluated our established business processes, revenue transaction streams and accounting policies, and identified our material revenue streams to be: (1)\nthe sale of new vehicles; (2) the sale of used vehicles to retail customers; (3) the sale of wholesale used vehicles at third-party auctions; (4) the arrangement of third-party vehicle\nfinancing and the sale of third-party service, warranty and other insurance contracts; and (5) the performance of vehicle maintenance and repair services and the sale of related\nparts and accessories. Generally, performance obligations are satisfied when the associated vehicle is either delivered to a customer and customer acceptance has occurred, over\ntime as the maintenance and repair services are performed, or at the time of wholesale and retail parts sales. We do not have any revenue streams with significant financing\ncomponents as payments are typically received within a short period of time following completion of the performance obligation(s).\nRetrospective finance and insurance revenues (“F&I retro revenues”) are recognized when the product contract has been executed with the end customer and the\ntransaction price is estimated each reporting period based on the expected value method using historical and projected data. F&I retro revenues can vary based on a variety of\nfactors, including number of contracts and history of cancellations and claims. Accordingly, we utilize this historical and projected data to constrain the consideration to the extent\nthat it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently\nresolved.\nWe record revenue when vehicles are delivered to customers, as vehicle service work is performed and when parts are delivered. Conditions for completing a sale include\nhaving an agreement with the customer, including pricing, and it being probable that the proceeds from the sale will be collected.\nThe accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 include approximately $38.7 million and $34.9 million, respectively, related to contract\nassets from F&I retro revenues recognition, which are recorded in receivables, net. Changes in contract assets from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 were primarily due\nto ordinary business activity, including the receipt of cash for amounts earned and recognized in prior periods.\nFloor Plan Assistance - We receive floor plan assistance in the form of direct payments or credits from certain manufacturers. This assistance reduces the carrying value\nof our new vehicle inventory and is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales at the time the associated inventory is sold. Amounts recognized as a reduction of cost of sales were\napproximately $51.5 million, $46.5 million and $40.6 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nContracts in Transit - Contracts in transit represent finance contracts evidencing loans or lease agreements between us, as creditor, and the guest, as borrower, to acquire\nor lease a vehicle in situations where a third-party finance source has given us initial, non-binding approval to assume our position as creditor. Funding and final approval from\nthe finance source is provided upon the finance source’s review of the loan or lease agreement and related documentation executed by the guest at the dealership. These finance\ncontracts are typically funded within 10 days of the initial approval of the finance transaction given by the third-party finance source. The finance source is not contractually\nobligated to make the loan or lease to the guest until it gives its final approval and funds the transaction, and until such final approval is given, the contracts in transit represent\namounts due from the guest to us. Contracts in transit are included in receivables, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled approximately $216.8 million\nand $143.0 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nF-10"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAccounts Receivable - In addition to contracts in transit, our accounts receivable primarily consists of amounts due from automobile manufacturers for repair services\nperformed on vehicles with a remaining factory warranty and amounts due from third parties from the sale of parts. We evaluate receivables for collectability based on the age of\nthe receivable, the credit history of the third party, past collection experience, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions. The\nrecorded allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was not significant at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nReceivables, net consist of the following:\n \nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\n \n(In millions)\nContracts in transit\n$\n216.8 \n$\n143.0 \nManufacturer and warranty receivables\n68.1 \n69.6 \nOther receivables\n177.5 \n188.5 \nReceivables, net\n$\n462.4 \n$\n401.1 \nInventories - Inventories of new vehicles, recorded net of manufacturer credits, and used vehicles, including demonstrators, are stated at the lower of specific cost or net\nrealizable value. Inventories of parts and accessories are accounted for using the “first-in, first-out” (“FIFO”) method of inventory accounting and are stated at the lower of FIFO\ncost or net realizable value. Other inventories are primarily service loaner vehicles and, to a lesser extent, vehicle chassis, other supplies and capitalized customer work-in-\nprogress (open customer vehicle repair orders). Other inventories are stated at the lower of specific cost (depreciated cost for service loaner vehicles) or net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining available lease term. The available lease term includes\nrenewal options if the exercise of a renewal option has been determined to be reasonably assured.\nThe range of estimated useful lives is as follows:\nBuildings and leasehold and land improvements\n10-40 years\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment\n3-10 years\nWe review the carrying value of property and equipment and other long-lived assets (including related right-of-use assets for leased properties, but excluding goodwill and\nother intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If such an indication is present, we\ncompare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows related to that asset. We conclude that an asset is impaired if the sum of such expected future\ncash flows is less than the carrying amount of the related asset. If we determine an asset is impaired, the impairment loss would be the amount by which the carrying amount of\nthe related asset exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the asset would be determined based on the quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market prices are not available,\nwe determine fair value by using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model. See Note 4, “Property and Equipment,” for a discussion of impairment charges.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - We utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated\ntransactions. Commonly, the types of risks being hedged are those relating to the variability of cash flows caused by fluctuations in interest rates. We document our risk\nmanagement strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of and during the term of each hedge. As of December 31, 2022, we utilized interest rate cap agreements to limit\nour exposure to increases in one-month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) rates above certain levels. See Note 6, “Long-Term Debt,” for further discussion of\nderivative instruments and hedging activities.\nGoodwill - Goodwill is recognized to the extent that the purchase price of the acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including other\nidentifiable intangible assets. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,” we test goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of October 1 of each\nyear) or more frequently if indications of impairment exist. The ASC also states that if an entity determines, based on an assessment of certain qualitative factors, that it is not\nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary.\nF-11"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor purposes of goodwill impairment testing, we have three reporting units, which consist of: (1) our traditional franchised dealerships, (2) our EchoPark stores and (3) our\npowersports stores. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference would represent the amount of the\nrequired goodwill impairment. As a result of our October 1, 2022 annual test, we determined that the carrying value of the EchoPark reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the\nreporting unit. We tested our reporting units for impairment using the DCF method that utilizes inputs, including projected revenues, margin, terminal growth rates, discount rates\nand a market capitalization reconciliation. We determined that the franchised dealership reporting unit passed by a significant margin, but the EchoPark reporting unit was\nimpaired. Based on this assessment, we determined that the EchoPark reporting unit goodwill amount of $202.9 million was fully impaired and recorded such impairment in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2022. We determined that no impairment existed for either the franchised dealerships or\npowersports reporting units as of October 1, 2022. After the effect of impairment charges, the carrying value of our goodwill totaled approximately $231.0 million at December\n31, 2022, approximately $221.8 million of which was related to our franchised dealership reporting unit and approximately $9.2 million of which was related to our powersports\nreporting unit.\nOther Intangible Assets - The principal identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill acquired in an acquisition are rights under franchise or dealer agreements with\nmanufacturers. We classify franchise and dealer agreements as indefinite lived intangible assets as it has been our experience that renewals have occurred without substantial cost\nor material modifications to the underlying agreements. As such, we believe that our franchise and dealer agreements will contribute to cash flows for an indefinite period,\ntherefore the carrying amount of franchise rights is not amortized. Franchise and dealer agreements acquired on or after July 1, 2001 have been included in other intangible assets,\nnet on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Prior to July 1, 2001, franchise and dealer agreements were recorded and amortized as part of goodwill and remain as part\nof goodwill on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,” we evaluate other intangible assets for\nimpairment annually (as of October 1 of each year) or more frequently if indications of impairment exist.\nWe utilized a multi-period excess earnings method (“MPEEM”) model to estimate the fair value of the franchise assets for each of our franchises with recorded franchise\nassets. The significant assumptions in our MPEEM model include projected revenue, projected operating margins, a discount rate (and estimates in the discount rate inputs) and\nresidual growth rates. Our estimate of future revenue growth is in part driven by our estimates of new vehicle industry sales volume in future periods. While not completely\ncorrelated, we believe the historic and projected industry sales volume is a good general indicator of growth or contraction in the retail automotive industry.\nAs a result of our impairment testing as of October 1, 2022, we determined that several of our recently acquired franchise assets’ fair values did not exceed the carrying\nvalues, resulting in $116.4 million in franchise asset impairment charges recorded in the consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2022. After the effect\nof impairment charges, the carrying value of our franchise assets totaled approximately $396.7 million at December 31, 2022, and is included in other intangible assets, net in the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheet as of such date. See Note 5, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” for further discussion of franchise and dealer agreements.\nIncome Taxes - Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently\ndue plus deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are provided at enacted tax rates for the tax effects of carryforward items and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and\nliabilities and their reported amounts. As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by various taxing authorities and, from time to time, these audits result in proposed\nassessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes. Management believes that the Company’s tax positions comply, in all material\nrespects, with applicable tax law and that the Company has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters.\nFrom time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the\ntax consequences of these transactions. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related\nappeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we\npresume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that does not meet the more-\nlikely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The tax position is measured at the\nlargest amount of benefit that is likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We adjust our estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the\nvarious taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent. See Note 7, “Income Taxes,” for further discussion of our uncertain tax positions. \nF-12"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nConcentrations of Credit and Business Risk - Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash on deposit with\nfinancial institutions, which may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited primarily to\nreceivables from automobile manufacturers, totaling approximately $68.1 million and $69.6 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and receivables from financial\ninstitutions (which include manufacturer-affiliated finance companies and commercial banks), totaling approximately $255.9 million and $175.2 million at December 31, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. Credit risk arising from trade receivables from commercial customers is reduced by the large number of customers comprising the trade receivables\nbalances.\nWe are subject to a concentration of risk in the event of financial distress or other adverse events related to any of the automobile manufacturers whose franchised\ndealerships are included in our brand portfolio. We purchase our new vehicle inventory from various automobile manufacturers at the prevailing prices available to all franchised\ndealerships. In addition, we finance a portion of our new and used vehicle inventory with manufacturer-affiliated finance companies. Our results of operations could be adversely\naffected by the manufacturers’ inability to supply our dealerships with an adequate supply of new vehicle inventory and related floor plan financing. We also have concentrations\nof risk related to the geographic markets in which our dealerships or stores operate. Changes in overall economic, retail automotive or regulatory environments in one or more of\nthese markets could adversely impact the results of our operations.\nFinancial Instruments and Market Risks - As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair values of our financial instruments, including receivables, notes receivable from\nfinance contracts, notes payable - floor plan, trade accounts payable, borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and certain mortgage notes, approximated their carrying\nvalues due either to length of maturity or existence of variable interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates. See Note 11, “Fair Value Measurements,” for further\ndiscussion of the fair value and carrying value of our fixed rate long-term debt and other financial instruments.\nWe have variable rate notes payable - floor plan, revolving credit facilities, a mortgage facility and other variable rate notes that expose us to risks caused by fluctuations\nin the underlying interest rates. We manage interest rate risk by entering into interest rate cap agreements. The counterparties to our interest rate cap agreements are large financial\ninstitutions; however, we could be exposed to loss in the event of non-performance by any of these counterparties. See further discussion in Note 6, “Long-Term Debt.”\nAdvertising - We expense advertising costs in the period incurred, net of earned cooperative manufacturer credits that represent reimbursements for specific, identifiable\nand incremental advertising costs. Advertising expense amounted to approximately $95.4 million, $61.6 million and $42.2 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is\nclassified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nWe have cooperative advertising reimbursement agreements with certain automobile manufacturers we represent. These agreements require us to provide the manufacturer\nwith support for qualified, actual advertising expenditures in order to receive reimbursement under the agreements. It is uncertain whether or not we would maintain the same\nlevel of advertising expenditures if these manufacturers discontinued their cooperative programs. Cooperative manufacturer credits classified as an offset to advertising expenses\nwere approximately $30.8 million, $22.1 million and $19.2 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSegment Information - For purposes of reporting financial condition and results of operations, we have determined that we have three reportable segments: (1) the\nFranchised Dealerships Segment; (2) the EchoPark Segment; and (3) the Powersports Segment. The Franchised Dealerships Segment provides comprehensive sales and services,\nincluding: (1) sales of both new and used cars and light trucks; (2) Fixed Operations activities; and (3) F&I services for our guests. The EchoPark Segment sells used cars and\nlight trucks and arranges third-party F&I product sales for our guests in pre-owned vehicle specialty retail locations, and does not offer customer-facing Fixed Operations\nservices. The Powersports Segment offers guests: (1) sales of both new and used powersports vehicles (such as motorcycles, personal watercraft and all-terrain vehicles); (2)\nFixed Operations activities; and (3) F&I services. All three segments generally operate independently of one another, with the exception of certain shared back-office functions\nand corporate overhead costs.\nEarnings Per Share - The calculation of diluted earnings per share considers the potential dilutive effect of restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and stock options\ngranted under Sonic’s stock compensation plans (and any non-forfeitable dividends paid on such awards), in addition to Class A Common Stock purchase warrants.\nF-13"

Business Acquisitions and Dispositions\nAcquisitions\nDuring 2022, we acquired two businesses in our Franchised Dealerships Segment and two businesses (consisting of eight locations) in our Powersports Segment for an\naggregate gross purchase price (including inventory acquired and subsequently funded by floor plan notes payable) of approximately $102.3 million, including a $14.7 million\nimpact of a post-close adjustment related to the RFJ Acquisition completed in December 2021. The allocation of the approximately $87.6 million aggregate gross purchase price\nfor the acquisitions completed during 2022 included inventory of approximately $31.0 million, property and equipment of approximately $0.5 million, franchise assets of\napproximately $33.2 million, goodwill of approximately $14.1 million, real estate of approximately $8.1 million, other assets of approximately $1.1 million, and liabilities of\napproximately $0.4 million. During 2021, we acquired 27 franchised dealership businesses and 14 pre-owned businesses for approximately $1,018.9 million. During 2020, we\nacquired two pre-owned businesses for approximately $19.7 million.\nResults of acquired dealerships are included in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income commencing on the date of acquisition. Our acquisitions are\naccounted for such that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their acquisition date fair values, with any excess of the consideration transferred over the\nestimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is an asset representing operational synergies and future economic benefits arising\nfrom other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. The fair value of our manufacturer franchise rights are\ndetermined as of the acquisition date, by discounting the projected cash flows specific to each franchise. This analysis includes projected revenue, projected operating margin, a\ndiscount rates (and estimates in the discount rate inputs) and residual growth rates.\nRFJ Acquisition\nOn December 6, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Sonic completed the acquisition of RFJ Auto Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “RFJ Auto”). On the Closing\nDate, RFJ Auto merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Sonic, with RFJ Auto surviving the merger and becoming a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Sonic (the\n“RFJ Acquisition”). In connection with the RFJ Acquisition, Sonic acquired RFJ Auto, which collectively have 33 automotive retail locations in seven states and a portfolio of 16\nautomotive brands. Beginning on the Closing Date, the results of 22 stores acquired in the RFJ Acquisition were included in our Franchised Dealerships Segment and 11\nNorthwest Motorsport pre-owned vehicle stores acquired in the RFJ Acquisition were included in our EchoPark Segment. The aggregate consideration for the RFJ Acquisition\nwas approximately $964.9 million, including a $14.7 million impact of a post-close adjustment, of which approximately $222.4 million was funded from borrowings under\nSonic’s syndicated new and used vehicle floor plan credit facilities.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on information\ncurrently available. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price based on final assessment of fair value:\nSummary of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\n(In millions)\nCash\n$\n9.4 \nReceivables\n31.4 \nInventories\n253.5 \nOther current assets\n7.8 \nProperty and equipment\n129.7 \nGoodwill\n177.1 \nFranchise assets\n398.2 \nTotal assets acquired\n$\n1,007.1 \nTrade accounts payable\n(5.3)\nOther accrued liabilities\n(36.9)\nTotal liabilities assumed\n$\n(42.2)\nNet assets acquired\n$\n964.9 \nWe recorded approximately $0.6 million and $3.0 million of acquisition related costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively,\nwhich are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nF-14"

Impairment charges were not material for 2021 and 2020.\n5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nPursuant to the applicable accounting pronouncements, we are required to evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually\n(as of October 1 of each year) or more frequently if indications of impairment exist. We utilized the DCF method, using unobservable inputs (Level 3) to estimate Sonic’s\nenterprise value as of October 1, 2022 and reconciled the discounted cash flows to Sonic’s market capitalization, using quoted market price inputs (Level 1). The significant\nassumptions in our DCF model include projected revenues and projected operating margins, a discount rate (and estimates in the discount rate inputs), control premium factors\nand residual growth rates. Based on our evaluation as of October 1, 2022, we determined the carrying value of the goodwill related to our EchoPark reporting unit was greater\nthan the fair value of the reporting unit. As a result, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $202.9 million to reduce the carrying value to fair value as of\nDecember 31, 2022. After the effect of impairment charges, the carrying value of our goodwill at our franchised dealerships reporting unit and powersports reporting unit totaled\napproximately $231.0 million at December 31, 2022, and is included in goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of such date.\nIn evaluating the recoverability of our indefinite lived franchise assets, we utilized a multi-period excess earnings method (“MPEEM”) model using unobservable inputs\n(Level 3) to estimate the fair value of the franchise assets for each of our franchises with recorded franchise assets. The significant assumptions in our MPEEM model include\nprojected revenue, projected operating margins, a discount rate (and estimates in the discount rate inputs) and residual growth rates. As a result of our impairment testing as of\nOctober 1, 2022, we determined that several of our franchise assets’ fair values did not exceed the carrying values, resulting in a non-cash pre-tax franchise asset impairment\ncharge of $116.4 million to reduce the carrying value to fair value as of December 31, 2022. After the effect of impairment charges, the carrying value of our franchise assets\ntotaled approximately $396.7 million at December 31, 2022, and is included in other intangible assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of such date.\nF-17"

On November 17, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the 2019 Mortgage Facility to, among other things, extend the scheduled maturity date to\nNovember 17, 2027.\nOn November 17, 2022, in connection with the closing of the amendment, the Company incurred a term loan under the 2019 Mortgage Facility with a principal amount of\n$320.0 million, with a portion of the proceeds used to repay the entire $77.6 million principal amount of the prior term loan. In addition, the lenders under the 2019 Mortgage\nFacility committed to providing, upon the terms set forth in the amendment and upon the pledging of sufficient collateral by the Company, delayed draw-term loans in an\naggregate principal amount up to $85.0 million (the “Delayed Draw Credit Facility”), and revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $95.0 million\noutstanding. On November 18, 2022, the Company incurred a term loan under the Delayed Draw Credit Facility with a principal amount of $7.0 million. The aggregate\ncommitments of the lenders under the 2019 Mortgage Facility equal a total of $500.0 million, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the 2019 Mortgage Facility, including\nthe appraisal and pledging of collateral of a specified value. The amendment also amended the 2019 Mortgage Facility to, among other things: (1) replace the 2019 Mortgage\nFacility’s LIBOR-based Eurodollar reference interest rate option with a reference interest rate option based upon one-month Term SOFR (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage\nFacility); and (2) make changes to the pricing grid for loans incurred under the 2019 Mortgage Facility, which price is based on an incremental interest margin calculated based\non the Company’s Consolidated Total Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility).\nUnder the 2019 Mortgage Facility, Sonic has a maximum borrowing limit of $500.0 million, which varies based on the appraised value of the collateral underlying the\n2019 Mortgage Facility. Based on balances as of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $327.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2019 Mortgage Facility and\nadditional lender commitments of $173.0 million subject to the appraisal and pledging of additional collateral.\nAmounts outstanding under the 2019 Mortgage Facility bear interest at: (1) a specified rate above one-month Term SOFR (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility),\nranging from 1.25% to 2.25% per annum according to a performance-based pricing grid determined by the Company’s Consolidated Total Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio as of\nthe last day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter (the “Performance Grid”); or (2) a specified rate above the Base Rate (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility), ranging\nfrom 0.25% to 1.25% per annum according to the Performance Grid. Interest on the 2019 Mortgage Facility is paid monthly in arrears calculated using the Base Rate plus the\nApplicable Rate (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility) according to the Performance Grid. Scheduled repayment of outstanding principal is paid quarterly commencing on\nMarch 31, 2023 through December 31, 2024 at a rate of 1.25% of the aggregate initial principal amount, and increases to 1.875% in March 2025 until the maturity date at\nNovember 17, 2027. A balloon payment of the remaining balance will be due at the November 17, 2027 maturity date. Prior to the November 17, 2027 maturity date, the\nCompany reserves the right to prepay the principal amount outstanding at any time without premium or penalty provided the prepayment amount exceeds $0.5 million. Additional\ndividends are permitted subject to the limitations on restricted payments set forth in the 2021 Credit Facilities.\nF-21"

The “EIN/Pension Plan Number” column provides the Employee\nIdentification Number (the “EIN”). Unless otherwise noted, the most recent Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the “PPA”) zone status available in the years ended December 31,\n2022 and 2021 is for the plan’s year-end at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The zone status is based on information that we received from the AI Pension Plan.\nAmong other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded (“Critical Status”), plans in the yellow zone are less than 80% funded and plans in the green zone\nare at least 80% funded. The “FIP/RP Status - Pending/Implemented” column indicates plans for which a Financial Improvement Plan (“FIP”) or a Rehabilitation Plan (“RP”) is\neither pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration dates of the collective bargaining agreements to which the plan is subject. The number of employees\ncovered by the AI Pension Plan decreased 8.5% from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 and increased 4.3% from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022, affecting\nthe period-to-period comparability of the contributions for 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nPension\nProtection\nAct Zone\nStatus\nFIP/RP Status\nSonic Contributions\nSurcharge\nImposed\nCollective Bargaining\nAgreement Expiration Date\nPension Fund\nEIN/Pension Plan\nNumber\n2022\n2021\nPending /Implemented\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\n(In millions)\nAI Pension Plan\n94-1133245\nRed\nRed\nRP Implemented\n$0.2\n$0.1\n$0.2\nYes\nBetween\nNovember 2024\nand January 2025\nOur participating dealership subsidiaries were not listed in the AI Pension Plan’s Form 5500 as providing more than 5% of the total contributions for the plan years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. In June 2006, we received information that the AI Pension Plan was substantially underfunded as of December 31, 2005. In July 2007, we received\nupdated information that the AI Pension Plan continued to be substantially underfunded as of December 31, 2006, with the amount of such underfunding increasing versus year\nend 2005. In March 2008, the Board of Trustees of the AI Pension Plan notified participants, participating employers and local unions that the AI Pension Plan’s actuary, in\naccordance with the requirements of the PPA, had issued a certification that the AI Pension Plan was in Critical Status effective with the plan year commencing January 1, 2008.\nIn conjunction with the AI Pension Plan’s Critical Status, the Board of Trustees of the AI Pension Plan adopted a RP that implemented reductions or eliminations of certain\nadjustable benefits that were previously available under the AI Pension Plan (including some forms of early retirement benefits, and disability and death benefits, among other\nitems), and also implemented a requirement on all participating employers to increase employer contributions to the AI Pension Plan for a seven-year period which commenced in\n2013. As of April 2015, the AI Pension Plan’s actuary certified that the AI Pension Plan remained in Critical Status for the plan year commencing January 1, 2015. According to\npublicly available information, in September 2016, the AI Pension Plan made a formal application for approval of suspension of benefits with the U.S. Treasury Department,\nwhich, if approved by the U.S. Treasury Department, would have implemented a benefit reduction effective July 1, 2017 for participants in the AI Pension Plan. The filing\nincluded an Actuarial Certification of Plan Status as of January 1, 2016 that the AI Pension Plan previously filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on March 30, 2016,\nwhich reported that the AI Pension Plan was in critical and declining status as of January 1, 2016 and further notified that the AI Pension Plan is making the scheduled progress in\nmeeting the requirements of the plan’s previously adopted RP. The September 2016 filing with the U.S. Treasury Department also included an Actuarial Certification of Plan\nSolvency as of July 1, 2016 with the actuarial firm’s projection that the proposed suspensions of benefits are reasonably estimated to enable the AI Pension Plan to avoid\ninsolvency assuming the proposed suspensions of benefits continue indefinitely. In May 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department denied the application to suspend benefits but noted\nthat it remains willing to discuss the issues presented in the September 2016 formal application for suspension of benefits. As of April 2019, the AI Pension Plan’s actuary\ncertified that the AI Pension Plan remained in Critical Status for the plan year commencing January 1, 2019 and is projected to become insolvent in 2031. Under applicable\nfederal law, any employer contributing to a multiemployer pension plan that completely ceases participating in the plan while the plan is underfunded is subject to payment of\nsuch employer’s assessed share of the aggregate unfunded vested benefits of the plan. In certain circumstances, an employer can be assessed withdrawal liability for a partial\nwithdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan. In addition, if the financial condition of the AI Pension Plan were to continue to deteriorate to the point that the AI Pension Plan is\nforced to terminate and be administered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the “PBGC”), the participating employers could be subject to assessments by the PBGC to\ncover the participating employers’ assessed share of the unfunded vested benefits. If any of these adverse events were to occur in the future, it could result in a substantial\nwithdrawal liability assessment to us.\nF-29"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n11. Fair Value Measurements\nIn determining fair value, Sonic uses various valuation approaches, including market, income and/or cost approaches. “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” in the\nASC establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that\nthe most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market\ndata obtained from sources independent of Sonic. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect Sonic’s assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing\nthe asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as\nfollows:\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that Sonic has the ability to access. Assets utilizing Level 1 inputs include\nmarketable securities that are actively traded, including Sonic’s stock or public bonds.\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. Assets and\nliabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include cash flow swap instruments and deferred compensation plan balances.\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Asset and liability measurements utilizing Level 3 inputs\ninclude those used in estimating fair value of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities in purchase acquisitions, those used in assessing impairment of right-of-use assets\n(“ROU assets”), property, plant and equipment and other intangibles, and those used in the reporting unit valuation in the goodwill impairment evaluation.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a wide variety of factors. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable\nor unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment required by Sonic in determining fair value is greatest\nfor assets and liabilities categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for\ndisclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is disclosed is determined based on the lowest level input (Level 3 being the\nlowest level) that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity-specific\nmeasure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, Sonic’s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the\nasset or liability at the measurement date. Sonic uses inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods when the market may be abnormally high or\nabnormally low. Accordingly, fair value measurements can be volatile based on various factors that may or may not be within Sonic’s control.\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n \nFair Value Based on\nSignificant Other Observable\nInputs (Level 2)\n \nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\n \n(In millions)\nAssets:\n \n \nCash surrender value of life insurance policies (1)\n$\n38.2 \n$\n39.5 \nTotal assets\n$\n38.2 \n$\n39.5 \nLiabilities:\nDeferred compensation plan (2)\n$\n21.1 \n$\n24.4 \nTotal liabilities\n$\n21.1 \n$\n24.4 \n(1) Included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n(2) Included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nF-30"

In addition, we have\ngenerally agreed to indemnify the lessor in the event of a breach of the lease by the lessee.\nIn connection with dealership dispositions and facility relocations, certain of our subsidiaries have assigned or sublet to the buyer their interests in real property leases\nassociated with such dealerships. In general, the subsidiaries retain responsibility for the performance of certain obligations under such leases, including rent payments and repairs\nto leased property upon termination of the lease, to the extent that the assignee or the sublessee does not perform. In the event an assignee or a sublessee does not perform its\nobligations, Sonic remains liable for such obligations.\nF-31"

Leases\nThe majority of our leases are related to dealership properties that are subject to long-term lease arrangements. In addition, we have certain equipment leases and contracts\ncontaining embedded leased assets that have been evaluated and included in the recorded Right of Use assets (“ROU”) asset and lease liabilities as appropriate.\nThe ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease\ncommencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred or previously recognized favorable lease assets, less any lease incentives received or previously recognized lease exit\naccruals. For operating leases, the ROU asset is subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus\n(minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the lease term. For finance leases, the ROU asset is reduced using the straight-line method from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of its useful life or the\nend of the lease term unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to us or we are reasonably certain to exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset. In those\ncases, the ROU asset is reduced over the expected useful life of the underlying asset. Expense related to the reduction of the ROU asset is recognized and presented separately\nfrom interest expense on the lease liability.\nVariable lease payments associated with our leases are recognized when the event, activity or circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed\noccurs. Variable lease payments are presented as operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the same line item as expense arising from fixed lease\npayments (operating leases) or expense related to the reduction of the ROU asset (finance leases).\nROU assets for operating and finance leases are periodically reduced by impairment losses. We use the long-lived assets impairment guidance in ASC Topic 360,\n“Property, Plant, and Equipment,” to determine whether the ROU asset is impaired and, if so, the amount of the impairment loss to recognize.\nWe regularly monitor events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of one of our leases. When a reassessment results in the remeasurement of a\nlease liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the corresponding ROU asset unless doing so would reduce the carrying amount of the ROU asset to\nan amount less than zero. In that case, the amount of the adjustment that would result in a negative ROU asset balance is recorded in profit or loss.\nKey estimates and judgments related to the measurement and recording of ROU assets and lease liabilities include how we determine: (1) the discount rate used to\ndiscount the unpaid lease payments to present value; and (2) the expected lease term, including any extension options.\nF-36"

      "text": "SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nASC Topic 842, “Leases,” requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its\nincremental borrowing rate. Generally, we cannot determine the interest rate implicit in the lease because we do not have access to the lessor’s estimated residual value or the\namount of the lessor’s deferred initial direct costs. Therefore, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease. We determined the discount rate\nfor our leases based on the risk-free rate as of the measurement date for varying maturities corresponding to the remaining lease term, adjusted for the risk-premium attributed to\nSonic’s corporate credit rating for a secured or collateralized instrument.\nMany of our lease arrangements have one or more existing renewal options to extend the lease term (typically in five- to 10-year increments), which were considered in the\ncalculation of the ROU assets and lease liabilities if we determined that it was reasonably certain that an extension option would be exercised. The lease term for all of the\nCompany’s leases includes the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by our option to extend the lease that we are reasonably certain to exercise.\nWe determine the probability of the exercise of a lease extension option based on our long-term strategic business outlook and the condition and remaining useful life of the fixed\nassets at the location subject to the lease agreement, among other factors.\nThe majority of our lease agreements require fixed monthly payments (subject to either specific or index-based escalations in future periods) while other agreements\nrequire variable lease payments based on changes in LIBOR or any replacement thereof. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the: (1) fixed\nlease payments, including in-substance fixed payments, owed over the lease term, which include termination penalties we would owe if the estimated lease term assumes that we\nwould be likely to exercise a termination option prior to the earliest expiration date; (2) variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index\nor rate at the lease commencement date; and (3) the exercise price of our option to purchase the underlying asset if we are reasonably certain to exercise the option. Our leases do\nnot typically contain residual value guarantees.\nIn certain situations, we have entered into sublease agreements whereby we sublease all or a portion of a leased real estate asset to a third party. To the extent that we have\na sublease related to a lease agreement for an asset that we are no longer using in operations, we have reduced the ROU asset by any applicable net deficiency in expected cash\nflows from that sublease (either due to partial monthly sublease proceeds or a sublease term less than the remaining master lease term). ASC Topic 842 also provides practical\nexpedients for ongoing accounting. We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for our real estate and equipment leases, which means that for those leases that qualify,\nwe do not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities and recognize the expense related to the short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term and any variable lease\npayments in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. We have also elected the practical expedient that allows us not to separate non-lease components of\nan agreement from lease components (for certain non-real estate assets).\nFollowing is information related to lease expenses and other lease-related information for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2022\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2021\nLease Expense\n(In millions)\nFinance lease expense\nReduction of right-of-use assets\n$\n13.6 \n$\n7.2 \nInterest on lease liabilities\n13.1 \n7.4 \nOperating lease expense (1)\n54.8 \n61.5 \nShort-term lease expense\n0.7 \n1.7 \nVariable lease expense\n9.0 \n9.3 \nSublease income\n(5.5)\n(8.3)\nTotal\n$\n85.7 \n$\n78.8 \n(1) Included in operating cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.\nF-37"
