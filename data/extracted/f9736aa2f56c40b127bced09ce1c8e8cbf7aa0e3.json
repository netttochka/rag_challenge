BUSINESS\nNeoGenomics, Inc., a Nevada corporation (referred to individually as the “Parent Company” or collectively with its subsidiaries as “NeoGenomics”, “we”, “us”, “our”, or\nthe “Company” in this Annual Report) is the registrant for SEC reporting purposes. Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol\n“NEO”.\nOverview\nWe provide a wide range of oncology diagnostic testing and consultative services which include technical laboratory services and professional interpretation of laboratory test\nresults by licensed physicians who specialize in pathology and oncology. We operate a network of cancer-focused testing laboratories in the United States, Europe and Asia. Our\nmission is to save lives by improving patient care. Our vision is become the world’s leading cancer testing, information, and decision support company by providing\nuncompromising quality, exceptional service, and innovative solutions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company operated College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) accredited and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”)\ncertified laboratories in Fort Myers, Florida; Aliso Viejo and San Diego, California; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and Houston, Texas; and CAP accredited full-\nservice, sample-processing laboratories in Rolle, Switzerland; Singapore and China. CAP accreditation is pending in Cambridge, United Kingdom. We also have several, small,\nnon-processing laboratory locations across the United States for providing analysis services. We currently offer the following types of testing services:\n•\nCytogenetics (“karyotype analysis”) – the study of normal and abnormal chromosomes and their relationship to disease. Cytogenetics involves analyzing the\nchromosome structure to identify changes from patterns seen in normal chromosomes. Cytogenetic studies are often performed to provide diagnostic, prognostic and\noccasionally predictive information for patients with hematological malignancies.\n•\nFluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (“FISH”) – a molecular cytogenetic technique that focuses on detecting and localizing the presence or absence of specific DNA\nsequences and genes on chromosomes. The technique uses fluorescent probes that bind to only those parts of the chromosome with which they show a high degree of\nsequence similarity. Fluorescence microscopy is used to visualize the fluorescent probes bound to the chromosomes. FISH can be used to help identify numerous types\nof gene alterations, including amplifications, deletions, and translocations.\n•\nFlow cytometry – a technique utilized to measure the characteristics of cell populations. Typically performed on liquid samples such as peripheral blood and bone\nmarrow aspirate, it may also be performed on solid tissue samples such as lymph nodes following additional processing steps. Cells are labeled with selective fluorescent\nantibodies and analyzed as they flow in a fluid stream through a beam of light. The properties measured in these antibodies include the relative size, relative granularity\nor internal complexity, and relative fluorescence intensity. These fluorescent antibodies bind to specific cellular antigens and are used to identify abnormal and/or\nmalignant cell populations. Flow cytometry is typically utilized in diagnosing a wide variety of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms. Flow cytometry is also used to\nmonitor patients during the course of therapy to identify extremely low levels of residual malignant cells, known as minimal residual disease (“MRD”) monitoring.\n•\nImmunohistochemistry (“IHC”) and Digital Imaging – the process of localizing cellular proteins in tissue sections and relies on the principle of antigen-antibody binding.\nIHC is widely used in the diagnosis of abnormal cells such as those found in cancer. Specific surface membrane, cytoplasmic, or nuclear markers may be identified. IHC\nis also widely used to understand the distribution and localization of differentially expressed proteins. Digital imaging allows clients to visualize scanned slides and also\nperform quantitative analysis for certain stains. Scanned slides are received online in real time and can be previewed often a full day before the glass slides can be\nshipped back to clients.\n•\nMolecular testing – a rapidly growing field which includes a broad range of laboratory techniques utilized in cancer testing. Most molecular techniques rely on the\nanalysis of DNA and/or RNA, as well as the structure and function of genes at the molecular level. Molecular testing technologies include: liquid biopsy tests for\nadvanced non-small cell lung cancer, all solid tumor types (pan-cancer), and certain breast cancer cases; DNA fragment length analysis; polymerase chain reaction\n(“PCR”) analysis; reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (“RT-PCR”) analysis, real-time (or quantitative) polymerase chain reaction (“qPCR”) analysis; bi-\ndirectional Sanger sequencing analysis; and next-generation sequencing (“NGS”) analysis.\n•\nMorphologic analysis – the process of analyzing cells under the microscope by a pathologist, usually for the purpose of diagnosis. Morphologic analysis may be\nperformed on a wide variety of samples, such as peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymph node, and from other sites such as lung, breast, etc. The services provided at\nNeoGenomics may\n4"

In the latter setting, the expert pathologists at NeoGenomics assist our\nclient pathologists on their most difficult and complex cases.\nReportable Segments\nWe have analyzed our reporting structure, the information available to our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and the information being used to make strategic\ndecisions and have identified two primary types of customers: Clinical and Pharma. Our Clinical customers include community-based pathology and oncology practices,\nhospital pathology labs, reference labs, and academic centers. Our Pharma customers include pharmaceutical companies to whom we provide testing and other services to\nsupport their research studies and clinical trials.\nIn 2022, our Clinical Services segment accounted for 82% of consolidated revenue and our Pharma Services segment accounted for 18% of consolidated revenue. Please refer\nto Note 20. Segment Information, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further financial information about these segments.\nClinical Services Segment\nThe clinical cancer testing services we offer to community-based pathologists and oncologists are designed to be a natural extension of, and complementary to, the services that\nthey perform within their own practices. We believe our relationship as a non-competitive partner to community-based pathology practices, hospital pathology labs, reference\nlabs, and academic centers can empower them to expand their breadth of testing to provide a menu of services that could match or exceed the level of service found in any\ncenter of excellence around the world. Community-based pathology practices and hospital pathology labs may order certain testing services on a technical component only\n(“TC” or “tech-only”) basis, which allows them to participate in the diagnostic process by performing the professional component (“PC”) interpretation services without having\nto hire laboratory technologists or purchase the sophisticated equipment needed to perform the technical component of the tests. We also support our pathology clients with\ninterpretation and consultative services using our own specialized team of pathologists for difficult or complex cases and we provide overflow interpretation services when\nrequested by clients.\nWe are a leading provider of Molecular and NGS testing. These tests are interpreted by NeoGenomics’ team of Molecular experts and are often ordered in conjunction with\nother testing modalities. NGS panels are one of our fastest growing testing areas and clients can often receive a significant amount of biomarker information from very limited\nsamples. These comprehensive panels can allow for faster treatment decisions for patients as compared to a series of single-gene molecular tests being ordered sequentially. We\nhave a broad Molecular testing menu and our targeted NeoTYPE panels include genes relevant to a particular cancer type. These tests are complemented by IHC and FISH\ntests. In addition, we offer molecular-only NGS targeted and comprehensive panels which combine DNA and RNA into a single work stream in order to report a full spectrum\nof genomic alterations, including mutations, fusions, copy number variations, and gene expression. This comprehensive menu means that our clients can get most of their\noncology testing needs satisfied by our laboratory. This is attractive to our clients as patient samples do not need to be split and then managed across several laboratories. The\nacquisition of Inivata provided us with oncology Liquid Biopsy technology capabilities. InVisionFirst -Lung is a highly sensitive, targeted plasma-based assay for patients with\nnon-small cell lung cancer, and RaDaR  is an industry-leading liquid biopsy assay designed to detect residual disease and recurrence in plasma samples from patients with solid\ntumor malignancies. We expect our Molecular laboratory and NGS capabilities to be a key growth driver in the coming years.\nIn addition, we directly serve oncology, dermatology and other clinician practices that prefer to have a direct relationship with a laboratory for cancer-related genetic testing\nservices. We typically serve these types of clients with a comprehensive service offering where we perform both the technical and professional components of the tests ordered.\nIn certain instances, larger clinician practices have begun to internalize pathology interpretation services, and our tech-only service offering allows these larger clinician\npractices to also participate in the diagnostic process by performing the PC interpretation services on TC testing performed by us.\nPharma Services Segment\nOur Pharma Services revenue consists of the following three revenue streams:\n•\nClinical trials and research;\n•\nValidation laboratory services; and\n•\nInformatics.\nOur Pharma Services segment supports pharmaceutical firms in their drug development programs by supporting various clinical trials and research. This portion of our business\noften involves working with the pharmaceutical firms (“sponsors”)\n®\n®\n5"

Our medical team often advises the sponsor and works closely with them as specimens are received from the enrolled\nsites. We also work on developing tests that will be used as part of a companion diagnostic to determine patients’ response to a particular drug. As studies unfold, our clinical\ntrials team reports the data and often provides key analysis and insights back to the sponsors.\nOur Pharma Services segment provides comprehensive testing services in support of our pharmaceutical clients’ oncology programs from discovery to commercialization. In\nbiomarker discovery, our aim is to help our customers discover the right content. We help our customers develop a biomarker hypothesis by recommending an optimal platform\nfor molecular screening and backing our discovery tools with the informatics to capture meaningful data. In other pre-clinical and non-clinical work, we can use our platforms to\ncharacterize markers of interest. Moving from discovery to development, we seek to help our customers refine their biomarker strategy and, if applicable, develop a companion\ndiagnostic pathway using the optimal technology for large-scale clinical trial testing.\nWhether serving as the single contract research organization or partnering with one, our Pharma Services team provides significant technical expertise, working closely with our\ncustomers to support each stage of clinical trial development. Each trial we support comes with rapid turnaround time, dedicated project management and quality assurance\noversight. We have experience in supporting submissions to the Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) for companion diagnostics. Our Pharma Services strategy is focused on\nhelping to bring more effective oncology treatments to market through providing world-class laboratory services in oncology to key pharmaceutical companies in the industry.\nWe believe that we are well positioned to service Pharma sponsors across the full continuum of the drug development process. Our Pharma Services team can work with these\nsponsors during the basic research and development phase as compounds come out of translational research departments, as well as work with clients from Phase I, Phase II and\nPhase III clinical trials as the sponsors work to demonstrate the efficacy of their drugs. The laboratory biomarker tests that are developed during this process may become\ncompanion diagnostic (“CDx”) tests, that will be used on patients to determine if they could respond to a certain therapy. We are able to offer these CDx tests to the market\nimmediately after FDA approval as part of our Day 1 readiness program. This ability helps to speed the commercialization of a drug and can enable Pharma sponsors to reach\npatients through our broad distribution channel in the Clinical Services segment.\nWe are committed to connecting patients with life-altering therapies and trials. In carrying out these commitments, we aim to provide transparency and choice to patients\nregarding the handling and use of their data through our Notice of Privacy Practices, and have invested in leading technologies to ensure the data we maintain is secure at all\ntimes. We are continuing to develop and broaden our informatics and data-related tools to leverage our unique market position and oncology expertise to help our stakeholders\nsolve real-world problems such as identifying patients for clinical trials or providing clinical decision support tools for physicians and providers.\nMarkets\nThe medical testing laboratory market can be broken down into the following three primary markets:\n•\nClinical Pathology testing;\n•\nAnatomic Pathology testing; and\n•\nGenetic and Molecular testing.\nClinical Pathology testing covers high volume, highly automated, lower complexity tests on easily procured specimens such as blood and urine. Clinical Pathology tests often\ninvolve testing of a less urgent nature, for example, cholesterol testing and testing associated with routine physical exams.\nAnatomic Pathology testing involves evaluation of tissue, as in surgical pathology, or cells as in cytopathology. The most widely performed Anatomic Pathology procedures\ninclude the preparation and interpretation of pap smears, skin biopsies, and tissue biopsies.\nGenetic and Molecular testing typically involves analyzing chromosomes, genes, proteins, and/or DNA/RNA sequences for abnormalities. Genetic and molecular testing\nrequires highly specialized equipment and credentialed individuals (typically MD or PhD level) to certify results and typically yields the highest reimbursement levels of the\nthree market segments.\nNeoGenomics operates primarily in the Genetic and Molecular testing market. We also act as a reference laboratory supplying Anatomic Pathology testing.\nThe field of cancer genetics is evolving rapidly and new tests continue to be developed at an accelerated pace. Based on medical and scientific discoveries over the last decade,\ncancer testing falls into one of three categories: diagnostic testing, prognostic testing and predictive testing. Of the three, the fastest growing area is predictive testing, which is\nutilized by\n6"

Personalized or precision medicine better allows clinicians to know if a patient will or will not respond to certain cancer medications like\nHerceptin®, Keytruda®, PIQRAY®, and Opdivo®, among many others. In addition to the direct benefits to patients, the “precision medicine” approach allows the healthcare\nsystem to save money by ensuring that expensive cancer drugs are only given to those who will be most likely to benefit from them. This type of testing improves patient care\nand potentially saves lives by identifying optimized therapies much more rapidly than what was possible in previous years.\nThe U.S. market for genetic and molecular testing is divided among numerous laboratories. Many of these laboratories are attached to academic institutions and primarily\nprovide clinical services to their affiliated university hospitals and associated physicians.\nWe believe several key factors are influencing the rapid growth in the market for cancer testing: (i) every year, more and more genes and genomic pathways are implicated in\nthe development and/or clinical course of cancer; (ii) cancer is primarily a disease of the elderly – one in four senior citizens is likely to develop some form of cancer during the\nrest of their lifetime once they turn sixty, and now that the baby boomer generation has started to reach this age range, the incidence rates of cancer are rising; (iii) increasingly,\nnew drugs are being targeted to certain cancer subtypes and pathways which require companion diagnostic testing; (iv) patient and payer awareness of the value of genetic and\nmolecular testing; (v) decreases in the cost of performing genetic and molecular testing; (vi) increased coverage from third party payers and Medicare for such testing; and\n(vii) the health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation\nAct, each enacted in March 2010. These factors have driven significant growth in the market for this type of testing. Additionally, there is an increased focus on developing tests\nfor monitoring purposes, including MRD and recurrence detection in cancer survivors, which could also broaden the use of certain tests and influence the market for cancer\ntesting.\n2023 Focus Areas:\nWe are committed to sustainable growth while transforming cancer care for patients and providers. Our focus for 2023 is to sustain a purpose driven culture that maintains\nexcellence in service and performance while growing through innovation. We expect the following initiatives to allow the Company to continue on its path to become one of the\nworld’s leading cancer testing and information companies:\nProfitably Grow Core Business\n•\nGrow volume and NGS mix;\n•\nImprove turnaround time;\n•\nWin on service;\n•\nExpand and optimize commercial optimization; and\n•\nImprove product offering.\nAccelerate Advanced Diagnostics\n•\nExecute clinical RaDaR™ (MRD) launch;\n•\nLaunch Neo Comprehensive, new NGS offering;\n•\nContinue to improve Pharma growth and profitability; and\n•\nFocus on enterprise data strategy.\nImprove Profitability\n•\nIncrease productivity and efficiency;\n•\nManage general and administrative spend;\n•\nFocused investments; and\n•\nPrioritize revenue cycle management.\nCompetitive Strengths\nIn addition to the competitive strengths discussed below, we believe that our superior testing technologies and instrumentation, laboratory information system, client education\nprograms and broad domestic and international presence also differentiates NeoGenomics from its competitors.\n7"

By providing information to our clients in a\ntimely manner, physicians can begin treating their patients as soon as possible. Timeliness of results by our Clinical Services segment is a driver of additional testing requests by\nreferring physicians. Turnaround times allow for the performance of other adjunctive tests within an acceptable diagnosis window in order to augment or confirm results and\nmore fully inform treatment options. Additionally, we believe that our rapid turnaround time on testing and our project milestones are a key factor in our Pharma Services\nsegment.\nInnovative Service Offerings\nWe believe we currently have the most extensive menu of tech-only FISH services in the country as well as extensive and advanced tech-only flow cytometry and IHC testing\nservices. These types of testing services allow the professional interpretation component of a test to be performed and billed separately by our physician clients. Our tech-only\nservices are designed to give pathologists the option to choose, on a case by case basis, whether they want to order only the technical component of testing so they can perform\nthe professional interpretation, or order “global” services and receive a comprehensive test report which includes a NeoGenomics pathologist’s interpretation of the test results.\nOur clients appreciate the flexibility to access NeoGenomics’ medical staff for difficult or complex cases or when they are otherwise unavailable to perform professional\ninterpretations.\nWe offer a comprehensive suite of technical and professional interpretation services to meet the needs of clients who are not credentialed and/or trained in interpreting various\ntesting modalities and who require Neo pathology specialists to interpret their testing results. In our global service offerings, our lab performs the technical component of testing\nand our MDs and PhDs provide the professional component of testing by interpreting the results of those tests. Our professional staff is also available for post-test consultative\nservices. Clients using our global service offering rely on the expertise of our medical team to give them the answers they need in a timely manner to help inform their diagnoses\nand treatment decisions.\nOur Molecular and NGS test menus provide clients with the ability to order single gene molecular tests, targeted NeoTYPE panels that include the relevant actionable genes for\na particular cancer type as well as large NGS panels. Our Pharma Services segment offers a full range of sequencing testing including whole exome and whole genome\nsequencing.\nNational Direct Sales Force\nOur direct sales force has been trained extensively in cancer genetic testing and consultative selling skills to service the needs of clients. Our sales team for the clinical cancer\ntesting services is organized into nine regions – Northeast, Northwest, Mid-Atlantic, South, Southeast, Southwest, West, Great Lakes, and South Central. Our sales team will be\nfocused on end-to-end client experience as a growth driver. Our Pharma Services segment has a dedicated team of business development specialists who are experienced in\nworking with Pharma sponsors and helping them with the testing needs of their research and development projects as well as Phase I, II and III studies. These sales\nrepresentatives utilize our custom Customer Relationship Management System (“CRM”) to manage their territories, and we have integrated the key customer care functionality\nwithin our Laboratory Information Services (“LIS”) into the CRM so that our sales representatives can stay informed of emerging issues and opportunities within their regions.\nOur in-house customer care team is aligned with our field sales team to serve the needs of our clients by utilizing the same LIS and CRM. Our field teams can see in real-time\nwhen a client calls the laboratory, the reason for the call, the resolution, and if face-to-face interaction is needed for follow-up. Our sales force educates clients on new test\nofferings and their proper utilization and our representatives are often seen as trusted advisors by our clients.\nSeasonality\nThe majority of our clinical testing volume is dependent on patients being treated by hematology/oncology professionals and other healthcare providers. The volume of our\ntesting services generally declines modestly during the summer vacation season, year-end holiday periods and other major holidays, particularly when those holidays fall during\nthe middle of the week. In addition, the volume of our testing tends to decline due to extreme adverse weather conditions, such as excessively hot or cold spells, heavy snow,\nhurricanes or tornadoes in certain regions, consequently reducing revenues and cash flows in any affected period.\nIn our Pharma Services segment, we enter into both short-term and long-term contracts, ranging from one month to several years. While the volume of this testing is not as\ndirectly affected by seasonality as described above, the testing volume does vary based on the terms of the contract. Our volumes are often based on how quickly sponsors can\nget patient enrollees for their trials and seasonality can impact how quickly patients are enrolled. Many of our long-term contracts contain specific performance obligations\nwhere the testing is performed on a specific schedule. In addition, this results in backlog that can be\n8"

Competitive factors in genetic and molecular testing generally include the reputation of the laboratory, range of services offered,\npricing, convenience of sample collection and pick-up, quality of analysis and reporting, medical staff, timeliness of delivery of completed reports (i.e. turnaround times) and\npost-reporting follow-up for clients.\nOur competitors for our Clinical Services segment in the United States are numerous and include major national medical testing laboratories, hospital laboratories and in-house\nphysician laboratories. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and production capabilities than us. These companies may succeed in developing service\nofferings that are more effective than any that we have or may develop, and may also prove to be more successful than we are in marketing such services. In addition,\ntechnological advances or different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors may render our service offerings obsolete, less effective or uneconomical.\nWe intend to continue our efforts to gain market share by offering rapid turnaround times, a broad service menu, high-quality test reports, new tests including proprietary ones,\nenhanced post-test consultation services, and personal attention from our direct sales force. In addition, we believe our flexible reporting solutions, which enable clients to report\nout customized results in a secure, real-time environment, will allow us to continue to gain market share.\nOur Pharma Services business competes against many other Contract Resource Organizations (“CROs”) and central reference laboratories. Many of these competitors are much\nlarger and have a greater international presence than we do. Over the past few years, we have expanded our Pharma Services business into Europe and Asia at the request of our\nclients and we believe that our expansive oncology testing menu and our high level of service along with our international expansion will allow us to continue to gain market\nshare in this segment.\nOur Pharma Services segment competitors are numerous CROs. These competitors are larger than NeoGenomics and have global operations including operations in some\nregions where we do not yet have service capabilities. These laboratories may be more effective than us in gaining business for global clinical trials. Many clinical reference\nlaboratories have also entered the space in support of clinical trials and the related laboratory testing. These reference laboratories are often willing to compete with lower\npricing for smaller, more limited studies. We believe our strong scientific and medical team is a key differentiator where NeoGenomics is used as an advisor to the sponsors on\ntheir trials. Our extensive experience in anatomic pathology continues to result in our winning clinical trials business as sponsors trust our medical team and want them to\nclosely oversee their trials. We believe our service focus and our molecular and IHC platforms, as well as our exclusive MultiOmyx\n platform will continue to lead to rapid\ngrowth in this segment.\nSuppliers\nWe order our laboratory and research supplies from large national laboratory supply companies. While we do not depend on a concentrated, limited number of suppliers, we do\nrely on certain suppliers for specific reagents or other equipment, including sequencers. We have experienced increase in supply chain disruptions and delays in obtaining\nreagents and basic laboratory supplies in 2021 and 2022. While we do not believe a short-term disruption from any one of these suppliers would have a material effect on our\nbusiness, it could result in short-term impact on our turnaround time or gross margin depending on the nature of or extent of the disruption.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to revenue and accounts receivable are primarily limited to certain clients to which we provide a significant volume of our services,\nand to specific payers of our services such as Medicare and individual insurance companies.\nDependence on Major Clients\nWe market our services to pathologists, oncologists, other clinicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, academic centers and other clinical laboratories throughout the\nUnited States, Europe and Asia. Our client base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed clients diversified across various customer types. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, no single client accounted for more than 10% of revenue.\nTM\n9"

As of December 31, 2022, we employed or contracted with\napproximately 170 MDs and PhDs. We have many nationally and world-renowned pathologists on staff, which is a key differentiator from many smaller laboratories. Our\nclinical customers look to our staff and their expertise and they often call our medical team on challenging cases. For our Pharma Services segment, many sponsors work with\nour medical team on their study design and on the interpretation of results from the studies. Our medical team is a key differentiator as we have a depth of medical expertise that\nmany other laboratories cannot offer to pharmaceutical companies.\nWorld-Class Culture\nWe promote a World-Class Culture through Employee Engagement, Training and Development, Wellness, Work-Life Balance, and Communication initiatives.

We\ncontinuingly strive to promote a workplace in which people of diverse race, ethnicity, veteran status, marital status, socio-economic level, national origin, religious belief,\nphysical ability, sexual orientation, age, class, political ideology, gender identity and expression participate in, contribute to, and benefit equally.\nWe are also committed to rewarding, supporting and developing our employees as they work toward our common purposes of saving lives by improving patient care. To that\nend, we offer a competitive comprehensive rewards package that includes competitive salaries, performance-based bonuses, equity grants, healthcare benefits, retirement\nsavings plans, paid family leave, paid time off, wellness programs and discounts, tuition reimbursement and an Employee Assistance Program. We also drive high levels of\nperformance and improvement by prioritizing training and development, and we motivate and develop our employees by providing them with opportunities for advancement\nand offering robust onsite and remote learning opportunities for employees at every stage in their career.\nOur employees’ health and safety is also important to us. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we took measures to support our employees, including de-densifying our\nlaboratories and facilities, adjusting laboratory shifts, restricting visitors to facilities, restricting employee travel, implementing an emergency paid time off policy, and\nproviding remote work-environment training and support.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe laboratory industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation domestically, at the federal and state levels, and internationally. The applicable laws and regulations\nchange frequently and there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to audit, inquiry, or investigation with respect to some aspect of its operations. The failure\nto comply with applicable laws, regulations, and reimbursement guidelines could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. Significant areas of regulation are\nsummarized below.\nLicensure, Accreditation, and Quality Standards\nThe Company operates laboratories domestically in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas, and internationally in China,\nSingapore, Switzerland and United Kingdom. The laboratories are licensed as required by the states or countries in which they are located. In addition, the laboratories in Fort\nMyers, Florida; Aliso Viejo and Carlsbad, California; Nashville, Tennessee; and Houston, Texas are licensed by the State of New York as the laboratories accept clinical\nspecimens obtained in New York. All of our domestic laboratories are certified in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”). Under\nCLIA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) establishes various operational, personnel, facilities, administration, quality, and proficiency requirements for\ntesting performed by a laboratory, intended to ensure testing services are accurate, valid, and timely. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill federal and\nstate health care programs, as well as many private insurers, for laboratory testing services. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements include: suspension,\nrevocation, or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business; cancellation or suspension of the laboratory’s approval to receive Medicare\nand/or Medicaid reimbursement; and significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany.\nCertain Company laboratories are also accredited by the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”), including our laboratories in Cambridge, United Kingdom; Rolle,\nSwitzerland; Singapore; and Suzhou, China, and actively participate in CAP’s proficiency testing programs for all tests offered by the Company. CAP’s proficiency testing\nprograms require participating laboratories to test specimens that they receive from an approved testing entity and return the results. The testing entity conducting the program\nanalyzes the results and provides to the Company a quality control report assessing the results.\nThe Company has a Quality Management System and we strive to conduct our business in a manner that meets applicable regulatory and accreditation requirements and\nindustry standards. The quality of care provided to clients and their patients is of paramount importance to us. We maintain quality control processes, including standard\noperating procedures, controls, performance measurement and reporting mechanisms. Our employees are committed to providing accurate, reliable, and consistent services.\nAny concerns regarding the quality of testing or services provided by the Company are quickly communicated to our Company management. We also frequently revise and\nimprove our tests and we work with laboratory equipment vendors to help ensure that our laboratory has the highest possible quality.\nCompliance with licensure, accreditation, and quality standards are verified through periodic inspections by agents of relevant regulatory agencies and accrediting\norganizations, and we believe we are in material compliance with all licensure, accreditation, and quality requirements.\n11"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nCompliance and Ethics Program\nThe health care industry is highly regulated and scrutinized with respect to fraud, abusive billing practices, and improper financial relationships between health care companies\nand their referral sources. The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has published compliance program guidance, including the\nCompliance Program Guidance for Clinical Laboratories in August of 1998, fraud alerts, and advisory opinions. The Company has implemented a robust Compliance & Ethics\nProgram encompassing this guidance, which is overseen by our Board of Directors, to support compliance with the myriad of international, federal, and state laws, regulations,\nand governmental guidance applicable to our business. Our program employs a risk-based approach to the development and implementation of standards of conduct, training\nand education of employees, monitoring and auditing Company practices, investigation, and response to reported or detected compliance issues. The Company provides a\nhotline for employees who wish to anonymously or confidentially report suspected violations of our codes of conduct, policies and procedures, or laws and regulations.\nEmployees are strongly encouraged to report suspected violations. The hotline does not replace other resources available to our employees, including supervisors, managers, and\nhuman resources staff but is an alternative channel available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The hotline forwards all reports to the Chief Compliance Officer, who is\nresponsible for investigating, reporting to the Compliance Committee, and documenting the disposition of each report. The hotline forwards any calls pertaining to the financial\nstatements or financial issues to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Company does not allow any retaliation against an employee who reports a compliance related issue\nin good faith.\nThe Board of Directors has a Compliance Committee that meets regularly to discuss all compliance-related issues that may affect the Company. The Company reviews its\npolicies and procedures as new regulations and interpretations come to light to comply with applicable regulations. The Chief Compliance Officer reports quarterly to the\nCompliance Committee on the effectiveness of the program.\nLaboratory Developed Tests\nThe FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents, and other medical devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing. High\ncomplexity and CLIA-certified laboratories such as ours frequently develop testing procedures intended exclusively for use by the developing laboratory to provide diagnostic\nresults to customers. These tests are referred to as laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”). The regulatory framework governing LDTs is evolving, complex, and has been the\nsubject of ongoing debate. LDTs are subject to CMS oversight through its enforcement of CLIA. The FDA has also claimed regulatory authority over LDTs but has generally\nexercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs offered by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories and has not subjected these tests to FDA rules and\nregulations governing medical devices, including premarket review requirements. In 2014, FDA issued draft guidance announcing that it would end its historical policy of\nenforcement discretion regarding LDTs and outlining the first of multiple frameworks that have been proposed for their regulation. FDA announced in 2016 that it no longer\nplanned to finalize its draft guidance and that it would continue to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs. On January 13, 2017, the FDA published a non-\nbinding “Discussion Paper” proposing a framework of LDT oversight largely consistent with the draft guidance, “to spur further dialogue” and give “congressional authorizing\ncommittees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution.” Recent agency announcements made in the context of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) public health emergency\nhave produced a shifting policy landscape and further uncertainty regarding the FDA’s role in regulating LDTs: in August 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services\n(“HHS”) announced that the FDA would not require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, but in November 2021, HHS issued a statement\nwithdrawing that prior announcement, indicating a return to FDA’s longstanding approach to the regulation and enforcement discretion toward LDTs.\nCongress has also considered a number of legislative proposals in recent years that would amend the regulatory framework for LDTs, including, among other requirements,\nFDA premarket review of certain LDTs. The most recent such proposal, the Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development (“VALID”) Act, was introduced in both the\nHouse and Senate on June 24, 2021. The VALID Act was expected to be included in the Omnibus bill signed at the end of 2022, but ultimately was not included and as such, it\nremains unclear whether the VALID Act will be passed 2023 or whether FDA will proceed through rulemaking. It is possible that legislation and resulting FDA regulation may\nresult in increased regulatory burdens and costs for us to seek marketing authorization for and maintain ongoing compliance for our existing tests, any modifications thereto, or\nany future tests we may develop. We cannot be certain as to which of our tests, if any, would require FDA approval or clearance under any of the proposed frameworks and, if\nrequired, that our tests could obtain such approval or clearance.\nLaws Governing Source Relationships\nThe federal laws governing Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health benefits, as well as other state and federal laws, regulate certain aspects of the relationships between\nhealth care providers, including clinical laboratories, and their referral\n12"

We are subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), which is a criminal felony statute, as\nwell as similar state statutes and regulations, which prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring,\nordering, leasing, purchasing, or arranging for or recommending the ordering, purchasing, or leasing of items or services payable by Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federally\nfunded healthcare program. Remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, in cash or in kind, and thus can implicate financial relationships including\npayments not commensurate with fair market value, such as in the form of personnel, supplies, professional, or technical services, or anything else of value. . If we are found to\nbe in violation of the AKS or a similar state anti-kickback law, we could be subject to significant penalties, including fines, exclusion from participation in government and\nprivate payer programs, or obligations to refund amounts previously received from government payers. For additional information regarding the federal AKS and similar state\nanti-kickback laws, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Risks Relating to Government Regulation and Reimbursement, “The failure to comply with Anti-Kickback laws may subject us\nto liability, penalties or limitation of operations.”\nIn addition to the federal AKS, in October 2018, the U.S. Congress enacted the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (“EKRA”), as part of the Substance Use-\nDisorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (“SUPPORT Act”). EKRA is an all-payer anti-kickback law that makes it\na criminal offense to pay any remuneration to induce referrals to, or in exchange for, patients using the services of a recovery home, a substance use clinical treatment facility,\nor laboratory. As drafted, an EKRA prohibition on incentive compensation to sales employees, payments to group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), or group practices is\nbroader than the federal AKS. Significantly, EKRA permits the DOJ to issue regulations clarifying EKRA’s exceptions or adding additional exceptions, but such regulations\nhave not yet been issued.\nWe are also subject to international laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal\npayments to, and contracting practices with regard to, government officials and others. The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad\nand regulators are frequently using enforcement proceedings to define the scope of these laws. These laws include civil penalties for enterprises and criminal penalties and\nimprisonment for individuals. Any violation of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, cause us\nto incur significant costs and expenses, including legal fees, and result in a material adverse effect on our business. We could also suffer severe penalties, including criminal and\ncivil penalties, disgorgement and other remedial measures. The obligation of the Company under these laws is to screen third parties who are hired to carry out certain services\non behalf of the Company, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, and to monitor direct and indirect payments to government officials and others. Because of the\nbroad definitions of applicability of these laws, international clients or vendors working for government-owned entities are often considered to be governmental officials. The\nCompany has implemented a program to comply with these laws and educates employees and its relevant vendors regularly on the requirements for vendor onboarding and\nconducting appropriate business interactions globally.\nPhysician Self-Referral Laws\nThe federal law referred to as the “Stark Law” prohibits payments for certain health care services, referred to as designated health services (“DHS”), rendered by entities with\nwhich referring physicians (or their immediate family members) have a financial relationship. A “financial relationship” includes both an ownership interest and/or a\ncompensation arrangement with a physician, both direct and indirect, and DHS includes, but is not limited to, laboratory services\nThe Stark Law prohibits an entity that receives a prohibited DHS referral from seeking payment from Medicare and Medicaid for any DHS services performed as a result of\nsuch a referral, unless an arrangement is carefully structured to satisfy every requirement of a regulatory exception. The Company endeavors to structure its financial\nrelationships in compliance with the Stark Law and with similar state physician self-referral laws, and performs routine audits in furtherance of this.\nMany states have promulgated self-referral laws and regulations similar to the federal Stark Law, but these vary significantly based on the state. In addition to services\nreimbursed by Medicaid or government payers, these state laws and regulations can encompass services reimbursed by private payers and paid by self-pay patients as well.\nPenalties for violating state self-referral laws and regulations vary based on the state but often include civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicaid, and loss of\nlicenses. Our financial arrangements with physicians are governed by the federal Stark Law and similar state self-referral laws, and we rely on certain exceptions to the Stark\nLaw with respect to such relationships. If we are found to be in violation of the Stark Law or a similar state self-referral law, we could be subject to significant penalties,\nincluding fines, exclusion from participation in government and private payer programs, or obligations to refund amounts previously received from government payers.\n13"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nThe False Claims Act\nThe federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. government, or to a Medicare program\ncontractor, a false or fraudulent claim for payment, knowingly making or using a false record or statement to have a false claim paid by the government, conspiring to defraud\nthe U.S. government, or knowingly making or using a false statement to conceal an obligation to pay the government, or improperly retaining overpayments from the\ngovernment. Following enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), claims resulting from violations of the federal AKS and knowing retention of\noverpayments are also considered false claims and could lead to liability under the FCA. Further, FCA liability may lead to exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid,\nand other federal healthcare programs. The FCA’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions are used with frequency to challenge the reimbursement practices of providers and\nsuppliers. These provisions allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has submitted false claims for payment to the\nfederal government. The government must decide whether to intervene in the lawsuit and whether to prosecute the case. If it declines to do so, the individual may pursue the\ncase alone, although the government must be kept apprised of the progress of the lawsuit. Whether or not the federal government intervenes in the case, it will receive the\nmajority of any recovery. The successful qui tam relator who brought the case is entitled to a portion of the proceeds and its attorneys’ fees and costs. As most qui tam cases are\nfiled by current or former employees, an effective compliance program, as defined by the DOJ and OIG, plays a crucial role in reducing the Company’s exposure to liability. It\nis also a criminal offense, under Title 18 U.S. Code, Section 287, for a person or entity to make a claim against the United States or any department or agency, knowing the\nclaim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent. The penalty is a fine and imprisonment of up to five years. The federal FCA has been an effective enforcement tool for the federal\ngovernment and many states have enacted similar false claims acts as well.\nThe Company seeks to structure its arrangements with physicians and other clients to be in compliance with the AKS, Stark Law, state laws, and the FCA and to stay abreast of\ncurrent developments and changes in the law and regulations. However, these laws and regulations are complex and subject to interpretation. Consequently, we are unable to\nascertain with certainty that our arrangements and transactions will not be subject to scrutiny and, if scrutinized, will not result in sanctions or penalties. The Company has\ntaken, and will continue to take, actions, including robust auditing and monitoring activities, to endeavor to ensure compliance with the myriad federal and state laws that govern\nour business.\nMedicare Payment Guidelines\nWe have various billing arrangements with our clients and with third party payers, including the Medicare program. When the Company bills the client for all, or a portion of, a\nlaboratory test performed, we believe these client billing arrangements are priced competitively at fair market value. These client billing arrangements may implicate the\nMedicare program’s prohibition against charging the Medicare or Medicaid programs fees substantially in excess of the Company’s usual and customary charges. Given our\nparticipation in Medicare and Medicaid, we are subject to Medicare and Medicaid regulations related to billing those programs as well as agency subregulatory guidance\nregarding the same, the federal Stark Law, federal and state anti-kickback statutes, and the federal FCA and state equivalents.\nIn light of the various federal regulations and guidance from the OIG, the Company seeks to price its products competitively while endeavoring to meet applicable statutes and\nregulations.\nEnvironmental Health and Safety\nThe Company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal and state laws relating to the protection of the environment as well as human health and safety laws and\nregulations relating to the handling, transportation, and disposal of medical specimens, hazardous materials, and infectious and hazardous waste. Company laboratories are\nsubject to applicable laws and regulations, primarily at the state-level, relating to the management and disposal of regulated medical wastes, including laboratory specimens,\nand the Company generally utilizes outside vendors for disposal of such waste materials. In addition to its comprehensive regulation of health and safety in the workplace in\ngeneral, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers, including clinical\nlaboratories and other healthcare-related facilities, whose workers may be exposed to chemical hazards as well as biological, physical and safety hazards, including blood-borne\npathogens such as HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, personal protective clothing and equipment,\ntraining, medical follow-up, vaccinations, and other measures designed to minimize and mitigate exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens and other types of\nhazards. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of\nthe following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the U.S. Postal Service, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the\nInternational Air Transport Association.

Failure to comply could subject the Company to various\nadministrative and/or other enforcement actions.\nConfidentiality and Security of Personal Information\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) contains provisions that protect individually identifiable health information from unauthorized use\nor disclosure by covered entities and their business associates. The Office for Civil Rights of HHS (“OCR”), the agency responsible for enforcing HIPAA, has published\nregulations to address the privacy (the “Privacy Rule”) and security (the “Security Rule”) of protected health information (“PHI”) and notification of breaches of PHI (the\n“Breach Notification Rule,” and, collectively, the “HIPAA Rules”). The Company acts as a covered entity under HIPAA and has adopted policies and procedures designed to\ncomply with HIPAA, including the HIPAA Rules. Many of the health care facilities and providers that refer specimens to the Company are also bound by HIPAA. HIPAA\nadditionally requires that all providers that transmit claims for health care goods or services electronically utilize standard transaction and data sets and use standardized national\nprovider identification codes. We believe that the Company has taken necessary steps to comply with HIPAA regulations. For example, the Company utilizes standard\ntransaction data sets, and has obtained and implemented national provider identifiers, or NPIs, as the standard unique health identifier in filing and processing health care claims\nand other transactions. HIPAA violations may be subject to criminal and civil penalties.\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”),\nextended the scope of HIPAA to permit enforcement against business associates, which are entities that use PHI to provide certain services on behalf of covered entities, for\nHIPAA for violations. The HITECH Act also established new requirements to notify the OCR of a breach of PHI, and allows the state Attorneys General to bring actions to\nenforce violations of HIPAA. In certain circumstances, we act as a business associate under HIPAA and could be subject to such enforcement if we were to fail to comply with\nHIPAA as a business associate.\nIn addition to the HIPAA Rules described above, the Company is subject to additional federal and state laws regarding the handling and disclosure of patient records and patient\nhealth information. Effective April 5, 2021, HHS published a final rule implementing the information blocking provisions (Information Blocking Rules) of the 21  Century\nCures Act. The Information Blocking Rules prohibit covered actors, including healthcare providers, from engaging in activity that is likely to interfere with the access,\nexchanges, or use of electronic health information (“EHI”) unless such activity falls into one of eight exceptions. The Information Blocking Rules provide for civil monetary\npenalties for noncompliance by healthcare IT vendors and, separately, “appropriate disincentives” for noncompliance by healthcare providers. The HIPAA Rules do not\nsupersede state laws that may be more stringent; therefore, we are required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations as well as varying state privacy and\nsecurity laws and regulations. These laws vary widely. For example, many states have implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent\nrequirements and limiting the disclosure of genetic test results. Penalties for violation of state laws can include sanctions against a laboratory’s licensure as well as civil or\ncriminal penalties. Additionally, private individuals may have a right of action against the Company for violations of a state’s privacy laws. We believe that we are in material\ncompliance with current state laws regarding the confidentiality of health information, and we will continue to monitor and comply with new or changing state laws.\nFurther, we are subject to certain comprehensive state laws governing the processing of personal information. In particular, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)\ntook effect on January 1, 2020, and imposed privacy compliance obligations with regard to the personal information of California residents. This legislation created significant\nnew requirements for identifying, managing, securing, tracking, producing, and deleting consumer personal information and granted new rights to California residents,\nincluding the right to opt out of their data being sold to a third party by the Company. The CCPA defines personal information extremely broadly as “information that identifies,\nrelates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.” Like the international\nprivacy laws discussed below, this creates greater complexity in implementing a compliance program to support these requirements. The CCPA law became enforceable by the\nCalifornia Attorney General on July 1, 2020, and the Company has implemented significant mechanisms to promote compliance with this law. The CCPA’s protections have\nbeen expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which became operational in most key respects on January 1, 2023. Similar laws have been proposed or passed\nat the U.S. federal and state level, including the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which took effect on January 1, 2023, the Colorado Consumer Protection Act, which\nwill take effect on July 1, 2023, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, which will take effect on July 1, 2023, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, which will take effect on\nDecember 31, 2023. We expect that other states will enact similar legislation in the future, and we will be required to analyze the effect of those laws on our business.\nDue to the Company’s international expansion, we are subject to a variety of international laws which serve to protect the personal data of individuals who are located in those\ncountries. These laws include the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the United Kingdom GDPR, The Swiss Federal Data Protection Act\n(“FADP”),\nst\n15"

These laws cover a\nbroader range of data in addition to patient data including data of employees, clients, and other individuals whose data we hold. Like HIPAA, these laws contain regulatory\nrequirements for both robust data privacy and security programs and require data breach reporting should personal data be used or disclosed in a manner not allowed under the\nlaws. Penalties for violations of these laws can be significant; for instance, GDPR’s maximum penalties are up to the greater of 4.0% of a company’s annual global turnover or\n€20.0 million. Although the Company’s business is conducted primarily in the United States, we do receive some samples for clinical testing from countries outside of the\nUnited States, and we collect data of individuals internationally as part of the Company’s Pharma business, which obligates us to comply with these laws. We have developed\nprivacy and security programs intended to meet these international obligations and continue to reassess and improve these programs continually.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. They are not, however, the only risks we face. Additional\nrisks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe not to be material may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations. An investor should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this filing before deciding to purchase our common\nstock. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or operating results could be materially harmed.

For example, new tests developed by our competitors may prove superior and replace our existing tests. Additionally, certain\ntechnological changes, such as advances in point-of-care testing, could reduce the need for the laboratory tests we provide. Our future success will depend in significant part on\nour ability to continually improve our offerings in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive service offerings, and we may be unsuccessful in\ndoing so, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe face the risk of capacity constraints, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe compete in the market place primarily on three factors: (i) the quality and accuracy of our test results; (ii) the speed or turnaround times of our testing services; and (iii) our\nability to provide after-test support to those physicians requesting consultation. Any unforeseen increase in the volume of clients could strain the capacity of our personnel and\nsystems, leading to unacceptable turnaround times or customer service failures. In addition, as the number of our clients and specimens increases, our products, services, and\ninfrastructure may not be able to scale accordingly. We may also not be able to hire additional licensed medical technologists that we need to handle increased volumes. Any\nfailure to handle higher volume of requests for our products and services could lead to the loss of established clients and have a material adverse effect on our business, results\nof operations, and financial condition. If we produce inaccurate test results, our clients may choose not to use us in the future. This could severely harm our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. In addition, based on the importance of the subject matter of our tests, inaccurate results could result in improper treatment of patients and\npotential liability for us.\nIncreased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability.\nThe market for genetic and molecular testing services is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to increase. Our competitors within the broader genomics\nprofiling space include laboratory companies such as, Quest Diagnostics, Laboratory Corporation of America, and Bio-Reference Laboratories. These are large national\nlaboratories that possess greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial resources and employ substantially more personnel than we do. We\nalso face increased competition from laboratories that are more specialized and focused on particular areas such as liquid biopsies or large tissue based molecular panels such as\nGuardant Health, Inc., Natera, Inc., Exact Sciences, Corp, Caris Life Science, and Tempus Labs, Inc. Our competitors may develop products and services that are superior to\nours or that achieve greater market acceptance than our offerings. Many of our competitors have long established relationships with their customers and third-party payers. We\ncannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with such entities in the future.\nThe laboratory business is intensely competitive, both in terms of price and service. Pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by\nhealthcare providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. As a result of the laboratory industry undergoing consolidation, larger laboratory providers are able to\nincrease cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. This consolidation results in greater price competition. We may be unable to increase cost efficiencies\nsufficiently, if at all, and as a result, our net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. Additionally, we may also face changes in fee\nschedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services, or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition.\n18"

For example, there can be no assurance that we will be able to produce commercial products for early detection of\ncancer. Before we can commercialize any new products, we will need to expend significant funds in order to:\n•\nconduct substantial research and development, including validation studies and clinical studies;\n•\nfurther develop and scale our laboratory processes to accommodate different products; and\n•\nfurther develop and scale our infrastructure to be able to analyze increasingly large amounts of data.\nOur product development process involves a high degree of risk, and product development efforts may fail for many reasons, including:\n•\nfailure of the product to perform as expected, including defects and errors;\n•\nlack of validation data; or\n•\nfailure to demonstrate the clinical utility of the product.\nAs we develop products, we have made and will have to make significant investments in product development, marketing and selling resources, including investing heavily in\nclinical studies, which could adversely affect our future cash flows.\nFailure to develop, or acquire licenses for, new or improved testing technologies could materially and adversely affect our revenues.\nOur industry is subject to rapidly changing technology and new product introductions. Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or other\nintellectual property rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop, perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs. In\naddition, they could introduce new tests, technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and\nreimbursement for these technologies. We may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and we cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield\ncommercially successful diagnostic tests. If we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, our research and development costs may increase as a result. In\naddition, if we are unable to license new or improved technologies to expand our testing operations, our testing methods may become outdated when compared with our\ncompetition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe potential loss or delay of our material Pharma Services customer contracts or of multiple contracts could adversely affect our results.\nThe revenue attributable to our Pharma Services clients may also fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our Pharma Services segment clients can terminate our contracts upon proper notice. Our Pharma Services clients may delay, terminate or reduce the scope of our\ncontracts for a variety of reasons beyond our control, including but not limited to actions by regulatory authorities, negative clinical results, lack of patient enrollment, or shifts\nin internal priorities. Delays, terminations or reductions in the scope of our contracts impact our ability to convert our backlog into revenue for the Company. If we cannot\nrealize the full benefits of our backlog of contractually committed services due to delay, cancellation or reduction in our client’s contractual commitments, this will materially\nimpact our revenues. Adverse speculation about our existing or potential relationships with our Pharma Services clients may be a catalyst for adverse speculation about us, our\nproducts and our technology, which can adversely affect our reputation and business.\nClinicians or patients using our services may sue us, and our insurance may not sufficiently cover all claims brought against us, which will increase our expenses.\nThe development, marketing, sale, and performance of healthcare services expose us to the risk of litigation, including professional negligence or product liability claims, were\nsomeone to allege that our tests failed to perform as designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the test results we provide to pathologists and oncologists or for a\nmisunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide.

We may be faced with litigation claims that exceed our insurance coverage or are not covered under any of our\ninsurance policies. In addition, litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business if it impacts our existing and potential customer relationships, creates adverse\npublic relations, diverts management resources from the operation of the business, or hampers our ability to otherwise conduct our business.\nWe may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including employment,\ncommercial, product liability, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters\ncan be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability and/or require us to change our business practices.\nBecause of the potential risks, expenses, and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we believe that we have meritorious claims or\ndefenses. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nOur involvement with clinical trials and research services create a risk of liability.\nWe have conducted clinical trials and presently support many clinical trials run by third parties, which ordinarily involve testing an investigational drug on a limited number of\nindividuals to evaluate a product’s safety, determine a safe dosage range and identify side effects. Errors or omissions could occur during a clinical trial that may result in harm\nto study volunteers, or if unnoticed and regulatory approval is received, to consumers of the drug, or that may undermine the usefulness of the clinical trial or data from the\nclinical trial and may delay the entry of a drug to the market.\nOur contracts with the pharmaceutical sponsors include provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability. These provisions do not uniformly\nprotect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions, such as gross negligence or misconduct. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required\nto pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by or exceeds the limits of a contractual indemnification provision, or in the event that a party\nwho must indemnify us does not fulfill its indemnification obligations, or which is beyond the level of our insurance coverage.\nOur investments in marketable securities are subject to certain risks which could affect our overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe invest a portion of our available cash and cash equivalents by purchasing marketable securities in a managed portfolio and direct investments in a variety of debt securities,\nincluding U.S. Treasury securities and corporate debt securities. The primary objective of our investment activity is to maintain the safety of principal and provide for future\nliquidity requirements while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. Should any of our investments or marketable securities lose value or have their liquidity\nimpaired, it could affect our overall financial condition. Additionally, should we choose to, or are required to, sell these securities in the future at a loss, our consolidated\noperating results or cash flows may be affected.\nOther manufacturers may discontinue or recall testing products used in our business.\nWe rely heavily on reagents, test kits and instruments manufactured by third parties in our testing services. From time to time, manufacturers have discontinued or recalled, and\nmay in the future discontinue or recall, the reagents, test kits or instruments used by us to perform laboratory testing. Such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect our\ncosts, testing volume and revenues. We have had certain tests discontinued by manufacturers and have had to develop alternative solutions for our clients.\nWe depend substantially upon third parties for payment of services, which reliance could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur business consists of clinical laboratories that provide medical testing services for doctors, hospitals, and other laboratories on patient specimens that are sent to our\nlaboratories. In the case of some specimen referrals that are received for patients that are not in-patients or out-patients at a hospital or institution or otherwise sent by another\nreference laboratory, we typically bill the patient’s insurance company or a government program for our services. As such, we rely on the cooperation of numerous third-party\npayers, including but not limited to Medicare, Medicaid, and various insurance companies, to get paid for performing services on behalf of our clients and their patients. The\namount of such third-party payments is governed by contractual relationships in cases where we are a participating provider for a specified insurance company or by established\ngovernment reimbursement rates in cases where we are an approved provider for a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid. However, we do not have contractual\nrelationships with some of the insurance companies with whom\n20"

In such cases, we are deemed to be a non-participating provider and there is\nno contractual assurance that we will be able to collect the amounts billed to such insurance companies or government programs. Until such time we become a participating\nprovider with such insurance companies, there can be no contractual assurance that we will be paid for the services we bill to such insurance companies or patients, and such\nthird parties may change their reimbursement policies for non-participating providers in a manner that may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow or results of\noperations. When new Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) codes are introduced by the American Medical Association (“AMA”) it often takes time for commercial\ninsurance providers to recognize the new codes, which can significantly impact the timing of payments, if any, and can increase our days-sales-outstanding. Medicare has also,\nat times, issued codes or coding guidance that conflicts with the AMA CPT coding, which can cause confusion when secondary insurance is involved. Insurance companies\nmay also try to steer business away from us towards in-network providers by sending letters to physicians and even imposing financial penalties if they continue to send us\nbusiness.\nWe may fail to protect our facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur operations are dependent in part upon our ability to protect our laboratory operations against physical damage from explosions, fire, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, power\nloss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, and similar events. We do not presently have an emergency back-up generator in place at our Tampa, Florida, Nashville,\nTennessee, Atlanta, Georgia, or Phoenix, Arizona laboratory locations, which would otherwise mitigate to some extent the effects of a prolonged power outage. The occurrence\nof any of these events could result in interruptions, delays, or cessations in service to clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,\nand financial condition.\nWe depend on information technology systems and maintain protected personal data, and a cyber-attack or other breach affecting these information technology\nsystems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur laboratory operations depend, in part, on the continued performance of our information technology systems. Such systems are susceptible to a cyber-attack, malicious\nintrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of confidentiality, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and\nother cyber-attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause our information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to\nbe compromised or stolen. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or\ndisruption, problems with product functionality, damage to customer relations, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties. Sustained system failures or interruption of our\nsystems in one or more of our laboratory operations could disrupt our ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner, and/or\nbill the appropriate party.\nWe also collect, manage and process protected personal data, including protected health information subject to HIPAA, in connection with our service offerings. Breaches with\nrespect to personal data could result in violations of HIPAA, the HITECH Act, GDPR, and other federal, state, and international laws regarding the privacy, confidentiality, and\nsecurity of such information. A breach of protected personal data could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses,\nincluding costs related to insurance and remediation of any security vulnerabilities, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.\nWhile we invest in our systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, there can be no\nassurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which we rely. Similarly, there can be no assurance\nthat third party information technology providers with whom we contract will not suffer a significant attack or disruption that impacts customers, such as supply chain attacks.\nAny significant breach, attack, disruption, or failure of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nPerformance issues, service interruptions, or price increases by our shipping carrier could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition,\nand harm our reputation and ability to provide our specialized diagnostic services on a timely basis.\nExpedited, reliable shipping is essential to our operations. One of our marketing strategies principally highlights the reliability of our point-to-point transport of patient samples.\nWe rely heavily on a single provider of transport services, FedEx Corporation (the “Carrier”), for reliable and secure point-to-point transport of patient samples to our laboratory\nand enhanced tracking of these patient samples. Should the Carrier encounter delivery performance issues such as loss, damage, or destruction of a sample, it may be difficult to\nreplace our patient samples in a timely manner and such occurrences may damage our reputation and lead to decreased demand for our services and increased cost and expense\nto our business.

Similarly, strikes, severe weather, natural disasters, or\nother service interruptions by delivery services we use would adversely affect our ability to receive and process patient samples on a timely basis. If the Carrier or we were to\nterminate our relationship, we would be required to find another party to provide expedited, reliable point-to-point transport of our patient samples. There are only a few other\nproviders of such nationwide transport services, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into arrangements with another provider on acceptable terms, if at all.\nFinding a new provider of transport services would be time-consuming and costly and result in delays in our ability to provide our specialized diagnostic services. Even if we\nwere to enter into an arrangement with such alternative provider, there can be no assurance that they will provide the same level of quality in transport services currently\nprovided to us by the Carrier. If the new provider does not provide the required quality and reliable transport services, it could adversely affect our business, reputation, results\nof operations, and financial condition.\nWe use biological and hazardous materials that require considerable expertise and expense for handling, storage, or disposal and may result in claims against us.\nWe work with hazardous materials, including chemicals, biological agents and compounds, blood samples, and other human tissue that could be dangerous to human health and\nsafety or the environment. Our operations also produce hazardous and biohazardous waste products. We have an Employee Health & Safety Department that closely monitors\nthe use of hazardous materials in our laboratory. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these\nmaterials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair\nbusiness efforts. If we do not comply with applicable regulations, we may be subject to fines and penalties. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury\nor contamination from these materials or wastes. Our general liability insurance or workers’ compensation insurance policies may not cover damages and fines arising from\nbiological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in\nan amount exceeding our resources, and our operations could be suspended or otherwise adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Indebtedness\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and it could decline substantially within a short period of time. The price of our common stock\ncould fluctuate significantly for many reasons including the following:\n•\nchange in our Leadership or Board of Directors;\n•\nfuture announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n•\nregulatory developments and enforcement actions bearing on advertising, marketing, or sales;\n•\nreports and recommendations of analysts and whether or not we meet the milestones and metrics set forth in such reports;\n•\ngaining or losing large customers or managed care plans;\n•\nintroduction of new products or services and related insurance coverage;\n•\nacquisition or loss of significant manufacturers, distributors or suppliers, or an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials needed to provide our\nservices;\n•\nquarterly variations in operating results;\n•\nbusiness acquisitions or divestitures;\n•\nchanges in the regulation of LDTs;\n•\nchanges in governmental or third-party reimbursement practices and rates; and\n•\nfluctuations in the economy, political events, or general market conditions.\nIn addition, stock markets in general and the market for shares of healthcare stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years,\nfluctuations that frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price\nof our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline below its current price and the market price of our shares may fluctuate significantly in the future.\nThese fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance.\nServicing our Convertible Notes requires a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our obligations under the\nConvertible Notes, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n22"

We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, pay interest on, or refinance our\nindebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to\ngenerate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our indebtedness and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow,\nwe may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly\ndilutive. Our ability to refinance the Convertible Notes will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of\nthese activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash or to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon a\nfundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Notes.\nHolders of the Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to\n100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless\nwe elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make\ncash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required\nto make repurchases of Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or Convertible Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or to pay cash\nupon conversions of the Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority, or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase\nConvertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the respective indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required\nby such indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under an indenture or the occurrence of the fundamental change may also lead to a default under\nagreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have\nsufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the 2028 Convertible Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we have entered into capped call transactions with the option counterparties. Upon conversion of any of the 2028\nConvertible Notes, we will satisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares\nof our common stock, at our election, and the capped call transactions are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes and/or offset\nsome or all of any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2028 Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or\noffset subject to a cap.\nIn connection with these transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions related to the capped call transactions by entering\ninto or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market\ntransactions prior to the maturity of the 2028 Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 2028 Convertible Notes or\nfollowing any repurchase or redemption of the 2028 Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common\nstock or the 2028 Convertible Notes.\nConversion of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of our common stock upon\nconversion of any of the Convertible Notes. We have entered into capped call transactions with respect to the 2028 Convertible Notes to reduce the risk of dilution, but to the\nextent that the conversion price of the 2028 Convertible Notes exceeds the cap price of the capped calls or to the extent that the Convertible Notes are converted, such\nconversions will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. The Convertible Notes may from time to time in the future be convertible at the option of their\nholders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect\nprevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because conversion could\nbe used to satisfy short positions, and the anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\n23"

The FDA has been considering changes to\nthe way that it regulates these LDTs. Currently, all LDTs are conducted and offered in accordance with CLIA, and individual state licensing procedures. The FDA has\npublished a draft guidance document that would require FDA clearance or approval of a subset of LDTs, as well as a modified approach for some lower risk LDTs that may\nrequire FDA oversight short of the full premarket approval or clearance process. Congress may enact legislation to provide a regulatory framework for the FDA’s role with\nregard to LDTs. As a result, there is a risk that the FDA’s proposed regulatory process could delay the offering of certain tests and result in additional validation costs and fees.\nThere is also an associated risk that some tests currently offered might become subject to FDA premarket approval or clearance. This FDA approval or clearance process may\nbe time-consuming and costly, with no guarantee of ultimate approval or clearance. If our diagnostic tests are allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty about the\nregulatory status of such tests, if they are labeled investigational by FDA, or if FDA limits our labeling claims, orders or reimbursement may decline.\nIn 2014, FDA issued draft guidance announcing that it would end its historical policy of enforcement discretion regarding LDTs and outlining the first of multiple frameworks\nthat have been proposed for their regulation. FDA announced in 2016 that it no longer planned to finalize its draft guidance and that it would continue to exercise enforcement\ndiscretion with respect to LDTs. On January 13, 2017, the FDA published a non-binding “Discussion Paper” proposing a framework of LDT oversight largely consistent with\nthe draft guidance, “to spur further dialogue” and give “congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution.” Recent agency announcements\nmade in the context of the COVID-19 public health emergency have produced a shifting policy landscape and further uncertainty regarding FDA’s role in regulating LDTs: in\nAugust 2020, HHS announced that FDA would not require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, but in November 2021, HHS issued a statement\nwithdrawing that prior announcement, indicating a return to FDA’s longstanding approach to the regulation and enforcement discretion toward LDTs.\nCongress has also considered a number of legislative proposals in recent years that would amend the regulatory framework for LDTs, including, among other requirements,\nFDA premarket review of certain LDTs. The most recent such proposal, the VALID Act, was introduced in both the House and Senate on June 24, 2021. The VALID Act was\nexpected to be included in the Omnibus bill signed at the end of 2022, but ultimately was not included and that, as such, it remains unclear whether the VALID Act will be\npassed 2023 or whether FDA will proceed through rulemaking. It is possible that legislation and resulting FDA regulation may result in increased regulatory burdens and costs\nfor us to seek marketing authorization for and maintain ongoing compliance for our existing tests, any modifications thereto, or any future tests we may develop. If the\ngovernment begins to regulate our tests, it could require a significant volume of applications, which would be burdensome. Furthermore, governmental bodies could take a long\ntime to review such applications and/or document responses if other laboratories were also required to file applications and/or document responses for each of their LDTs.\nIn the event that the FDA begins to regulate our tests, it may require additional pre-market clinical testing prior to submitting a regulatory notification or application for\ncommercial sales. Such pre-market clinical testing could delay the commencement or completion of clinical testing, significantly increase our test development costs, delay\ncommercialization of any future tests, and interrupt sales of our current tests. Additionally, the results of pre-clinical trials or previous clinical trials may not be predictive of\nfuture results, and clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Many of the factors that may cause or lead to a delay in\nthe commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or approval. The commencement of clinical trials may be\ndelayed due to insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of\npatients to clinical sites, and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. We also cannot be certain that FDA will not enact rules or guidance that could impact our ability to\npurchase materials necessary for the performance of our LDTs, such as products labeled for research use only. Should any of the reagents we obtain from third party suppliers\nand use in conducting our LDTs be affected by future regulatory actions, our business could be adversely affected by those actions, including increasing the cost of testing or\ndelaying and limiting or prohibiting the purchase of reagents necessary to perform testing.\nWe may find it necessary to engage contract research organizations to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our clinical trials, which might increase the cost\nand complexity of our trials. We may also depend on clinical investigators, medical institutions, and contract research organizations to perform the trials. If these parties do not\nsuccessfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness, or\n24"

Many of these factors would be beyond our control. We may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without undue delays or considerable\nexpenditures. If there are delays in testing or approvals as a result of the failure to perform by third parties, our research and development costs would increase, and we may not\nbe able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our tests. In addition, we may not be able to establish or maintain relationships with these parties on favorable terms, if at\nall. Each of these outcomes would harm our ability to market our tests and/or to achieve sustained profitability.\nHealthcare reform programs may impact our business and the pricing we receive for our services.\nIn March 2010, healthcare reform legislation known as the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,” also known as the ACA, was passed into law. The ACA makes\nchanges that are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and clinical laboratories. For example, the ACA contains several provisions\nthat seek to limit Medicare spending in the future. One key provision in the ACA is the establishment of “Accountable Care Organizations” (“ACOs”), under which hospitals\nand physicians are able to share savings that result from improved coordination of healthcare. ACOs continue to develop, and we cannot predict how the continued\nestablishment and implementation of these new business models will impact our business. There is the possibility that value-based payment models, such as ACOs, will drive\ndown the utilization and/or reimbursement rates for our services. We may not be able to gain access into certain ACOs. These changes could have an adverse and material\nimpact on our operations.\nFollowing the 2016 election cycle, there were substantial efforts to repeal all or portions of the ACA. In December 2017, Public Law No. 115-97, which made changes to the tax\ncode and included, among other things, a repeal of the ACA’s penalties for the individual mandate, a provision that required individuals to buy health insurance or pay a fine,\nbecame law. While efforts to repeal all or part of the ACA have subsided, in part due to the results of the 2020 election, we cannot be certain that there will not be further\nlegislative efforts or judicial challenges in the future.\nChanges in laws, regulations, contracting arrangements with payers, or payer policies, including steps taken by payers to control utilization and reimbursement of\nhealthcare services, may adversely affect coverage or reimbursement for our specialized diagnostic services, which may decrease our revenues and adversely affect\nour results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernmental payers, as well as private insurers and private payers, have implemented and will continue to implement measures to control the cost, utilization, and delivery of\nhealthcare services, including clinical laboratory and pathology services. Congress and federal agencies, such as CMS, have, from time to time, implemented changes to laws\nand regulations governing healthcare service providers, including specialized diagnostic service providers. These changes have adversely affected and may in the future\nadversely affect coverage for our services. We also believe that healthcare professionals may not use our services if third-party payers do not provide adequate coverage and\nreimbursement for them. These changes in federal, state, local, and third-party payer regulations or policies may decrease our revenues and adversely affect our results of\noperations and our financial condition. We will continue to be a non-contracted provider until such time as we enter into contracts with third-party payers with whom we are not\ncurrently contracted. Because a portion of our revenues is from third-party payers with whom we are not currently contracted, it is likely that we will be required to make\npositive or negative adjustments to accounting estimates with respect to contractual allowances in the future, which may adversely affect our results of operations, our\ncredibility with financial analysts and investors, and our stock price.\nWe face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization as well as reimbursement for laboratory testing services. Changes in governmental reimbursement may result from\nstatutory and regulatory changes, prospective and/or retroactive rate adjustments, administrative rulings, and other policy changes.\nFrom time to time, legislative freezes and updates affect some of our tests that are reimbursed by the Medicare program under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”),\nor the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”). The MPFS is updated on an annual basis. In the past, the MPFS was updated using a prescribed statutory formula (i.e., the\nsustainable growth rate formula). The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) repealed the previous statutory formula and specified new annual\nconversion factors for calendar years 2015 and beyond. If the new annual conversion factor results in negative reimbursement in future years, the resulting decrease in payment\nmay adversely affect our revenue, business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\nIn addition, recent laws have made changes to Medicare reimbursement for our tests that are reimbursed under the CLFS, many of which have already gone into effect. The\nProtecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”) made significant changes to how Medicare pays for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests under the CLFS. As part of the\nchanges made under PAMA, beginning in 2017, Medicare CLFS reimbursement rates were to be based on the volume-weighted median of the private payer payment rates for\nthese tests. This led to reductions from prior rates, and without further legislative changes,\n25"

Reductions were capped at 10.0 percent per\nannum from 2017 through 2020, and this cap was set to increase to 15.0 percent for 2020. However, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”)\nand Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act delayed the implementation of the 15.0 percent rate reduction cap to 2023 and capped reductions at\n0.0 percent for 2021 and 2022. The Consolidated Appropriations Act 2023 further delayed the implementation of the 15.0 percent rate reduction cap to 2024 and extended the\n15.0 percent rate reduction cap through 2026. When rate reductions begin to take effect again in 2024, this will further reduce Medicare program payments for CLFS tests. It is\npossible that additional reductions could be enacted in the future.\nCMS also adopts regulations and policies, from time to time, revising, limiting, or excluding coverage or reimbursement for certain of the tests that we perform. Likewise, many\nstate governments are under budget pressures and are also considering reductions to their Medicaid fees. Further, Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payers audit for\noverutilization of billed services. Even though all tests performed by us are ordered by our clients who are responsible for establishing the medical necessity for the tests ordered,\nwe may be subject to recoupment of payments, as the recipient of the payments for such tests, in the event that a third-party payer such as CMS determines that the tests failed\nto meet all applicable criteria for payment. When third-party payers like CMS revise their coverage regulations or policies, our costs generally increase due to the complexity of\ncomplying with additional administrative requirements. Furthermore, Medicaid reimbursement and regulations vary by state. Accordingly, we are subject to varying\nadministrative and billing regulations, which also increase the complexity of servicing such programs and our administrative costs. Finally, state budget pressures have\nencouraged states to consider several courses that may impact our business, such as delaying payments, restricting coverage eligibility, service coverage restrictions and\nimposing taxes on our services.\nIn certain jurisdictions, Palmetto GBA administers the Molecular Diagnostic Services Program (“MolDx”) and establishes coverage and reimbursement for certain molecular\ndiagnostic tests, including many of our tests. To obtain Medicare coverage for a molecular diagnostic test (FDA-approved or LDT), laboratories must apply for and obtain a\nunique test identifier or what is known as a “Z” code. For newly developed tests or for established tests that have not been validated for clinical and analytical validity and\nclinical utility, laboratories must submit a detailed dossier of clinical data to substantiate that the test meets Medicare’s requirements for coverage. We have received favorable\ncoverage for many of our molecular tests, however, we have also received non-coverage determinations for many newer tests. The field of molecular diagnostics is evolving\nvery rapidly, and clinical studies on many new tests are still underway. We cannot be assured that some of our molecular tests will ever be covered services by Medicare, nor\ncan we determine when the medical literature will meet the standard for coverage that Medicare administrative contractors have set.\nIn November 2017, CMS initiated a national coverage analysis for the use of NGS diagnostic tests for patients with advanced cancer. The proposed decision memorandum was\nreleased and open to a public comment period. On March 16, 2018, CMS issued a final decision memorandum for NGS as a diagnostic laboratory test and determined it to be\nreasonable and necessary, and covered nationally when performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory, ordered by a treating physician, and all of the following requirements are met:\n(a) the patient has either recurrent, relapsed, refractory, metastatic, or advanced stages III or IV cancer; (b) the patient has either not been previously tested using the same NGS\ntest for the same primary diagnosis of cancer or has had repeat testing using the same NGS test only when a new primary cancer diagnosis is made by the treating physician; and\n(c) the patient has decided to seek further cancer treatment (e.g., therapeutic chemotherapy). CMS also determined that the diagnostic laboratory test using NGS must have:\nFDA approval or clearance as a companion in vitro diagnostic; an FDA approved or cleared indication for use in that patient’s cancer; and results provided to the treating\nphysician for management of the patient using a report template to specify treatment options. On October 29, 2019, CMS issued a proposed decision memorandum open to a\npublic comment period that would expand coverage of NGS test when performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory, ordered by a treating physician, and all of the following\nrequirements are met (a) the patient has ovarian or breast cancer; (b) the patient has clinical indications for germline (inherited) testing; (c) the patient has risk factors for\ngermline (inherited) breast or ovarian cancer; and (d) the patient has not been previously tested using NGS. These CMS changes to reimbursement for NGS testing could\ndirectly affect our revenue for this test type.\nIn recent years, Medicare has encouraged beneficiaries to participate in managed care programs, known as “Medicare Advantage” programs, and has encouraged beneficiaries\nfrom the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program to switch to Medicare Advantage programs. This has resulted in rapid growth of health insurance and managed care plans\noffering Medicare Advantage programs and growth in Medicare beneficiary enrollment in these programs. Also, in recent years, many states have increasingly mandated that\nMedicaid beneficiaries enroll in managed care arrangements. If these efforts continue to be successful, we may experience a further shift of traditional Medicare and Medicaid\nfee-for-service beneficiaries to managed care programs. As a result, we would be required to contract with those private managed care programs in order to be reimbursed for\nservices provided to their Medicare and Medicaid members. There can be no assurance that we will be\n26"

These efforts, including changes in law or regulations that may occur in the\nfuture, may each individually or collectively have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations regarding laboratory licensing and operations, including CLIA environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations\nsuch as the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act and the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of\nlicensure, and have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nWe are subject to extensive state and federal regulatory oversight regarding laboratory licensing and operations. Each of our laboratories must satisfy federal requirements\nunder CLIA and to maintain the appropriate CLIA Certificate for all testing performed at the lab. Additionally, most states have adopted various laws and regulations setting\nstandards for laboratories performing clinical laboratory testing, and requiring laboratories to obtain and maintain a state laboratory license before the laboratory is authorized to\nperform testing. These state licensure laws address a host of requirements and often establish permissible and prohibited practices involving digital health, including but not\nlimited to telehealth and telepathology.\nPeriodic inspections or surveys are performed to determine whether our laboratory locations are compliant with CLIA requirements or with applicable state licensure or\ncertification laws. If we fail to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or similar state laws, that failure could adversely affect payment for our products and services, prevent\ntheir approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale and/or marketing of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense. The sanctions for\nfailure to comply with CLIA, state licensure requirements, or other applicable laws and regulations include the suspension, revocation, or limitation of the right to perform\nclinical laboratory services or receive compensation for those services, as well as the requirement to enter into a corrective action plan to monitor compliance, and the imposition\nof civil or criminal penalties or administrative fines. In addition, any new legislation or regulation or the application of existing laws and regulations in ways that we have not\nanticipated could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety,\nincluding laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation, and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste, and radioactive materials, as well as\nregulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating\nto workplace safety for healthcare employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus.\nThese requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations, and other measures\ndesigned to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. In addition, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act requires, among other things, that we\ninclude in our safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles, if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the\nworkplace.\nFailure to comply with such federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other\nenforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements for\nus, which may be costly.\nOur net revenue will be diminished if payers do not adequately cover or reimburse our services.\nThere has been, and will continue to be, significant efforts by both federal and state agencies to reduce costs in government healthcare programs and otherwise implement\ngovernment control of healthcare costs. In addition, private payers continually seek ways to reduce and control overall healthcare costs, and increasing emphasis on managed\ncare in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of healthcare services. Uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of new applications\nand services. Third-party payers, including governmental payers such as Medicare and private payers, are scrutinizing new medical products and services and may not cover or\nmay limit coverage and the level of reimbursement for our services. Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any of our existing tests or for tests we\ndiscover and develop, and a substantial portion of the testing for which we bill our hospital and laboratory clients is ultimately paid by third-party payers. Likewise, any pricing\npressure exerted by these third-party payers on our clients may, in turn, be exerted by our clients on us. If government and other third-party payers do not provide adequate\ncoverage and reimbursement for our tests, it could adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and/or our financial condition.\n27"

Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable laws, we must bill various payers, such as patients, insurance\ncompanies, Medicare, Medicaid, physician practices, employer groups, hospitals, and other laboratories, all of which have different billing requirements. Additionally, we\nundertake internal audits to evaluate compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures. Insurance companies and\ngovernment payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, also impose routine external audits to evaluate payments, which adds further complexity to the billing process.\nAmong others, the primary factors which complicate our billing practices are:\n•\npricing differences between our fee schedules and the reimbursement rates of the payers;\n•\nchanges in payer rules or contracts;\n•\ndisputes with payers as to the party who is responsible for payment;\n•\ndisparity in coverage and information requirements among various carriers; and\n•\ndiffering pre-authorization requirements across payers.\nWe incur significant additional costs as a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory services are\nsubject to considerable and complex federal and state regulations. The costs we expect to continue to incur include those related to: (i) complexity added to our billing processes\nand systems; (ii) training and education of our employees and clients; (iii) implementing compliance procedures and oversight; (iv) collections and legal costs; and (v) costs\nassociated with, among other factors, challenging coverage and payment denials and providing patients with information regarding claims processing and services, such as\nadvance beneficiary notices.\nOur operations are subject to strict laws prohibiting fraudulent billing and other abuse, and our failure to comply with such laws could result in substantial penalties,\nincluding exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other governmental payer programs.\nOf particular importance to our operations is ensuring compliance with federal and state laws prohibiting fraudulent billing and the retention of overpayments. In particular, if\nwe fail to comply with federal and state documentation, coding, and billing rules, we could be subject to liability under the federal False Claims Act, including civil penalties,\nloss of licenses, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The False Claims Act prohibits individuals and companies from knowingly submitting false claims\nfor payments to, or improperly retaining overpayments from, the government.\nIf an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus\nsubstantial civil penalties for each separate false claim. Further, False Claims Act liability may lead to exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal\nhealthcare programs. There are a number of potential bases for liability under the federal False Claims Act. For example, liability arises when an entity knowingly submits, or\ncauses another to submit, a claim for reimbursement to the federal government for a service which was not provided or which did not qualify for reimbursement. Submitting a\nclaim with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of its truth or falsity could also result in liability under the False Claims Act. Following enactment of the ACA, knowing\nretention of overpayments is also considered a false claim and could lead to liability under the False Claims Act.\nThe False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions are used with frequency to challenge the reimbursement practices of providers and suppliers. Those provisions\nallow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has submitted false claims for payment to the government. The government\nmust decide whether to intervene in the lawsuit and whether to prosecute the case. If it declines to do so, the individual may pursue the case alone, although the government\nmust be kept apprised of the progress of the lawsuit. Whether or not the federal government intervenes in the case, it will receive the majority of any recovery. The successful\nqui tam relator who brought the case is entitled to a portion of the proceeds and his or her attorneys’ fees and costs. In addition, various states have enacted laws modeled after\nthe federal False Claims Act, which prohibit submitting false claims for payment to the state, or, in some states, to commercial payers. If we fail to comply with federal and state\ndocumentation, coding, and billing rules, we could be subject to liability under analogous state laws as well as criminal liability through a variety of federal and state criminal\nstatutes.\nGovernment investigations of clinical laboratories have been ongoing for a number of years and are expected to continue in the future. Governmental enforcement action or qui\ntam civil litigation against us may result in material costs and occupy significant management resources, even if we ultimately prevail. In addition, governmental enforcement\naction may result in substantial fines, penalties or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs and entry into corporate integrity\nagreements with governmental agencies, which could entail significant obligations and costs.\n28"

A large number of laboratories have entered into substantial settlements with the federal and state\ngovernments for alleged noncompliance under these laws and rules. Private payers have also brought civil actions against laboratories, which have resulted in substantial\njudgments. Failure to follow these rules could result in potential civil liability under the False Claims Act, under which extensive financial penalties can be imposed. It could\nfurther result in criminal liability under various federal and state criminal statutes.\nWe submit thousands of claims for payment to governmental programs and private payers, and we cannot guarantee that there have not been errors in our claims. While we\nmaintain a robust compliance program that includes consistent, detailed review of our documentation, coding, and billing practices, the rules are frequently vague, complex, and\ncontinually changing and we cannot assure that governmental authorities, private insurers, or private whistleblowers will not challenge our practices. Such a challenge could\nresult in a material adverse effect on our business. We therefore could be exposed to potential liability, penalties, or limitations on our operations due to failure to comply with\nsignificant government regulation and laboratory operations.\nExisting federal laws governing Medicare and Medicaid, as well as other state and federal laws, also regulate certain aspects of the relationship between healthcare providers,\nincluding clinical laboratories, and their referral sources, including physicians, hospitals and other laboratories. Some of these laws, including the federal AKS and the federal\nStark Law contain extremely broad proscriptions. Violation of these laws can result in criminal or civil penalties, exclusion from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid, and\nother federal healthcare programs, repayment of reimbursement received related to services tied to any impermissible referrals, or civil monetary penalties, which may be\nsignificant, as well as potential False Claims Act liability. Government authorities may determine that our arrangements with physicians and other clients do not comply with\nthe federal AKS, Stark Law, and similar state laws, and may impose civil monetary penalties or exclude us from participation in federal healthcare programs based on our\narrangements with physicians and other clients. The Company, voluntarily conducted an internal investigation, with the assistance of outside counsel, that focused on the\ncompliance of certain consulting and service agreements with federal healthcare laws and regulations, including those relating to fraud, waste, and abuse. Based on this internal\ninvestigation, the Company voluntarily notified the OIG of the Company’s internal investigation in November 2021. The Company’s interactions with regulatory authorities and\nthe Company’s related review of this matter are ongoing. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has accrued a reserve of $11.2 million in other long-term liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets for potential damages and liabilities associated with the federal healthcare program revenue received by the Company in connection with the\nagreements at issue that were identified during the course of this internal investigation. This reserve reflects management’s best estimate of the minimum probable loss\nassociated with this matter. As a result of the internal investigation and ongoing interactions with regulatory authorities, the Company may accrue additional reserves for any\nrelated potential damages and liabilities arising out of this matter. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the duration, scope, result, or related costs associated with any\nfurther investigation, including by the OIG, or any other governmental authority, or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek. Accordingly, at this time, the Company is\nunable to estimate a range of possible loss in excess of the amount reserved. Determinations that the Company’s operations or activities do not, or did not, comply with laws or\nregulations, however, may result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties, disgorgement, restitution, equitable relief, exclusion from participation in federal\nhealthcare programs or other losses or conduct restrictions, which could be material to the Company’s financial results or business operations.\nThe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“federal CMP Law”) imposes civil monetary penalties and potential exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs on any person\nwho offers or transfers remuneration to any patient, who is a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary, when the person knows or should know that the remuneration is likely to induce\nthe patient to receive medical services from a particular provider. The federal CMP Law applies, among other things, to many kinds of inducements or benefits provided to\npatients, including complimentary items or services that are of more than nominal value. Government authorities may determine our operations and provision of services do not\ncomply with the law and its interpretations and impose civil monetary penalties and exclude us from participation in Medicare and Medicaid for past or present practices related\nto patient incentive, coordination of care and need-based programs.\nTests which are reimbursed by Medicare and other Government payers (for example, State Medicaid programs) accounted for approximately 16%, 18% and 17% of our\nrevenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Medicare program imposes extensive and detailed requirements on diagnostic service\nproviders, including, but not limited to, rules that govern how we structure our relationships with physicians, how and when we submit claims for reimbursement, and how we\nprovide specialized diagnostic laboratory services. Further, we are prohibited from contracting with any individuals or entities who have been excluded from participation in\nMedicare or Medicaid and are listed on the OIG’s List of Excluded Individuals and Entities List (“LEIE”) or in the System for Award Management, which includes the\npreviously independent Government Services Administration’s Excluded Parties List System (“GSA-EPLS”).

If we were unable to receive reimbursement under a governmental payer program, a substantial portion of our revenues would be lost, which would\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws, including physician self-referral laws and anti-kickback laws, may subject us to liability, penalties, or limitation of\noperations.\nWe are subject to the federal Stark Law, as well as similar state statutes and regulations, which prohibit billing Medicare for certain healthcare services, which are referred to as\nDHS, rendered as a result of referrals by physicians to DHS entities with which the physicians (or their immediate family members) have a financial relationship unless an\nexception is met. A “financial relationship” includes both an ownership interest and/or a compensation arrangement with a physician, both direct and indirect, and DHS\nincludes, but is not limited to, laboratory services. The Stark Law prohibits an entity that receives a prohibited DHS referral from seeking payment from Medicare for any DHS\nservices performed as a result of such a referral, unless an arrangement is carefully structured to satisfy every requirement of a regulatory exception. The Stark Law is a strict\nliability statute, and thus any technical violation requires repayment of all “tainted” referrals, regardless of the intent, unless an exception applies. Penalties for violating the\nStark Law may include the denial of payment to an entity for the impermissible provision of DHS, the requirement to refund any amounts collected in violation of the Stark\nLaw, and substantial civil monetary penalties for each circumvention arrangement or scheme. Other implications of a Stark Law violation may include exclusion from Medicare\nand Medicaid programs, and potential False Claims Act liability, including via “qui tam” action.\nFurther, many states have promulgated self-referral laws and regulations similar to the federal Stark Law, and these vary significantly based on the state. In addition to services\nreimbursed by Medicaid or government payers, these state laws and regulations can encompass services reimbursed by private payers and self-pay patients as well. Penalties for\nviolating state self-referral laws and regulations vary based on the state, but often include civil penalties, exclusion from Medicaid, and loss of licenses.\nOur financial arrangements with physicians are governed by the federal Stark Law, and we rely on certain exceptions to the Stark Law with respect to such relationships. If we\nare found by the government to be in violation of the Stark Law, we could be subject to significant penalties, including fines as specified above, exclusion from participation in\ngovernment and private payer programs and requirements to refund amounts previously received from government. Further, as our operations expand into new states and\njurisdictions, we must continually evaluate whether our relationships with physicians comply with such new jurisdiction’s laws. This may require structural and organizational\nmodifications to our relationships with physicians, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the federal AKS, which is a criminal felony statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any form of remuneration\nin return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing, or arranging for or recommending the ordering, purchasing, or leasing of items or services payable by Medicare, Medicaid,\nor any other federally funded healthcare program. Remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, in cash or in kind, and thus can implicate financial\nrelationships involving payments not commensurate with fair market value, such as in the form of office space, equipment leases, professional or technical services, or anything\nelse of value.\nThe AKS is an “intent-based” statute, meaning that a violation occurs when one or both parties intend the remuneration to be in exchange for or to induce referrals. In 2010, the\nACA, amended the intent requirement of the AKS. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the\nACA provides that a claim submitted for reimbursement for items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the\nfederal False Claims Act.\nThere are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions; however, the\nexceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. Violations of the AKS may\nresult in substantial civil or criminal penalties, including criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties under the federal CMP Law, civil penalties and damages under the federal\nFalse Claims Act and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If we face these penalties or exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid,\nit could significantly reduce our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n30"

Some of these state laws apply to items and services paid for by private payers as well as by government payers.\nIn addition, many states have adopted laws prohibiting the splitting or sharing of fees between physicians and non-physicians, as well as between treating physicians and\nreferral sources. If we are found to be in violation of the AKS or a similar state anti-kickback law, we could be subject to significant penalties, including fines, exclusion from\nparticipation in government and private payer programs, or obligations to refund amounts previously received from government payers. We also could be required to restructure\nor terminate our contractual and other arrangements with physicians, which could result in a loss of revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSome states have also adopted laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine, or prohibiting business corporations from employing physicians or engaging in activities\nconsidered to be the “practice of medicine.” In these states, we rely on service agreements with physicians and/or professional associations owned by physicians, to perform\nneeded professional pathology services. We cannot be certain that a physician or physician’s professional organization will not seek to terminate an agreement with us on any\nbasis, nor can we be certain that governmental authorities in those states will not seek termination of these arrangements on the basis of state laws prohibiting the corporate\npractice of medicine.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and international laws related to privacy and security could result in fines, penalties, and damage to the Company’s reputation\nwith customers and could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business.\nIn the U.S., HIPAA, as expanded through the HITECH Act and as implemented through the HIPAA Rules, and similar state laws contain provisions that require the electronic\nexchange of health information, such as claims submission and receipt of remittances, using standard transactions and code sets, which we refer to as “Standards,” and regulate\nthe use and disclosure of patient records and other PHI. These provisions, which address security and confidentiality of patient information as well as the administrative aspects\nof claims handling, have very broad applicability and govern many healthcare providers, including physicians and clinical laboratories. Failure to comply with the Standards, the\nHIPAA Rules , and applicable state privacy and security laws, could result in material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and our financial condition and\ncould subject us to liability.\nThe HIPAA Rules establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of PHI by certain entities including health plans and healthcare providers,\nand set standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic medical records. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework governing the\nuse and disclosure of PHI, including, for example, the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the\npatient; a patient’s right to access, amend, and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI; the content of notices of privacy practices describing how PHI is used and\ndisclosed and individuals’ rights with respect to their PHI; and implementation of administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect privacy and security of PHI. The\nfederal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose certain individually identifiable patient health information, without patient authorization, for purposes other than\npayment, treatment, or healthcare operations, as defined by HIPAA, except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the\nHIPAA Rules. The HIPAA Rules do not supersede state laws that may be more stringent; therefore, we are required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations\nand varying state privacy and security laws and regulations.\nThe HIPAA Rules also require healthcare providers like us to notify affected individuals, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and in some\ncases, the media, when PHI has been “breached,” as defined by HIPAA. Many states have similar breach notification laws. In the event of a breach, we could incur substantial\noperational and financial costs related to mitigation and remediation, including preparation and delivery of notices to affected individuals. Additionally, HIPAA and its\nimplementing regulations provide for significant civil fines, criminal penalties, and other sanctions for failure to comply with the privacy, security, and breach notification rules,\nincluding for wrongful or impermissible use or disclosure of PHI. Although the HIPAA statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of action for damages,\nwe could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful or impermissible use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal\ninformation. Additionally, HIPAA allows state Attorneys General to bring an action against a covered entity, such as us, for a violation of HIPAA. We insure some of our risk\nwith respect to HIPAA security breaches, but operational costs and penalties associated with HIPAA breaches easily could exceed our insured limits.\nHIPAA imposes additional requirements, restrictions, and penalties on covered entities and their business associates to, among other things, deter breaches of security. As a\nresult, in addition to the aforementioned reporting requirements, covered entities and their business associates may be required to take preventative and remedial actions, as well\nas face stringent\n31"

Despite our implementation of various security\nmeasures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, and other disruptive problems inadvertently introduced by authorized users such as employees\nand clients, or purposefully targeted by hackers and other cybercriminals which could lead to interruption, delays, or cessation in service to our clients. Further, such incidents,\nwhether electronic or physical, could jeopardize the security of confidential information, including PHI and other sensitive information stored in our computer systems related to\nclients, patients, and other parties connected through us, which may deter potential clients and give rise to uncertain liability to parties whose security or privacy has been\ninfringed. A significant security breach could result in fines, loss of clients, damage to our reputation, direct damages, costs of repair and detection, costs to remedy the breach,\ngovernment penalties, and other expenses. We insure some of our risk with respect to security breaches but the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, and our financial condition.\nIn the United States, in addition to the HIPAA Rules described above, the Company is subject to additional federal and state laws regarding the handling and disclosure of\npatient records and patient health information. Effective April 5, 2021, HHS published a final rule implementing the information blocking provisions (Information Blocking\nRules) of the 21  Century Cures Act. The Information Blocking Rules prohibit covered actors, including healthcare providers, from engaging in activity that is likely to interfere\nwith the access, exchanges, or use of electronic health information (“EHI”) unless such activity falls into one of eight exceptions. The Information Blocking Rules provide for\ncivil monetary penalties for noncompliance by healthcare IT vendors and, separately, “appropriate disincentives” for noncompliance by healthcare providers.\nThe HIPAA Rules do not supersede state laws that may be more stringent; therefore, we are required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations as well as\nvarying state privacy and security laws and regulations. These laws vary widely. For example, many states have implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific\npatient consent requirements and limiting the disclosure of genetic test results. Penalties for violation include sanctions against a laboratory’s licensure as well as civil or\ncriminal penalties. Additionally, private individuals may have a right of action against the Company for violations of a state’s privacy laws.\nNumerous other federal, state, and international laws govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information and may complicate our compliance efforts. Failure to\ncomply with these laws can result in the imposition of significant fines and impact our ability to process certain personal data. For example, in the U.S., the CCPA affords\nCalifornia residents expanded privacy rights and protections and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action related to certain data security breaches.\nThese protections have been expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which became operational in most key respects on January 1, 2023. Similar laws have\nbeen proposed or passed at the U.S. federal and state level, including the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which took effect on January 1, 2023, the Colorado Consumer\nProtection Act, which will take effect on July 1, 2023, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, which will take effect on July 1, 2023, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, which will\ntake effect on December 31, 2023. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of\nfocus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including laws in all 50 states requiring security breach notification in some circumstances.\nThese and other laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business.\nOutside of the U.S., the GDPR, for example, imposes penalties of up to 4.0% of annual global turnover. The GDPR imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on\nthe ability to process (which includes collection, analysis, and transfer of) personal data, including health data from performance of clinical tests, clinical trials and adverse event\nreporting. The GDPR also includes requirements relating to establishing a legal basis for processing personal data, the information provided to the individuals prior to\nprocessing their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the national data protection authorities, standards for binding vendors that\nprocess personal data, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. Further, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU that are\nnot considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection, including to the United States, except if the data controller meets very specific\nrequirements. Following the Schrems II decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) on July 16, 2020, which invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield\nFramework (the “Privacy Shield”) under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to US entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme, there is\nconsiderable uncertainty as to the permissibility of international data transfers under the GDPR. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a\nstandard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it made clear\nthat reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking\ninto account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals. On June 4, 2021, the European\nCommission released two revised sets of standard contractual clauses, which have been designed in part to assist organizations in meeting\nst\n32"

However, it is unclear how the use of these clauses will be scrutinized and enforced by supervisory authorities and privacy interest\ngroups.\nThese recent developments may require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make and/ or receive personal data transfers to/ in the United States. As\nsupervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, and/or start\ntaking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data\nbetween and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our\nrelevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition to the GDPR, numerous other countries have implemented laws governing the use, processing, and cross-border transfer of personal data, such as Switzerland’s\nFADP, Singapore’s PDPA, and China’s PIPL.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is highly dynamic in the United States and throughout the world and may adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks related to the public health crises such as the global COVID-19 pandemic. Economic and health conditions in the United States and across most of the\nglobe continue to change rapidly. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced significant volatility, including periods of material decline compared to prior\nyear periods, in testing volumes in the Company’s base business (which excludes COVID-19 molecular and antibody testing). Demand may fluctuate depending on the duration\nand severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, additional governmental actions that may be taken\nand/or extensions of time for restrictions that have been imposed to date, and numerous other uncertainties. Such events may result in business disruption, reduced revenues and\nreduced number of tests, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the Company’s customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, but the Company is not able to assess the full extent of the\ncurrent impact nor predict the ultimate consequences that may result. At this time, we have not experienced significant interruptions in our operations due to supplier delays.\nWe have established a COVID-19 procurement team to partner with our suppliers to reduce the risk of disruption. Distribution channels have not been disrupted as incoming\nand outgoing tests are delivered via major carriers.\nWhile the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, the widespread pandemic has resulted in, and may\ncontinue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets and a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our\nbusiness and the value of our common stock. The ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company is highly uncertain and will depend on future\ndevelopments which cannot be predicted.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and need to hire additional qualified personnel in order for our business to succeed.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our senior management and key technical personnel. In particular, our success depends substantially on the\ncontinued efforts of our senior management team. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, our medical staff, our laboratory directors or other key employees\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and our financial condition. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and\nretain highly qualified managerial and technical personnel as we continue to grow. Competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be able to retain our key\nmanagerial and technical employees or may not be able to attract and retain additional highly qualified managerial and technical personnel in the future. The inability to attract\nand retain the necessary managerial and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our ability to retain existing clients for our specialized diagnostic services and attract new clients is dependent upon retaining existing sales representatives and\nhiring and training new sales representatives, which are expensive and time-consuming processes. We face intense competition for qualified sales personnel and our inability to\nhire or retain an adequate number of sales representatives could limit our ability to maintain or expand our business and increase sales. Even if we are able to increase our sales\nforce, our new sales personnel may not commit the necessary resources or provide sufficient high quality service and attention to effectively market and sell our services. If we\nare unable to maintain and expand our marketing and sales networks, or if our sales personnel do not perform to our standards, we may be unable to maintain or\n33"

If a sales representative ceases employment, such termination\ncould result in the loss of client goodwill based on the impairment of relationships developed between the sales representative and the healthcare professionals for whom the\nsales representative was responsible. This is particularly a risk if the representative goes to work for a competitor, as the healthcare professionals that are our clients may choose\nto use a competitor’s services based on their relationship with our former sales representative.\nFurther, non-compliant activities and unlawful conduct by sales and marketing personnel could give rise to significant risks under the AKS. We require extensive,\ncomprehensive training of all sales and marketing personnel, but cannot guarantee that every staff member will comply with the training. Thus, in addition to the cost of training\nsales and marketing personnel, we could face liability under the AKS for non-compliance by individuals engaged in prohibited sales and marketing activities.\nOur business operations and reputation may be materially impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies.\nIn our business, we collect, generate, process, or maintain sensitive information, such as patient data and other personal information. If we use or do not adequately safeguard\nsuch information in compliance with applicable requirements under federal, state, and international laws, or if such information were disclosed to persons or entities that should\nnot have access to it, our business could be materially impaired, our reputation could suffer, and we could be subject to fines, penalties, and litigation. In the event of a data\nsecurity breach, we may be subject to notification obligations, litigation, and governmental investigation or sanctions and may suffer reputational damage, which could have an\nadverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information, including: (a) HIPAA and the regulations\nthereunder, which establish (i) a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and (ii) comprehensive federal standards\nregarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information; (b) state laws, including the CCPA; and (c) the European Union’s GDPR.\nWe may not be able to implement our business strategy, which could impair our ability to continue operations.\nImplementation of our business strategies will depend in large part on our ability to (i) attract and maintain a significant number of clients; (ii) effectively provide acceptable\nproducts and services to our clients; (iii) develop and license new products and technologies; (iv) obtain adequate financing on favorable terms to fund our business strategies;\n(v) maintain appropriate internal procedures, policies, and systems; (vi) hire, train, and retain skilled employees and management; (vii) continue to operate despite competition\nin the medical laboratory industry; (viii) be paid reasonable fees by government payers that will adequately cover our costs; (ix) establish, develop, and maintain our name\nrecognition; and (x) establish and maintain beneficial relationships with third-party insurance providers and other third-party payers. Our inability to obtain or maintain any or\nall these factors could impair our ability to implement our business strategies successfully, which could have material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe may be unable to realize estimated benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business might otherwise\nbe adversely affected.\nWe engaged in restructuring activities in 2022 and these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are ongoing and complex. If we do not successfully manage our\ncurrent restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may take in the future, any expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and\nour operations and business could be disrupted. Restructuring presents potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us, including: actual or perceived disruption\nof service to customers; the failure to preserve supplier relationships and distribution, sales and other important relationships and to resolve conflicts that may arise; diversion of\nmanagement attention from ongoing business activities; and the failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees. In addition, the costs associated with\nimplementing restructuring activities might exceed expectations, which could result in additional future charges. Because of these and other factors, we cannot predict whether\nwe will realize the purpose and anticipated benefits of these measures and, if we do not, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions with our legacy business, the anticipated benefits of such transaction may not be realized.\nAcquisitions require us to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the acquired company’s business practices and operations with our own.\nPotential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and cash flows, include the following:\n34"

These factors would include the reactions of third parties with whom we enter into contracts and do business and the reactions of\ninvestors and analysts.\nIf we cannot successfully integrate our legacy business with any future business we may acquire, we may fail to realize the expected benefits of such transaction, including the\nanticipated cost synergies. We could also encounter additional transaction and integration costs or be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates.\nIf goodwill and intangible assets that we recorded in connection with our acquisitions become impaired, we may have to take significant charges against earnings.\nIn connection with the accounting for our completed acquisitions, we recorded a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible\nassets are evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if conditions warrant, by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Intangible\nassets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Declines in operating results,\nsustained market declines and other factors that impact the fair values of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets and a charge against\nearnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition in future periods.\nWe may incur greater costs than anticipated, which could result in sustained losses.\nWe use reasonable efforts to assess and predict the expenses necessary to pursue our business strategies. However, implementing our business strategies may require more\nemployees, capital equipment, supplies, or other expenditure items than management has predicted, particularly as we continue to assess any further needs resulting from the\ngrowth of our Pharma Services segment. Similarly, the cost of compensating additional management, employees, and consultants or other operating costs may be more than we\nestimate, which could result in ongoing and sustained losses.\nWe may face fluctuations in our results of operations and we are subject to seasonality in our business which could negatively affect our business operations.\nManagement expects that our results of operations may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the continued rate\nof growth, usage, and acceptance of our products and services; (ii) demand for our products and services; (iii) the introduction and acceptance of new or enhanced products or\nservices by us or by competitors; (iv) our ability to anticipate and effectively adapt to developing markets and to rapidly changing technologies;\n35"

Accordingly, future sales and operating results are difficult to\nforecast. Our expenses are based in part on our expectations as to future revenues and to a significant extent are relatively fixed, at least in the short-term. We may not be able to\nadjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in relation to our expectations would likely have\nan immediate adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, we may determine from time to time to make certain pricing or\nmarketing decisions or acquisitions that could have a short-term material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and may not result in the\nlong-term benefits intended.

NeoGenomics\nserves the needs of pathologists, oncologists, academic centers, hospital systems, pharmaceutical firms, integrated service delivery networks, and managed care organizations\nthroughout the United States and pharmaceutical firms in Europe and Asia.\n2022 Overview and Highlights\n•\nWe increased consolidated revenue by 5.2% compared to 2021, including increases in Clinical Services revenue of 3.6% and in Pharma Services revenue of 13.5%;\n•\nRevenue growth over prior year accelerated each quarter in 2022;\n•\nReported sequential revenue, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA growth in each of the four quarters of 2022;\n•\nStrengthened our executive leadership team by welcoming Chris Smith, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Sherman, Chief Financial Officer; Warren Stone, President,\nClinical Services; Vishal Sikri, President, Pharma Services and President and Chief Commercial Officer, Inivata; and Melody Harris, President, Enterprise Operations;\n•\nDeveloped our vision of “OneNeo” to better integrate the Company, align our core capabilities and enhance communication; and\n•\nInitiated a restructuring effort to take significant costs out of the business in 2023.\nCompany Outlook\nAdvances in science and technology are driving a proliferation of oncology therapies and associated diagnostic tests. These diagnostic tools and therapies are increasing\nsurvival and enhancing quality-of-life for cancer patients. As a leading global oncology diagnostics company serving biopharmaceutical companies as well as practicing\noncologists and pathologists, NeoGenomics facilitates the adoption of these advanced oncology diagnostic tools beyond the academic environment into the community setting.\nWe are continuously enhancing and expanding our test menu to ensure that providers and patients have access to leading edge solutions such as advanced molecular testing and\nstate-of-the art digital pathology. Moreover, our team of MDs and PhDs, along with our highly-trained oncology-focused sales team, provides ongoing education to our clients\nto ensure that they remain abreast of cutting-edge developments in oncology.\nWe are a leading provider of oncology-diagnostic services to biopharma companies. We will continue to work with these clients across the drug development continuum—from\nresearch and development through clinical trials testing—to commercialization of companion diagnostic tests. We expect to continue to grow our Pharma Services business\nthrough (i) global expansion in both Europe and Asia, (ii) expansion of our test offerings (including leading edge NGS tools such as WES, WGS, RaDaR), and (iii) our unique\ncapabilities for developing and commercializing companion diagnostic tests.\nWe are continuing to develop and broaden our informatics and data-related tools to leverage our strategic market position and oncology expertise to help our stakeholders solve\nreal-world problems such as identifying patients for clinical trials or providing clinical decision support tools for physicians and providers. We are committed to connecting\npatients with life altering therapies and trials. In carrying out these commitments, NeoGenomics aims to provide transparency and choice to patients regarding the handling and\nuse of their data through our Notice of Privacy Practices, and has invested in leading technologies to help ensure the data we maintain is secured at all times.\nWe believe lower cost and increased value of testing is extremely important to the healthcare industry and creates a competitive advantage. We will invest in information\ntechnology, automation and best practices to continually improve our processes and drive down the cost of testing. We will continue to expand our test menu and expect to\nremain at the forefront of the ongoing revolution in cancer related genetic and molecular testing to achieve our vision of becoming one of the world’s leading cancer testing and\ninformation companies.\nWe continue to develop our company-wide focus, which includes the following four critical success factors for 2023:\nProfitably Grow Core Business\n•\nGrow volume and NGS mix;\n•\nImprove turnaround time;\n•\nWin on service;\n•\nExpand and optimize commercial optimization; and\n•\nImprove product offering.\nAccelerate Advanced Diagnostics\n•\nExecute clinical RaDaR™ (MRD) launch;\n40"

We have structured departmental goals around these factors and have created employee\nincentive plans in which every employee will have a meaningful incentive for our success.\nRegulatory Environment\nThe FDA is currently considering changes that may include increased regulation of LDTs by the FDA. In October 2014 the FDA announced its proposed framework and\ntimetable and indicated it would move toward greater oversight of LDTs. The FDA has not finalized the framework they announced in 2014. In 2017 the FDA shifted its\napproach to oversight of LDTs, indicating that they would work with Congress and stakeholders on a new legislative framework and pathway for all diagnostic testing. In 2018\nthe FDA began limited enforcement activities on a subset of LDTs known as pharmacogenetic testing (“PGx”). NeoGenomics is a member of the American Clinical Laboratory\nAssociation (“ACLA”), which has been in active discussions with the FDA and Congress regarding FDA oversight of LDT’s. However, recent agency announcements made in\nthe context of the COVID-19 public health emergency have produced a shifting policy landscape and further uncertainty regarding FDA’s role in regulating LDTs: in August\n2020, HHS announced that FDA would not require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, but in November 2021, HHS issued a statement\nwithdrawing that prior announcement, indicating a return to FDA’s longstanding approach to the regulation and enforcement discretion toward LDTs. The most recent such\nproposal, the VALID Act, was introduced in both the House and Senate on June 24, 2021. The VALID Act was expected to be included in the Omnibus bill signed at the end of\n2022, but ultimately was not included and that, as such, it remains unclear whether the VALID Act will be passed 2023 or whether FDA will proceed through rulemaking. At\nthis time, we cannot predict what the current administration impact will be on the oversight and regulation of LDTs or if there will be any additional changes to current rules\nand regulations.\nWe closely monitor changes in legislation and take specific actions to identify and estimate the impact of changes in legislation whenever possible as regulatory changes can\naffect reimbursement for clinical laboratory services. We do not anticipate significant changes to our clinical revenue in 2023 resulting from known changes in legislation or\nrulemaking.\nReportable Segments\nWe report our activities in two reportable segments—the Clinical Services Segment and the Pharma Services Segment. We have presented the financial information reviewed\nby the Chief Operating Decision Maker including revenues, cost of revenue, and gross margin for each of our reportable segments. Assets are not presented at the segment level\nas that information is not used by the CODM.\nClinical Services\nThe clinical cancer testing services we offer to community-based pathologists and oncologists are designed to be a natural extension of, and complementary to, the services that\nthey perform within their own practices. We believe our relationship as a non-competitive partner to community-based pathology practices, hospital pathology labs, reference\nlabs, and academic centers can empower them to expand their breadth of testing to provide a menu of services that could match or exceed the level of service found in any\ncenter of excellence around the world. Community-based pathology practices and hospital pathology labs may order certain testing services on a technical component only\n(“TC” or “tech-only”) basis, which allows them to participate in the diagnostic process by performing the professional component (“PC”) interpretation services without having\nto hire laboratory technologists or purchase the sophisticated equipment needed to perform the technical component of the tests. We also support our pathology clients with\ninterpretation and consultative services using our own specialized team of pathologists for difficult or complex cases and we provide overflow interpretation services when\nrequested by clients.\nWe are a leading provider of Molecular and NGS testing. These tests are interpreted by NeoGenomics’ team of Molecular experts and are often ordered in conjunction with\nother testing modalities. NGS panels are one of our fastest growing testing areas and clients can often receive a significant amount of biomarker information from very limited\nsamples. These\n41"

We have a broad\nMolecular testing menu and our targeted NeoTYPE panels include genes relevant to a particular cancer type, as well as other complementary tests such as IHC and FISH. In\naddition, we offer molecular-only NGS targeted and comprehensive panels which combine DNA and RNA into a single work stream in order to report a full spectrum of\ngenomic alterations, including mutations, fusions, copy number variations, and gene expression. This comprehensive menu means that our clients can get most of their\noncology testing needs satisfied by our laboratory. This is attractive to our clients as patient samples do not need to be split and then managed across several laboratories. The\nacquisition of Inivata provided us with oncology Liquid Biopsy technology capabilities. InVisionFirst -Lung is a highly sensitive, targeted plasma-based assay for patients with\nnon-small cell lung cancer, and RaDaR  is an industry-leading liquid biopsy assay designed to detect residual disease and recurrence in plasma samples from patients with solid\ntumor malignancies. We expect our Molecular laboratory and NGS capabilities to be a key growth driver in the coming years.\nIn addition, we directly serve oncology, dermatology and other clinician practices that prefer to have a direct relationship with a laboratory for cancer-related genetic testing\nservices. We typically serve these types of clients with a comprehensive service offering where we perform both the technical and professional components of the tests ordered.\nIn certain instances, larger clinician practices have begun to internalize pathology interpretation services, and our tech-only service offering allows these larger clinician\npractices to also participate in the diagnostic process by performing the PC interpretation services on TC testing performed by us. In these instances we will typically provide all\nof the more complex, molecular testing services.\nPharma Services\nOur Pharma Services revenue consists of three revenue streams:\n•\nClinical trials and research;\n•\nValidation laboratory services; and\n•\nInformatics.\nOur Pharma Services segment supports pharmaceutical firms in their drug development programs by supporting various clinical trials and research. This portion of our business\noften involves working with the pharmaceutical firms (“sponsors”) on study design as well as performing the required testing. Our medical team often advises the sponsor and\nworks closely with them as specimens are received from the enrolled sites. We also work on developing tests that will be used as part of a companion diagnostic to determine\npatients’ response to a particular drug. As studies unfold, our clinical trials team reports the data and often provides key analysis and insights back to the sponsors.\nOur Pharma Services segment provides comprehensive testing services in support of our pharmaceutical clients’ oncology programs from discovery to commercialization. In\nbiomarker discovery, our aim is to help our customers discover the right content. We help our customers develop a biomarker hypothesis by recommending an optimal platform\nfor molecular screening and backing our discovery tools with the informatics to capture meaningful data. In other pre-clinical and non-clinical work, we can use our platforms to\ncharacterize markers of interest. Moving from discovery to development, we seek to help our customers refine their biomarker strategy and, if applicable, develop a companion\ndiagnostic pathway using the optimal technology for large-scale clinical trial testing.\nWhether serving as the single contract research organization or partnering with one, our Pharma Services team provides significant technical expertise, working closely with our\ncustomers to support each stage of clinical trial development. Each trial we support comes with rapid turnaround time, dedicated project management and quality assurance\noversight. We have experience in supporting submissions to the Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) for companion diagnostics. Our Pharma Services strategy is focused on\nhelping to bring more effective oncology treatments to market through providing world-class laboratory services in oncology to key pharmaceutical companies in the industry.\nWe believe that we are well positioned to service Pharma sponsors across the full continuum of the drug development process. Our Pharma Services team can work with these\nsponsors during the basic research and development phase as compounds come out of translational research departments, as well as work with clients from Phase I, Phase II and\nPhase III clinical trials as the sponsors work to demonstrate the efficacy of their drugs. The laboratory biomarker tests that are developed during this process may become\ncompanion diagnostic (“CDx”) tests, that will be used on patients to determine if they could respond to a certain therapy. We are able to offer these CDx tests to the market\nimmediately after FDA approval as part of our Day 1 readiness program. This ability helps to speed the commercialization of a drug and can enable Pharma sponsors to reach\npatients through our broad distribution channel in the Clinical Services segment.\nWe are committed to connecting patients with life-altering therapies and trials. In carrying out these commitments, we aim to provide transparency and choice to patients\nregarding the handling and use of their data through our Notice of Privacy\n®\n®\n42"

Trapelo™ is an end-to-end, clinical decision-support platform designed to resolve the complexities of precision oncology –\nfrom test ordering to therapy selection to navigating prior authorization.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the\neffects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Please refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete\ndescription of our significant accounting policies.\nOur critical accounting policies are those where we have made difficult, subjective, or complex judgments in making estimates and/or where these estimates can significantly\nimpact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions. Our critical accounting policies are:\n•\nBusiness Combinations;\n•\nAccounts Receivable;\n•\nRecoverability and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets;\n•\nGoodwill;\n•\nContingencies;\n•\nStock-based Compensation;\n•\nRevenue Recognition; and\n•\nDeferred Taxes.\nBusiness Combinations\nResults of operations and cash flows of acquired companies are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to\nthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to the net tangible and\nidentifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded to goodwill. Transaction costs associated with acquisitions are expensed as incurred in general and\nadministrative expenses.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are reported for all Clinical Services payers based on the amount expected to be collected, which considers implicit price concessions.\nFor Pharma Services, we negotiate billing schedules and payment terms on a contract-by-contract basis, which often includes payments based on certain milestones being\nachieved. Receivables are generally reported over time based on the number of units completed, which aligns with the progress towards fulfilling its obligations under the\ncontract.\nRecoverability and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review the recoverability of our long-lived assets (including definite-lived intangible assets) if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired.\nEvaluation of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the\nrelated operations. If the expected undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between\nthe estimated fair value to the carrying amount of the asset.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators could include, but are\nnot limited to, (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. We\nfirst assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\n43"

If management concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management performs\na quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative analysis is performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value is\ngreater than the estimate of fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount in which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. We estimate\nthe fair values of our reporting units using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies’\ndata.\nAs of June 30, 2022 we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were less than their\ncarrying values. Such qualitative factors included macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance and other relevant\nevents. As a result of the qualitative assessment, we determined that due to changes in executive leadership and the sustained decline in our stock price of $12.15 per share as of\nMarch 31, 2022 to $8.15 per share as of June 30, 2022, there were indicators that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were less than their\ncarrying values. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative analysis and compared our reporting units’ fair values to their carrying values to determine whether goodwill was\nimpaired. We determined the fair values of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach using discounted cash flows and the market approach utilizing\ncomparable companies’ data. The assumptions and estimates, including management’s estimated future revenue growth rates, estimated future margins and discount rates, used\nin the quantitative analysis were based on management’s best estimate about current and future conditions including projected net revenue from emerging market technologies\nacquired through the June 2021 acquisition of Inivata. The results of the quantitative analysis showed that the reporting units’ fair values exceeded their carrying values and\nthere was no impairment of the recorded goodwill as of June 30, 2022. However, to the extent we continue to experience declines in our stock price or experience other\nindicators, such as industry and market considerations or declines in financial performance, that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values, there\ncould be a risk of goodwill impairment of our reporting units in future periods.\nContingencies\nWe accrue contingent losses when estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involve uncertain outcomes. Contingent losses are recorded based on\nmanagement judgment along with internal and external advice from legal counsel and/or technical consultants. Estimated losses from contingencies are recorded when both of\nthe following conditions are met: (i) information available before the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued) indicates that it is probable that an asset has been\nimpaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If some amount within a range of loss\nappears at the time to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount shall be accrued. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any\nother amount, however, the minimum amount in the range shall be accrued.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs for all share-based payment awards made to employees, non-employee contracted physicians and directors based upon the awards’ initial\ngrant-date fair value. Prior to 2021, we estimated the fair value of stock options using a trinomial lattice model. On January 1, 2021, we began applying the Black-Scholes\noption valuation model on a prospective basis to new awards. Stock compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the awards’ requisite service periods. The periodic\nexpense is adjusted for actual forfeitures.\nRevenue Recognition\nClinical Services Revenue\nOur specialized diagnostic services are performed based on an online test order or a written test requisition form. The performance obligation is satisfied and revenues are\nrecognized once the diagnostic services have been performed and the results have been delivered to the ordering physician. These diagnostic services are billed to various\npayers, including client direct billing, commercial insurance, Medicare and other government payers, and patients. Revenue is recorded for all payers based on the amount\nexpected to be collected, which considers implicit price concessions. Implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we\nexpect to receive based on negotiated discounts, historical collection experience and other anticipated adjustments, including anticipated payer denials. Collection of\nconsideration we expect to receive typically occurs within 90 to 120 days of billing for commercial insurance, Medicare and other governmental and self-pay patients and within\n60 to 90 days of billing for client payers.\nThe following table reflects our estimate of the breakdown of net clinical revenue by type of payer for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n44"

Such services also include validation studies and assay development. We record revenue on a unit-of-service basis based on the number of\nunits completed towards the satisfaction of a performance obligation. Certain contracts include upfront fees or billing milestones that are recognized over time, which aligns\nwith the progress of fulfilling our obligations under the contract.\nAdditional offerings within the Pharma Services portfolio includes Informatics, which involves the licensing of de-identified data to pharmaceutical and biotech customers in\nthe form of either retrospective records or prospective deliveries of data. Informatics revenue is recognized at a point in time upon delivery of retrospective data or over time for\nprospective data feeds. We negotiate billing schedules and payment terms on a contract-by-contract basis, and contract terms generally provide for payments based on a unit-of-\nservice arrangement.\nAmounts collected in advance of services being provided are deferred as contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The associated revenue is recognized and the\ncontract liability is reduced as the contracted services are subsequently performed. Contract assets are established for revenue recognized but not yet billed. These contract\nassets are reduced once the customer is invoiced and a corresponding receivable is recorded. Additionally, Pharma Services incurs sales commissions in the process of obtaining\ncontracts with customers. Sales commissions that are payable upon contract award are recognized as assets and amortized over the expected life of the customer relationship.\nFor offerings with primarily short-term contracts, such as Informatics, we apply the practical expedient which allows costs to obtain a contract to be expensed when incurred, if\nthe amortization period of the assets that would otherwise have been recognized is one year or less. Contract assets and capitalized commissions are included in other current\nassets and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMost contracts are terminable by the customer, either immediately or according to advance notice terms specified within the contracts. All contracts require payment of fees for\nservices rendered through the date of termination and may require payment for subsequent services necessary to conclude the study or close out the contract.\nDeferred Taxes\nOur accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in accounting estimates. The factors included in\nthe analysis are historical and projected future taxable income including evolving business practices of our industry. Changes in existing tax laws, regulations, rates and future\noperating results may impact the amount of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets over time.\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the existing deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we determined sufficient positive evidence did not exist to conclude it is more likely than not that net operating losses generated by our\noperations in the U.S., Switzerland, Singapore, and China would be able to be utilized in future periods and has therefore established a valuation allowance against the deferred\ntax assets generated by such losses.\n45"

Increases in Clinical Services revenue reflects an increase in average unit price due to strategic reimbursement initiatives and a more\nfavorable test mix.\nDue to the broad roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine and a sharp decline in the demand for COVID-19 PCR testing, we made the decision at the end of the first quarter 2021 to\nexit from COVID-19 PCR testing which was included in Clinical Services segment revenue.

These increases in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were partially offset by a\ndecrease when compared to the same period in 2021 of $11.1 million of loss contingency for a regulatory matter and $11.3 million of acquisition transaction costs related to the\nacquisitions of Inivata and Trapelo that occurred in the second quarter of 2021.\n(2)\n(3)\n(2) \n(3) \n47"

Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain income and/or expense items that management believes are not directly\nattributable to our core operating results and/or certain items that are inconsistent in amounts and frequency, making it difficult to perform a meaningful evaluation of our current\nor past operating performance. Management believes that the presentation of operating results using non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to\ninvestors by facilitating the analysis of our core test-level operating results across reporting periods and when comparing those same results to those published by our peers.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in evaluating future prospects. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures for financial and\noperational decision making, planning and forecasting purposes and to manage the business. These non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of financial\ninformation in accordance with U.S. GAAP financial results, should not be considered measures of liquidity, and are unlikely to be comparable to non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used by other companies. \n(5)\n(5)\n49"

This $39.3 million\nincrease was primarily driven by our operating results (net loss adjusted for depreciation, amortization of intangibles, and other non-cash charges) which resulted in $12.2\nmillion of higher cash used by operating activities year-over-year, as well as a $27.1 million increase in cash used resulting from net changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nThe increase in cash used by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 reflects cash used to fund the operating activities of\nour Inivata subsidiary which was acquired in June of 2021, an increase in higher payroll and payroll-related costs to support our strategic growth initiatives, as well as the timing\nof cash receipts and cash payments in the ordinary course of business which can cause operating cash flow to fluctuate from period to period.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by investing activities was $0.5 million, compared to $632.4 million of cash used in investing activities for the same\nperiod in 2021. This change was primarily due to a $419.4 million decrease in net cash used in business acquisitions, a $99.2 million decrease in purchases of marketable\nsecurities, a $33.3 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment, a $15.0 million decrease in loan receivable from non-consolidated affiliate, a $53.9 million increase\nin sales and maturities of marketable securities year-over-year, and a $12.1 million increase in proceeds from assets held for sale.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by financing activities was $11.8 million compared to $725.3 million for the same period in 2021. The cash provided\nby financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of $12.6 million for the issuance of common stock net of issuance costs offset by $0.8 million used\nfor the repayment of equipment financing obligations. The primary reason for the decrease in cash provided by financing activities year-over-year was that there were no\nconvertible debt or equity offerings for the year ended December 31, 2022. Comparatively, the year ended December 31, 2021 had convertible debt net proceeds of $334.4\nmillion and equity offering net proceeds of $408.1 million, partially offset by $29.3 million of premiums paid for capped call confirmations.\nLiquidity Outlook\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $263.2 million in cash and cash equivalents in addition to $174.8 million of marketable securities available to support current operational\nliquidity needs. We anticipate that the cash on hand, marketable securities, and cash collections are sufficient to fund our near-term capital and operating needs for at least the\nnext 12 months.

We forecast capital expenditures in order to execute on our business plan and maintain\ngrowth; however, the actual amount and timing of such capital expenditures will ultimately be determined by the volume of business. We currently anticipate that our capital\nexpenditures for the year ended December 31, 2023, will be in the range of $30.0 million to $40.0 million.

Depending on the severity and persistence of these inflationary pressures, we could experience, in the future, a negative impact on our\nfinancial results.

The 2025 Convertible Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 1.25%;\ntherefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure with respect to the 2025 Convertible Notes. In January 2021, we issued $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of\nthe 2028 Convertible Notes. The 2028 Convertible Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%; therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure with respect to\nthe 2028 Convertible Notes. However, the fair value of the 2025 Convertible Notes and 2028 Convertible Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value\nwill increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value is affected by our common stock price. The fair value will generally increase as our\ncommon stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price declines. We carry the 2025 Convertible Notes and 2028 Convertible Notes at face value\nless unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this\nobjective, we invest in highly liquid and high-quality U.S. government and other highly credit rated debt securities. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to\nfluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. To minimize our exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates,\nwe invest in short-term securities with short maturities. If a 1% change in interest rates were to have occurred on December 31, 2022, this change would not have had a material\neffect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date. Due to the short holding period of our investments, we do not believe that we have a material financial market\nrisk\n(8)\n(8)\n52"

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position\nof the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are\nnot, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Recognition—Clinical Services—Refer to Notes 2 and 13 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs discussed in Note 13 to the financial statements, revenue for the Company’s clinical services is recognized once the diagnostic services have been performed and the results\nhave been delivered to the ordering physician. Revenue is recorded for all payers based on the amount expected to be collected, which considers implicit price concessions.\nImplicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive based on negotiated discounts,\nhistorical collection experience and other anticipated adjustments, including anticipated payer denials.\nWe identified management’s estimation of implicit price concessions related to clinical services revenue recorded that has not been received in cash as a critical audit matter due\nto management’s manual process used to determine the estimate, and the significant judgments required by management to estimate payer behavior. This required a high degree\nof auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to expected\nreceipts that were applied in the estimate of implicit price concessions.\n55"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s judgments in the estimate of implicit price concessions included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s determination of assumptions used to calculate implicit price concessions.\n•\nWe tested the methodology used by the Company to estimate implicit price concessions.\n•\nWe tested the assumptions used by management to calculate implicit price concessions by:\n◦\nTesting the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculation of implicit price concessions.\n◦\nTesting the historical cash receipts compared to the amounts billed to payers, which are used in the estimate of implicit price concessions, by making selections\nand agreeing the selected information to source documents.\n◦\nTesting management’s ability to estimate implicit price concessions accurately by comparing recorded net revenue to cash receipts received through January\n2023.\n◦\nEvaluating trends in revenue and accounts receivable compared to previous periods to identify any evidence that may contradict management’s assertion\nregarding implicit price concessions.\nGoodwill — Clinical and Pharma Reporting Units — Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $522.8 million as of December 31, 2022, of which $458.8 million\nand $64.0 million was allocated to the Clinical and Pharma reporting units, respectively. As a result of the qualitative impairment assessment performed as of June 30, 2022, the\nCompany determined there were indicators it was more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units were less than their carrying values, including changes to\nexecutive leadership and a sustained decline in the Company’s stock price. Accordingly, the Company performed a quantitative analysis and determined the Clinical and\nPharma reporting units’ fair values exceeded their respective carrying values and there was no impairment of the recorded goodwill as of June 30, 2022.\nThe Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company determines the fair\nvalue of its reporting units using a combination of the income approach, using the discounted cash flow model, and the market approach. The determination of the fair value\nusing the discounted cash flow model requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to the selection of discount rates, the timing\nand amount of future revenues, and operating margins.\nWe identified goodwill for the Clinical and Pharma reporting units as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value\nof the Clinical and Pharma reporting units, and the sensitivity of those estimates and assumptions to change. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased\nextent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company’s estimates and\nassumptions related to the selection of the discount rates, forecasts of the timing and amount of future revenues, including the emerging market technology, RaDaR™, for which\nthere is limited historical data, and operating margins for the Clinical and Pharma reporting units.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the selection of discount rates, forecasts of future revenues, and operating margins for the Clinical and Pharma reporting units included the\nfollowing, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment assessment, including those over the determination of the fair value of the Clinical and\nPharma reporting units as of June 30, 2022, such as controls related to the selection of the discount rates for the Clinical and Pharma reporting units, management’s\nestimate of the timing and amount of future revenues, including revenues related to RaDaR™, and operating margins.\n•\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimates of the timing and amount of future revenues, including revenues related to RaDaR™, and operating margins\nby comparing the estimates to (1) the actual historical results of the Clinical and Pharma reporting units (2) peer companies and third-party market analyses, (3) internal\ncommunications to management and the board of directors, (4) external communications made by management to\n56"

Nature of Business\nNature of the Business\nNeoGenomics, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Parent,” “Company,” or “NeoGenomics”), and its subsidiaries, operate as a certified, high complexity clinical laboratory in\naccordance with the federal government’s Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act, as amended, and is dedicated to the delivery of clinical diagnostic services to pathologists,\noncologists, urologists, hospitals, and other laboratories as well as providing clinical trial services to pharmaceutical firms.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Update\nThe impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, including recent COVID-19 variants, and the related disruptions had a significant adverse impact on the Company’s results of\noperations, volume growth rates and test volumes in 2020, 2021 and 2022. The full extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact the Company’s business, results of\noperations, financial condition, and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that\nmay emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national, and international markets. As the\nCOVID-19 pandemic continues, the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows may continue to be materially adversely affected, particularly if the\npandemic continues to persist for a significant amount of time.\nThe Company anticipates that the cash on hand, marketable securities, and expected cash collections are sufficient to fund near-term capital and operating needs for at least the\nnext 12 months.\nAt the end of the first quarter 2021, due to the broad roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine and a sharp decline in COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) testing demand,\nthe Company made the decision to exit COVID-19 PCR testing and the Company recorded a $6.1 million loss related to the exit from COVID-19 PCR testing. This amount\nconsisted of write-offs of $5.3 million for all remaining COVID-19 PCR testing inventory recorded to cost of revenue and $0.8 million for all remaining COVID-19 PCR testing\nlaboratory equipment recorded to general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. There were no such\namounts recorded for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020.\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\nThe Federal government passed legislation and the President of the United States signed into law on March 27, 2020, known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic\nSecurity Act (the “CARES Act”). On April 10, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services announced that Medicare-enrolled providers would receive a portion of\na direct deposit disbursement totaling $50 billion. The $50 billion is part of a $100 billion Public Health and Social Service Emergency Fund created by the CARES Act.\nPayments made under the CARES Act are intended to reimburse healthcare providers for health care related expenses or lost revenues attributable to COVID-19 and are not\nrequired to be repaid provided that recipients attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including limitations on balance billing for COVID-19 patients. In the\nabsence of specific guidance to account for government grants in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the\nCompany accounts for such grants in accordance with international accounting standards for government grants. Such amounts are recognized when there is reasonable\nassurance that the Company will (1) comply with the conditions associated with the grant and (2) receive the grant.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $7.9 million in grant income related to the CARES Act. There were no such amounts recorded for each of\nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. CARES Act grant income is classified in other expense (income), net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe CARES Act also permits the deferral of payment of the employer portion of social security taxes between March 27, 2020 and December 31, 2020. 50% of the deferred\namount was due on December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% was due on December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there were no accrued deferred social security taxes\nrelated to the CARES Act recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, the total accrued deferred social security taxes, related to the CARES Act\nwas $3.0 million. This amount was recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAdditionally, the CARES Act included an Employee Retention Tax Credit (“ERTC”) provision designed to encourage employers to retain employees on their payroll. The\nERTC is a refundable tax credit against certain payroll taxes paid by employers for eligible wages paid between March 13, 2020 and September 30, 2021 that meet the\nrequirements of the ERTC\n64"

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $1.9 million in credits under the ERTC which was included in loss from operations on the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. The Company recorded $4.4 million and $1.9 million in expense in loss from operations related to non-reoccurring reversals and\nreserves against tax credits previously recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no such amounts recorded for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Parent and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and balances have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Company prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP. These principles require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, together with amounts disclosed in the related notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nActual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates, judgments and assumptions. Significant estimates, judgments and assumptions used in these\nConsolidated Financial Statements include, but are not limited, to those related to revenues, accounts receivable and related allowances, contingencies, useful lives and\nrecovery of long-term assets and intangible assets, income taxes and valuation allowances, stock-based compensation, business combinations, impairment analysis of goodwill,\nand restructuring reserves. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected on the\nConsolidated Financial Statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Company determines whether investments in affiliates are a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) at the start of each new venture and when a reconsideration event has occurred.\nA reporting entity must consolidate a VIE if that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) and is determined to be the primary beneficiary.\nThe primary beneficiary has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb\nlosses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nThe Company accounts for its equity investments that are under 20% of the total equity outstanding and for which the Company does not have significant influence by applying\nthe cost method. Investments that are under 20% of the total equity outstanding and for which the Company has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method\nunless a scope exception is applicable. Investments in which the Company holds a non-controlling interest and are between 20-50% equity are accounted for using the equity\nmethod. For any equity investments in which the Company holds over 50% of the outstanding stock, or for investments in which the Company controls the investee, the\nCompany consolidates those entities into the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company reports its activities in two reportable segments; (1) the Clinical Services segment and (2) the Pharma Services segment. These reportable segments deliver testing\nservices to hospitals, reference labs, pathologists, oncologists, clinicians, pharmaceutical firms, and researchers and represent 100% of the Company’s consolidated assets, net\nrevenue, and net (loss) income in each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Please refer to Note 20. Segment Information, for further financial information\nabout these segments.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions of entities over which control is obtained that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business\ncombinations. The tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair values as of\nthe business combination date, including identifiable intangible assets which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The Company bases\nthe estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination on independent third-party valuations that use information and assumptions provided\nby management, which consider estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Any excess purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to the\nnet tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded to goodwill. The use of alternative\n65"

Transaction\ncosts associated with acquisitions are expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Results of operations and cash\nflows of acquired companies are included in the Company’s operating results from the date of acquisition.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash, certain cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and Pharma contract\nliabilities are considered reasonable estimates of their respective fair values due to their short-term nature.\nThe Company measures its marketable securities at fair value on a recurring basis. Please refer to Note 4. Fair Value Measurements, for further discussion.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of ninety days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and\ncash equivalents with financial institutions that the Company believes to be of high credit standing. The Company believes that, as of December 31, 2022, its concentration of\ncredit risk related to cash and cash equivalents was not significant.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company classifies all marketable securities as available-for-sale, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, and therefore these securities are classified within\ncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they are available to support current operational liquidity needs.\nMarketable securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of income taxes, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income until\nrealized. The Company evaluates its marketable securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a\ndecline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company reviews several factors to determine whether a loss is other-than-temporary, such as the length and\nextent of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether there is the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell\nbefore the securities’ anticipated recovery. There were no other-than-temporary impairments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Regardless of the intent to\nsell a security, the Company performs additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security. Credit\nlosses are recorded when the Company does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security.\nFor the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, cost and fair value are determined on a specific identification basis.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are reported for all Clinical Services payers based on the amount expected to be collected, which considers implicit price concessions. Implicit price\nconcessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive based on negotiated discounts, historical collection\nexperience, and other anticipated adjustments, including anticipated payer denials.\nFor Pharma Services the Company negotiates billing schedules and payment terms on a contract-by-contract basis which can include payments based on certain milestones\nbeing achieved.\nInventories\nInventories consist principally of testing supplies and are valued at lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. The Company periodically reviews\nits inventories for excess or obsolescence and writes-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventories to their estimated net realizable value.\nPrepaid Assets\n66"

      "page_index": 66,
      "text": "Table of Contents\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nThe Company records a prepaid expense for costs paid but not yet incurred. Those expected to be incurred within one year are recorded as prepaid assets within total current\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any costs expected to be incurred outside of one year are recorded as other assets within total non-current assets on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.\nAssets Held for Sale\nAssets to be disposed of by sale are reclassified as held for sale if their carrying amounts are expected to be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing\nuse and when the Company commits to a plan to sell the assets. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less selling costs.\nSuch assets are classified within current assets if there is reasonable certainty that the sale and collection of consideration will take place within one year. Upon reclassification\nas held for sale, long-lived assets are no longer depreciated or amortized and a measurement for impairment is performed to determine if there is an excess of carrying value\nover fair value less costs to sell. Any remeasurement is reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the assets. Subsequent changes to estimated fair value less the selling\ncosts will impact the measurement of assets held for sale if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value of the assets.\nOther Current Assets\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, other current assets consisted primarily of receivables related to research and development (“R&D”) tax credits, pharma contract assets and\nother non-trade receivables.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line basis over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the related lease terms or their estimated useful lives. Costs incurred in\nconnection with the development of internal-use software are capitalized in accordance with the accounting standard for internal-use software, and are amortized over the\nexpected useful life of the software.\nThe Company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Changes to the estimated useful lives are recorded prospectively from the date of the\nchange. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed of, and the related accumulated depreciation, are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is\nincluded in loss from operations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and are included in cost of revenue, general and administrative expenses or R&D\nexpenses, as appropriate in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nLeases\nThe Company leases corporate offices and laboratory spaces throughout the world, all of which are classified as operating leases expiring at various dates and generally having\nterms ranging from 1 to 20 years. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.\nSome of the Company’s real estate lease agreements include options to either renew or early terminate the lease. Leases with renewal options allow the Company to extend the\nlease term typically between 1 and 5 years. When it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise an option to renew or terminate a lease, these options are considered in\ndetermining the classification and measurement of the lease at lease commencement.\nLease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term and assessed as of the commencement date. Incentives received from\nlandlords, such as reimbursements for tenant improvements and rent abatement periods, effectively reduce the total lease payments owed for leases.\nCertain real estate leases also include executory costs such as common area maintenance (non-lease component), as well as property insurance and property taxes (non-\ncomponents). Lease payments, which may include lease components, non-lease components and non-components, are included in the measurement of the Company’s lease\nliabilities to the extent that such payments are either fixed amounts or variable amounts based on a rate or index (fixed in substance), as stipulated in the lease contract. Any\nactual costs in excess of such amounts are expensed as incurred as variable lease cost.\nThe Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate by lease term in order to calculate the present value of its future lease payments when the implicit rates in the leases\nagreements are not readily determinable. The discount rate represents a risk-adjusted rate on a secured basis and is the rate at which the Company would borrow funds to satisfy\nthe scheduled lease liability payment streams commensurate with the lease term.\nOperating lease costs represent fixed lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease costs include an immaterial amount of variable lease\ncosts and are recorded in cost of revenue, general and administrative,\n67"

Each intangible asset with a determinable\nuseful life is amortized over its estimated useful life using the straight-line method. The Company periodically reviews the estimated pattern in which the economic benefits will\nbe consumed and adjusts the amortization period and pattern to match the estimate. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are recorded initially at fair value or cost and are\ntested annually for impairment or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment exist. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, no\nimpairment losses related to intangible assets with indefinite useful lives were recorded.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company’s intangible assets were comprised of customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, marketing assets, and developed\ntechnology.\nRecoverability and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets (including definite-lived intangible assets) if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets may be\nimpaired. Evaluation of possible impairment is based on the Company’s ability to recover the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows (undiscounted and without\ninterest charges) of the related operations. If the expected undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for\nthe difference between the estimated fair value to the carrying amount of the asset. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no impairment losses were recognized\nrelated to long-lived assets. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $0.7 million of impairment charges to facility-related assets within restructuring\ncharges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For further details on the Company’s restructuring activities, please refer to Note 14. Restructuring.\nGoodwill\nThe Company evaluates goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators could\ninclude, but are not limited to, (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a\nregulator. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,\nincluding goodwill. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management performs a\nquantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative analysis is performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value is\ngreater than the estimate of fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount in which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company\nestimates the fair values of its reporting units using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable\ncompanies’ data. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s evaluation of goodwill resulted in no impairment losses.\nAt June 30, 2022, the Company performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units were less than their\ncarrying values. Such qualitative factors included macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance and other relevant\nevents. As a result of the qualitative assessment, the Company determined that there were indicators that it was more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units\nwere less than their carrying values. Accordingly, the Company performed a quantitative analysis and determined the reporting units’ fair values exceeded the reporting units’\ncarrying values and there was no impairment of the recorded goodwill as of June 30, 2022.\nContingencies\nThe Company accrues contingent losses when estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involve uncertain outcomes. Contingent losses are recorded\nbased on management judgment along with internal and external advice from legal counsel and/or technical consultants. Estimated losses from contingencies are recorded when\nboth of the following conditions are met: (i) information available before the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued) indicates that it is probable that an asset\nhas been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If some amount within a range\nof loss appears at the time to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount shall be accrued. When no amount within the range is a better estimate\nthan any other amount, however, the minimum amount in the range shall be accrued. Please refer to Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies, for further discussion.\n68"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nNEOGENOMICS, INC.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs related to convertible senior notes are recorded as deductions that net against the principal value of the debt and are amortized as interest expense over the\nlife of the debt using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs related to term loans are recorded as direct deductions from the carrying amount of the term loan and are\namortized to interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs relating to line of credit arrangements are recorded as assets and\namortized over the term of the credit arrangement regardless of whether any outstanding borrowing existed. Please refer to Note 9. Debt, for further information on debt\nissuance costs.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company measures compensation expense for stock-based awards to employees, non-employee contracted physicians, and directors based upon the awards’ initial grant-\ndate fair values.\nPrior to 2021 the Company estimated the fair value of stock options using a trinomial lattice model. On January 1, 2021, the Company began applying the Black-Scholes option\nvaluation model (“Black-Scholes”) on a prospective basis to new awards. The Company expects the use of Black-Scholes to provide a more ubiquitous estimate of fair value.\nLike the prior trinomial lattice model, Black-Scholes is affected by the stock price on the date of the grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and\nsubjective variables. These variables include the expected term of the option, expected risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of common stock, and expected dividend\nyield; each of which is described below. The assumptions for expected term and expected volatility are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value.\nExpected Term: The expected term of an option is determined using the simplified method under SAB 107 which represents the average between the vesting term and the\ncontractual term. The Company utilizes the simplified method to determine the expected life of the options due to insufficient exercise activity during recent years.\nRisk-free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes model is based on the implied yield at the grant date of the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with an\nequivalent term to the stock-based award being valued. Where the expected term of a stock-based award does not correspond with the term for which a zero coupon interest rate\nis quoted, the Company uses the nearest interest rate from available maturities.\nExpected Stock Price Volatility: The Company uses its own historical weekly volatility because that is more reflective of market conditions.\nDividend Yield: Because the Company has never paid a dividend and does not expect to begin doing so in the foreseeable future, the Company assumed no dividend yield in\nvaluing the stock-based awards.\nRevenue Recognition\nClinical Services\nThe Company’s specialized diagnostic services are performed based on a written test requisition form or electronic equivalent. The performance obligation is satisfied and\nrevenues are recognized at the point in time the diagnostic services have been performed and the results have been delivered to the ordering physician. These diagnostic services\nare billed to various payers, including client direct billing, commercial insurance, Medicare and other government payers, and patients. Revenue is recorded for all payers based\non the amount expected to be collected, which considers implicit price concessions. Implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated\nconsideration the Company expects to receive based on negotiated discounts, historical collection experience, and other anticipated adjustments, including anticipated payer\ndenials. Collection of consideration the Company expects to receive typically occurs within 90 to 120 days of billing for commercial insurance, Medicare and other\ngovernmental and self-pay patients and within 60 to 90 days of billing for client payers.\nPharma Services\nThe Company’s Pharma Services segment generally enters into contracts with pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as other contract research organizations (“CROs”)\nto provide research and clinical trial services. Such services also include validation studies and assay development. The Company records revenue on a unit-of-service basis\nbased on the number of units completed towards the satisfaction of a performance obligation. Certain contracts include upfront fees or billing milestones that are recognized\nover time, which aligns with the progress of the Company towards fulfilling its obligations under the contract.\n69"

Informatics revenue is recognized at a point in time upon delivery of retrospective data or over time for\nprospective data feeds. The Company negotiates billing schedules and payment terms on a contract-by-contract basis, and contract terms generally provide for payments based\non a unit-of-service arrangement.\nAmounts collected in advance of services provided are deferred as contract liabilities. The associated revenue is recognized and the contract liability is reduced as the contracted\nservices are subsequently performed. Contract assets are established for revenue that has been recognized but not yet billed. These contract assets are reduced once the customer\nis invoiced and a corresponding account receivable is recorded. Additionally, Pharma Services incurs sales commissions in the process of obtaining contracts with customers.\nSales commissions that are payable upon contract award are recognized as assets and amortized over the expected life of the customer relationship. For offerings with primarily\nshort-term contracts, such as Informatics, the Company applies the practical expedient which allows costs to obtain a contract to be expensed when incurred, if the amortization\nperiod of the assets that would otherwise have been recognized is one year or less. Contract assets and capitalized commissions are included in other current assets and other\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMost contracts are terminable by the customer, either immediately or according to advance notice terms specified within the contracts. All contracts require payment of fees to\nthe Company for services rendered through the date of termination and may require payment for subsequent services necessary to conclude the study or close out the contract.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes payroll and payroll related costs for performing tests, project management, depreciation of laboratory equipment and laboratory leasehold\nimprovements, rent for laboratory facilities, laboratory reagents, probes and supplies, delivery and courier costs relating to the transportation of specimens to be tested, and\namortization for acquired Inivata developed technology intangible assets. The expenses related to shipping specimens to the facilities for testing, includes costs incurred for\ncontract couriers, commercial airline flights, and courier charges. The Company also incurs expenses returning samples and slides to its customers. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded shipping expenses of approximately $19.6 million, $16.5 million, and $13.8 million, respectively as cost of revenue\nin the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of payroll and payroll related costs for the Company’s billing, finance, human resources, information technology, and other\nadministrative personnel as well as stock-based compensation. The Company also includes professional services, facilities expense, IT infrastructure costs, depreciation,\namortization, and other administrative-related costs in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D costs are expensed as incurred. R&D expenses consist of payroll and payroll related costs, laboratory supplies, depreciation of laboratory equipment, and costs for samples\nto complete validation studies. These expenses are primarily incurred to develop new genetic tests.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses are primarily attributable to employee-related costs including sales management, sales representatives, sales and marketing consultants, and\nmarketing and customer service personnel in the Clinical Services segment. Advertising costs are expensed at the time they are incurred and are deemed immaterial for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nRestructuring charges\nRestructuring charges relate to a restructuring program to improve execution and drive efficiency across the organization. Restructuring charges consist of severance and other\nemployee costs, costs for optimizing the Company’s geographic presence, and consulting and other costs.

Also, the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Temporary differences between\nfinancial and tax reporting arise primarily from the use of different depreciation methods and lives for property and equipment, recognition of bad debts, compensation related\nexpenses, and various other expenses that have been allowed for or accrued for financial statement purposes but are not currently deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe provision for income taxes, including the effective tax rate and analysis of potential tax exposure items, if any, requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and\nstate income tax laws, regulations, and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any estimated valuation allowances deemed necessary to\nrecognize deferred tax assets at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company evaluates tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in\nits tax returns and records a liability for uncertain tax positions, if deemed necessary. The Company follows a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax\npositions. First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination,\nincluding resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%\nlikelihood of being realized upon settlement.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31,\n2022 and 2021, the Company has an uncertain tax position related to Federal and State R&D tax credits. The Company does not expect a significant change in its uncertain tax\npositions in the next 12 months.\nNet (Loss) Income per Common Share\nThe Company calculates basic net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted-average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net (loss) income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\napplicable period, plus the dilutive effect of potential common stock. Potential common stock consists of shares issuable pursuant to stock options and convertible notes, as well\nas non-vested restricted stock awards which are not considered outstanding with respect to the weighted average common shares outstanding in the calculation of basic net\n(loss) income per share. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the Company’s outstanding stock options and restricted stock\nawards. Potentially dilutive shares issuable upon conversion of the 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 and the 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 are calculated\nusing the if-converted method.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance (“ASU 2021-10”).\nThis update requires business entities to disclose information about certain government assistance they receive. Such disclosure requirements include the nature of the\ntransactions and the related accounting policy used, the line items on the balance sheet and income statement that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial\nstatement line item and significant terms and conditions of the transactions. ASU 2021-10 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early\nadoption permitted. ASU 2021-10 should be applied either (1) prospectively to all transactions within the scope of the amendments that are reflected in financial statements at\nthe date of initial application and new transactions that are entered into after the date of initial application or (2) retrospectively to those transactions. The Company adopted this\npronouncement on January 1, 2022, and there was no impact from this standard on its annual disclosures.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with\nCustomers (“ASU 2021-08”). This update amends guidance to require that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a\nbusiness combination in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). At the acquisition date, an acquirer should account for the related revenue\ncontracts in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contracts. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim\nperiods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted including adoption in an interim period. If the Company early adopts in an interim period, the\nCompany is required to apply the amendments (1) retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year\nthat includes the interim period of early application and (2) prospectively to all business combinations that occur on or after the date of initial application. The amendments in\nASU 2021-08 should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The Company adopted this standard as of\nJanuary 1, 2023 and there was no impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n71"

Acquisitions\nTrapelo Health\nOn April 7, 2021 (the “Trapelo Acquisition Date”), the Company completed the acquisition of a 100% ownership interest in Intervention Insights, Inc. d/b/a Trapelo Health\n(“Trapelo”), an information technology company focused on precision oncology. The purchase price consisted of (i) cash consideration of $35.6 million, which included a net\nadjustment of $0.6 million for estimated cash on hand of Trapelo and estimated working capital adjustments on the Trapelo Acquisition Date, and (ii) equity consideration of\n$29.2 million, consisting of 597,712 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, valued at $48.81 per share. The Company acquired control of Trapelo\non the Trapelo Acquisition Date; therefore, the fair value of the common stock issued as part of consideration was determined on the basis of the closing market price of the\nCompany’s common stock immediately prior to the Trapelo Acquisition Date. The Trapelo acquisition enhances the Company’s ability to provide customers clinical decision\nsupport to help answer complex questions related to precision oncology biomarker testing and treatment options as part of the Company’s comprehensive oncology offerings.\nThe acquisition of Trapelo was determined to be a business combination and has been accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase price and purchase price\nallocation were based upon management’s best estimates and assumptions and were considered final as of March 31, 2022. The following table summarizes the purchase\nconsideration recorded for the acquisition of Trapelo, the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the calculation of goodwill based on the excess of the\nconsideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Trapelo Acquisition Date (in thousands, except per share data):\nAmount\nPurchase consideration:\nShares of common stock issued as consideration\n597,712 \nPer share value of common stock issued as consideration\n$\n48.81 \nFair value of common stock at Trapelo Acquisition Date\n$\n29,174 \nPlus: Cash paid at closing\n35,591 \nTotal purchase consideration\n$\n64,765 \nAllocation of the purchase consideration:\nCash\n$\n713 \nOther current assets\n282 \nIdentifiable intangible asset - marketing assets\n549 \nIdentifiable intangible asset - developed technology\n19,040 \nOther long-term assets\n268 \nTotal identifiable assets acquired\n20,852 \nCurrent liabilities\n(751)\nNet identifiable assets acquired\n20,101 \nGoodwill\n44,664 \nTotal purchase consideration\n$\n64,765 \nThe identified developed technology and marketing intangible assets are being amortized over ten years and four years, respectively, based on their estimated useful lives. The\nweighted-average amortization period in total for all classes of intangible assets from the Trapelo acquisition is 9.8 years. The developed technology was valued using the\nincome approach, specifically, the multi-period excess earnings method, which measures the after-tax cash flows attributable to the developed technology. The marketing\nintangible assets were valued using the income approach, specifically, the relief from royalty method, which measures the cash flow streams attributable to the marketing\nintangible assets in the form of the avoided royalty payment that would be paid to the owner in return for the rights to use the marketing intangible assets had the intangible\nassets not been acquired. The values of the identifiable intangible assets represent Level 3 measurements as they were based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s\nassumptions used in pricing the assets at fair value.

No pro\nforma information has been included relating to the Trapelo acquisition, as this acquisition was not deemed to be material to the Company’s revenue or net loss on a pro forma\nbasis.\nInivata Limited\nOn June 18, 2021 (the “Inivata Acquisition Date”), the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining equity interests in Inivata Limited, a private limited company\nincorporated in England and Wales (“Inivata”). Inivata is a global, commercial stage, liquid biopsy platform company. The acquisition follows a $25.0 million minority equity\ninvestment by the Company in Series C1 Preference Shares (the “Preference Shares” or “previously-held equity interest”) in Inivata in May 2020, at which time the Company\nalso acquired a fixed price option to purchase the remainder of equity interests in Inivata for $390.0 million (the “Purchase Option”). The Company and Inivata also entered into\na line of credit agreement in the amount of $15.0 million (the “Line of Credit”) in May 2020. For further details regarding the previously-held equity investment in Inivata, the\nPurchase Option and the Line of Credit, please refer to Note 8. Investment in Non-Consolidated Affiliate. The Inivata acquisition adds liquid biopsy platform technology,\nincluding minimal residual disease testing capabilities, to the Company’s comprehensive portfolio of oncology testing solutions.\nThe purchase price consisted of cash consideration of $398.6 million, which included a net adjustment of $8.6 million for estimated cash on hand of Inivata and other\nadjustments on the Inivata Acquisition Date, and was funded through cash on hand and a private placement of equity. For further information regarding the private placement of\nequity, please refer to Note 11. Equity Transactions.\nPrior to the acquisition of the remaining equity interests in Inivata, the Company accounted for its previously-held equity interest and the Purchase Option in Inivata as equity\nsecurities without a readily determinable fair value. The equity interests were recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price\nchanges in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Therefore, the Company’s acquisition of control of Inivata on the Inivata Acquisition\nDate was accounted for as a business combination achieved in stages under the acquisition method. Accordingly, the Company used a discounted cash flow to derive a business\nenterprise value of Inivata in order to determine the acquisition-date fair value of the Company’s previously-held equity interest and Purchase Option in Inivata. To determine\nthe fair value of the previously-held equity interest, the fair value of Inivata’s total equity was allocated to its various classes of equity based on the respective rights and\nprivileges of each class of stock in liquidation. The business enterprise value and a Black-Scholes model were then used to determine the fair value of the remaining equity\nacquired through the exercise of the Purchase Option. The Purchase Option was recorded at the fair value at the Inivata Acquisition Date based on its settlement value. This\nresulted in fair values of $64.9 million in Preference Shares and a $74.3 million Purchase Option, immediately prior to the acquisition. On the Inivata Acquisition Date, the\n$10.3 million outstanding under the Line of Credit extended by the Company to Inivata was effectively settled as part of the acquisition of Inivata at the $15.0 million principal\namount and was recorded as part of the consideration transferred in the acquisition. The Company recorded a gain on investment in and loan receivable from non-consolidated\naffiliate, net, within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations of $109.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the excess of the acquisition-date fair\nvalue of the Company’s previously-held equity interest, Purchase Option, and Line of Credit over their carrying values. For further details regarding the previously-held equity\ninvestment and purchase option in Inivata, please refer to Note 8. Investment in Non-Consolidated Affiliate.\nThe purchase price and purchase price allocation were based upon management’s best estimates and assumptions and were considered final as of June 30, 2022. The following\ntable summarizes the calculation of goodwill based on the excess of the estimated fair value of the consideration transferred including the fair value of the Line of Credit, and the\nestimated fair value of the previously-held equity interest and Purchase Option, over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Inivata\nAcquisition Date and includes measurement period adjustments recorded during 2021 (in thousands):\n73"

Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the\nasset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A fair value hierarchy has been established based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered\nobservable and the last unobservable.\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets\ninvolving identical assets.\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These are typically obtained from\nreadily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs, where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions of the data that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain financial assets at fair value on a recurring basis, including its marketable securities and certain cash equivalents. The Company considers all\nsecurities available-for-sale, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, and therefore these securities are classified within current assets on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets as they are available to support current operational liquidity needs. The money market accounts are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. The\nmarketable securities are generally valued based on other observable inputs for those securities (including market corroborated pricing or other models that utilize observable\ninputs such as interest rates and yield curves) based on information provided by independent third-party pricing entities, except for U.S. Treasury securities which are valued\nbased on quoted market prices in active markets.\n75"

The Investment Agreement also granted the Company one seat on Inivata’s Board of Directors.\nOn June 18, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining equity interests in Inivata. For further details regarding the acquisition of Inivata, please refer to\nNote 3. Acquisitions.\nPrior to the Inivata Acquisition Date, Inivata was determined to be a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and the Company’s investment was under 20.0% of the total equity\noutstanding. The Company considered qualitative factors in assessing the primary beneficiary of the VIE which included understanding the purpose and design of the VIE,\nassociated risks that the VIE created, activities that could be directed by the Company, and the expected relative impact of those activities on the economic performance of the\nVIE. Based on an evaluation of these factors, the Company concluded that it was not the primary beneficiary of Inivata prior to the Inivata Acquisition Date.\nPrior to the Inivata Acquisition Date, the power to control the activities that most significantly impacted Inivata’s economic performance was the sole responsibility of Inivata’s\nmanagement and Board of Directors; however, the Company did have significant influence over Inivata. As the Preference Shares were determined to not be in-substance\ncommon stock, and because the Preference Shares and the Purchase Option did not have readily determinable fair values, prior to the Inivata Acquisition Date, the Company\nelected to measure the Preference Shares and the Purchase Option at cost, minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly\ntransactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nOn May 22, 2020, the initial $25.0 million cost and $0.6 million of associated transaction costs was allocated between the Preference Shares and the Purchase Option based on\nthe relative fair value of each and was recorded as investment in non-consolidated affiliate on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The initial relative fair value of the investment in\nnon-consolidated affiliate was comprised of $19.6 million in Preference Shares and a $6.0 million Purchase Option. The Preference Shares were valued by determining the\nequity value of Inivata using the Backsolve Method and allocating the value of the Preference Shares using the Option-Pricing Method and the inputs used included the equity\nvalue based on the Series C1 capital raised by Inivata, a volatility rate of 84.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 0.17% and 0.0% dividend yield. The Purchase Option was valued\nusing the Black-Scholes model with a volatility rate of 84.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 0.17% and 0.0% dividend yield.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, an observable transaction of an identical investment in Inivata Preference Shares occurred. This resulted in a remeasurement of the\nPreference Shares to the value of this observable transaction. The Purchase Option was also remeasured at fair value as a result of this observable transaction. As a result of\nthese remeasurements, at December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the investment in non-consolidated affiliate is $29.6 million, comprised of $25.0 million in Preference\nShares and a $4.6 million Purchase Option. The Company recorded a net unrealized gain of $4.0 million for these remeasurements for the year ended December 31, 2020 in\ngain on investment in and loan receivable from non-consolidated affiliate, net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2020, the Purchase Option was\nvalued using the Black-Scholes model with a volatility rate of 84.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 0.17% and 0.0% dividend yield.\nOn May 22, 2020, the Company and Inivata also entered into the Line of Credit in the amount of $15.0 million. In January 2021, the Line of Credit, in its entirety, was drawn by\nInivata and recorded as a loan receivable from non-consolidated affiliate on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to the Inivata Acquisition Date, the Line of Credit\ncontractually matured on December 1, 2025 and the unpaid principal balance was payable on January 1, 2026 and bore interest at 0.0% per annum. In January 2021, upon the\ndraw of the Line of Credit by Inivata, the Company used an imputed interest rate of 8.33% to present value the Line of Credit. The Company recorded an imputed interest rate\ndiscount of $5.0 million on the loan receivable from non-consolidated affiliate and an additional investment in non-consolidated affiliate of $5.0 million, resulting in a\n$10.0 million present value of the loan receivable from non-consolidated affiliate and increasing the value of the Preference Shares to $30.0 million. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 through the Inivata Acquisition Date $0.4 million of interest income was amortized to the loan receivable from non-consolidated affiliate. The interest\nincome amortization is recorded in interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, subsequent to Inivata’s draw on the Line of Credit, an observable transaction of an identical investment in Inivata Preference Shares occurred. This\nresulted in a remeasurement of the Preference Shares to the value of this observable transaction. The Company recorded a net unrealized loss of $5.0 million for this\nremeasurement for the three months ended March 31, 2021. As of March 31, 2021, the carrying value of the investment in non-consolidated affiliate was $29.6 million,\ncomprised of $25.0 million in Preference Shares and a $4.6 million Purchase Option.\n82"

The Company’s carrying\nvalue of the investment in non-consolidated affiliate was $29.6 million, comprised of $25.0 million in Preference Shares and a $4.6 million Purchase Option immediately prior\nto obtaining the remaining ownership of Inivata. The Company’s acquisition of control of Inivata on the Inivata Acquisition Date was accounted for as a business combination\nachieved in stages under the acquisition method. Accordingly, the Company remeasured its Preference Shares and Purchase Option to their acquisition-date fair values. The\nCompany used a discounted cash flow to derive a business enterprise value of Inivata in order to determine the acquisition-date fair value of the Company’s Preference Shares\nand the Purchase Option. To determine the fair value of the Preference Shares, the fair value of equity was allocated to the various classes based on the respective rights and\nprivileges of each class of stock in liquidation. The business enterprise value and a Black-Scholes model was then used to determine the fair value of the remaining equity\nacquired through the exercise of the Purchase Option. The Purchase Option was recorded at fair value at the Inivata Acquisition Date based on its settlement value. This resulted\nin fair values of $64.9 million in Preference Shares and a $74.3 million Purchase Option, immediately prior to the acquisition, resulting in a net gain of $104.6 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, which includes the net loss of $5.0 million for the remeasurement in the first quarter of 2021. In addition, on the Inivata Acquisition Date, the\n$10.3 million outstanding under the Line of Credit extended by the Company to Inivata was effectively settled as part of the acquisition of Inivata at the $15.0 million principal\namount and was recorded as part of the consideration transferred in the acquisition resulting in a gain of $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company\nrecorded a total gain on investment in and loan receivable from non-consolidated affiliate, net, within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations of $109.3 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 for the excess of the acquisition-date fair value of the Company’s Preference Shares, Purchase Option, and Line of Credit over their\ncarrying values.

The\ninitial conversion rate for the 2028 Convertible Notes is 15.1172 shares of common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes, equivalent to an initial\nconversion price of approximately $66.15 per share of common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment as described in the Indenture. In addition, following certain\ncorporate events that occur prior to the maturity date as described in the Indenture, the Company will pay a make-whole premium by increasing the conversion rate for a holder\nwho elects to convert its 2028 Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances.

The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2028 Convertible Notes, at\nits option, on or after January 20, 2025 if the last reported sale price of its common stock has been at least 130.0% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading\ndays (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day\nimmediately preceding the date of notice by the Company of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes to be\nredeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The 2028 Convertible Notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other\nliabilities, including trade payables, of its subsidiaries.\nThe interest expense recognized on the 2028 Convertible Notes includes $0.9 million, $1.5 million and $34,000 for the contractual coupon interest, the amortization of the debt\ndiscount and the amortization of the debt issuance costs, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The interest expense recognized on the 2028 Convertible Notes\nincludes $0.8 million, $1.4 million and $32,000 for the contractual coupon interest, the amortization of the debt discount and the amortization of the debt issuance costs,\nrespectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The effective interest rate on the 2028 Convertible Notes is 0.70%, which includes the interest on the 2028 Convertible\nNotes and amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs. The 2028 Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on\nJanuary 15 and July 15 of each year, which began on July 15, 2021.\nCapped Call Transactions\nIn connection with the 2028 Convertible Notes offering, on January 11, 2021, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions\n(collectively, the “Capped Call Transactions”) with option counterparties pursuant to capped call confirmations at a cost of approximately $29.3 million. As the Capped Call\nTransactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Capped Call Transactions were classified as equity, are not accounted for as derivatives and were recorded as a reduction of\nthe Company’s additional paid-in capital in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The Capped Call Transactions are not part of the terms of the 2028\nConvertible Notes and will not affect any holders’ rights under the 2028 Convertible Notes. The Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments,\nthe number of shares of the Company’s common stock that initially underlie the 2028 Convertible Notes. The number of shares underlying the Capped Call Transactions\nis 5.2 million.\nThe cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is initially $85.75 per share of the Company’s common stock, which represents a premium of 75.0% over the public offering\nprice of the common stock in the 2021 Common Stock Offering, which was $49.00 per share, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call\nTransactions.\nBy entering into the Capped Call Transactions, the Company expects to reduce the potential dilution to its common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2028 Convertible\nNotes is settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that, at the time of conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes, its common stock price exceeds the\nconversion price of the 2028 Convertible Notes.\n2025 Convertible Senior Notes\nOn May 4, 2020, the Company completed the sale of $201.3 million of convertible senior notes with a stated interest rate of 1.25% and a maturity date of May 1, 2025 (the\n“2025 Convertible Notes”), unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued at a discounted price of 97.0% of their principal\namount. The total net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes and exercise of the over-allotment option were approximately $194.5 million, which includes\napproximately $6.9 million of discounts, commissions and offering expenses paid by the Company. On May 4, 2020, the Company entered into an indenture (the “Indenture”),\nwith U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), governing the 2025 Convertible Notes.\nPrior to February 1, 2025, noteholders may convert their 2025 Convertible Notes at their option, only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter\ncommencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20\ntrading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar\nquarter is greater than or equal to 130.0% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day\nperiod in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98.0% of the product of\nthe last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls any or all of the notes for redemption, at\nany time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or\nafter February 1, 2025 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, noteholders may convert their 2025 Convertible Notes at any\ntime, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.\nThe last reported sales price of the Company’s common stock was not greater than or equal to 130.0% of the conversion price of the 2025 Convertible Notes on at least 20 of the\nlast 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter ended September 30, 2022.

The Company\naccounted for the effects of the stock awards as modifications, and recognized $8.6 million of incremental stock-based compensation upon acceleration, which consisted of\n$2.7 million and $5.9 million for the acceleration of stock option awards and restricted stock awards, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. These amounts are\nincluded in stock compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 and are recorded as general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company sponsors an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), under which eligible employees can purchase common stock at a 15.0% discount from the fair market\nvalue. Stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $0.9\nmillion, respectively. Shares issued pursuant to this plan were 415,450, 112,094 and 138,309 for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNote 13. Revenue Recognition\nThe Company’s two reportable segments for which it recognizes revenue are (1) Clinical Services and (2) Pharma Services. The Clinical Services segment provides various\nclinical testing services to community-based pathology practices, oncology practices, hospital pathology labs, reference labs, and academic centers with reimbursement from\nvarious payers including client direct billing, commercial insurance, Medicare and other government payers, and patients. The Pharma Services segment supports\npharmaceutical firms in their drug development programs by providing testing services and data analytics for clinical trials and research.\nClinical Services Revenue\nThe Company’s specialized diagnostic services are performed based on a written test requisition form or an electronic equivalent. The performance obligation is satisfied and\nrevenues are recognized once the diagnostic services have been performed and the results have been delivered to the ordering physician. These diagnostic services are billed to\nvarious payers, including client direct billing, commercial insurance, Medicare and other government payers, and patients. Revenue is recorded for all payers based on the\namount expected to be collected, which considers implicit price concessions. Implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated\nconsideration the Company expects to receive based on negotiated discounts, historical collection experience, and other anticipated adjustments, including anticipated payer\ndenials.\nPharma Services Revenue\nThe Company’s Pharma Services segment generally enters into contracts with pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as other contract research organizations (“CROs”)\nto provide research and clinical trial services. Such services also include validation studies and assay development. The Company records revenue on a unit-of-service basis\nbased on the number of units completed towards the satisfaction of a performance obligation. Certain contracts include upfront fees or billing milestones that are recognized\nover time, which aligns with the progress of the Company towards fulfilling its obligations under the contract.\nAdditional offerings within the Pharma Services portfolio includes Informatics, which involves the licensing of de-identified data to pharmaceutical and biotech customers in\nthe form of either retrospective records or prospective deliveries of data. Informatics revenue is recognized at a point in time upon delivery of retrospective data or over time for\nprospective data feeds. The Company negotiates billing schedules and payment terms on a contract-by-contract basis, and contract terms generally provide for payments based\non a unit-of-service arrangement.\nAmounts collected in advance of services being provided are deferred as contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The associated revenue is recognized and the\ncontract liability is reduced as the contracted services are subsequently performed. Contract assets are established for revenue recognized but not yet billed. These contract\nassets are reduced once the customer is invoiced and a corresponding receivable is recorded. Additionally, Pharma Services incurs sales commissions in the process of obtaining\ncontracts with customers. Sales commissions that are payable upon contract award are recognized as assets and amortized over the expected life of the customer relationship.\nFor offerings with primarily short-term contracts, such as Informatics, the Company applies the practical expedient which allows costs to obtain a contract to be expensed when\n91"

Contract assets and capitalized commissions are included in\nother current assets and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMost contracts are terminable by the customers, either immediately or according to advance notice terms specified within the contracts. All contracts require payment of fees to\nthe Company for services rendered through the date of termination and may require payment for subsequent services necessary to conclude the study or close out the contract.\nThe following table summarizes the values of contract assets, capitalized commissions, and contract liabilities for Pharma Services as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in\nthousands):\n2022\n2021\nCurrent pharma contract assets\n$\n1,898 $\n1,738 \nLong-term pharma contract assets\n31 \n236 \nTotal pharma contract assets\n$\n1,929 $\n1,974 \nCurrent pharma capitalized commissions\n$\n800 $\n109 \nLong-term pharma capitalized commissions\n715 \n882 \nTotal pharma capitalized commissions\n$\n1,515 $\n991 \nCurrent pharma contract liabilities\n$\n7,557 $\n5,192 \nLong-term pharma contract liabilities\n19 \n917 \nTotal pharma contract liabilities\n$\n7,576 $\n6,109 \n Recorded within other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n Recorded within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n Recorded within other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRevenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, related to Pharma contract liabilities outstanding at the beginning of each year was $5.2 million,\n$4.4 million, and $2.3 million, respectively. Amortization of capitalized commissions for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $0.9 million, $1.1 million\nand $0.8 million respectively.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Company considered various factors for both its Clinical Services and Pharma Services segments in determining appropriate levels of homogeneous data for its\ndisaggregation of revenue; including the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows. Clinical Services categories align with the types of customers due to\nsimilarities of billing method, level of reimbursement, and timing of cash receipts. Unbilled amounts are accrued and allocated to payer categories based on historical\nexperience. In future periods actual billings by payer category may differ from accrued amounts. Pharma Services relate to contracts with large pharmaceutical and biotech\ncustomers as well as other CROs. Because the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are similar and primarily driven by individual contract terms Pharma\nServices revenue is not further disaggregated.\nThe following table details the disaggregation of net revenue for both the Clinical Services and Pharma Services Segments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020 (in thousands):\n2022\n2021\n2020\nClinical Services:\n    Client direct billing\n$\n279,732 \n$\n252,617 \n$\n240,535 \n    Commercial insurance\n73,280 \n78,773 \n76,550 \n    Medicare and other government\n65,585 \n72,010 \n64,776 \n    Self-pay\n157 \n772 \n476 \nTotal Clinical Services\n418,754 \n404,172 \n382,337 \nPharma Services\n90,974 \n80,157 \n62,111 \nTotal net revenue\n$\n509,728 \n$\n484,329 \n$\n444,448 \n(1)\n(2)\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n92"

Federal net operating loss carry\nforwards will begin to expire in 2036.

The weight given to the evidence is\ncommensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be objectively verified. If negative evidence exists, positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a\nvaluation allowance is not needed. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, management determined that sufficient positive evidence did not exist and concluded that it is more\nlikely than not that a valuation allowance is required against deferred tax assets. Accordingly, management established a valuation allowance of $ 59.5 million related to the\nCompany’s domestic operations and a full valuation allowance of $5.7 million as of December 31, 2022 related to the Company’s China, Switzerland and Singapore operations.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, as well as Singapore, Switzerland, China, United Kingdom and in various state jurisdictions. Tax regulations within\neach jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment. For U.S. federal and most state purposes, the Company\nhas open tax years ended December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2022. For Switzerland, the Company has open tax years ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022, for\nSingapore the Company has open tax years ended December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2022 and for United Kingdom the Company has open tax years ended December 31,\n2021 and December 31, 2022. The 2017 U.S. Federal income tax filing is currently under examination by the IRS.\nThe Company applied the accounting standard for uncertain tax positions and recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant\ntax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the\nfinancial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. Increases or\ndecreases to the unrecognized tax benefits could result from management’s belief that a position can or cannot be sustained upon examination based on subsequent information\nor potential lapse of the applicable statute of limitation for certain tax positions.\nThe following are the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\n2022\n2021\nUnrecognized tax benefits - January 1\n$\n2,351 $\n1,670 \nIncreases in prior year positions\n82 \n83 \nIncreases in tax positions taken in current year\n726 \n632 \nStatute expirations\n— \n(34)\nUnrecognized tax benefits - December 31\n$\n3,159 $\n2,351 \nDue to the valuation allowance, the majority of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022, if recognized, would not impact the Company’s effective tax rate.

Interest and tax penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense.\nNote 16. Net (Loss) Income per Share\nThe Company presents both basic earnings per share (“EPS”) and diluted EPS. Basic EPS excludes potential dilution and is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the\nweighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock awards were exercised and if the\n2028 Convertible Notes and 2025 Convertible Notes were converted. The potential dilution from stock awards is accounted for using the treasury stock method based on the\naverage market value of the Company’s common stock. The potential dilution from conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes and 2025 Convertible Notes is accounted for\nusing the if-converted method, which requires that all of the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes and the 2025\nConvertible Notes will be included in the calculation of diluted EPS assuming conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes and the 2025 Convertible Notes at the beginning of the\nreporting period (or at time of issuance, if later).\n95"

At the time of filing the outcome of this matter is not estimable or probable.\nRegulatory Matter\nWith the assistance of outside counsel, the Company voluntarily conducted an internal investigation that focused on the compliance of certain consulting and service agreements\nwith federal healthcare laws and regulations, including those relating to fraud, waste and abuse. Based on this internal investigation, the Company voluntarily notified the Office\nof Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) of the Company’s internal investigation in November 2021. The Company’s interactions\nwith regulatory authorities and the Company’s related review of this matter are ongoing. The Company has a reserve of $11.2 million in other long-term liabilities as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for potential damages and liabilities primarily associated with the federal healthcare program revenue\nreceived by the Company in connection with the agreements at issue that were identified during the course of this internal investigation. This reserve reflects management’s best\nestimate of the minimum probable loss associated with this matter. As a result of the internal investigation and ongoing interactions with regulatory authorities, the Company\nmay accrue additional reserves for any related potential damages and liabilities arising out of this matter. The Company was notified on June 30, 2022 that the Department of\nJustice (“DOJ”) will be participating in the investigation of this matter. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the duration, scope, result or related costs associated with\nany further investigation, including by the OIG, DOJ, or any other governmental authority, or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek. Accordingly, at this time, the\nCompany is unable to estimate a range of possible loss in excess of the amount reserved. Any determination that the Company’s operations or activities are not in compliance\nwith existing laws or regulations, however, could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties, disgorgement, restitution, equitable relief, exclusion from\nparticipation in federal healthcare programs or other losses or conduct restrictions, which could be material to the Company’s financial results or business operations.\nNote 19. Related Party Transactions\nOn May 22, 2020, the Company formed a strategic alliance with Inivata and entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement and Laboratory Services Agreement whereas Inivata,\nprior to the Inivata Acquisition Date, would render and perform certain laboratory testing which the Company made available to customers. In connection with this agreement,\nInivata provided $0.8 million of testing services to the Company recorded in cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31,\n2021 through the Inivata Acquisition Date.\nOn May 22, 2020, the Company and Inivata also entered into a Line of Credit in the amount of $15.0 million. The Company and Inivata settled the Line of Credit after the\nInivata Acquisition Date and no amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. For further details on the Line of Credit, please refer to Note 8. Investment in\nNon-Consolidated Affiliate.\nOn June 18, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of all remaining equity interest in Inivata by exercising its Purchase Option. Beginning June 18, 2021, Inivata is a\nwholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company. As of the Inivata Acquisition Date, Inivata’s financial statement activity has been consolidated within the Company’s\nConsolidated Financial Statements. For further details on the acquisition of Inivata, please refer to Note 3. Acquisitions.\nThe Company has Pharma Services contracts with CytomX Therapeutics, Inc., an entity with whom a director of the Company, Dr. Alison L. Hannah, was an officer at until\nSeptember 2022, and the Company’s former Chief Legal Officer, Halley E. Gilbert, is a director. In connection with these contracts, the Company recognized $ 0.7 million of\nrevenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Company has Pharma Services contracts with HOOKIPA Pharma, Inc., an entity with whom a director of the Company, Michael A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of\nDecember 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were (1) effective, in that they were designed to ensure that material information relating to us, and information\nrequired to be disclosed in our reports to the SEC, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer by others\nwithin those entities, particularly during the period in which this report was being prepared, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions and decisions regarding required\ndisclosure therein; and (2) effective, in that they provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control\nover financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or\nunder the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles and includes those policies and procedures: (1) that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, however, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management\nused the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (“2013\nFramework”). Based on this assessment, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of December 31,\n2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria at the reasonable assurance level.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report, which is included\nin this annual report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we continued to monitor and evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of key controls. There were no changes in our internal control\nover financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control\nover financial reporting.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of NeoGenomics, Inc.\n100"

In our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as\nof and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,\nand performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;\nand (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSan Diego, California\nFebruary 24, 2023\n101"

In the event that the Executive knows or suspects that any activities of the Company or any personnel or\ncontractor of the Company, or any client of the Company implicates any such requirements or guidance, the Executive agrees that he or she\nwill immediately inform the Company and cooperate fully with the Company to investigate and address any compliance issues arising as a\nresult of such known or suspected activities.

The “Reduced Amount” shall be either (A) the largest portion of the\nPayment that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax or (B) the largest portion, up to and including the total\namount, of the Payment, whichever of the amounts determined under (A) and (B), after taking into account all applicable federal, state and\nlocal employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in the Executive’s\nreceipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount of the Payment notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to\nthe Excise Tax. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting “parachute payments” is necessary so that the Payment equals the Reduced\nAmount, reduction shall occur in the following order: reduction of cash payments; reduction of employee benefits; and cancellation of\naccelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards. In the event that acceleration of vesting of outstanding equity awards is to be reduced, such\nacceleration of vesting shall be undertaken in the reverse order of the date of grant of the Executive’s outstanding equity awards.

For purposes of making the calculations and determinations required by this Section 10, the Tax Counsel may rely\non reasonable, good faith assumptions and approximations concerning the application of Section 280G of the Code and Section 4999 of the\n9"
