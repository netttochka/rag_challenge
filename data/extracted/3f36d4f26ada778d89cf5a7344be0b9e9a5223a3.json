Our culture \nremains the soul of our company, and relationships \nare at the center of what we do. During the past year, \nas we prepare for crossing the important $10 billion \nasset mark, we enhanced an already strong executive \nmanagement team with the additions of Derek \nMcGee as Chief Legal Counsel and Wally Wallace \nas Chief Financial Officer. Our entire executive team \nis deeply committed to executing on our strategic \nplan and driving long-term value for our employees, \ncustomers, communities and shareholders.   \nTHE UNICORN – BT HOLDINGS, INC.\nWhen we became a public company in 2018, \none of our key initiatives was to implement an \nopportunistic M&A strategy.  We were extremely \ndiligent and patient, as we sought out a partner \nwho was the right fit culturally, geographically \nand financially.  BTH Bank, the subsidiary of BT \nHoldings, Inc., was that perfect fit—they were the \nunicorn.  \nOrigin and BTH, two companies founded in the \nearly 1900s, only 190 miles from each other.  Both \nfrom rural communities where handshakes and \nhard work still mean something.  Two companies \nwith an unwavering commitment to employees, \ncustomers, communities and shareholders.  \nThe Origin and BTH partnership gives our \ncompany meaningful expansion across the I-20 \ncorridor in East Texas and adds tremendous \ndepth to our teams in Dallas and Fort Worth.  We \nbelieve we have an incredible opportunity to add \nto what BTH has done in the deposit rich, East \nTexas markets, and expand upon their impact in \nNorth Texas.  \nI am extremely proud of the Origin and BTH \nemployees who made the process go so \nsmoothly.  The merger was announced in late \nFebruary, received regulatory approval in June, \nclosed in August, and the system conversion was \ncompleted in early October.  This impressive \ntimeline is a testament to the quality of our \npeople, the strength of our relationships with"

We \nare linked together through the I-20 corridor, \nand more importantly, we are inner-connected \nthrough our culture and humble roots.  \nTHE TEXAS GROWTH STORY CONTINUES\nOrigin’s Texas Growth Story has been impressive, \nand the addition of BTH has created incredible \nopportunity to drive value in a meaningful way.  Our \nTexas franchise represents approximately 70% of loans \nheld for investment and 54% of deposits.  The Dallas-\nFort Worth and Houston markets each delivered more \nthan $1 billion in new loan production in 2022.  This \ngrowth reinforces our strategy of attracting best-in-\nclass bankers across our footprint and their ability \nto drive long-term value for our company.  In 2022, \nwe made several strategic hires, adding twenty-one \nnew producers, primarily in the Texas market who are \ndriving meaningful deposit and loan growth.  Origin \nwill continue to invest and seek opportunity in Texas. \nWe have proven that our investments in people and \ninfrastructure, coupled with the Origin Culture, have \nand will continue to pay dividends for our company.  \nDISCIPLINED CREDIT CULTURE \nWhile I am extremely proud of our production for the \nyear, I am even more proud of where we are from a \ncredit perspective.  At year-end, Past Due Loans were \nat 0.15% of total loans, and we also showed continued \nreduction in the level of Nonperforming Loans, which \nended the year at 0.14%.  Classified loans remained \nstable at 1.05%.  \nOrigin will remain highly committed to a disciplined \napproach to managing credit risk, but it is more than \njust credit metrics.  Our success in 2022 was about the \ncomradery and the trust that our producers and credit \nteams have with each other and puts us in a position \nof strength as we head into an uncertain economic \nenvironment in 2023.  We continue to believe that our \nTexas, Louisiana and Mississippi markets will be less \nimpacted by a potential recession than other areas of \nthe country. Our focus on relationship banking along \nwith sound underwriting and credit structure continue \nto result in our well-diversified and resilient portfolio. \nTHE ORIGIN CULTURE -\nOur commitment to the Origin Culture remains a \ncompetitive advantage throughout our markets. This \nwas reinforced in 2022 with Origin being recognized \nas the second best bank to work for in the country \nby American Banker Magazine.  This marks the tenth \nconsecutive year that Origin has been recognized \namong the best banks to work for.  The Origin Culture \nand our geographic management model create \nan environment that attracts high quality people \nwho are committed to building valuable, long-term \nrelationships. \nWhat is unique about the Origin Culture is that it is \ndefined, reinforced and measured. We currently \nmeasure \nemployee \nengagement \nthrough \nGlint \nsurveys, our community support through employee \nvolunteerism, customer satisfaction through Net \nPromoter Scores and efficiencies through our Robotics \nAutomation process.  The tremendous success that \nwe achieve in all of these categories, along with the \ncontinued improvements in our financial performance, \nmakes us believe that Origin can be the best bank in \nAmerica. \nLOOKING FORWARD\nOrigin continues to operate from a position of \nstrength. While we acknowledge the uncertainty \nthat events early in 2023 created in the markets, we \nremain very well capitalized with more than adequate \nlevels of liquidity. We have the right team in place with \nincredible employees who know and understand our \nclients.  I am pleased with where we are from a credit \nperspective and with the credit culture that is in place. \nUNIQUE FROM WITHIN"

The financial metrics were more heavily weighted than scorecard \nmetrics to reflect the Company’s focus on profitability, credit quality, and growth.\nThe Compensation Committee establishes a target annual incentive award for each NEO expressed as \na percentage of the executive’s base salary, established by factors such as: the estimated contribution \nand responsibility of the NEO, Peer Group market practices, internal equity and the recommendation \nof the CEO (for all officers excluding himself). \nThe 2022 STIP target annual incentive award opportunities as a percentage of base salary for each of \nthe NEOs are shown below. \nSTIP Opportunity Levels as a % of Base Salary\nName/Position\nThreshold %\nTarget %\nMaximum %\nDrake Mills, CEO\n25.0\n50.0\n75.0\nWilliam Wallace, IV, CFO(1)\n20.0\n40.0\n60.0\nM.

The PSUs are linked to the achievement of ROAA and ROAE against predetermined \nperformance goals over the three-year performance period ending December 31, 2024. ROAA and \nROAE were chosen as financial metrics because the Committee believes these are strong indicators of \nour performance over a longer period of time. ROAA and ROAE are equally weighted. The respective \nperformance goals are based on a 3-year average calculation for each performance measure, with a \nrange of 85% to 115% of target. Depending on achieved performance, a NEO may earn between 50% \nand 150% of his or her target PSUs.

In the event of a CIC in \nwhich the surviving Company does not assume the outstanding Award granted or does not substitute \nequivalent equity awards, the Award will become fully vested.\nThe PSUs are eligible to vest based on achievement of five pre-established stock price hurdles (each, \na “Stock Price Hurdle”) during the seven-year performance period (the “Performance Period”) ending \non December 31, 2029. Achievement of each Stock Price Hurdle requires substantial and sustained \ngrowth in the Company’s stock price, with each Stock Price Hurdle representing a twenty percent \n(20%) price appreciation over the 20-day average closing price of the Company’s common stock on \nthe Grant Date (such that 100% appreciation is required for 100% of the PSUs to vest). Each Stock \nPrice Hurdle will be considered achieved only if it is maintained for twenty consecutive trading days \nduring the Performance Period. Each of the five tranches of PSUs will vest on the later of the date \nthat the applicable Stock Price Hurdle is achieved (“Achieved RSUs”) or the third, fourth, fifth, sixth \nand seventh anniversaries of the Grant Date, respectively, subject to Mr. Mills’ continued employment \nwith the Company on each respective vesting date, or upon the earlier occurrence of Mr. Mills’ death \nor disability. In the event of a CIC in which the surviving Company does not assume the outstanding \nAward granted or does not substitute equivalent equity awards, the award will become fully vested. \nSupplemental Retirement and Income Benefits\nThe Company has entered into individual Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (each, a “SERP”) \nwith several of our NEOs. Eligibility to participate in a SERP is limited to senior officers and determined \nby the Board. Currently, Mr. Mills, Mr. Hall and Mr. Brolly participate in a SERP. The SERPs are unfunded \nand designed to be nonqualified deferred compensation retirement plans in compliance with Section \n409A of the Internal Revenue Code. In October 2019, the Company also entered into an Executive \nSupplemental Income Agreement (“ESIA”) with Mr. Hall.\nThe Company believes these plans provide an effective long-term retention measure in keeping with an \noverall competitive compensation strategy aimed at retaining high performance executives. The plans \nare defined benefit style programs in which the participant is promised a benefit according to a set \nformula and such benefit is paid to the participant (or his or her beneficiary) in equal annual installments \nover a specified period of time as outlined in each individual’s agreement. Vesting requirements are also \noutlined in each individual agreement and are tied to the number of years of service of the executive. \nThese plans encourage our executives to remain with the Company for an extended period or until \nretirement. Additional tables on page 72 provide more details regarding these plans.\nOrigin Bank Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan\nOn December 7, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the Origin Bank Nonqualified \nDeferred Compensation Plan (the “DCP”), pursuant to which certain employees, including the NEOs, \nmay elect to participate. Pursuant to the DCP, which became effective January 1, 2023, participants \nmay make deferral elections with respect to their base salary, bonus or stock units. The Company may \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION \nAND ANALYSIS"

The Company is not currently making any discretionary contributions to the \nDCP. Participants may make individual investment elections that will determine the rate of return on \ntheir cash deferral amounts under the DCP. Cash deferrals are only deemed to be invested in the \ninvestment options selected. The DCP does not provide any above-market returns or preferential \nearnings to participants, and, with the exception of any Company contributions, the deferrals and their \nearnings are always 100% vested. Participants may elect at the time they make their deferral elections \nto receive in-service and/or separation from service distributions, either as a lump sum payment or in \nsubstantially equal annual installments over a period of 5 years or 10 years, respectively. \nBenefits and Perquisites\nWe provide our NEOs with certain limited perquisites, including the use of Company cars or car allowance, \nthe payment of life insurance premiums, reimbursement for country club dues and certain other expenses \nwhich we believe is consistent with competitive market practice and aids in executive retention.\nExecutive officers are eligible to participate in the same benefit plans provided to all full-time employees, \nincluding health, dental, vision, basic group life and disability insurance. The Company also provides \nits employees, including executives, with a 401(k) plan, which currently provides an employer match of \n50 cents on each dollar of employee contributions up to 6% of eligible compensation. In addition, all \nemployees, including executives, can participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which \ngrants a purchase right consisting of an option to purchase shares at a 15 percent discount.\nCIC and Severance Benefits\nOur NEOs are generally entitled to certain limited CIC and severance protections. We believe that \nappropriate CIC and severance protections accomplish two objectives. First, they create an environment \nwhere key executives are able to take actions in the best interest of the Company without incurring \nundue personal risk. Second, they foster management stability during periods of potential uncertainty. \nThe CIC and severance benefits payable to our NEOs are discussed under the heading “Employment \nArrangements, CIC Agreements, and Potential Payments Upon Termination or CIC” below.\nOther Compensation Policies and Information\nIn addition to adhering to the processes described in the preceding sections, the Compensation Committee \nmaintains a strong corporate governance culture with respect to executive compensation. Over the \nyears it has adopted policies, including those described below, to further align executive compensation \nwith performance and what the Company believes is in the best interest of our stockholders.\nRisk Assessment\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risk related to our \nexecutive and non-executive compensation plans. Annually, our Chief Risk Officer prepares a risk \nassessment of these plans, which includes an analysis of the design and operation of the Company’s \nincentive compensation programs, identification and evaluation of situations or compensation elements \nthat may raise material risks, and an evaluation of controls and processes designed to identify and \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION \nAND ANALYSIS"

Based on its evaluation, the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation \nplans and practices are not likely to create risks that could have a material adverse effect on the \nCompany. The compensation plans and practices are subject to review and modification by the \nCompensation Committee on an annual basis.\nExecutive and Director Stock Ownership Guidelines\nDirectors and executive officers are subject to Stock Ownership Guidelines, which were adopted \nduring the year ended December 31, 2022, and are designed to encourage executive tenure while also \nfurther aligning executive’s interests with those of stockholders. In this regard, the Board has adopted \nminimum stock ownership guidelines, which provide that executives and non-employee directors \nshould beneficially own at least the number of shares of common stock of the Company equal to the \nvalues specified below:\nTitle\nMultiple of Base \nSalary\nCompliant at \nDecember 31, 2022\nChairman and CEO of the Company\n5x\nyes\nPresident and CEO of Origin Bank\n3x\nyes\nSenior Executive Officers\n2x \nyes\nExecutive Vice Presidents\n1x\nyes\nNon-Employee Directors\n5x annual cash retainer\nyes\nBeneficial ownership of shares of common stock shall be determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 \npromulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; provided, however, that \n(i) shares shall be deemed to be beneficially owned notwithstanding a disclaimer of such ownership, \n(ii) unvested RSAs and RSUs shall be deemed to be beneficially owned, and (iii) neither stock options \nnor performance-based RSUs shall be included in such calculation.  \nExecutives and non-employee directors will not be considered out of compliance with these stock \nownership guidelines prior to attaining sufficient shares to meet the applicable stock ownership \nguidelines. However, each executive and non-employee director is prohibited from selling shares of \ncommon stock unless such individual has attained his or her applicable stock ownership guideline, and \neach executive and non-employee director is expected to continuously own sufficient shares to meet \nthe applicable guideline once attained (except for shares withheld to pay withholding taxes or the \nexercise price of options). If an individual falls below the applicable guideline due solely to a decline in \nthe market value of shares of common stock, the individual will not be required to acquire additional \nshares to meet the guideline, but he or she will be required to retain all shares then held (except \nfor shares withheld to pay withholding taxes or the exercise price of options) until such time as the \nexecutive again complies with the applicable guideline.\nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION \nAND ANALYSIS"

In making this determination, we annualized the compensation of full-time and \npart-time permanent employees who were employed on December 31, 2022, but who did not work \nfor us the entire year. No full-time equivalent adjustments were made for part-time employees.\n•\t We identified our 2022 median employee using this compensation measure and methodology, \nwhich was consistently applied to all employees who were included in the calculation. In order to \ndetermine the median employee, we then reviewed the employee list based upon a ranking of the \ntotal cash compensation of all employees other than our PEO.\n•\t We calculated the median employee’s total annual compensation figure by aggregating the value \nof all wages, cash incentives, equity incentives, Employee 401(k) employer contributions and any \napplicable perquisites earned or paid in 2022 in the same manner as we calculated the total annual \ncompensation of our PEO for purposes of the Summary Compensation Table.\n•\t With respect to the annual total compensation of our PEO, we used the amount reported in the \n“Total” column of our 2022 Summary Compensation Table. \nDuring 2022, our PEO received stock awards with an aggregate grant date fair value of $8.6 million, \nof which $8.2 million represented two one-time awards in conjunction with the Company’s efforts to \nmore evenly match the PEO’s pay to the Company’s performance and are part of the Company’s LTIP. \nWithout these one-time awards, the PEO’s annual compensation would have been $2.0 million with \na ratio of PEO to median employee compensation of 1:30.

Since 2005, we have \nenhanced our growth by integrating four bank acquisitions, entering de novo into several expansion markets, expanding our \nproduct offerings in mortgage lending and servicing as well as in insurance and private banking. We have supported our \nmarkets by hiring a number of experienced in-market bankers and banking teams. To support our growth, we have raised \nover $589.6 million of new Tier 1 capital since 2006, including proceeds from our initial public offering completed in May \n2018, we issued subordinated notes that are treated as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes in 2020, and completed an all \nstock merger valued at $307.8 million in 2022. Through these efforts, we have successfully increased our market share in our \nkey geographic markets.\nMerger\nWe believe in relationship-based, community banking where a putting people first philosophy thrives. Identifying \nand merging with BT Holdings, Inc. (\"BTH\"), a Texas corporation and the registered bank holding company of BTH Bank, \nallowed us to merge two companies that have been passionately committed to community banking for more than 100 years \nand are each deeply rooted in their communities. Our merger with BTH was our only material acquisition during the previous \nfive years.\n5"

We issued \n6,794,910 shares of our common stock, and all outstanding BTH common stock options were converted into options to \npurchase an aggregate of 611,676 shares of Origin common stock. Based on the closing price of our common stock on July \n29, 2022, of $43.07 per share, the aggregate consideration paid to holders of BTH common stock in connection with the \nmerger was approximately $307.8 million.

BTH formerly operated its banking business \nfrom 13 locations in East Texas, Dallas and Fort Worth, each of which now operates as a banking location of Origin Bank.\nOur Competitive Strengths and Banking Strategy\nOrganic Growth Capabilities with Strategic Acquisitions\nWe have historically been able to demonstrate our ability to grow our loans and deposits organically. Our team of \nseasoned bankers has been an important driver of our organic growth by further developing banking relationships with \ncurrent and potential clients. Our relationship bankers are motivated to increase the size of their loan and deposit portfolios \nand generate fee income while maintaining strong credit quality. To promote our organic growth, we strategically locate \nbanking centers within our markets and employ highly experienced relationship bankers who proactively develop valuable \nrelationships within the communities that we serve. Through these relationships, our bankers are able to meet our customers’ \nneeds and capitalize on loan demand across a wide range of industries. This allows us to not only diversify our loan portfolio, \nbut also focus on loans with quality credit characteristics.\nWe focus on generating and retaining core deposits and, in particular, noninterest-bearing deposits, as our primary \nfunding source to support loan growth. We believe motivating our relationship bankers to generate strong core, noninterest-\nbearing deposit growth enhances our ability to build and strengthen client relationships and provide stable funding for future \ngrowth.\nWe also intend to continue pursuing selective acquisition opportunities that we expect will enhance our business \nmodel within our attractive geographic footprint and other complementary markets.\nA Unique from Within Client Experience\nOur mission is to passionately pursue ways to make banking and insurance more rewarding for our employees, \ncustomers, communities, and stockholders. We have a deep commitment to providing an unmatched client experience that \nexceeds our customers’ expectations. We believe by aligning our processes, philosophy, technology, and culture; we create a \nseamless experience that goes beyond the transactional and becomes transformational. Trust, encouraging strong work ethic, \ninnovation, flexibility, forward-thinking, genuine respect for others, commitment to our community, and never compromising \nour integrity are our values, and are the foundation of our company.\nConcentration on Sound Asset Quality\nWe believe that asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. We seek to maintain sound asset quality by \nmoderating credit risk, adhering to prudent lending practices and promoting a relationship-based approach to commercial and \nconsumer banking. Our executive management team has extensive knowledge of the bank regulatory landscape, significant \nexperience navigating interest rate and credit cycles and a long history of collaboration, which we believe may help us avoid \nor mitigate unforeseen losses.\n6"

We primarily originate \ncommercial real estate loans and construction/land/land development loans that are generally secured by real estate located in \nour market areas. Our commercial mortgage loans are generally collateralized by first liens on real estate and amortized over \n20 to 30 years, with balloon payments typically due at the end of five years. These loans are generally underwritten by \naddressing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary, secondary, and tertiary sources of repayment, the financial strength of \nany guarantor, the strength of the tenant (if any), the borrower's liquidity and leverage, management experience, ownership \nstructure, economic conditions, industry-specific trends and collateral. Commercial real estate loans have contributed interest \nincome of $88.2 million and $61.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, while \nconstruction/land/land development loans have contributed interest income of $36.4 million and $21.9 million for the years \nended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nConsumer Loans and Residential Real Estate Loans. Our consumer loan portfolio is primarily composed of secured \nand unsecured loans that we originate. The largest component of our consumer loan portfolio is for residential real estate \npurposes. We originate one-to-four family, owner-occupied residential mortgage loans generally secured by property located \nin our primary market areas. The majority of our residential mortgage loans consist of loans secured by owner-occupied, \nsingle-family residences. These loans are underwritten by giving consideration to the borrower's ability to pay, stability of \nemployment or source of income, debt-to-income ratio, credit history and loan-to-value ratio. Consumer loans also include \nclosed-end second mortgages, home equity lines of credit and our mortgage loans held for sale. Consumer and residential real \nestate loans have contributed interest income of $51.1 million and $38.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and \n2021, respectively.\nCommercial and Industrial Loans. Commercial and industrial loans are made for a variety of business purposes, \nincluding working capital, inventory, equipment and capital expansion.

      "text": "Mortgage Warehouse Loans. Mortgage warehouse loans are extended to mortgage companies and secured by loan \nparticipations in mortgages that are typically sold within 15 to 25 days. The loans are underwritten by the approved mortgage \ncompany using agency or investor guidelines. The loans are then committed to a secondary market investor and are primarily \nmade up of agency-eligible conventional loans (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac), government loans (Ginnie Mae, FHA loans, VA \nloans, USDA Rural Housing Development loans) and qualified jumbo loans. Mortgage warehouse loans have contributed \ninterest income of $18.7 million and $27.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCredit Risks. The principal economic risk associated with each category of loans we make is the creditworthiness of \nthe borrower and the ability of the borrower to repay the relevant loan. Borrower creditworthiness is affected by general \neconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation, and in the case of commercial borrowers, demand for the borrower's \nproducts and services, and other factors affecting the borrower's customers, suppliers and employees.\nMortgage warehouse loan risk is primarily centered in the borrower’s adherence to agency or investor underwriting \nguidelines, while the risk associated with the underlying consumer mortgage loan repayment, as similar to other consumer \nloans, depends on the borrower's financial stability and are more likely than commercial loans to be adversely affected by \ndivorce, job loss, illness and other personal hardships.\nRisks associated with real estate loans also include fluctuations in the value of real estate, new job creation trends, \ntenant vacancy rates, economic downturns that create the need for temporary payment forbearances and, in the case of \ncommercial borrowers, the quality of the borrower's management. Consumer loan repayments depend on the borrower's \nfinancial stability and are more likely than commercial loans to be adversely affected by divorce, job loss, illness and other \npersonal hardships.\nLending Philosophy. Our lending philosophy is driven by our commitment to centralized underwriting for all loans, \nlocal market knowledge, long-term customer relationships and a conservative credit culture. To implement this philosophy, \nwe have established various levels of authority and review, including our Credit Risk Management Group. In each loan \nreview, we emphasize cash flow and secondary and tertiary repayment sources, such as guarantors and collateral. We \ngenerally avoid lending to highly cyclical industries and typically avoid making certain types of loans that we consider to be \nhigher risk.\nLending Policies. We have established common documentation requirements and policies for each type of loan. We \nhave also established a corporate loan committee with authority to approve loans up to the legal lending limit of Origin Bank. \nDuring 2022, credit relationships of $8.0 million or greater were generally presented to the corporate loan committee for \napproval or ratification of approval prior to committing to the loan. The corporate loan committee meets weekly and on an ad \nhoc basis as needed.\nOrigin Bank's board of directors reviews our lending policies and procedures at least annually. In addition, there are \nlegal restrictions on the maximum amount of loans available for each lending relationship. Origin Bank is subject to certain \nlegal lending limits under the Louisiana Banking Law and Federal Reserve Regulation O. At December 31, 2022, we had \nestablished a general in-house lending limit ranging between $30.0 million and $35.0 million to any one borrower, excluding \nmortgage warehouse lines of credit, based upon our internal risk rating of the relationship. Due to multiple sources of \nrepayment, mortgage warehouse lines of credit have a general in-house lending limit ranging between $30.0 million and \n$75.0 million to any one borrower.\nDeposits and Other Sources of Funds\nAn important aspect of our business franchise is the ability to gather deposits. At December 31, 2022, we held $7.78 \nbillion of total deposits and have grown deposits at a compound annual growth rate of 18.8% since December 31, 2003. At \nDecember 31, 2022, 95.8% of our total deposits were core deposits (defined as total deposits excluding time deposits greater \nthan $250,000 and brokered deposits). We offer a wide range of deposit services, including checking, savings, money market \naccounts and time deposits. We obtain most of our deposits from individuals, small businesses and municipalities in our \nmarket areas. At December 31, 2022, 54.2% of our deposits were business deposits, 35.6% were consumer deposits and \n10.2% were public fund deposits. One area of focus has been to create a deposit-focused sales force of business development \nbankers who have extensive contacts and connections with targeted clients and centers of influence throughout our \ncommunities. We also have access to secondary sources of funding, including advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of \nDallas, borrowings at the Federal Reserve Discount Window and other borrowings.\n9"

Revenue from our mortgage banking activities was $6.7 million, $12.9 million and $29.6 \nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nInsurance\nWe offer a wide variety of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products through our wholly-\nowned insurance subsidiary, Davison Insurance Agency, LLC, which conducts business under the trade names Lincoln \nAgency, LLC, Lincoln Agency Transportation Insurance, Pulley-White Insurance Agency, Reeves, Coon & Funderburg, \nSimoneaux & Wallace Agency and Thomas & Farr Agency.

In December 2021, we acquired the \nremaining 62% interest in the Lincoln Agency, bringing our total ownership to 100% ownership. In addition, in December \n2021, we acquired Pulley-White located in Bossier City, Louisiana, thereby solidifying our presence as one of the larger \nindependent insurance agencies in North Louisiana.

Our core data \nprocessing platform is from a nationally-recognized bank processing vendor and we leverage the capabilities of a third-party \nservice provider in developing our network design and architecture. We also actively manage our business continuity plan. \nThe majority of our other systems, including electronic funds transfer and transaction processing, are operated in-house. \nOnline banking services and other public-facing web services are performed using third-party service providers. We strive to \nfollow all recommendations outlined by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and we perform regular tests \nof the adequacy of our contingency plans for key functions and systems.\nCompetition\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and our profitability will depend in large part on our ability to compete \nwith other banks and nonbank financial service companies located in our markets for lending opportunities, deposit funds, \nfinancial products, bankers and acquisition targets.\nWe are subject to vigorous competition in all aspects of our business from banks, savings banks, savings and loan \nassociations, finance companies, credit unions, technology companies, and other financial service providers, such as money \nmarket funds, fintech companies, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, asset-based nonbank lenders, insurance \ncompanies and certain other non-financial entities, including retail stores which may maintain their own credit programs and \ncertain governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing than we can.\nMany other commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions have offices in our primary market areas. \nThese institutions include many of the largest banks operating in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, including various national \nbanks. Our competitors often have greater resources, have broader geographic markets, have higher lending limits, offer \nvarious services that we may not currently offer and make broader use of media advertising, support services and electronic \ntechnology than we do. To offset these competitive disadvantages, we depend on our reputation as having greater personal \nservice, consistency, flexibility and the ability to make credit and other business decisions quickly.\n10"

This focus was \nmagnified with the impact of COVID-19 and employee and customer health and safety continues to be one of our top \npriorities. While COVID-19 variants have evolved and changed our support of our employees and customer health has \nremained unwavering. During the pandemic, we expanded our work from home (“WFH”) capabilities in order to allow our \nemployees to better serve our customers while putting safety first, and this option has allowed smooth operations while \nvariants of the virus ebb and flow.  \nCompensation and Benefits\nWe provide competitive compensation and benefits in order to attract and retain top talent.

Over 250 employees have \nparticipated in this program since 2019. We launched a nationally-recognized financial wellness program (“SmartDollar”) \nduring 2021 that is designed to assist our employees in becoming debt-free and saving money for emergencies and \nretirement, empowering them to become better financially prepared for their future, which during 2022, had an over 40% \nparticipation rate.  Due to our adoption rate, we won a national award in 2021 from the Dave Ramsey Foundation called the \n“Vision” award. Also in 2021, we hired a certified Holistic Health Coach to spearhead our Health & Wellness initiatives. In \naddition to providing health and wellness information on a regular basis to all employees, we currently have approximately \n10% of our employees working directly with our Health Coach on a personalized basis to meet their desire to be healthier. \nAdditionally, in one specific initiative designed to help the communities we serve, our Project Enrich program provides \nemployees with up to twenty hours of paid time off to volunteer in their communities. In 2022, the employees of Origin \nvolunteered 2,874 hours in the community during bank time, not including many more on personal time.\nEmployee Feedback\nEmployee feedback is highly valued at Origin and our employees provide anonymous input via quarterly surveys \nfacilitated by Glint, a LinkedIn company. Our employees consistently rank Origin in the top 10% of Glint’s global customer \nbase with regard to employee engagement. We regularly receive hundreds of written comments each quarter that in turn are \nused to improve processes, policies, or programs in an effort to show tangible affirmation of those comments. We also have \ncontinued a practice that was implemented at the beginning of the pandemic called “The Origin Insider”.  This webinar event \noccurs monthly and features speakers (internal and external) for our employees on a wide range of topics promoting, among \nother things, employee engagement and satisfaction. The employees are able to submit questions for the speakers in advance \nof the webinar. \nTalent Development \nTalent development at Origin begins with our comprehensive recruitment program and continues throughout the \nemployee life cycle. Beginning in 2021 and continuing throughout 2022, we implemented the Giving Interns Valuable \nExperience (g.i.v.e.) program, and welcomed a very diverse (both in gender and race) group of 27 interns from 17 different \nuniversities.

Participants in the Origin Leadership Academy are appointed by senior management. Further, \nall employees are eligible to apply for participation in the “Emerging Leaders Council”, which is a one-year program \ndesigned to train and develop emerging leaders in our organization. Beginning in 2021, we implemented a program called \n“Career Manager” which provides young professionals within our organization one-on-one time with senior leaders to \nenhance their career aspirations and accelerate their understanding of the business of banking.

Additionally, all employees participate \nin diversity training and managers have additional, in-depth training on recognizing unconscious biases and access to brand \nnew micro learning lessons every week to help respond to current needs around diversity and inclusion.\nAlso, we recently introduced VIBE Central in Workday. VIBE stands for Value, Inclusion, Belonging and Equity. \nThis allows senior leaders in our organization to set goals and monitor progress by assessing, measuring, benchmarking, and \nmanaging diversity and inclusion by the dimensions of their choice, such as race/ethnicity and gender.\nOrigin has been recognized as a “Best Bank to Work For” by American Banker magazine for ten consecutive years \nand was named the 2nd \"Best Bank to Work For\" in America in 2022, which we believe is attributable to our deep \ncommitment to corporate culture, and our focus on initiatives to support and develop our employees.

A bank regulator conducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined \ninstitution. The results of the examination are confidential. Supervision and regulation of banks, their holding companies and \naffiliates is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and clients, the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) of the \nFDIC, and the U.S. banking and financial system rather than holders of our securities.\nRegulation of the Company\nWe are registered as a bank holding company with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \n“Federal Reserve”) under the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended (the “BHC Act”) and have elected to be treated as a \nfinancial holding company. As such, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve and \nare subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. Federal law subjects bank holding companies, such as the Company, to \nrestrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements. In addition, the \nLouisiana Office of Financial Institutions (the “OFI”) regulates bank holding companies that own Louisiana-chartered banks, \nsuch as us, under the bank holding company laws of the State of Louisiana. Various federal and state bodies regulate and \nsupervise our non-bank activities including our insurance agency activities. These include, but are not limited to, various state \nregulators of insurance activities.\nViolations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in regulatory agencies \nimposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these \nagencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the \naffairs of a bank or bank holding company. Like all bank holding companies, we are regulated extensively under federal and \nstate law. Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository \ninstitutions, state banking regulators, the Federal Reserve, and separately the FDIC as the insurer of bank deposits, have the \nauthority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if they determine that we have insufficient capital or other resources, \nor are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under \nthis authority, our regulators can require us or our subsidiaries to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements, \nincluding board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, \npursuant to which we would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from \ntaking certain actions.\n13"

If our regulators were to take such supervisory actions, then we could, \namong other things, become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as well as \nrestrictions on our existing business, and we could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and \nliabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. The terms of any such action could have a material negative effect on \nour business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition, and the value of our securities. \nActivity Limitations\nAs a financial holding company, we are permitted to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities \nthan those permitted for a bank holding company that has not elected to be a financial holding company. Bank holding \ncompanies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and certain other \nactivities determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking. Financial holding companies may also engage \nin activities that are considered to be financial in nature, as well as those incidental or, if determined by the Federal Reserve, \ncomplementary to financial activities. We rely on our financial holding company status to engage in insurance agency \nactivities.\nIf Origin Bank ceases to be “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards, or if Origin \nBank receives a rating of less than satisfactory under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve may, among \nother things, place limitations on our ability to conduct these broader financial activities or, if the deficiencies persist, require \nus to divest the banking subsidiary or the businesses engaged in activities permissible only for financial holding companies.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any \nnonbanking activity or terminate its ownership or control of any nonbank subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe \nthat continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or \nstability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company. As further described below, each of the Company and Origin \nBank is well-capitalized under applicable regulatory standards as of December 31, 2022, and Origin Bank has an overall \nrating of “Satisfactory” in its most recent CRA evaluation.\nSource of Strength Obligations\nA bank holding company, such as us, is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its \nsubsidiary bank. The term “source of financial strength” means the ability of a company, such as us, that directly or indirectly \nowns or controls an insured depository institution, such as Origin Bank, to provide financial assistance to such insured \ndepository institution in the event of financial distress. The appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution \n(in the case of Origin Bank, this agency is the Federal Reserve) may require reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a \nsource of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring us to provide financial \nassistance to Origin Bank in the event of financial distress. If we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly \nliquidation process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to \nmaintain the capital of Origin Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as appropriate, and entitled to a \npriority of payment. In addition, the FDIC provides that any insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss \nincurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or any assistance provided by the FDIC to, a commonly controlled \ninsured depository institution. Origin Bank is an FDIC-insured depository institution and thus subject to these requirements.\n14"

      "text": "Acquisitions\nThe BHC Act permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies, such that we and any other bank holding \ncompany, whether located in Louisiana or elsewhere, may acquire a bank located in any other state, subject to certain deposit-\npercentage, age of bank charter requirements, and other restrictions. The BHC Act requires that a bank holding company \nobtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% \nof the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company, (ii) taking any action that causes an additional bank or \nbank holding company to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other \nbank holding company. The Federal Reserve may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would \nbe in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any \nsection of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly \nin any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of \nthe proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the \nconvenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider: (1) the financial and \nmanagerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United \nStates banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including performance \nunder the CRA; and (4) the effectiveness of the company in combatting money laundering.\nChange in Control\nFederal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person may acquire \nwithout the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a \nperson or group must give advance notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such \nas the Company, or before acquiring control of any FDIC-insured bank, such as Origin Bank. Upon receipt of such notice, the \nFederal Reserve may approve or disapprove the acquisition. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable \npresumption of control if a person or group acquires the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding common stock. The \noverall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or \nsimilar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company \nmay be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to \nacquire control of other companies. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock.\nGovernance and Financial Reporting Obligations\nWe are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight \nBoard (\"PCAOB\"), and the Nasdaq. In particular, we are required to include management and independent registered public \naccounting firm reports on internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K in order to comply with Section 404 \nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have evaluated our controls, including compliance with the SEC rules on internal controls, \nand have and expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules. Our failure \nto comply with these internal control rules may materially adversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary \ncertifications to financial statements, and the values of our securities. \nVolcker Rule\nSection 13 of the BHC Act, commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule,” generally prohibits banking organizations \nfrom (i) engaging in certain proprietary trading, and (ii) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a \n“covered fund,” all subject to certain exceptions. The Volcker Rule also specifies certain limited activities in which banking \norganizations may continue to engage and requires us to maintain a compliance program. Banking organizations, such as us, \nwith $10 billion or less in total consolidated assets and with total trading assets and liabilities of less than 5% of total \nconsolidated assets are exempt from the Volcker Rule.\n15"

      "text": "Incentive Compensation\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint rules or guidelines for \nfinancial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets, such as us and Origin Bank, which prohibit incentive compensation \narrangements that the agencies determine to encourage inappropriate risks by the institution. The federal banking agencies \nissued proposed rules in 2011 and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies. In 2016, the federal \nbanking agencies and the SEC proposed rules that would, depending upon the assets of the institution, directly regulate \nincentive compensation arrangements and would require enhanced oversight and recordkeeping. As of December 31, 2022, \nthese rules have not been implemented. Further, the capital conservation buffer described above would limit discretionary \nbonus payments to bank executives if the institution's regulatory capital ratios failed to exceed certain thresholds. We and \nOrigin Bank have undertaken efforts to ensure that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage inappropriate risks, \nconsistent with three key principles - that incentive compensation arrangements should appropriately balance risk and \nfinancial rewards, be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate \ngovernance.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to oversight by the SEC, the PCAOB, the Nasdaq, and various state securities \nand insurance regulators. We and our subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for information from regulatory \nauthorities in various states, including state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, \nconcerning our business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business.\nCapital Requirements\nWe and Origin Bank are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of \ncapital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the Federal Reserve \nmay determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of \ncapital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from \nnon-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes \nin interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks, are important factors that are to be taken into account in \nassessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these \ncapital rules and their potential impact on our capital levels.\nWe and Origin Bank are subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a CET1 risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 \nrisk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total risk-based capital ratio, which includes \nTier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of \ntreasury stock plus retained earnings less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible \nassets, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is \nprimarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier \n1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of \nrisk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and \noff-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for \nexample, certain “high volatility” commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings.\nThe leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly \naverage total consolidated assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The \nrequired minimum leverage ratio for all banks and bank holding companies is 4%.\nIn addition, effective January 1, 2019, the capital rules required a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, comprised of \nCET1, above each of the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total capital), which is designed \nto absorb losses during periods of economic stress. These buffer requirements must be met for a bank or bank holding \ncompany to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive \nmanagement without restriction.\n16"

      "text": "The FDICIA, among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” \nregarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital \ntiers: “well capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized”, and “critically \nundercapitalized”. A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant \ncapital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution \nfrom making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding \ncompany if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDICIA imposes progressively more \nrestrictive restraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is \nclassified. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. \nIn addition, undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC, are \nsubject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans for regulatory approval. A depository \ninstitution's holding company must guarantee any required capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% \nof the depository institution's assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the \ninstitution fails to comply with the plan. Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among \nother things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution's \ncapital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. \nTo be well-capitalized, Origin Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios:\n• \n6.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;\n• \n8.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets;\n• \n10.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and\n• \n5.0% leverage ratio.\nThe Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the \nhigher capital requirements imposed under the current capital rules applicable to banks. For purposes of the Federal Reserve’s \nRegulation Y, including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding \ncompany, bank holding companies, such as the Company, must maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater \nand a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater to be well-capitalized. Also, the Federal Reserve may require bank \nholding companies, including the Company, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, \ndepending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition, risk profile and growth \nplans.\nFailure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and \npossible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our \noperations or financial condition. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the \nCompany’s or Origin Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of \napplications or other restrictions on its growth.\nIn 2022, the Company’s and Origin Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were above the applicable well-capitalized \nstandards and met the capital conservation buffer. Based on current estimates, we believe that the Company and Origin Bank \nwill continue to exceed all applicable well-capitalized regulatory capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer in \n2023. Please see Note 18 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for \nconsolidated capital ratios of the Company and Origin Bank as of December 31, 2022.\nPayment of Dividends\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from Origin Bank and our other subsidiaries. Under the laws of the State \nof Louisiana, we, as a business corporation, may declare and pay dividends in cash or property unless the payment or \ndeclaration would be contrary to restrictions contained in our Articles of Incorporation, or unless, after payment of the \ndividend, we would not be able to pay our debts when they become due in the usual course of our business or our total assets \nwould be less than the sum of our total liabilities. In addition, we are also subject to federal regulatory capital requirements \nthat effectively limit the amount of cash dividends that we may pay.\n17"

      "text": "The primary sources of funds for our payment of dividends to our shareholders are cash on hand and dividends from \nOrigin Bank and our non-bank subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of \ndividends that Origin Bank may pay. Origin Bank is subject to certain restrictions on dividends under federal and state laws, \nregulations and policies. In general, Origin Bank may pay dividends to us without the approval of the Louisiana Office of \nFinancial Institutions so long as the amount of the dividend does not exceed the bank's net profits earned during the current \nyear combined with its retained net profits of the immediately preceding year. The bank is required to obtain the approval of \nthe Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions for any amount in excess of this threshold. Additionally, to pay dividends to us, \nunder Louisiana law Origin Bank must have unimpaired surplus that equals or exceeds fifty percent of its outstanding capital \nstock. Further, under federal law, Origin Bank may not pay any dividend to us if it is undercapitalized or the payment of the \ndividend would cause it to become undercapitalized. \nIn addition, we and Origin Bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the \npayment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The Federal Reserve \nhas indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound \nbanking practice. The Federal Reserve has indicated that depository institutions and their holding companies should generally \npay dividends only out of current operating earnings.\nUnder a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider \ndifferent factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, and is not based \non overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a \nstrong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding \ncompany should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s \ndividends if:\n• \nits net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during \nthat period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;\n• \nits prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and \nprospective financial condition; or\n• \nit will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nRegulation of the Bank\nOrigin Bank, which is a member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to comprehensive supervision and \nregulation by the Federal Reserve, and is subject to its regulatory reporting requirements, as well as supervision and \nregulation by the OFI. As a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, Origin Bank is required to hold stock in its district \nFederal Reserve Bank in an amount equal to 6% of its capital stock and surplus (half paid to acquire stock with the remainder \nheld as a cash reserve). Member banks do not have any control over the Federal Reserve System as a result of owning the \nstock and the stock cannot be sold or traded. The annual dividend rate for member banks with $10 billion or less in total \nassets is fixed at 6%, which currently applies to us. However, the annual dividend rate for member banks with total assets in \nexcess of $10 billion, is based on a floating dividend rate tied to10-year U.S. Treasuries with the maximum dividend rate \ncapped at 6%.\nThe deposits of Origin Bank are insured by the FDIC up to applicable limits, and, accordingly, Origin Bank is also \nsubject to certain FDIC regulations and the FDIC has backup examination authority and some enforcement powers over \nOrigin Bank. In addition, as discussed in more detail below, Origin Bank and any other of our subsidiaries that offer \nconsumer financial products and services are subject to regulation by the CFPB. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits \nstates to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, \nand state attorneys general are permitted to enforce certain federal consumer financial protection law.\nBroadly, regulations applicable to Origin Bank include limitations on loans to a single borrower and to its directors, \nofficers and employees; restrictions on the opening and closing of branch offices; the maintenance of required capital ratios; \nthe granting of credit under equal and fair conditions; the disclosure of the costs and terms of such credit; requirements to \nmaintain reserves against deposits and loans; limitations on the types of investment that may be made by Origin Bank; and \nrequirements governing risk management practices. Subject to Federal Reserve approval and certain state filing requirements, \nOrigin Bank is permitted under federal law to branch on a de novo basis across state lines wherever the laws of that state \nwould permit a bank chartered by that state to establish a branch.\n18"

      "text": "Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders\nOrigin Bank is subject to restrictions on extensions of credit and certain other transactions between Origin Bank and \nthe Company or any nonbank affiliate. Generally, these covered transactions with either the Company or any affiliate are \nlimited to 10% of Origin Bank’s capital and surplus, and all such transactions between Origin Bank and the Company and all \nof its nonbank affiliates combined are limited to 20% of Origin Bank’s capital and surplus. Loans and other extensions of \ncredit from Origin Bank to the Company or any affiliate generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified \namounts. In addition, any transaction between Origin Bank and the Company or any affiliate are required to be on an arm’s \nlength basis. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on certain extensions of credit by insured banks, such as \nOrigin Bank, to their directors, executive officers and principal shareholders.\nFDIC Insurance Assessments and Depositor Preference\nOrigin Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC’s DIF up to the limits under applicable law, which currently are set \nat $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. Origin Bank is subject to FDIC \nassessments for its deposit insurance. The FDIC calculates quarterly deposit insurance assessments based on an institution’s \naverage total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity, and determines the applicable rate based upon a range of \nfactors, including certain additional factors for institutions in excess of $10 billion assets. The assessment rate schedule can \nchange from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. \nAs of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio fell to 1.30%, below the statutory minimum of 1.35%. The FDIC, as \nrequired under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, established a plan on September 15, 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio \nto meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35% within eight years. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted an amended \nrestoration plan to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio would be restored to at least 1.35 percent by September 30, \n2028. The FDIC’s amended restoration plan increases the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly \nby 2 basis points, beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC could further increase the deposit \ninsurance assessments for certain insured depository institutions, including Origin Bank, if the DIF reserve ratio is not \nrestored as projected.\nInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and \nunsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, \nrule, order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act \nprovides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors \nof the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative \nexpenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including \nthose of the parent bank holding company. \nStandards for Safety and Soundness\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or \nguideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) \ninformation systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and \n(6) asset quality. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards \nfor Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness \nstandards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the \nregulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may \nrequire the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review \nof such safety and soundness compliance plans.\n19"

      "text": "Anti-Money Laundering\nA continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating \nmoney laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened the application of anti-money laundering \nregulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker-dealers, investment advisors and insurance \ncompanies, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. Government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money \nlaundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act require that \nregulated financial institutions, including state member banks: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program that includes \ntraining and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to \nopen an account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned accounts; and (iv) perform certain \nverification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships. Failure of a \nfinancial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act’s requirements could have serious legal and reputational \nconsequences for the institution. Origin Bank has augmented its systems and procedures to meet the requirements of these \nregulations and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by law. \nFinCEN has adopted rules that require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect \nto legal entities with which such institutions conduct business, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. Bank regulators \nare focusing their examinations on anti-money laundering compliance, and we continue to monitor and augment, where \nnecessary, our anti-money laundering compliance programs. Banking regulators will consider compliance with the Act’s \nmoney laundering provisions in acting upon merger and acquisition proposals. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions \nfor compliance with these obligations and have been active in imposing cease and desist and other regulatory orders and \nmoney penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations. Sanctions for violations of the Act can be \nimposed in an amount equal to twice the sum involved in the violating transaction, up to $1 million. On January 1, 2021, \nCongress passed federal legislation that made sweeping changes to federal anti-money laundering laws, including changes \nthat will be implemented in subsequent years. On June 30, 2021, FinCEN published the first set of “national AML priorities,” \nas required by the Bank Secrecy Act, which include, but are not limited to, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, and drug/\nhuman trafficking.  FinCEN is required to implement regulations to specify how covered financial institutions, such as the \nCompany, should incorporate these national priorities into their AML programs.  As of December 31, 2022, no such \nregulations have been proposed.\nEconomic Sanctions\nThe OFAC is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain \nprohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and acts of Congress. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists \nof names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially \nDesignated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an \nOFAC list, we must undertake certain specified activities, which could include blocking or freezing the account or transaction \nrequested, and we must notify the appropriate authorities.\nConcentrations in Lending\nDuring 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies released guidance on “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate \nLending” (the “Guidance”) and advised financial institutions of the risks posed by CRE lending concentrations. The \nGuidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate \nlending concentrations. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The Guidance is triggered \nwhen CRE loan concentrations exceed either:\n• \nTotal reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100% or more of a bank’s total \nrisk-based capital; or\n• \nTotal reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for \nconstruction, land development, and other land of 300% or more of a bank’s total risk-based capital.\nThe Guidance also applies when a bank has a sharp increase in CRE loans or has significant concentrations of CRE \nsecured by a particular property type. We have always had exposures to loans secured by CRE due to the nature of our \nmarkets and the loan needs of both consumer and commercial clients. We believe our long-term experience in CRE lending, \nunderwriting policies, internal controls, and other policies currently in place, as well as our loan and credit monitoring and \nadministration procedures, are generally appropriate to managing our concentrations as required under the Guidance. As of \nDecember 31, 2022, our CRE loan concentrations were below the Guidance thresholds discussed above.\n20"

The maximum \npermissible interchange fee that a non-exempt issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per \ntransaction and 5 bps multiplied by the value of the transaction, subject to an upward adjustment of 1 cent if an issuer \ncertifies that it has implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set \nforth by the Federal Reserve. In addition, card issuers and networks are prohibited from entering into arrangements requiring \nthat debit card transactions be processed on a single network or only two affiliated networks and allows merchants to \ndetermine transaction routing.\nDebit card issuers with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from these interchange fee \nrestrictions. The exemption for small issuers ceases to apply as of July 1 of the year following the calendar year in which the \ndebit card issuer has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more at calendar year end. \nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nOrigin Bank is subject to the provisions of the CRA, which imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation, \nconsistent with safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of entire communities where the bank accepts \ndeposits, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The Federal Reserve’s assessment of Origin Bank’s CRA \nrecord is made available to the public. CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual CRA reports must \nbe made to the Federal Reserve. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become or remain a financial holding \ncompany and no new activities authorized under GLB may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial \nsubsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a “satisfactory” CRA rating in its latest CRA examination. Federal \nCRA regulations require, among other things, that evidence of discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis, and \nillegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation. Origin Bank has a rating of “Satisfactory” in its \nmost recent CRA evaluation. \nOn May 5, 2022, the OCC, FRB, and FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to provide for a coordinated \napproach to modernize their respective CRA regulations, such that all banks will be subject to the same set of CRA rules. No \nfinal rule has been issued, but the rulemaking may affect Origin Bank’s CRA compliance obligations in the future.\nPrivacy, Credit Reporting, and Data Security\nThe GLB generally prohibits disclosure of non-public consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the \nconsumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further \nrequired to disclose their privacy policies to clients annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to comply with \nstate law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the GLB. The GLB also directed federal regulators to prescribe \nstandards for the security of consumer information. Origin Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for \nnotifying clients in the event of a security breach. Origin Bank utilizes credit bureau data in underwriting activities. Use of \nsuch data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V on a uniform, nationwide basis, including credit \nreporting, prescreening, and sharing of information between affiliates and the use of credit data. The Fair and Accurate Credit \nTransactions Act, which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act, permits states to enact identity theft laws that are not \ninconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of that Act. Clients must be notified when unauthorized disclosure \ninvolves sensitive client information that may be misused. On November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies issued a new \nrule effective in 2022 that requires banks to notify their primary federal regulator within 36 hours of a “computer-security \nincident” that rises to the level of a “notification incident.” \nThe federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk \nmanagement standards among financial institutions. As a result, financial institutions, like the Company and Origin Bank, are \nexpected to establish multiple lines of defense and to ensure their risk management processes address the risk posed by \npotential threats to the institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to \neffectively respond and recover the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack. A financial institution is also expected to \ndevelop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical service provider of the \ninstitution falls victim to this type of cyber-attack. Our information security protocols are designed in part to adhere to the \nrequirements of this guidance.\n21"

      "text": "State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and \nregulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement \ncybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption \nrequirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy \nrequirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring \ndevelopments in the states in which our clients are located.\nAnti-Tying Restrictions\nIn general, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration \nfor them on the condition that (1) the client obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the bank \nor bank holding company or their subsidiaries or (2) the client not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a \ncompetitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. A bank \nmay, however, offer combined-balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a client obtains two or \nmore traditional bank products. The law also expressly permits banks to engage in other forms of tying and authorizes the \nFederal Reserve Board to grant additional exceptions by regulation or order. Also, certain foreign transactions are exempt \nfrom the general rule.\nConsumer Regulation\nActivities of Origin Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and \nregulations include, among numerous other things, provisions that:\n• \nlimit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Origin Bank, including rules respecting \nthe terms of credit cards and of debit card overdrafts;\n• \ngovern Origin Bank’s disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;\n• \nrequire Origin Bank to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether it \nis fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the communities it serves;\n• \nprohibit Origin Bank from discriminating on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors when it \nmakes decisions to extend credit;\n• \ngovern the manner in which Origin Bank may collect consumer debts; and\n• \nprohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in the provision of consumer financial products and \nservices.\nMortgage Regulation\nThe CFPB adopted a rule that implements the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage provisions of the Dodd-Frank \nAct (the “ATR/QM rule”), which requires lenders to consider, among other things, income, employment status, assets, \npayment amounts, and credit history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance “safe harbor” for lenders that \nissue certain “qualified mortgages.” The ATR/QM rule defines a “qualified mortgage” to have certain specified \ncharacteristics, and generally prohibits loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms \nexceeding 30 years from being qualified mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified \nmortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years \nof the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43%. While “qualified \nmortgages” will generally be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay \nrequirements will attach to “qualified mortgages” that are “higher priced mortgages” (which are generally subprime loans). In \naddition, the securitizer of asset-backed securities must retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing \nthe asset-backed securities, unless subject to an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by \nresidential mortgages that qualify as “qualified residential mortgages.”\n22"

      "text": "The CFPB has also issued rules to implement requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act pertaining to mortgage loan \norigination (including with respect to loan originator compensation and loan originator qualifications) as well as integrated \nmortgage disclosure rules. In addition, the CFPB has issued rules that require servicers to comply with certain standards and \npractices with regard to: error correction; information disclosure; force-placement of insurance; information management \npolicies and procedures; requiring information about mortgage loss mitigation options be provided to delinquent borrowers; \nproviding delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower’s mortgage loan \naccount; and evaluating borrowers’ applications for available loss mitigation options. These rules also address initial rate \nadjustment notices for adjustable-rate mortgages, periodic statements for residential mortgage loans, and prompt crediting of \nmortgage payments and response to requests for payoff amounts.\nThe CARES Act granted certain forbearance rights and protection against foreclosure to borrowers with a “federally \nbacked mortgage loan,” including certain first or subordinate lien loans designed principally for the occupancy of one to four \nfamilies. These consumer protections continued during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. \nNon-Discrimination Policies\nOrigin Bank is also subject to, among other things, the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair \nHousing Act, both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, sex, and familial status in \nany aspect of a consumer or commercial credit or residential real estate transaction. The Department of Justice, and the \nfederal bank regulatory agencies have issued an Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination in Lending that provides \nguidance to financial institutions in determining whether discrimination exists, how the agencies will respond to lending \ndiscrimination, and what steps lenders might take to prevent discriminatory lending practices. The DOJ has increased its \nefforts to prosecute what it regards as violations of the ECOA and FHA.\nEffect of Governmental Monetary Policies. \nThe commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by U.S. fiscal policy \nand the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal \nReserve include changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, the fluctuating availability of borrowings at the \n\"discount window\" and open market operations as directed by the Federal Open Market Committee. These policies influence \nto a significant extent the overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or \npaid on deposits. We cannot predict the nature of future fiscal and monetary policies or the effect of these policies on our \noperations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects.\nLIBOR\nOn March 15, 2022, Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”) to address \nreferences to LIBOR in contracts that (i) are governed by U.S. law; (ii) will not mature before June 30, 2023; and (iii) lack \nfallback provisions providing for a clearly defined and practicable replacement for LIBOR. On December 16, 2022, the FRB \nadopted a final rule to implement the LIBOR Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR (Secured Overnight \nFinancing Rate) that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023.  The final rule identifies \nreplacement benchmark rates based on SOFR to replace overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month \nLIBOR in contracts subject to the LIBOR Act.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System. \nOrigin Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which is one of the 11 regional Federal Home \nLoan Banks composing the Federal Home Loan Bank system. The Federal Home Loan Banks make loans to their member \nbanks in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Federal Home Loan Bank system and the boards of \ndirectors of each regional Federal Home Loan Bank. Any advances from a Federal Home Loan Bank must be secured by \nspecified types of collateral, and all long-term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for \nresidential housing finance.

      "text": "Risks Related to Our Business\nCurrent uncertain economic conditions pose challenges, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and \nresults of operations.\nWe are operating in an uncertain economic environment. The pandemic caused a global economic slowdown, and \nwhile we have seen economic recovery, continuing supply chain issues, labor shortages and inflation risk are affecting the \ncontinued recovery. Our business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to customers in the form of \nloans, borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business \nand economic conditions in the U.S. Continued economic uncertainty and a recessionary or stagnant economy could result in \nfinancial stress on our borrowers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We \ndecreased the expense for credit losses over fiscal year 2021 as the economy began to recover, however, deteriorating \nconditions in the regional economies we serve, or in certain sectors of those economies, could drive losses beyond that which \nis provided for in our allowance for credit losses. We could also face the following risks in connection with the following \nevents:\n•\ninflationary pressures remained elevated throughout 2022 and are likely to continue into 2023;\n•\nmarket developments and economic stagnation or slowdown may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause \nadverse changes in payment patterns, resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit \nfacilities;\n•\nthe processes we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses and other reserves may prove to be unreliable. Such \nestimates rely upon complex modeling inputs and judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which \nmay be rendered inaccurate and/or no longer subject to accurate forecasting;\n•\nour ability to assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to \nselect, manage, and underwrite loans become less predictive of future charge-offs;\n•\nregulatory scrutiny of the industry could increase, leading to increased regulation of the industry that could lead to a \nhigher cost of compliance, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and increase our exposure to litigation \nor fines;\n•\nineffective monetary policy or other market conditions could cause rapid changes in interest rates and asset values \nthat would have a materially adverse impact on our profitability and overall financial condition;\n•\nerosion in the fiscal condition of the U.S. Treasury could lead to new taxes that would limit our ability to pursue \ngrowth and return profits to shareholders; and\n•\nthe U.S. government’s decisions regarding its debt ceiling and the possibility that the U.S. could default on its debt \nobligations may cause further interest rate increases, disrupt access to capital markets and deepen recessionary \nconditions.\nIf these conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, we could experience adverse effects on our financial \ncondition. \nChanges in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. \nSignificant increases in market interest rates on loans, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely \naffect both our ability to originate new loans and our ability to grow. Beginning early in 2022, in response to growing signs \nof inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates rapidly. Further, the Federal Reserve announced an intention to \ntake further actions to mitigate inflationary pressures. Rapid changes in interest rates may make it difficult for us to balance \nour loan and deposit portfolios, which may adversely affect our results of operations by, for example, reducing asset yields or \nspreads, or having other adverse impacts on our business. Conversely, decreases in interest rates could result in an \nacceleration of loan prepayments. The increased market interest rates could also adversely affect the ability of our floating-\nrate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets \nand charge offs, which could adversely affect our business.\n26"

      "text": "Further, our earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income, which is the \ndifference or spread, between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. When \nmarket rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities may fluctuate. \nThis can cause decreases in our spread and can adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including: \n•\nThe rate of inflation;\n•\nEconomic conditions;\n•\nFederal monetary policies; and\n•\nStability of domestic and foreign markets.\nChanges in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income, because different types of assets and \nliabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities \nmature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in the same period, an increase in interest \nrates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater \ndegree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. As of December 31, 2022, our \nnet interest income simulations projected that 100 and 200 basis point increases in interest rates would result in a positive \nvariance in net interest income of 3.64% and 7.10%, respectively, relative to the base case over the next 12 months, while \ndecreases in interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points would result in a negative variance in net interest income of 2.26% and \n6.72%, respectively, relative to the base case over the next 12 months. These are estimates and assume that the composition \nof our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at each year-end will remain constant over the relevant twelve month \nmeasurement period and that changes in market interest rates are instant and constant across the yield curve regardless of \nduration of pricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities. Changes in market values of investment securities classified \nas available for sale are impacted by higher rates and can negatively impact our other comprehensive (loss) income and \nequity levels through accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, which includes net unrealized gains and losses on \nthose securities. Further, such losses could be realized into earnings should liquidity and/or business strategy necessitate the \nsales of securities in a loss position.\nAdditionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to \noriginate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, \namong other things, increased prepayments on our loan portfolio and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, \nchanges in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume, loan \nportfolio and our overall results. Moreover, although we have implemented practices we believe will reduce the potential \neffects of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, these practices may not always be successful. Accordingly, \nchanges in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest income and our net interest \nmargin, asset quality, loan and lease origination volume, liquidity, and overall profitability. We cannot assure you that we can \nminimize our interest rate risk.\nIn addition, we originate residential mortgage loans for sale and for our portfolio. The origination of residential \nmortgage loans is highly dependent on the local real estate market and the level of interest rates. Increasing interest rates tend \nto reduce the origination of loans for sale and fee income, which we report as gain on sale of loans. Decreasing interest rates \ngenerally result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, as borrowers refinance their debt in order \nto reduce their borrowing cost. This typically leads to reinvestment at lower rates than the loans or securities were paying. \nChanges in market interest rates could also reduce the value of our financial assets. Our financial condition and results of \noperations could be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in managing the effects of changes in interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates may change the value of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio, which may increase the \nvolatility of our earnings.\nAs a result of our mortgage servicing business, we have a portfolio of mortgage servicing rights on unpaid principal \nbalances of $1.90 billion at December 31, 2022. During the second half of 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our \nGNMA mortgage servicing rights portfolio, which met all final sale conditions in early 2023. We sold approximately \n$1.8 million in GNMA mortgage servicing rights, representing $453.3 million in unpaid principal balances and derecognized \nthe related GNMA repurchase asset and offsetting liability of $24.6 million. \n27"

      "text": "A mortgage servicing right is the right to service a mortgage loan - collect principal, interest and escrow amounts - \nfor a fee. We measure and carry our residential mortgage servicing rights using the fair value measurement method. Fair \nvalue is determined as the present value of estimated future net servicing income, calculated based on a number of variables, \nincluding assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers.\nThe primary risk associated with mortgage servicing rights is that in a declining interest rate environment, they will \nlikely lose a substantial portion of their value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments. Moreover, if prepayments \nare greater than expected, the cash we receive over the life of the mortgage loans would be reduced. Conversely, these assets \ngenerally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than previously \nestimated. An increase in the size of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio may increase our interest rate risk. At December \n31, 2022, our mortgage servicing rights had a fair value of $20.8 million, compared to $16.2 million at December 31, 2021. \nChanges in fair value of our mortgage servicing rights are recorded to earnings in each period. Depending on the interest rate \nenvironment, it is possible that the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights may be reduced in the future. If such changes in \nfair value significantly reduce the carrying value of our mortgage servicing rights, our business, financial condition and \nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nInflationary pressures and rising prices may affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nInflation rose in 2022 at levels not seen for over 40 years. Inflationary pressures are likely to continue into 2023. \nInflation could lead to increased costs to our customers, making it more difficult for them to repay their loans or other \nobligations increasing our credit risk. Sustained higher interest rates by the Federal Reserve may be needed to tame persistent \ninflationary price pressures, which could push down asset prices and weaken economic activity. A deterioration in economic \nconditions in the United States and our markets could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, \ndecreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services, all of which, in turn, would \nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to monetary policy by the Federal Reserve could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve is responsible for regulating the supply of money in the United States, including open market \noperations used to stabilize prices in times of economic stress, as well as setting monetary policies. These activities strongly \ninfluence our rate of return on certain investments, our hedge effectiveness for mortgage servicing and our mortgage \norigination pipeline, as well as our costs of funds for lending and investing, all of which may adversely impact our liquidity, \nresults of operations, financial condition and capital position.\nUnstable global economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition, and \noperations.\nThe global credit and financial markets have from time to time experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, \nincluding severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic \ngrowth, increases in unemployment rates, high rates of inflation, and uncertainty about economic stability. The financial \nmarkets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, \nincluding the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which is increasing volatility in commodity and energy prices, \ncreating supply chain issues and causing instability in financial markets. Sanctions imposed by the United States and other \ncountries in response to such conflict could further adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any \neconomic countermeasures by the affected countries or others could exacerbate market and economic instability. The specific \nconsequences of the conflict in Ukraine on our business is difficult to predict at this time, but in addition to inflationary \npressures affecting our operations and those of our customers and borrowers, we may also experience an increase in \ncyberattacks against us, our customers and borrowers, service providers and other third parties. There can be no assurance \nthat further deterioration in markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy may \nbe adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment, hostile third-party action or continued \nunpredictable and unstable market conditions.\n28"

      "text": "We may not be able to adequately measure and limit our credit risk, which could lead to unexpected losses.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to \nthe risk that the principal of, or interest on, a loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral \nsupporting a loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. In addition, we are exposed to risks with respect to \nthe period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes \nin economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual loans and borrowers. The creditworthiness \nof a borrower is affected by many factors, including local market conditions and general economic conditions. If the overall \neconomic climate in the United States, generally, or our market areas, specifically, experiences material disruption, our \nborrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become \nilliquid, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional \nprovisions for credit losses. Additional factors related to the credit quality of commercial loans include the quality of the \nmanagement of the business and the borrower's ability both to properly evaluate changes in the supply and demand \ncharacteristics affecting our market for products and services and to effectively respond to those changes. Additional factors \nrelated to the credit quality of commercial real estate loans include tenant vacancy rates and the quality of management of the \nproperty.\nOur risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of our loans within specific industries and our \ncredit approval, review and administrative practices may not adequately reduce credit risk, and our credit administration \npersonnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting \ncustomers and the quality of the loan portfolio. A failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with our \nloan portfolio may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs, and may necessitate that we significantly \nincrease our allowance for credit losses, each of which could adversely affect our net income. As a result, our inability to \nsuccessfully manage credit risk could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan credit losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio and our \nearnings could decrease.\nOur experience in the banking industry indicates that some portion of our loans will not be fully repaid in a timely \nmanner or at all. Accordingly, we maintain an allowance for loan credit losses that represents management's judgment of \nexpected losses and risks inherent in our loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management's continuing \nevaluation of general economic conditions, diversification and seasoning of the loan portfolio, historic loss experience, \nidentified credit problems, delinquency levels and adequacy of collateral. The determination of the appropriate level of the \nallowance for loan credit losses is inherently highly subjective and requires us to make significant estimates of and \nassumptions regarding current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Inaccurate \nmanagement assumptions, deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing \nloans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to \nincrease our allowance for loan credit losses and additional expenses may be incurred. At any time, we are likely to have \nloans in our portfolio that will result in losses but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem credits. \nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to identify deteriorating credits before they become nonperforming assets or that we \nwill be able to limit or correctly estimate losses on those loans that are identified. In addition, our regulators, as an integral \npart of their periodic examination, review the adequacy of our allowance for loan credit losses and may direct us to make \nadditions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. \nChanges in economic conditions or individual business or personal circumstances affecting borrowers, new information \nregarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, \nmay require an increase in the allowance. Further, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed our estimation of charge-offs, \nwe may need additional provision for loan losses to restore the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required \nto materially increase our level of allowance for loan credit losses for any reason, such increases could have an adverse effect \non our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n29"

      "text": "Because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy \naffecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing certain of our loans and result in \nloan and other losses.\nReal estate values in many Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi markets have experienced periods of fluctuation over \nthe last several years, and the market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. At December 31, \n2022, $4.73 billion, or 66.7%, of our total LHFI was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary component of collateral. \nWe also make loans secured by real estate as a supplemental source of collateral. Adverse changes affecting real estate values \nand the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, \nand could result in losses that adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation. Negative changes in \nthe economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in our market areas could significantly impair the value of property \npledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. \nCollateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. \nSuch declines and losses could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If real \nestate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan credit losses, which \ncould have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe geographic concentration of our markets in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi makes us more sensitive than our more \ngeographically diversified competitors to adverse changes in the local economy.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, we are a regional bank concentrated in \nthe Interstate 20 Corridor between the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area, East Texas, North Louisiana and Jackson, \nMississippi, as well as in Houston, Texas. At December 31, 2022, 66.1% of our total loans (by dollar amount), excluding \nmortgage warehouse lines of credit, were made to borrowers who reside or conduct business in Texas, 20.5% attributable to \nLouisiana and 7.3% attributable to Mississippi, and substantially all of our real estate loans are secured by properties located \nin these states. A deterioration in local economic conditions or in the residential or commercial real estate markets could have \nan adverse effect on the quality of our portfolio, the demand for our products and services, the ability of borrowers to timely \nrepay loans, and the value of the collateral securing loans. If the population, employment or income growth in one of our \nmarkets is negative or slower than projected, income levels, deposits and real estate development could be adversely \nimpacted. Some of our larger competitors that are more geographically diverse may be better able to manage and mitigate \nrisks posed by adverse conditions impacting only local or regional markets.\nOur commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to risks that may be greater than the risks related to our other \nmortgage loans.\nOur loan portfolio includes non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for \nvarious purposes, which are secured by commercial properties, as well as real estate construction and development loans. At \nDecember 31, 2022, our non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $1.46 billion, or 20.6%, of our total loan \nportfolio. These loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the \nproperty securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely \naffected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose us to greater credit risk than loans \nsecured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be liquidated as easily as \nresidential real estate because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Additionally, non-owner-occupied \ncommercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. \nAccordingly, charge-offs on non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those \nincurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our commercial \nreal estate loan portfolio would require us to increase our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability, and \ncould materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n30"

      "text": "A large portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans secured by receivables, inventory, equipment or \nother commercial collateral, the deterioration in value of which could expose us to credit losses.\nAt December 31, 2022, approximately $2.05 billion, or 28.9%, of our total loans were commercial and industrial \nloans to businesses. In general, these loans are collateralized by general business assets, including, among other things, \naccounts receivable, inventory and equipment and many are backed by a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. \nThese commercial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individuals and, therefore, have the potential for larger \nlosses on a single loan basis. Additionally, the repayment of commercial loans is subject to the ongoing business operations \nof the borrower. The collateral securing such loans generally includes movable property, such as equipment and inventory, \nwhich may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate, exposing us to increased credit risk. In addition, a portion of our \ncustomer base, including customers in the energy and real estate business, may be exposed to volatile businesses or industries \nwhich are sensitive to commodity prices or market fluctuations, such as energy prices. Accordingly, negative changes in \ncommodity prices and real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of the collateral securing these loans. Significant \nadverse changes in the economy or local market conditions in which our commercial lending customers operate could cause \nrapid declines in loan collectability and the values associated with general business assets resulting in inadequate collateral \ncoverage that may expose us to credit losses and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of \noperations.\nOur loan portfolio contains a number of large loans to certain borrowers, and deterioration in the financial condition of \nthese borrowers could have a significant adverse impact on our asset quality.\nOur growth over the past several years has been partially attributable to our ability to originate and retain relatively \nlarge loans given our asset size. At December 31, 2022, the size of our average loan held for investment was approximately \n$523,987. Further, at December 31, 2022, our 20 largest borrowing relationships, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, \nrepresented 10.8% of our outstanding loan portfolio, and 12.1% of our total commitments to extend credit. Along with other \nrisks inherent in our loans, such as the deterioration of the underlying businesses or property securing these loans, the higher \naverage size of our loans presents a risk to our lending operations. If any of our largest borrowers become unable to repay \ntheir loan obligations as a result of economic or market conditions or personal circumstances, our nonperforming loans and \nour provision for loan losses could increase significantly, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have adversely impacted, and could \ncontinue to adversely impact, our business and results.\nOur business is dependent on the willingness and ability of our customers to conduct banking and other financial \ntransactions. The ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency caused significant disruption in the United States \nand international economies and financial markets and continues to cause illness, quarantines, reduced attendance at events \nand reduced travel, reduced commercial and financial activity, and overall economic and financial market instability.\nWhile the level of disruption caused by, and the economic impact of, COVID-19 has lessened in 2022, there is no \nassurance that the pandemic will not worsen again, included as a result of the emergence of new strains of the virus. Any \nworsening of the pandemic and its effects on the economy could further impact our business, our provision and allowance for \ncredit losses, and the value of certain assets that we carry on our consolidated balance sheets such as goodwill. Our \ncustomers, business partners, and third-party providers, including those who perform critical services for our business, may \nalso be adversely affected.\nWe rely heavily on our executive management team and other key employees, and the loss of any these individuals could \nadversely impact our business or reputation.\nOur success depends in large part on the performance of our key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract, \nmotivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees. Competition for employees \nis intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our \nbusiness plan may be lengthy. We may not be successful in retaining our key employees, and the unexpected loss of services \nof one or more of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our \nprimary markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. If the \nservices of any of our key personnel should become unavailable for any reason, we may not be able to identify and hire \nqualified persons on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition \nand results of operations.\n31"

This information includes non-public, personally-identifiable information that is \nprotected under applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, certain of our data processing functions are \nnot handled by us directly, but are outsourced to third-party providers. Our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party \nservice providers, may be vulnerable to threats to data security, security breaches, acts of vandalism and other physical \nsecurity threats, computer viruses or compromises, ransomware attacks, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human \nerrors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of \nour confidential business, employee or customer information, whether originating with us, our vendors or retail businesses, \ncould severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of civil litigation and liability, require the payment of regulatory \nfines or penalties or undertaking of costly remediation efforts with respect to third parties affected by a security breach, \ndisrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is difficult or impossible to defend against every risk being posed by changing technologies or criminals intent on \ncommitting cyber-crime. Our controls and protections and those of our vendors could prove inadequate. In the last few years, \nthere have been an increasing number of cyber incidents and cyber criminals continue to increase their sophistication, \nincluding several well-publicized cyber-attacks that targeted other companies in the United States, including financial \nservices companies much larger than us. These cyber incidents have been initiated from a variety of sources, including \nterrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. As technology advances, the ability to initiate transactions and access \ndata has also become more widely distributed among mobile devices, personal computers, automated teller machines, remote \ndeposit capture sites and similar access points, some of which are not controlled or secured by us. It is possible that we could \nhave exposure to liability and suffer losses as a result of a security breach or cyber-attack that occurred through no fault of \nour own. Further, the probability of a successful cyber-attack against us or one of our third-party services providers cannot be \npredicted.\nCyber-security risks appear to be growing and, as a result, the cyber-resilience of banking organizations is of \nincreased importance to federal and state banking agencies and other regulators. New or revised laws and regulations may \nsignificantly impact our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, the \ncollection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and employee information, and current or planned business \nactivities. For example, a final rule that the federal banking agencies issued in November 2021 requires banking \norganizations to notify their primary federal regulator of significant computer security incidents within 36 hours of \ndetermining that such an incident has occurred. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information \nsecurity laws to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to \nprovide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. \nOur ability to attract and retain profitable bankers is critical to the success of our business strategy.\nOur ability to retain and grow our loans, deposits and fee income depends upon the business generation capabilities, \nreputation and relationship management skills of our bankers. If we were to lose the services of any of our bankers, including \nprofitable bankers employed by banks that we may acquire, to a new or existing competitor or otherwise, we may not be able \nto retain valuable relationships and some of our customers could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our \nservices.\nOur growth strategy also relies on our ability to attract and retain additional profitable bankers. We may face \ndifficulties in recruiting and retaining bankers of our desired caliber, including as a result of competition from other financial \ninstitutions. In particular, many of our competitors are significantly larger with greater financial resources, and may be able to \noffer more attractive compensation packages and broader career opportunities. Additionally, we may incur significant \nexpenses and expend significant time and resources on training, integration and business development before we are able to \ndetermine whether a new banker will be profitable or effective. If we are unable to attract and retain profitable bankers, or if \nour bankers fail to meet our expectations in terms of customer relationships and profitability, we may be unable to execute \nour business strategy, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n32"

      "text": "The discontinuation of LIBOR could result in financial, operational, legal, reputational or compliance risks to us.\nOn March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, \nannounced that (i) 24 LIBOR settings would cease to exist immediately after December 31, 2021 (all seven euro LIBOR \nsettings; all seven Swiss franc LIBOR settings; the Spot Next, 1-week, 2-month, and 12-month Japanese yen LIBOR settings; \nthe overnight, 1-week, 2-month, and 12-month sterling LIBOR settings; and the 1-week and 2-month US dollar LIBOR \nsettings); (ii) the 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month US LIBOR settings would cease to exist after June 30, 2023; and \n(iii) the FCA would consult on whether the remaining nine LIBOR settings should continue to be published on a synthetic \nbasis for a certain period using the FCA’s proposed new powers that the UK government is legislating to grant to them. \nCentral banks and regulators in a number of major jurisdictions (for example, United States, United Kingdom, European \nUnion, Switzerland and Japan) have convened working groups to find, and implement the transition to, suitable replacements \nfor interbank offered rates. Regardless, the federal banking agencies issued guidance on November 30, 2020, encouraging \nbanks to (i) stop using LIBOR in new financial contracts no later than December 31, 2021; and (ii) either use a rate other than \nLIBOR or include clear language defining the alternative rate that will be applicable after LIBOR’s discontinuation. We \nsuspended the utilization of LIBOR as an index for new and renewed loans and instrument contracts as of December 31, \n2021.\nTo address the problem created by legacy financial contracts that incorporate LIBOR as their reference interest rate, \nbut extend beyond the date after which LIBOR will be published, on March 15, 2022, Congress enacted the Adjustable \nInterest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”).  On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule \nimplementing the LIBOR Act by adopting benchmark rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) that \nwill replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023.\nGiven LIBOR's extensive use across financial markets, the transition away from LIBOR presents various risks and \nchallenges to financial markets and institutions and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition \nand results of operations. Our commercial and consumer businesses issue, trade and hold various products that are currently \nindexed to LIBOR. Among other products, at December 31, 2022, we had approximately $1.07 billion of loans indexed to \nLIBOR. Our products that are indexed to LIBOR are significant, and if not sufficiently planned for, the discontinuation of \nLIBOR could result in financial, operational, legal, litigation, reputational or compliance risks to us.\nThe elimination of LIBOR or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR could \nhave an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, swaps and other financial \nobligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations. All our \nnotes contain fallback language that allows us to replace the index in the event LIBOR becomes unavailable, or \nunascertainable, ceases to be published or is otherwise unreliable. We determine the replacement index in our sole discretion \nand can include an effective adjustment to the spread. In addition, any inadequate fallback language may result in issues \nestablishing an alternative index and adjusting the margin as applicable. We continue to monitor this activity and evaluate the \nrelated risks. In addition, in light of the FCA's announced schedule for the cessation of LIBOR, we will continue to \nrenegotiate credit agreements executed prior to the addition of the LIBOR fallback language and extending beyond June 30, \n2023 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, in order to replace LIBOR with SOFR or another new \nstandard that is established, which may have an adverse effect on our overall financial condition or results of operations. \nFollowing the replacement of LIBOR, some or all of these credit agreements may bear interest at a lower interest rate, which \ncould have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nAlthough we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to \nadequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of \noperations. Any failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could also adversely impact our \nreputation.\n33"

In addition to our current regulatory requirements, \nbanks with $10 billion or more in total assets are, among other things: examined directly by the CFPB with respect to various \nfederal consumer financial laws; subject to limits on debit interchange fees pursuant to Section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Act, \nknown as the Durbin Amendment; eligible for potentially a smaller dividend on holdings of Federal Reserve Bank stock; \nsubject to the Volcker Rule’s limitations on proprietary trading and investments or sponsorship in covered funds; subject to \nthe large bank assessment methodology for calculating FDIC insurance premiums; and no longer eligible to elect to be \nsubject to the CBLR. Compliance with these additional ongoing requirements may necessitate additional personnel, the \ndesign and implementation of additional internal controls, or the incurrence of other significant expenses, among other things, \nany of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our \nregulators may also consider our preparation for compliance with these regulatory requirements in the course of examining \nour operations generally or when considering any request from us or the Bank.\nWe will become subject to reduced debit interchange income and could face related adverse business consequences if our \ntotal assets grow in excess of $10 billion as of December 31 of any calendar year.\nDebit card interchange fee restrictions set forth in the Durbin Amendment, as implemented by regulations of the \nFederal Reserve, cap the maximum debit interchange fee that a debit card issuer may receive per transaction. Debit card \nissuers with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from these interchange fee restrictions. The \nexemption for small issuers ceases to apply as of July 1 of the year following the calendar year in which the debit card issuer \nhas total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more at calendar year end. Any reduction in interchange income as a result of \nthe loss of the exemption for small issuers under the Durbin Amendment could have a significant adverse effect on our \nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Our interchange fees for the year ended December 31, 2022, were $7.7 \nmillion.\nMoreover, our loss of eligibility under the exemption for small issuers could adversely affect or reduce our ability to \nmaintain certain of our fee-sharing prepaid card partnerships, which have the right to terminate our agreement with respect to \ncertain financial services under such circumstances.\nWe may have exposure to tax liabilities that are larger than we anticipate.\nThe tax laws applicable to our business activities are subject to interpretation and may change over time. From time \nto time, legislative initiatives, such as corporate tax rate changes, which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely \naffect our deferred tax assets or our tax positions or liabilities, may be enacted. The taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in \nwhich we operate may challenge our tax positions, which could increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position \nand results of operations. In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than \nanticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or by changes in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. \nWe are subject to audit and review by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit \ncould have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our provision \nfor income taxes and other liabilities requires significant judgment by management. Although we believe that our estimates \nare reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business \ndevelopments, which may impair our borrowers' ability to repay loans.\nWe focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small to medium-sized businesses. Small to \nmedium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic \ndownturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in \noperating results, any of which may impair a borrower's ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and \nmedium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of \npeople, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have an adverse impact on the business \nand its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the markets in which we operate and small \nto medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise harmed by adverse business developments, \nthis, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n34"

Our competitors are generally larger and may have significantly \nmore resources, greater name recognition, and more extensive and established branch networks or geographic footprints than \nwe do. Because of their scale, many of these competitors can be more aggressive than we can on loan and deposit pricing. \nAlso, many of our nonbank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. We expect \ncompetition to continue to intensify due to financial institution consolidation; legislative, regulatory and technological \nchanges; and the emergence of alternative banking sources.\nOur ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n•\nour ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical \nstandards and safe, sound assets;\n•\nour scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n•\nthe rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n•\ncustomer satisfaction with our level of service;\n•\nour ability to expand our market position;\n•\nindustry and general economic trends; and\n•\nour ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology.\nIncreased competition could require us to increase the rates we pay on deposits or lower the rates we offer on loans, \nwhich could reduce our profitability.

Any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and \nresults of operations.\nWhile we carefully monitor internal and external developments for areas of potential reputational risk and have \nestablished governance structures to assist in evaluating such risks in our business practices and decisions, adverse \nreputational impacts on third parties with whom we have important relationships may also adversely impact our reputation. \nAdverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative \nscrutiny, which may lead to laws, regulations or regulatory actions that may change or constrain the manner in which we \nengage with our customers and the products and services we offer. Adverse reputational impacts or events may also increase \nour litigation risk. \nOur business faces increasing public scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") activities. \nWe risk damage to our brand and reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity, equity and \ninclusion (\"DEI\"), environmental stewardship, human capital management, support for our local communities, corporate \ngovernance and transparency, or fail to consider ESG factors in our business operations. Additionally, investors and \nshareholder advocates are placing ever increasing emphasis on how corporations address ESG issues in their business \nstrategy when making investment decisions and when developing their investment theses and proxy recommendations.

We face significant competition in pursuing acquisition \ntargets from other banks and financial institutions, many of which possess greater financial, human, technical and other \nresources than we do. Our ability to compete in acquiring target institutions will depend on our available financial resources \nto fund the acquisitions, including the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have and the liquidity and value of our \ncommon stock. In addition, increased competition may also drive up the acquisition consideration that we will be required to \npay in order to successfully capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities.\nAcquisitions of financial institutions also involve operational risks and uncertainties, such as unknown or contingent \nliabilities with no available manner of recourse, exposure to unexpected problems such as asset quality, the retention of key \nemployees and customers, and other issues that could negatively affect our business. We may not be able to complete future \nacquisitions after dedicating substantial resources or, if completed, we may not be able to successfully integrate the \noperations, technology platforms, management, products and services of the entities that we acquire or to realize our expected \nbenefits or our attempts to eliminate redundancies. The integration process may also require significant time and attention \nfrom our management that would otherwise be directed toward servicing existing business and developing new business. \nFailure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations in a timely manner may increase our \noperating costs significantly and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nFurther, acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution \nof our book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future acquisition, and the carrying \namount of any goodwill that we currently maintain or may acquire may be subject to impairment in future periods.\nThe markets in which we operate are susceptible to hurricanes and other natural disasters, adverse weather and climate \nchange effects, which could result in a disruption of our operations and increases in loan losses.\nA significant portion of our business is generated from markets that have been, and may continue to be, damaged by \nhurricanes, floods, tropical storms, tornadoes and other natural disasters and adverse weather, which may grow more severe \nas a result of climate change. Natural disasters can disrupt our operations, cause widespread property damage, and severely \ndepress the local economies in which we operate. If the economies in our primary markets experience an overall decline as a \nresult of a natural disaster, adverse weather, climate change or other disaster, demand for loans and our other products and \nservices could be reduced. In addition, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies and loan losses may increase \nsubstantially, as uninsured property losses or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair the ability of borrowers \nto repay their loans. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures the loans could be materially and \nadversely affected by a disaster. A disaster could, therefore, result in decreased revenue and loan losses that could have an \nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n37"

      "text": "We have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new \ntechnology, or we may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new \ntechnology-driven products and services and an established and growing demand for mobile and other phone and computer \nbanking applications. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs as \nwell as service our customers better. Largely unregulated “fintech” businesses have increased their participation in the \nlending and payments businesses, and have increased competition in these businesses. This trend is expected to continue for \nthe foreseeable future. Our future success will depend, at least in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers \nby using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create \nadditional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our products and service offerings. We may \nexperience operational challenges as we implement these new technology enhancements or products, which could result in us \nnot fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require us to incur significant costs to remedy any \nsuch challenges in a timely manner.\nThese changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate. Many of our larger competitors have \nsubstantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or \nsuperior products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. \nAccordingly, we may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to \nprovide such products and services. \nNew lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we implement new lines of business, or offer new products and product enhancements as well as \nnew services within our existing lines of business, and we will continue to do so in the future. There are substantial risks and \nuncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In \nimplementing, developing or marketing new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, we may invest \nsignificant time and resources, although we may not assign the appropriate level of resources or expertise necessary to make \nthese new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services successful or to realize their expected benefits. \nFurther, initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business, products, product enhancements or \nservices may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance \nwith regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the ultimate implementation of a \nnew line of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services. Furthermore, any new line of business, \nproduct, product enhancement or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal \ncontrols. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or \nofferings of new products, product enhancements or services could have an adverse impact on our business, financial \ncondition or results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the use of data and modeling in our management's decision-making and faulty data or modeling \napproaches could negatively impact our decision-making ability or possibly subject us to regulatory scrutiny in the future.\nThe use of statistical and quantitative models and other quantitative analyses is endemic to bank decision-making, \nand the employment of such analyses is becoming increasingly widespread in our operations. Liquidity stress testing, interest \nrate sensitivity analysis, and the identification of possible violations of anti-money laundering regulations are all examples of \nareas in which we are dependent on models and the data that underlies them. The use of statistical and quantitative models is \nalso becoming more prevalent in regulatory compliance. While we are not currently subject to annual Dodd-Frank Act stress \ntesting and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review submissions, we currently utilize stress testing for capital, credit \nand liquidity purposes and anticipate that model-derived testing may become more extensively implemented by regulators in \nthe future.\n38"

      "text": "We anticipate data-based modeling will penetrate further into bank decision-making, particularly risk management \nefforts, as the capacities developed to meet rigorous stress testing requirements are able to be employed more widely and in \ndiffering applications. While we believe these quantitative techniques and approaches improve our decision-making, they \nalso create the possibility that faulty data or flawed quantitative approaches could negatively impact our decision-making \nability or, if we become subject to regulatory stress-testing in the future, adverse regulatory scrutiny. We seek to mitigate this \nrisk by performing back-testing to analyze the accuracy of these techniques and approaches. Secondarily, because of the \ncomplexity inherent in these approaches, misunderstanding or misuse of their outputs could similarly result in suboptimal \ndecision-making. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our business, financial \ncondition or results of operations.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in some circumstances, which could diminish our liquidity.\nHistorically, we have originated mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market. When mortgage loans are sold in \nthe secondary market, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchasers about the \nmortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. The mortgage loan sale agreements require us to repurchase or \nsubstitute mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach these representations and warranties. In \naddition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage \nloan. With respect to loans that are originated by us through our broker or correspondents, the remedies available against the \noriginating broker or correspondent, if any, may not be as broad as the remedies available to a purchaser of mortgage loans \nagainst us or the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not have the financial capacity to perform remedies that \notherwise may be available. Therefore, if a purchaser enforces their remedies against us, we may not be able to recover losses \nfrom the originating broker or correspondent. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid \nclaims, it could diminish our liquidity, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of \noperations. We were not required to repurchase any material amount of mortgage loans sold into the secondary market during \n2022, 2021 or 2020.\nA lack of liquidity could impair our ability to fund operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business, and we monitor our liquidity and manage our liquidity risk at the holding \ncompany and bank levels daily. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and \nmaturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our \noperations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of our investment securities, the sale of loans, \nand other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds is deposits. \nDeposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If \nour customers move money out of deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, we would lose a \nrelatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income. \nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, \nand proceeds from the issuance and sale of our equity and debt securities to investors. Access to liquidity may be negatively \nimpacted by the value of our securities portfolio, if liquidity and/or business strategy necessitate the sales of securities in a \nloss position. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. We also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. \nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to \nus, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as \ndisruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. \nOur access to funding sources could also be affected by a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a \ndownturn in our primary market area or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against us. In addition, our access to \ndeposits may be affected by the liquidity and/or cash flow needs of depositors, which may be exacerbated in an inflationary, \nrecessionary, or elevated rate environment.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our \nexpenses, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which \ncould have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and could, in turn, have an adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition and results of operations. In addition, because our primary asset at the holding company level is the bank, our \nliquidity at the holding company level depends primarily on our receipt of dividends from the bank. If the bank is unable to \npay dividends to us for any reason, we may be unable to satisfy our holding company level obligations, which include \nfunding operating expenses and debt service obligations.\n39"

      "text": "We may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, we may not be able to \nmaintain regulatory compliance.\nWe face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. We may need to raise \nadditional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and \nbusiness needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. In addition, we, on a consolidated basis, and \nOrigin Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity in \nsuch amounts as the regulators may require from time to time. Importantly, regulatory capital requirements could increase \nfrom current levels, which could require us to raise additional capital or reduce our operations. Even if we satisfy all \napplicable regulatory capital minimums, our regulators could ask us to maintain capital levels which are significantly in \nexcess of those minimums. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic \nconditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions \nand governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will \nbe able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory \nrequirements, we could be subject to enforcement actions or other regulatory consequences, which could have an adverse \neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nBy engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to additional credit and market risk.\nWe use interest rate swaps to help manage our interest rate risk from recorded financial assets and liabilities when \nthey can be demonstrated to effectively hedge a designated asset or liability and the asset or liability exposes us to interest \nrate risk or risks inherent in customer related derivatives. We use other derivative financial instruments to help manage other \neconomic risks, such as liquidity and credit risk, including exposures that arise from business activities that result in the \nreceipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Our \nderivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected \ncash receipts principally related to our fixed rate loan assets. Hedging interest rate risk is a complex process, requiring \nsophisticated models and routine monitoring, and is not a perfect science. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged \nassets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in market value. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation \nwill generally be offset by income or loss on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. By \nengaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk \nexists to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. Market risk exists to the extent that interest rates change in ways \nthat are significantly different from what we expected when we entered into the derivative transaction. The transition away \nfrom LIBOR as the interest rate benchmark for derivatives, including interest rate swaps, also may present market risk. The \nexistence of credit and market risk associated with our derivative instruments could adversely affect our net interest income \nand, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control. \nAt December 31, 2022, the fair value of our portfolio of available for sale investment securities was approximately \n$1.64 billion, which included a net unrealized loss of approximately $203.5 million, before taxes. The decline in the fair \nvalue of our available for sale investment securities during the year ended December 31, 2022, negatively impacted total \nstockholders' equity, primarily due to the steepening of the short end of the yield curve that occurred during the first three \nquarters of 2022. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can \ncause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating \nagency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in \nmarket interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause an \nincrease in the amount of the allowance for credit losses as it pertains to available for sale or held-to-maturity debt securities, \nwhich could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects. The \nprocess for determining if a security has a credit loss often requires complex, subjective judgments about whether there has \nbeen a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer, whether management has the intent or ability to hold a \nsecurity for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value, the future financial performance and \nliquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security, and other relevant factors.\n40"

Our business \ndepends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and \nthird-party servicers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on \nwhich any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and \ntelecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand \nfor such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. In addition, we have engaged a \nthird-party to administer our mortgage servicing activities through a subservicing arrangement. While we endeavor to manage \nand oversee our third-party vendors, these vendors may have contact with our customers and address customer complaints, \nwhich creates reputational and, potentially, regulatory risk. Replacing vendors or addressing other issues with our third-party \nservice providers could entail significant delay and expense. If we are unable to efficiently replace ineffective service \nproviders, or if we experience a significant, sustained or repeated, system failure or service denial, it could compromise our \nability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and subject us to additional \nregulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nIn the course of our business, we may purchase real estate, or we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a \nresult, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a \ngovernmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by \nthese parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic \nsubstances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be \nsubstantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law \nclaims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. \nAny significant environmental liabilities could cause an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of \noperations.\nWe may be subject to claims and litigation pertaining to intellectual property.\nBanking and other financial services companies, such as ours, rely on technology companies to provide information \ntechnology products and services necessary to support their day-to-day operations. Technology companies frequently enter \ninto litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent \nholding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. Competitors of our vendors, or other \nindividuals or companies, may from time to time claim to hold intellectual property sold to us by our vendors. Such claims \nmay increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. The \nplaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by \npotential or actual litigants, we may have to engage in protracted litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time-\nconsuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. If we are found to infringe one or more patents or \nother intellectual property rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party. In certain cases, \nwe may consider entering into licensing agreements for disputed intellectual property, although no assurance can be given \nthat such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly \nincrease our operating expenses. If legal matters related to intellectual property claims were resolved against us or settled, we \ncould be required to make payments in amounts that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and \nresults of operations.\nWe and other financial institutions have been the subject of litigation, investigations and other proceedings which could \nresult in legal liability and damage to our reputation.\nWe and certain of our directors, officers and subsidiaries are named from time to time as defendants in litigation and \nare the subject of investigations and other proceedings relating to our business and activities.

These \nmatters could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, amendments and/or restatements of our \nSEC filings and/or financial statements, determinations of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures or \nother relief. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us, as well as matters in which we are involved \nthat are ultimately determined in our favor, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of \noperations, cause significant reputational harm to our business, divert management attention from the operation of our \nbusiness and/or result in additional litigation. \nBanking institutions are also increasingly the target of class action lawsuits. Most recently there has been an increase \nin class action lawsuits filed claiming deceptive practices or violations of account terms in connection with non-sufficient \nfunds or overdraft charges. In September 2021, we received a class action complaint alleging that we have improperly \ncharged and collected overdraft fees on debit card transaction that were allegedly authorized while the account was positive, \nbut settled when the account was negative or overdrafted. Similarly, in January 2023, we received a class action complaint \nalleging that we have improperly charged and collected non-sufficient funds fees on items re-presented for payment. We are \nvigorously defending these actions and monitoring activity with similar class action lawsuits. If a court rules adversely to our \ndefense of any class action lawsuits, or if we enter into a settlement agreement in connection with any class action lawsuit, \nwe could be exposed to monetary damages, reputational harm, or subject to limits on our ability to operate our business, \nwhich could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial \nsoundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, \ncounterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions \nwith counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and \nother financial intermediaries. In addition, we participate in loans originated by other institutions, and we participate in \nsyndicated transactions (including shared national credits) in which other lenders serve as the lead bank. As a result, defaults \nby, declines in the financial condition of, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions, financial \nservice companies or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity, asset quality or other \nproblems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. These problems, losses or defaults could have an \nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate \ngovernance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, \ncould subject us to regulatory action or penalties.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our \noperations. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect our stockholders. Rather, these laws and regulations are \nintended to protect customers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund and the overall financial stability of the U.S., and not \nstockholders or counterparties. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, \nimpose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividends or distributions that Origin Bank can \npay to us, and that we can pay to our stockholders, and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be \nmore restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than U.S. GAAP alone \nwould generally require. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and \nregulations often impose additional compliance costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the \nfailure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business \nactivities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of \nour securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive. All of these \nlaws and regulations, and the supervisory framework applicable to our industry, could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\") has also attracted interest from federal and state enforcement authorities, \noversight agencies, regulators and Congressional committees. State Attorneys General and other federal and state agencies \nmay assert that they are not subject to the provisions of the CARES Act and the PPP regulations entitling Origin Bank to rely \non borrower certifications, and they may take more aggressive actions against Origin Bank for alleged violations of the \nprovisions governing Origin Bank’s participation in the PPP.

If Origin Bank does not meet minimum capital \nrequirements, it will be subject to prompt corrective action by the Federal Reserve. Prompt corrective action can include \nprogressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions. Failure to exceed the capital \nconservation buffer will result in certain limitations on dividends, capital repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to \nexecutive officers. Even if we meet minimum capital requirements, it is possible that our regulators may ask us to raise \nadditional capital.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, USA Patriot Act of 2001 and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, \namong other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and \ncurrency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the Treasury \nto administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those \nrequirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal bank regulatory \nagencies, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. Federal \nbank regulatory agencies and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-\nmoney laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, \nincluding fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain \nregulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, which would negatively impact our business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nFailure by Origin Bank to perform satisfactorily on its Community Reinvestment Act (\"CRA\") evaluations could make it \nmore difficult for our business to grow.\nThe performance of a bank under the CRA, in meeting the credit needs of its community is a factor that must be \ntaken into consideration when the federal banking agencies evaluate applications related to mergers and acquisitions, as well \nas branch opening and relocations. If Origin Bank is unable to maintain at least a \"Satisfactory\" CRA rating, our ability to \ncomplete the acquisition of another financial institution or open a new branch will be adversely impacted. If Origin Bank \nreceived an overall CRA rating of less than \"Satisfactory\", the Federal Reserve would not re-evaluate its rating until its next \nCRA examination, which may not occur for several more years, and it is possible that a low CRA rating would not improve \nin the future.\nIncreases in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance premiums could adversely affect our earnings and results \nof operations.\nThe deposits of Origin Bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subject it to the payment of \nFDIC deposit insurance assessments. The bank's regular assessments are determined by the level of its assessment base and \nits risk classification, which is based on its regulatory capital levels and the level of supervisory concern that it poses. \nMoreover, the FDIC has the unilateral power to change deposit insurance assessment rates and the manner in which deposit \ninsurance is calculated and also to charge special assessments to FDIC-insured institutions. The FDIC utilized these powers \nduring the financial crisis for the purpose of restoring the reserve ratios of the Deposit Insurance Fund. Beginning in the first \nquarterly assessment period of 2023, the FDIC deposit insurance premiums were increased by two basis points. Any future \nspecial assessments, increases in assessment rates or premiums, or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could \nreduce our profitability or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, which could materially and adversely \naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n43"

However, we conduct all of our material business operations through our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Origin Bank, \nand the discussion and analysis that follows primarily relates to activities conducted at the Bank level.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and \nrelated notes contained in Item 8 of this report. To the extent that this discussion describes prior performance, the \ndescriptions relate only to the periods listed, which may not be indicative of our future financial outcomes. In addition to \nhistorical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions \nthat could cause results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are \ndiscussed in the sections titled \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\" We \nassume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nDiscussion in this Form 10-K includes results of operations and financial condition for 2022 and 2021 and year-\nover-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. For discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to \n2021 and 2020 and year-over-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020, please refer to “Management's Discussion and \nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the \nyear ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2022.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and with general practices within \nthe financial services industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that \naffect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical \nexperience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances. These \nassumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available \nfrom independent, objective sources. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Use of alternative assumptions may \nhave resulted in significantly different estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Please refer to Note 1 - \nSignificant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for a full discussion \nof our accounting policies, including estimates.\nWe have identified the following accounting estimates that, due to the difficult, subjective or complex judgments \nand assumptions inherent in those estimates and the potential sensitivity of the financial statements to those judgments and \nassumptions, are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the \njudgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate.\nAllowance for Loan Credit Losses. The allowance for loan credit losses represents the estimated losses for loans \naccounted for on an amortized cost basis. Expected losses are calculated using relevant information about past events, \nincluding historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of \nthe reported amount. We evaluate loans held for investment (\"LHFI\") on a pool basis with pools of loans characterized by \nloan type, collateral, industry, internal credit risk rating and FICO score. The amount of the allowance for loan credit losses is \naffected by loan charge-offs, which decrease the allowance, recoveries on loans previously charged off, which increase the \nallowance, as well as the provision for loan credit losses charged to income, which increases the allowance. In determining \nthe provision for loan credit losses, management monitors fluctuations in the allowance resulting from actual charge-offs and \nrecoveries and periodically reviews the size and composition of the loan portfolio in light of current and forecasted economic \nconditions. If actual losses exceed the amount of allowance for loan credit losses, it could materially and adversely affect our \nearnings. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more \ninformation becomes available. Credit losses are charged against the allowance for loan credit losses when management \nbelieves the loss is confirmed. \n49"

      "text": "Loan Acquisition Accounting.  We account for our mergers/acquisitions under Accounting Standards Codification \n(“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable \nassets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. The fair value for acquired loans at the time of acquisition or \nmerger is based on a variety of factors, including discounted expected cash flows, adjusted for estimated prepayments and \ncredit losses. In accordance with ASC 326, the fair value adjustment is recorded as premium or discount to the unpaid \nprincipal balance of each acquired loan. Loans that have been identified as having experienced a more-than-insignificant \ndeterioration in credit quality since origination is a purchase credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loan. The net premium or discount \non PCD loans is adjusted by the Company’s allowance for credit losses recorded at the time of merger/acquisition. The \nremaining net premium or discount is accreted or amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the \neffective interest rate method. The net premium or discount on loans that are not classified as PCD (“non-PCD”), that \nincludes credit and non-credit components, is accreted or amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan \nusing a constant yield method. We then record the necessary allowance for credit losses on the non-PCD loans through \nprovision for loan credit losses expense.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, U.S. federal regulatory authorities issued an interim final rule that provided banking \norganizations that adopted the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) methodology during the 2020 calendar year with the \noption to delay the regulatory capital impact for up to two years (beginning January 1, 2020), followed by a three-year \ntransition period. We elected to use the two-year delay of CECL’s impact on our regulatory capital (from January 1, 2020, \nthrough December 31, 2021), followed by the three-year transition period of CECL’s initial impact on our regulatory capital \n(from January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2024), and, accordingly, we began to amortize the CECL adoption impact to \nour regulatory capital beginning on January 1, 2022. The amount representing the CECL impact to the Company's regulatory \ncapital that will be ratably transitioning back into regulatory capital over the transition period is $5.1 million and $7.6 million \nat December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \nMortgage Servicing Rights. We recognize the rights to service mortgage loans based on the estimated fair value of \nthe Mortgage Servicing Right (\"MSR\") when loans are sold and the associated servicing rights are retained. We elected to \naccount for the MSR at fair value.\nThe fair value of the MSR is determined using a valuation model administered by a third-party that calculates the \npresent value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in \nestimating future net servicing income, including estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate, default rates, cost to service \n(including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income and other ancillary \nincome such as late fees. Management reviews all significant assumptions quarterly. Mortgage loan prepayment speeds, a key \nassumption in the model, is the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal. The \ndiscount rate used to determine the present value of estimated future net servicing income, another key assumption in the \nmodel, is an estimate of the rate of return investors in the market would require for an asset with similar risk. Both \nassumptions can, and generally will, change as market conditions and interest rates change.\nAn increase in either the prepayment speed or discount rate assumption will result in a decrease in the fair value of \nthe MSR, while a decrease in these assumptions will result in an increase in the fair value of the MSR. In recent years, there \nhave been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment speeds and discount rates. These fluctuations can be \nrapid and may continue to be significant. Therefore, estimating prepayment speed and/or discount rates within ranges that \nmarket participants would use in determining the fair value of the MSR requires significant management judgment.\nGeneral\nWe are a financial holding company headquartered in Ruston, Louisiana. Our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Origin \nBank, was founded in 1912 in Choudrant, Louisiana. Deeply rooted in our history is a culture committed to providing \npersonalized, relationship banking to businesses, municipalities, and personal clients to enrich the lives of the people in the \ncommunities we serve. We provide a broad range of financial services and currently operate 59 banking centers located in \nDallas/Fort Worth, East Texas, Houston, North Louisiana and Mississippi. As a financial holding company operating through \none segment, we generate the majority of our revenue from interest earned on loans and investments, service charges and fees \non deposit accounts.\n50"

      "text": "We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and noninterest expense, such as salaries and \nemployee benefits and occupancy expenses. We analyze our ability to maximize income generated from interest earning \nassets and expense of our liabilities through our net interest margin. Net interest margin is a ratio calculated as net interest \nincome divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-\nearning assets, such as loans, securities and interest-bearing cash, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as \ndeposits and borrowings. Net interest spread is the average yield on interest-earning assets minus the average rate on interest-\nbearing liabilities.\nChanges in market interest rates and the interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing \nliabilities, as well as in the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities and \nstockholders' equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net \ninterest income. Fluctuations in market interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, \ninflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international \nconditions and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets.

As a result of the merger, the Company \nacquired $1.24 billion in loans, net of fair value accounting adjustments, $456.8 million in investment securities and $1.57 \nbillion in deposits, which impacted most net interest income and interest expense categories.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $275.3 million, an increase of $59.0 million \ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Increases in interest rates and average interest-earning assets drove increases \nof $51.5 million and $33.5 million, respectively, in total interest income. The increase in total interest income was offset by a \n$25.9 million increase in interest expense; $22.5 million of the increase was driven by increases in interest rates. Purchase \naccounting accretion on acquired loans was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, with remaining purchase \naccounting net loan discounts totaling $2.2 million at December 31, 2022.

      "text": "Provision for Credit Losses\nWe recorded a provision for credit loss expense of $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a \n$35.5 million increase from a provision net benefit of $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was \nprimarily due to the merger with BTH, which drove a $14.9 million provision for loan credit losses for the CECL requirement \non non-PCD loans. In addition, the total LHFI, excluding BTH loans and mortgage warehouse lines of credit, increased \n$978.6 million during the comparable periods. Net charge-offs were $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, \ncompared to $11.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, while the allowance for loan credit losses to \nnonperforming LHFI was 876.87% at December 31, 2022, compared to 259.35% at December 31, 2021, primarily driven by \na $15.0 million decrease in nonperforming LHFI at December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021, as well as the \n$22.6 million increase in the Company’s allowance for loan credit losses during the intervening period. While the majority of \nour credit metrics continue to improve, uncertainty remains due to risks related to continued inflation, economic recession \nconcerns, market interest rate increases, geopolitical risks, labor pressures, and continued global supply-chain disruptions.\nThe provision for credit losses, which includes the provisions for loan losses, off-balance sheet commitments and \ninvestment security credit losses, is based on management's assessment of the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses \n(\"ACL\") for loans, securities and our reserve for off-balance sheet lending commitments. Factors impacting the provision \ninclude inherent risk characteristics in our loan portfolio, the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs, both current \nand historic, local economic and credit conditions, the direction of the change in collateral values, reasonable and supportable \nforecasts, and the funding probability on unfunded lending commitments. The provision for credit losses is charged against \nearnings in order to maintain our allowance for credit losses, which reflects management's best estimate of life of loan credit \nlosses inherent in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date, investment security credit losses and our reserve for off-balance \nsheet lending commitments, which reflects management's best estimate of losses inherent in our legally binding lending-\nrelated commitments.

      "text": "Mortgage banking revenue. The $6.2 million decrease in mortgage banking revenue compared to the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021, was primarily due to a $9.8 million decrease in gain on sale of loans sold including MSR origination, \nprimarily due to a 44.9% reduction in origination volume, a 51.2% reduction in sales volume and a 13.5% reduction in sales \nmargin experienced during the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as a $2.0 million impairment on the held for sale \nGNMA MSR portfolio. The decreases were partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in mortgage held for sale and pipeline \nfair value adjustment. \nDuring the second half of 2022, the Company recognized an impairment of $2.0 million and entered into an \nagreement to sell its GNMA MSR portfolio, which met all final sale conditions in early 2023. The Company sold \napproximately $1.8 million in GNMA MSR, with no significant additional gain or loss realized, and derecognized the related \nGNMA repurchase asset and offsetting liability of $24.6 million in the first quarter of 2023.\nLimited partnership investment income. The $5.9 million decrease in limited partnership investment income during \nthe year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to a net $5.7 million \nvaluation increase in the limited partnership funds during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net $256,000 \nvaluation decrease recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOther income. The decrease in other noninterest income was primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining 62% \nequity interest in The Lincoln Agency in December 2021. The previously held 38% equity method investment in Lincoln \nAgency was remeasured to its fair value, resulting in recognition of a gain of $5.2 million in other noninterest income during \nthe year ended December 31, 2021.\nInsurance commission and fee income. The increase in insurance commission and fee income during the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily driven by $8.3 million of additional \ncontribution income as a result of the insurance acquisitions that occurred on December 31, 2021, which significantly \nexpanded the Company's insurance presence in the North Louisiana market.\nService charges and fees. The $2.6 million increase in service charges and fees income was primarily driven by \nincreases of $444,000, $321,000 and $606,000, excluding BTH service charges, in overdraft fee income, account analysis \nincome and debit interchange fees due to increases in debit card transactions, respectively. In total, BTH contributed \n$749,000 to the total service charges and fee income since the date of the merger.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents the significant components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 vs. 2021\n2021 vs. 2020\nNoninterest expense:\n2022\n2021\n2020\n$ Change\n% Change\n$ Change\n% Change\nSalaries and employee benefits\n$ \n118,971 \n$ \n93,026 \n$ \n91,105 $ \n25,945 \n 27.9 % $ \n1,921 \n 2.1 %\nOccupancy and equipment, net\n \n20,203 \n \n17,347 \n \n17,022  \n2,856 \n 16.5 \n \n325 \n 1.9 \nData processing\n \n10,456 \n \n9,117 \n \n8,321  \n1,339 \n 14.7 \n \n796 \n 9.6 \nOffice and operations\n \n8,120 \n \n6,399 \n \n5,624  \n1,721 \n 26.9 \n \n775 \n 13.8 \nLoan-related expenses\n \n6,097 \n \n7,688 \n \n6,316  \n(1,591) \n (20.7) \n \n1,372 \n 21.7 \nProfessional services\n \n3,813 \n \n3,644 \n \n3,975  \n169 \n 4.6 \n \n(331) \n (8.3) \nElectronic banking\n \n3,958 \n \n3,563 \n \n3,686  \n395 \n 11.1 \n \n(123) \n (3.3) \nAdvertising and marketing\n \n4,431 \n \n3,438 \n \n3,710  \n993 \n 28.9 \n \n(272) \n (7.3) \nFranchise tax expense\n \n3,582 \n \n2,538 \n \n2,186  \n1,044 \n 41.1 \n \n352 \n 16.1 \nRegulatory assessments\n \n3,547 \n \n2,904 \n \n3,826  \n643 \n 22.1 \n \n(922) \n (24.1) \nIntangible asset amortization\n \n5,488 \n \n844 \n \n1,060  \n4,644 \nN/M  \n(216) \n (20.4) \nCommunications\n \n1,246 \n \n1,574 \n \n1,767  \n(328) \n (20.8) \n \n(193) \n (10.9) \nMerger-related expense\n \n6,171 \n \n— \n \n—  \n6,171 \nN/A  \n— \n — \nOther expenses\n \n4,336 \n \n4,697 \n \n3,337  \n(361) \n (7.7) \n \n1,360 \n 40.8 \nTotal noninterest expense\n$ \n200,419 \n$ \n156,779 \n$ \n151,935 $ \n43,640 \n 27.8 \n$ \n4,844 \n 3.2 \n____________________________\nN/M = Not meaningful.\nN/A = Not applicable.\n57"

The increases \nwere partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in loan-related expenses.\nSalaries and employee benefits. The $25.9 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses was primarily \ndriven by an increase in full-time equivalent employees to 1,011 at December 31, 2022, from 776 at December 31, 2021, and \nreflected a $14.6 million increase in salary alone. \n•\nThe BTH merger contributed 114 of the new full time positions and $5.6 million to the salaries and \nemployee benefits expense increase.\n•\nThe insurance acquisition at December 31, 2021, contributed 34 new full time positions and $4.8 million to \nthe salaries and employee benefits expense increase.\n•\nIncentive compensation increased $5.7 million due to loan production exceeding performance goals. \n•\nAlso contributing to the increase was the impact of cost of living adjustments and annual raises made on \nMarch 1, 2022, and additional cost of living increases made in August 2022.\nMerger-related expense. The $6.2 million merger-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022, were \nassociated with the BTH merger that closed on August 1, 2022.\nIntangible asset amortization expense. The $4.6 million increase in intangible asset amortization expense was \nprimarily due to the core deposit intangible established in conjunction with the BTH merger, which contributed $3.4 million \nto the total increase. The insurance acquisition at December 31, 2021, contributed $1.4 million to the total increase for the \nrelationship-based and noncompete intangibles established in conjunction with the acquisition.\nOccupancy and equipment, net. The $2.9 million increase in occupancy and equipment expense was primarily due to \nthe BTH merger that closed on August 1, 2022, which contributed $1.6 million to the total increase. In addition, the rental \nexpense increased by $323,000 primarily due to one new banking center location which opened during the last quarter of \n2022, and total maintenance and repairs expense increased on property, furniture, fixtures and equipment by $296,000.\nOffice and operations. The increase in office and operations expense was primarily due to increases in business \ndevelopment costs and credit card reward expenses. \nLoan-related expenses. The decrease in loan-related expenses was primarily driven by a decrease of $1.2 million in \nloan-related legal fees, primarily due to our lower past due and nonperforming LHFI balances.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized income tax expense of $19.7 million, compared to $23.9 \nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our effective tax rate was 18.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022, \ncompared to 18.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The effective tax rate was lower for the year ended December 31, \n2021, compared to the rate for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the tax impact of the exercise of stock \noptions and vesting of stock awards during the year ended December 31, 2021. Offsetting the increase in the effective tax rate \nduring the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2021, was \nthe impact of merger-related expenses during 2022, which drove net income before income taxes down.\nOur effective income tax rates have differed from the applicable U.S. statutory rates of 21% at December 31, 2022 \nand 2021, due to the effect of tax-exempt income from securities, low-income housing and qualified school construction bond \ntax credits, tax-exempt income from life insurance policies and income tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. \nBecause of these items, we expect our effective income tax rate to continue to remain below the applicable U.S. statutory \nrate. These tax-exempt items can have a larger than proportional effect on the effective income tax rate as net income \ndecreases. Any increases to the statutory tax rate would increase income taxes in the future.\n58"

      "text": "Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021\nGeneral\nThe merger with BTH affected most material financial metrics of the Company at December 31, 2022. Total assets \nincreased by $1.82 billion, or 23.2%, to $9.69 billion at December 31, 2022, from $7.86 billion at December 31, 2021. The \nincrease in total assets is primarily due to $1.85 billion in total assets, net of purchase accounting adjustments, acquired from \nthe merger with BTH, which included $1.24 billion in loan balances, net of purchase accounting adjustments. Organic loan \ngrowth contributed an additional $619.2 million increase in our loan portfolio balances which grew to $7.09 billion at \nDecember 31, 2022, from $5.23 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total assets was offset by a $346.6 million \ndecrease in cash and cash equivalents to $359.0 million at December 31, 2022, from $705.6 million at December 31, 2021. \nTotal deposits increased $1.21 billion to $7.78 billion at December 31, 2022, from $6.57 billion at December 31, \n2021. The increase in deposits was due to the assumption of $1.57 billion in deposits, net of purchase accounting \nadjustments, from the BTH merger. Excluding the deposits acquired in the BTH merger at August 1, 2022, total deposit \nbalances decreased by $361.5 million, or 5.5%, with the remaining BTH-originated deposits totaling $1.45 billion at \nDecember 31, 2022. Overall, higher rates of inflation tend to cause individuals and businesses to hold fewer liquid assets \nthereby contributing to tightening liquidity.\nStockholders’ equity increased $219.7 million to $949.9 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $730.2 million \nat December 31, 2021. The increase in stockholders’ equity is primarily associated with the $306.3 million in consideration \npaid related to the BTH merger and the $87.7 million in net income for the year ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by \nthe $165.6 million in other comprehensive loss and the $15.9 million of stockholder dividends declared in 2022.\nLoan Portfolio\nOur loan portfolio is our largest category of interest-earning assets, and interest income earned on our loan portfolio \nis our primary source of income. At December 31, 2022, 78.8% of the loan portfolio held for investment was comprised of \ncommercial and industrial loans, including mortgage warehouse lines of credit, commercial real estate and construction/land/\nland development loans, which were primarily originated within our market areas of Texas, North Louisiana, and Mississippi, \ncompared to 82.3% at December 31, 2021.\nThe following table presents the ending balance of our loan portfolio held for investment at the dates indicated.\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\n2022 vs. 2021\nReal estate:\nAmount\nPercent\nAmount\nPercent\n$ Change\n% Change\nCommercial real estate\n$ 2,304,678 \n 32.6 % $ 1,693,512 \n 32.4 % $ \n611,166 \n 36.1 %\nConstruction/land/land development\n \n945,625 \n 13.3 \n \n530,083 \n 10.1 \n \n415,542 \n 78.4 \nResidential real estate\n \n1,477,538 \n 20.8 \n \n909,739 \n 17.4 \n \n567,799 \n 62.4 \nTotal real estate\n \n4,727,841 \n 66.7 \n \n3,133,334 \n 59.9 \n \n1,594,507 \n 50.9 \nCommercial and industrial total\n \n2,051,161 \n 28.9 \n \n1,454,235 \n 27.8 \n \n596,926 \n 41.0 \nMortgage warehouse lines of credit\n \n284,867 \n 4.0 \n \n627,078 \n 12.0 \n \n(342,211) \n (54.6) \nConsumer\n \n26,153 \n 0.4 \n \n16,684 \n 0.3 \n \n9,469 \n 56.8 \nTotal LHFI\n$ 7,090,022 \n 100.0 % $ 5,231,331 \n 100.0 % $ 1,858,691 \n 35.5 \nAt December 31, 2022, total LHFI were $7.09 billion, an increase of $1.86 billion, or 35.5%, compared to $5.23 \nbillion at December 31, 2021.

Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status even if the contractual \npayments are not past due if information becomes available that causes substantial doubt about the borrower's ability to meet \nthe contractual obligations of the loan. When accrual of interest is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Past \ndue status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized to the extent \ncash payments are received, but payments received are usually applied to principal. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual \nstatus when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably \nassured. If a loan is determined by management to be uncollectible, regardless of size, the portion of the loan determined to \nbe uncollectible is then charged to the allowance for loan credit losses.\nPurchased loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are purchase \ncredit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans. The Company evaluates acquired loans for deterioration in credit quality based on any of, \nbut not limited to, the following: (1) nonaccrual status; (2) troubled debt restructured designation; (3) risk ratings of special \nmention, substandard or doubtful; (4) watchlist credits; and (5) delinquency status, including loans that are current on merger/\nacquisition date, but had been previously delinquent two times 60 days. An allowance for credit losses is determined using \nthe same methodology as other individually evaluated loans. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are \nrecorded through the provision for credit losses. We held approximately $48.1 million of unpaid principal balance PCD loans \nat December 31, 2022, and no PCD loans at December 31, 2021.\nWe manage the quality of our lending portfolio in part through a disciplined underwriting policy and through \ncontinual monitoring of loan performance and borrowers' financial condition. There can be no assurance, however, that our \nloan portfolio will not become subject to losses due to declines in economic conditions or deterioration in the financial \ncondition of our borrowers.\n60"

      "text": "Potential Problem Loans\nFrom a credit risk standpoint, we classify loans using risk grades which fall into one of five categories: pass, special \nmention, substandard, doubtful or loss. The classifications of loans reflect a judgment about the risks of default and loss \nassociated with the loan. We review the ratings on loans and adjust them to reflect the degree of risk and loss that is felt to be \ninherent or expected in each loan. The methodology is structured so that reserve allocations are increased in accordance with \ndeterioration in credit quality (and a corresponding increase in risk and loss) or decreased in accordance with improvement in \ncredit quality (and a corresponding decrease in risk and loss). Loans rated special mention reflect borrowers who exhibit \ncredit weaknesses or downward trends deserving close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in \ndeterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the bank's credit position at some future date. While potentially \nweak these borrowers currently do not pose sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Loans rated substandard are those \nborrowers with deteriorating trends and well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the orderly liquidation of debt. A \nsubstandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral \npledged, if any. Normal repayment from the borrower might be in jeopardy.\nLoans rated as doubtful have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the \nweaknesses make collection or liquidation in full questionable, and there is a high probability of loss based on currently \nexisting facts, conditions and values. Loans classified as loss are charged-off and we have low expectations for the recovery \nof any payments in respect to loans rated as loss. Information regarding the internal risk ratings of our loans at December 31, \n2022, is included in Note 5 - Loans to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nAllowance for Loan Credit Losses\nThe allowance for loan credit losses represents the estimated losses for loans accounted for on an amortized cost \nbasis. Expected losses are calculated using relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current \nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. We evaluate LHFI \non a pool basis with pools of loans characterized by loan type, collateral, industry, internal credit risk rating and FICO score. \nWe applied a probability of default, loss given default loss methodology to the loan pools at December 31, 2022. Historical \nloss rates for each pool are calculated based on charge-off and recovery data beginning with the second quarter of 2012. \nThese loss rates are adjusted for the effects of certain economic variables forecast over a one-year period, particularly for \ndifferences between current period conditions and the conditions existing during the historical loss period. Subsequent to the \nforecast effects, historical loss rates are used to estimate losses over the estimated remaining lives of the loans. The estimated \nremaining lives consist of the contractual lives, adjusted for estimated prepayments. Loans that exhibit characteristics \ndifferent from their pool characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Certain of these loans are considered to be \ncollateral dependent, with the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. For these loans, the fair value of collateral practical \nexpedient is elected whereby the allowance is calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost exceeds the fair value of \ncollateral, less costs to sell (if applicable). Those individual loans that are not collateral dependent are evaluated based on a \ndiscounted cash flow methodology.\nThe amount of the allowance for loan credit losses is affected by loan charge-offs, which decrease the allowance, \nrecoveries on loans previously charged off, which increase the allowance, as well as the provision for loan credit losses \ncharged to income, which increases the allowance. In determining the provision for loan credit losses, management monitors \nfluctuations in the allowance resulting from actual charge-offs and recoveries and periodically reviews the size and \ncomposition of the loan portfolio in light of current and forecasted economic conditions. If actual losses exceed the amount of \nthe allowance for loan credit losses, it would materially and adversely affect our earnings.\nAcquisition Accounting and Acquired Loans. We account for our mergers/acquisitions under Financial Accounting \nStandards Board (\"FASB\") ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of \naccounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. In accordance with ASC 326, we \nrecord a discount or premium, and also an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. All purchased loans are recorded at \nfair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. The \nfair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of \nundiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nPurchased loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are PCD loans. \nAn allowance for loan credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other individually evaluated loans. The sum \nof the loan’s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between \nthe initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a non-credit discount or premium, which is amortized or \naccreted into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for loan credit losses are recorded \nthrough the provision for credit losses.\n62"

      "text": "As a general rule, when it becomes evident that the full principal and accrued interest of a loan may not be collected, \nor at 90 days past due, we will reflect that loan as nonperforming. It will remain nonperforming until it performs in a manner \nthat it is reasonable to expect that we will collect principal and accrued interest in full. When the amount or likelihood of a \nloss on a loan has been confirmed, a charge-off will be taken in the period it is determined.\nWe establish general allocations for each major loan category and credit quality. The general allocation is based, in \npart, on historical charge-off experience and loss given default methodology, derived from our internal risk rating process. \nOther adjustments may be made to the allowance for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external influences on \ncredit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data. We give consideration to trends, changes in \nloan mix, delinquencies, prior losses, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other related information.\nIn connection with the review of our loan portfolio, we consider risk elements attributable to particular loan types or \ncategories in assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements we consider include:\n•\nfor commercial real estate loans, the debt service coverage ratio, operating results of the owner in the case of \nowner-occupied properties, the loan to value ratio, the age and condition of the collateral and the volatility of \nincome, property value and future operating results typical of properties of that type;\n•\nfor construction, land and land development loans, the perceived feasibility of the project, including the ability \nto sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or the ability to lease property constructed for \nlease, the quality and nature of contracts for presale or prelease, if any, experience and ability of the developer \nand loan to value ratio;\n•\nfor residential mortgage loans, the borrower's ability to repay the loan, including a consideration of the debt to \nincome ratio and employment and income stability, the loan-to-value ratio, and the age, condition and \nmarketability of the collateral; and\n•\nfor commercial and industrial loans, the debt service coverage ratio (income from the business in excess of \noperating expenses compared to loan repayment requirements), the operating results of the commercial, \nindustrial or professional enterprise, the borrower's business, professional and financial ability and expertise, the \nspecific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for businesses in that category and the value, \nnature and marketability of collateral.\nOverall, absent the impact of the BTH merger, most credit metrics improved at December 31, 2022, compared to \nDecember 31, 2021. The impact of the BTH merger on loans at December 31, 2022, was as follows: provision of \n$23.9 million, classified loans of $17.8 million, past due loans of $6.0 million, and nonperforming LHFI of $2.6 million. \nThe allowance for loan credit losses to nonperforming LHFI increased to 876.87% at December 31, 2022, compared \nto 259.35% at December 31, 2021, primarily driven by a $15.0 million decrease in nonperforming LHFI at December 31, \n2022, compared to December 31, 2021, as well as the $22.6 million increase in the allowance for loan credit losses during the \nintervening period, which was predominately driven by the BTH merger.

Mortgage-backed \nsecurities and collateralized mortgage obligations are typically issued with stated principal amounts and are backed by pools \nof mortgage loans and other loans with varying maturities. The term of the underlying mortgages and loans may vary \nsignificantly due to the ability of a borrower to prepay outstanding amounts. Monthly pay downs on mortgage-backed \nsecurities tend to cause the average life of the securities to be much different from the stated contractual maturity. During a \nperiod of increasing interest rates, fixed rate mortgage-backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of \nprincipal, and, consequently, the average life of this security is typically lengthened. If interest rates begin to fall, \nprepayments may increase, thereby shortening the estimated average life of these securities.\nOther than securities issued by government agencies or government sponsored enterprises, we did not own securities \nof any one issuer for which aggregate cost exceeded 10.0% of consolidated stockholders' equity at December 31, 2022 or \n2021. Additionally, we do not hold any Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac preferred stock, collateralized debt obligations, \nstructured investment vehicles or second lien elements in the investment portfolio, nor does the investment portfolio contain \nany securities that are directly backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages.\n66"

These BTH repurchase agreements \nwere restructured and integrated into the Company's repurchase agreements which include the sale and repurchase of \ninvestment securities and mature on a daily basis.

The BTH Notes are intended to \nqualify for Tier 2 capital treatment and are substantively identical in terms and conditions, including priority, except for the \nmaturity dates and interest rates payable on the notes. Interest is payable on the BTH Notes quarterly, and the principal \namount of each BTH Note is payable at maturity. After the five-year anniversary of issuance, the Company can redeem the \nBTH Notes in part or in full at the Company’s discretion and, if applicable, subject to receipt of any required regulatory \napprovals. In addition, the BTH Notes can be redeemed at any time without penalty, upon not less than ten days’ notice, in \nthe event that (i) the BTH Notes no longer qualify as Tier 2 capital as a result of any amendment or change in interpretation \nor application of laws or regulation that becomes effective after the date of issuance of the BTH Notes, (ii) a tax event, or (iii) \ninvestment company act event, as defined in the BTH Notes. The BTH Notes are unsecured and rank senior to the \nCompany’s common stock, any preferred stock that may be issued, and the BTH TruPS (defined below). \nIn February 2020, Origin Bank completed an offering of $70.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% \nfixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2030 (the “4.25% Notes”) to certain investors in a transaction exempt from \nregistration under Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 4.25% Notes initially bear interest at a fixed \nannual rate of 4.25%, payable semi-annually in arrears, to but excluding February 15, 2025. From and including February 15, \n2025, to but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will equal the three-month LIBOR rate \n(provided that in the event the three-month LIBOR is less than zero, the three-month LIBOR will be deemed to be zero) plus \n282 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears, subject to customary fallback provision upon the discontinuation of LIBOR. \nOrigin Bank is entitled to redeem the 4.25% Notes, in whole or in part, on or after February 15, 2025, and to redeem the \n4.25% Notes at any time in whole upon certain other specified events. The 4.25% Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for \nregulatory capital purposes for Origin Bank.\nIn October 2020, the Company completed of an offering of $80.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.50% \nfixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2030 (the “4.50% Notes”). The 4.50% Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 4.50%, \npayable semi-annually in arrears, to but excluding November 1, 2025. From and including November 1, 2025, to but \nexcluding the maturity date or earlier redemption date, the 4.50% Notes bear a floating interest rate expected to equal the \nthree-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 432 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. The Company may \nredeem the 4.50% Notes at any time upon certain specified events or in whole or in part on or after November 1, 2025. The \n4.50% Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes for the Company and a portion of the proceeds was \ntransferred to Origin Bank during the fourth quarter of 2020, which qualifies as Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes \nfor the Bank. \nOn August 1, 2022, the Company assumed BTH's obligations with respect to $7.2 million in aggregate principal \namount of junior subordinated debentures issued to a statutory trust of BTH (\"BTH TruPS\"). The BTH TruPS and the \nCompany's two other wholly-owned, unconsolidated subsidiary grantor trusts were established for the purpose of issuing trust \npreferred securities. The trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions periodically at specified annual rates as \nprovided in each trust agreement. The trusts used the net proceeds from each of the offerings to purchase a like amount of \njunior subordinated debentures (the \"debentures\") of the Company.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our cash and liquid \nsecurities totaled 12.1% and 23.2% of total assets, respectively, providing liquidity to support our existing operations.\nThe Company, which is a separate legal entity apart from the Bank, must provide for its own liquidity, including to \nfund payment of any dividends that may be declared for our common stockholders and interest and principal on any \noutstanding debt or trust preferred securities incurred by the Company. The Company had available cash balances of $99.8 \nmillion and $28.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This cash is available for the general corporate \npurposes described above, as well as providing capital support to the Bank and financing potential future acquisitions. In \naddition, the Company has a line of credit under the terms of which the loan amount shall not exceed an aggregate principal \nbalance of $100 million, consisting of an initial $50 million extension of credit and any one or more potential incremental \nrevolving loan amounts that the lender may make in its sole discretion, up to an aggregate principal of $50 million, upon the \nrequest of the Company. See Note 12 - Borrowings to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report \nfor more information on the holding company line of credit.\nThere are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends under federal and state laws, regulations \nand policies. See \"Item 1. Business - Regulation and Supervision\" above for more information.\nCurrently, we believe we have sufficient liquidity from our available on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, \nhowever, should market conditions change, we may take action to enhance our financial flexibility.\nIn addition to cash generated from operations, we utilize a number of funding sources to manage our liquidity, \nincluding core deposits, investment securities, cash and cash equivalents, loan repayments, federal funds lines of credit \navailable from other financial institutions, as well as advances from the FHLB. We may also use the discount window at the \nFRB as a source of short-term funding.\nCore deposits, which are total deposits excluding time deposits greater than $250,000 and brokered deposits, are a \nmajor source of funds used to meet cash flow needs. Maintaining the ability to acquire these funds as needed in a variety of \nmarkets is the key to assuring our liquidity.\nThe investment portfolio is another source for meeting our liquidity needs. Monthly payments on mortgage-backed \nsecurities are used for short-term liquidity, and our investments are generally traded in active markets that offer a readily \navailable source of cash through sales, if needed. Securities in our investment portfolio are also used to secure certain deposit \ntypes, such as deposits from state and local municipalities, and can be pledged as collateral for other borrowing sources.\nOther sources available for meeting liquidity needs include long- and short-term advances from the FHLB, and \nfederal funds lines of credit. Long-term funds obtained from the FHLB are primarily used as an alternative source to fund \nlong-term growth of the balance sheet by supporting growth in loans and other long-term interest-earning assets. We typically \nrely on such funding when the cost of such borrowings compares favorably to the rates that we would be required to pay for \nother funding sources, including certain deposits. See Note 12 - Borrowings to our consolidated financial statements \ncontained in Item 8 of this report for additional borrowing capacity and outstanding advances at the FHLB.\nWe also had unsecured federal funds lines of credit available to us, with no amounts outstanding at either December \n31, 2022 or 2021. These lines of credit primarily provide short-term liquidity and in order to ensure availability of these \nfunds, we test these lines of credit at least annually. Interest is charged at the prevailing market rate on federal funds \npurchased and FHLB advances.\nAdditionally, we had the ability to borrow at the discount window of the FRB using our commercial and industrial \nloans as collateral. There were no borrowings against this line at December 31, 2022.\nIn the normal course of business as a financial services provider, we enter into various financial instruments, such as \ncertain contractual obligations and commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of our \ncustomers. These commitments are discussed in more detail in Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated \nfinancial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\n71"

Our financial management \npolicy provides management with guidelines for effective funds management and we have established a measurement system \nfor monitoring the net interest rate sensitivity position.\nFluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our \nassets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which \nhave a short-term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential for economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These \neconomic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The \nobjective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the consolidated balance sheets to minimize the \ninherent risk while at the same time maximizing income.\nWe manage exposure to interest rates by structuring the consolidated balance sheets in the ordinary course of \nbusiness. Additionally, from time to time, we enter into derivatives and futures contracts to mitigate interest rate risk from \nspecific transactions. Based on the nature of operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. We \nhave entered into interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk in limited circumstances, but it is not our policy to enter into \nsuch transactions on a regular basis.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Bank's Asset-Liability Management Committee in accordance \nwith policies approved by the Bank's board of directors. The committee formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of \ninterest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the committee considers the impact on earnings and \ncapital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business \nstrategies and other factors.\nThe committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate \nchanges, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, \ncommitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the committee reviews \nliquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. We employ \nmethodologies to manage interest rate risk, which includes an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and \ninterest-bearing liabilities, and an interest rate shock simulation model.\n73"

      "text": "We use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analyses to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest \nincome and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on other financial metrics. Contractual maturities \nand re-pricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model, as are prepayment assumptions, maturity data and call \noptions within the investment portfolio. The average life of non-maturity deposit accounts is based on our balance retention \nrates using a vintage study methodology. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain, and, as a result, the model cannot \nprecisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net \ninterest income. Actual results will differ from the model's simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of \ninterest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management \nstrategies.\nOn a quarterly basis, we run various simulation models, including a static balance sheet and a dynamic growth \nbalance sheet. These models test the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity from changes in market interest \nrates under various scenarios. Under the static model, rates are shocked instantaneously and ramped rates change over a \ntwelve-month and twenty-four-month horizon based upon parallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume \ninstantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. Additionally, we run a non-\nparallel simulation involving analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the shape of the yield curve. \nInternal policy regarding interest rate risk simulations currently specifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield \ncurve, estimated net interest income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than 8.0% for a \n100 basis point shift, 15.0% for a 200 basis point shift, 20.0% for a 300 basis point shift, and 25.0% for a 400 basis point \nshift. We continue to monitor our asset sensitivity and evaluate strategies to prevent being significantly impacted by future \nchanges in interest rates.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of an instantaneous, sustained simulated change in net interest income \nand fair value of equity over a 12-month horizon at the date indicated:\nDecember 31, 2022\nChange in Interest Rates (basis points)\n% Change in Net \nInterest Income\n% Change in Fair \nValue of Equity\n+400\n 14.2 %\n (3.5) %\n+300\n 10.6 \n (3.4) \n+200\n 7.1 \n (2.1) \n+100\n 3.6 \n (0.9) \nBase\n-100\n (2.3) \n 0.4 \n-200\n (6.7) \n (1.5) \n-300\n (15.5) \n (7.2) \nWe have found that, historically, interest rates on deposits change more slowly than changes in the discount and \nfederal funds rates. This assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap \nanalysis, meaning that process by which we measure the gap between interest rate sensitive assets versus interest rate \nsensitive liabilities. The assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot \nprecisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net \ninterest income. Actual results will differ from the model's simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of \ninterest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies.\nEconomic conditions and growth prospects are currently impacted by record inflation and recessionary concerns. \nIncreasing interest rates and rising building costs have caused some slowing in the single family housing market. \nFurthermore, worker shortages especially in the restaurant, hospitality and retail industries, combined with supply chain \ndisruptions impacting numerous industries, and inflationary conditions has had some impact on the level of economic growth. \nOngoing higher inflation levels and higher interest rates could have a negative impact on both our consumer and commercial \nborrowers.\n74"

During 2022, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds target rate range seven times \nfrom 25 to 450 basis points, which is the primary reason for the other comprehensive loss we have experienced during the \nyear ended December 31, 2022.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which presently \nrequires us to measure the majority of our financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars. \nChanges in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered.\nUnlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in \nnature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than the general level \nof inflation. However, inflation affects financial institutions by increasing their cost of goods and services purchased, as well \nas the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense, and similar items. Inflation and related increases in interest rates \ngenerally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings, and \nstockholders’ equity. In management’s opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial \ninstitution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in \nthe inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates \nare highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the \ninfluence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its \nagencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities.\nMarket Risk\nRegulators expect banks to transition away from the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as a \nreference rate. It is expected that the transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will continue to \noccur over the course of the next several months, ahead of the FCA's announced cessation of the remaining LIBOR settings \nby June 30, 2023.

      "text": "Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies \nNature of Operations. \nOrigin Bancorp, Inc. (\"Company\") is a financial holding company headquartered in \nRuston, Louisiana. The Company's wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Origin Bank (\"Bank\"), was founded in 1912 in \nChoudrant, Louisiana. Deeply rooted in Origin’s history is a culture committed to providing personalized, relationship \nbanking to businesses, municipalities, and personal clients to enrich the lives of the people in the communities it serves. \nOrigin provides a broad range of financial services and currently operates 59 banking centers located in Dallas/Fort Worth, \nEast Texas, Houston, North Louisiana and Mississippi. The Company principally operates in one business segment, \ncommunity banking.\nBasis of Presentation. \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all other \nentities in which Origin Bancorp, Inc. has a controlling financial interest, including the Bank, and Davison Insurance Agency, \nLLC (\"Davison Insurance\"), doing business as Lincoln Agency, LLC (the \"Lincoln Agency\"), Lincoln Agency \nTransportation Insurance, Pulley-White Insurance Agency (\"Pulley-White\"), Reeves, Coon & Funderburg, Simoneaux & \nWallace Agency and Thomas & Farr Agency. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in \nconsolidation. The Company's accounting and financial reporting policies conform, in all material respects, to accounting \nprinciples generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") and to general practices within the financial services \nindustry. The Company has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and/or disclosure through the date these \nconsolidated financial statements were issued.\nReclassifications. \nCertain amounts previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current \npresentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on prior year net income or stockholders' equity.\nVariable Interest Entities. \nThe Company determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity \nby first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") under U.S. GAAP. Voting \ninterest entities are entities in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself \nindependently and provides the equity holders with the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and \nthe right to make decisions about the entity's activities. The Company consolidates voting interest entities in which it has all, \nor at least a majority of, the voting interest. As defined in applicable accounting standards, VIEs are entities that lack one or \nmore of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A controlling financial interest in a VIE is present when an enterprise \nhas both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and an \nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The enterprise with \na controlling financial interest, known as the primary beneficiary, consolidates the VIE. The Company's wholly-owned \nsubsidiaries CTB Statutory Trust I, First Louisiana Statutory Trust I and BT Holdings Trust I are VIEs for which the \nCompany is not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the accounts of these trusts are not included in the Company's \nconsolidated financial statements.\nOperating Segments. \nOperating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial \ninformation is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker in deciding how to allocate \nresources and in assessing performance. The Bank is the only significant subsidiary upon which management makes \ndecisions regarding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Individual bank branches offer a group of similar \nservices, including commercial, real estate and consumer loans, time deposits, checking and savings accounts, all with similar \noperating and economic characteristics. While the chief operating decision-maker monitors the revenue streams of the various \nproducts and services, operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Company-wide basis. \nAccordingly, all of the community banking services and branch locations are considered by management to be aggregated \ninto one reportable operating segment, community banking.\nUse of Estimates. \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management \nto make estimates and assumptions based on available information that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements \nand disclosures provided, including the accompanying notes, and actual results could differ. Material estimates that are \nparticularly susceptible to change include the allowance for credit losses for loans and available for sale securities; fair value \nmeasurements of assets and liabilities; and income taxes. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects \nof revisions are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements in the period they are deemed necessary. While \nmanagement uses its best judgment, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n88"

      "text": "Cash and Cash Equivalents. \nFor purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers \nall cash on hand, demand deposits with other banks, federal funds sold and short-term interest-bearing cash items with an \noriginal maturity less than 90 days to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains deposits with other financial institutions \nin amounts that exceed federal deposit insurance coverage. Furthermore, federal funds sold are essentially uncollateralized \nloans to other financial institutions. Management regularly evaluates the credit risk associated with the counterparties to these \ntransactions and believes that the Company is not exposed to any significant credit risks on cash and cash equivalents.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company had cash collateral required to be held with counterparties on certain \nderivative transactions as discussed in Note 13 - Derivative Financial Instruments. \nSecurities. \nThe Company accounts for debt and equity securities as follows:\nAvailable for Sale (\"AFS\") - Debt securities that will be held for indefinite periods of time, including securities that \nmay be sold in response to changes in market interest or prepayment rates, needs for liquidity and changes in the availability \nof and the yield of alternative investments are classified as AFS. These assets are carried at fair value. Fair value is \ndetermined using published quotes. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on other methods \nincluding, but not limited to the discounting of cash flows. Unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities are excluded from \nearnings and reported net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income until realized. Please see the paragraphs \nunder Allowance for Credit Losses referenced below in this footnote for information on the allowance for credit losses \npertaining to AFS securities.\nHeld to Maturity (\"HTM\") - Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold until \nmaturity are classified as HTM and are carried at their remaining unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized premiums or \nunaccredited discounts. Please see the paragraphs under Allowance for Credit Losses referenced below in this footnote for \ninformation on the allowance for credit losses pertaining to HTM securities.\nSecurities Carried at Fair Value through Income - Debt securities for which the Company has elected the fair value \noption for accounting are classified as securities carried at fair value through income. Management has elected the fair value \noption for these items to offset the corresponding change in fair value of related interest rate swap agreements. Fair value is \ndetermined using discounted cash flows and credit quality indicators. Changes in fair value are reported through the \nconsolidated statements of income as a part of other noninterest income.\nInterest income on securities includes amortization of purchase premiums and discounts. Premiums and discounts on \nsecurities are generally amortized using the interest method with a constant effective yield without anticipating prepayments, \nexcept for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. Premiums on callable securities are amortized to \ntheir earliest call date. A security is placed on nonaccrual status if (i) principal or interest has been in default for a period of \n90 days or more or (ii) full payment of principal and interest is not expected. The Company has made a policy election to \nexclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis of debt securities and report accrued interest in other assets in the \nconsolidated balance sheets. Interest accrued but not received for a security placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against \ninterest income. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date, are derived from the amortized cost of the security \nsold and are determined using the specific identification method.\nNon-marketable Equity Securities Held in Other Financial Institutions.\nSecurities with limited marketability, \nsuch as stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (\"FRB\") or the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (\"FHLB\"), are \ncarried at cost, less impairment, if any. These investments in stock do not have readily determinable fair values. The \nCompany's remaining equity investments in other financial institutions, excluding FRB and FHLB, totaling $15.8 million and \n$15.7 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, qualify for the practicability exception under Accounting \nStandards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-01 due to having illiquid markets and are carried at cost, less impairment, plus or minus any \nobservable price changes. The carrying value of these securities was evaluated and was determined not to be impaired during \nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 .\nLoans Held for Sale. \nLoans held for sale include mortgage loans and are carried at fair value, with unrealized \ngains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of income. Please see Mortgage Servicing Rights and Transfers of \nFinancial Assets below for information on the GNMA repurchase asset which represents the difference between the total \nloans held for sale on the face of the consolidated balance sheet and the loans held for sale at fair value also shown on the \nface of the consolidated balance sheet.\nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n89"

      "text": "Forward commitments to sell mortgage loans are acquired to reduce market risk on mortgage loans in the process of \norigination and mortgage loans held for sale. The forward commitments acquired by the Company for mortgage loans in \nprocess of origination are mandatory forward commitments, and the Company is required to substitute another loan or to buy \nback the commitment if the original loan does not fund. Typically, the Company delivers the mortgage loans within a few \ndays after the loans are funded. These commitments are derivative instruments carried at fair value.\nGains and losses resulting from sales of mortgage loans are realized when the respective loans are sold to investors. \nGains and losses are determined by the difference between the selling price (including the fair value of any items such as \nmortgage servicing rights) and the carrying amount of the loans sold. Fees received from borrowers to guarantee the funding \nof mortgage loans held for sale are recognized as income or expense when the loans are sold or when it becomes evident that \nthe commitment will not be used.\nAcquisition Accounting and Acquired Loans. \nThe Company accounts for its mergers/acquisitions under \nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business \nCombinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including \nloans, are recorded at fair value. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records a discount or premium and also an \nallowance for credit losses on acquired loans. All purchased loans are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value \nmethodology prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. The fair value estimates associated with the \nloans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, \ninterest and other cash flows.\nPurchased loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are purchased \ncredit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans. The Company evaluates acquired loans for deterioration in credit quality based on any of, \nbut not limited to, the following: (1) non-accrual status; (2) troubled debt restructured designation; (3) risk ratings of special \nmention, substandard or doubtful; (4) watchlist credits; and (5) delinquency status, including loans that are current on merger/ \nacquisition date, but had been previously delinquent two times 60 days. An allowance for credit losses is determined using \nthe same methodology as other individually evaluated loans.\nThe Non-PCD model utilizes data from the Bank in order to determine the probability of default and loss given \ndefault to be used in the calculation. The initial allowance for credit losses, determined on a collective basis, is allocated to \nindividual loans. The sum of the loan’s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. \nThe difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a non-credit discount or premium, \nwhich is amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit \nlosses are recorded through the provision for credit losses.\nLoans. \nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or \npayoff, are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances adjusted for charge-offs, the allowance for credit losses, \nand any deferred fees or costs on originated loans. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan \norigination fees, and certain direct origination costs, are deferred and amortized as a yield adjustment over the lives of the \nrelated loans using the interest method. Late fees are recognized as income when earned, assuming collectability is \nreasonably assured.\nIn addition to loans issued in the normal course of business, the Company considers overdrafts on customer deposit \naccounts to be loans and classifies these overdrafts as loans in its consolidated balance sheets. \nLoans are placed on nonaccrual status when management believes that the borrower's financial condition, after \ngiving consideration to economic and business conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, \nor generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status even if the contractual \npayments are not past due if information becomes available that causes substantial doubt about the borrower's ability to meet \nthe contractual obligations of the loan. Loans are considered past due or delinquent when the contractual principal or interest \ndue in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement or any portion thereof remains unpaid after the due date of the \nscheduled payment. When accrual of interest is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Past due status is based \non contractual terms of the loan. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are \nreceived, but payments received are usually applied to principal. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status \nwhen contractual payments are less than 90 days past due, the customer has made required payments for at least six months, \nand the Company reasonably expects to collect all principal and interest. If a loan is determined by management to be \nuncollectible, regardless of size, the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectible is then charged to the allowance for \nloan credit losses.\nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n90"

      "text": "Allowance for Credit Losses. \nThe allowance for loan credit losses represents the estimated losses for financial \nassets accounted for on an amortized cost basis. Expected losses are calculated using relevant information about past events, \nincluding historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of \nthe reported amount. The Company evaluates loans held for investment (\"LHFI\") on a pool basis with pools of loans \ncharacterized by loan type, collateral, industry, internal credit risk rating and Fair Isaac Corporation (\"FICO\") score. \nHistorical loss rates for each pool are calculated based on charge-off and recovery data beginning with the second quarter of \n2012. These loss rates are adjusted for differences between current period conditions, including the economic forecast and the \nconditions existing during the historical loss period. Historical losses are additionally adjusted for the effects of certain \neconomic variables forecast over a one-year period. Subsequent to the forecast effects, historical loss rates are used to \nestimate losses over the estimated remaining lives of the loans. The estimated remaining lives consist of the contractual lives, \nadjusted for estimated prepayments. Loans that exhibit characteristics different from their pool characteristics are evaluated \non an individual basis. Certain of these loans are considered to be collateral dependent with the borrower experiencing \nfinancial difficulty. For these loans, the fair value of collateral practical expedient is elected whereby the allowance is \ncalculated as the amount by which the amortized cost exceeds the fair value of collateral, less costs to sell (if applicable). \nThose individual loans that are not collateral dependent are evaluated based on a discounted cash flow methodology. This \nevaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information \nbecomes available. Loans are charged off against the allowance for credit losses when management believes the loss is \nconfirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nDelinquency statistics are updated at least monthly and are the most meaningful indicator of the credit quality of \none-to-four single-family residential, home equity loans and lines of credit and other consumer loans. Internal risk ratings are \nconsidered the most meaningful indicator of credit quality for commercial and industrial, construction, and commercial real \nestate loans. Internal risk ratings are a key factor in identifying loans that are individually evaluated for impairment and \nimpact management's estimates of loss factors used in determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses. Internal risk \nratings are updated on a regular basis.\nTroubled debt restructurings (\"TDRs\") are loans for which the contractual terms on the loan have been modified and \nboth of the following conditions exist: (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) the restructuring \nconstitutes a concession. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, \nforgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. The Company assesses all loan \nmodifications to determine whether they constitute a TDR.\nThe allowance for off-balance sheet exposures was determined using the same methodology that is applied to LHFI. \nUtilization rates are determined based on historical usage.\nCredit losses related to available for sale debt securities are recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The \namount of the allowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. Discounted \ncash flow analysis is required for determining credit losses for available for sale securities. In determining whether or not a \ncredit loss exists, such factors as extent of the loss, adverse conditions related to the entity, industry or geographic region, \nsecurity structure, ratings and changes by a rating agency and past performance are considered. The length of time a security \nhas been in an unrealized loss position is not a factor in determining whether a credit loss exists.\nThe allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity securities is calculated using a probability of default, loss given \ndefault methodology. Credit losses are estimated over the lives of the securities using historical loss rates, adjusted for current \nconditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Third-party data is used for the historical loss rates and probability of \ndefault statistics. The forecast effect is applied over the estimated lives of the securities.\nPremises and Equipment, net. \nLand is carried at cost. Buildings and improvements are stated at cost less \naccumulated depreciation computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range \nfrom 35 to 39 years. Furniture, fixtures, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation computed using the \nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years.\n Leases.  \nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease assets are \nincluded in accrued interest receivable and other assets, operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other \nliabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to \nrecognize short-term lease assets and liabilities (less than a 12-month term) or immaterial equipment and server space leases \nin its consolidated balance sheets; instead, the Company recognizes the lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis \nover the life of the lease. The Company has no material finance leases.\nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n91"

      "text": "Right of use (\"ROU\") assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease \nliabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU lease assets and liabilities \nare recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. \nThe Company uses an estimated incremental collateralized borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the \nlease commencement date and gives consideration to the applicable FHLB borrowing rates, when determining the present \nvalue of lease payments.\nThe Company's lease terms include options to extend a lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will \nexercise that option. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees. All of the Company's \noperating long-term leases are real estate leases, which are accounted for as a single lease component.\nMortgage Servicing Rights and Transfers of Financial Assets.\nGains or losses on \"servicing-retained\" loan \nsale transactions generally include a component reflecting the differential between the contractual interest rate of the loan and \nthe interest rate to be received by the investor. The present value of the estimated future profit for servicing the loans is also \ntaken into account in determining the amount of gain or loss on the sale of these loans. For loans sold servicing-retained, the \nfair value of mortgage servicing rights is recorded as an asset, with their value estimated using a discounted cash flow \nmethodology to arrive at the present value of future expected earnings from the servicing of the loans. Significant model \ninputs include prepayment speeds, discount rates, and servicing costs. Servicing revenues are based on a contractual \npercentage of the outstanding principal or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned.\nLoans sold into the secondary market are considered transfers of financial assets. These transfers are accounted for \nas sales when control over the asset has been surrendered, which is deemed to have occurred when: an asset does not have \nany claims to it by the transferor or their creditors, including in bankruptcy or other receivership situations; the transferee \nobtains the unconditional right to pledge or exchange the asset; or the transfer does not include a repurchase provision above \nthe limited recourse provisions of these loan sales.\nGNMA optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans \nthat meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution provides servicing. At the servicer's option \nand without GNMA's prior authorization, the servicer may repurchase a delinquent loan for an amount equal to 100% of the \nremaining principal balance of the loan. This buy-back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria \nare met, at which time the option becomes unconditional. When a financial institution is deemed to have regained effective \ncontrol over these loans under the unconditional buy-back option, the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be \nincluded in the consolidated balance sheets as mortgage loans held for sale, regardless of whether the institution intends to \nexercise the buy-back option. These loans were recorded as mortgage loans held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value \nwith a corresponding liability in FHLB advances and other borrowings on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. \nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into a contract to sell substantially all of its \nGNMA mortgage servicing rights portfolio, recognized an impairment of $2.0 million, and met all final sale conditions in \nearly 2023. The sale was completed in February 2023. The Company sold approximately $1.8 million in GNMA mortgage \nservicing rights, representing $453.3 million in unpaid principal balances, with no significant additional gain or loss realized, \nand derecognized the related GNMA repurchase asset and offsetting liability of $24.6 million.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\nAll derivatives are recorded on the accompanying \nconsolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended \nuse of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge \naccounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives \ndesignated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment \nattributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and \nqualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, \nare considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss \nrecognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that \nare attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash \nflow hedge. During the term of a cash flow hedge contract, the effective portion of changes in fair value in the derivative \ninstrument are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives to which \nhedge accounting does not apply are recognized immediately in earnings.

Such assets are evaluated at least annually as to the \nrecoverability of their carrying value for potential impairment. In the quarter following the period in which identified \nintangible assets become fully amortized, the fully amortized balances are removed from the gross asset and accumulated \namortization amounts.\nOther Real Estate Owned. \nOther real estate owned (\"OREO\") represents properties acquired through \nforeclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure on loans on which the borrowers have defaulted as to payment of \nprincipal and interest. OREO also includes bank-owned real estate which the Company is no longer utilizing and intends to \nsell. These properties are initially recorded at fair value, less cost to sell, at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost \nbasis. Fair value is determined based on third-party appraisals. Any subsequent capital improvements that increase value are \nadded to the balance of the properties. Any valuation adjustments required at the date of transfer from loans to OREO are \ncharged to the allowance for credit losses. Any subsequent write-downs to reflect current fair value, or gains and losses on the \nsale of the properties are charged to noninterest income. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balance of OREO was \n$806,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, and included as a component of accrued interest receivable and other assets in the \naccompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nOvernight Repurchase Agreements with Depositors.\nThe Company enters into agreements under which it sells \nsecurities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities. Under these arrangements, the Company may \ntransfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates it to \nrepurchase the assets. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature on the banking day following that on \nwhich the investment was initially sold and are treated as collateralized financing transactions which are recorded at the \namounts at which the securities were sold plus accrued interest. Interest rates and maturity dates of the securities involved \nvary and are not intended to be matched with funds from customers.\nRevenue Recognition. \nIn general, for revenue not associated with financial instruments, guarantees and \nlease contracts, the Company applies the following steps when recognizing revenue from contracts with customers: (i) \nidentify the contract, (ii) identify the performance obligations, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the \ntransaction price to the performance obligations and (v) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied. Our \ncontracts with customers are generally short-term in nature, typically due within one year or less or cancellable by us or our \ncustomer upon a short notice period. Performance obligations for our customer contracts are generally satisfied at a single \npoint in time, typically when the transaction is complete, or over time. Descriptions of the Company's revenue generating \nactivities that are within the scope of the revenue recognition standard are described below.\nService charges and fees on deposit accounts\nService charges and fees on deposit accounts are primarily comprised of maintenance fees, service fees, \nstop payment and insufficient funds fees. The Company's performance obligation for service fees or other fees covering a \nperiod of time are generally satisfied, and related revenue recognized, over the period in which the service is provided. The \nCompany's performance obligations for transactional-based fees are generally satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a \npoint in time.\nInsurance commission and fee income\nThe Company earns commission income through production on behalf of insurance carriers and also earns \nfee income by providing complementary services such as collection of premiums. In most instances, the Company considers \nthe performance obligation to be complete at the time the service was rendered.\nCredit card interchange income\nThe Company records credit card interchange income at a point in time as card transactions occur. The \nCompany's performance obligation for these transactions is deemed to have occurred upon completion of each transaction. \nThe amounts are included as a component of other income in the consolidated statements of income.\nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n93"

The \ntransaction price is fixed, and on occasion the Company will finance a portion of the purchase price of the transferred asset.\nMortgage Banking Revenue.\nThis revenue category primarily reflects the Company's mortgage production, \nsales and mortgage servicing revenue, including fees and income derived from mortgages originated with the intent to sell; \nmortgage sales and servicing; and the impact of risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline and \nmortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\"). This revenue category also includes gains and losses on sales and changes in fair value \nfor mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell and measured at fair value under the fair value option. Changes in the fair \nvalue of MSRs are reported in mortgage banking revenue. Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in interest \nincome.\nIncome Taxes.\nIncome tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change \nin deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary \ndifferences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation \nallowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nA tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is \"more likely than not\" that the tax position would be sustained \nin a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax \nbenefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the \"more likely than \nnot\" test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company did not have any amount accrued with respect to uncertain income tax \npositions at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters as a component of noninterest \nexpense.

Federal income \ntax expense or benefit has been allocated to subsidiaries on a separate return basis.\nStock-Based Compensation.\nThe cost of employee services received in exchange for stock options, restricted \nstock and performance stock grants and/or units are measured using the fair value of the award on the grant date and is \nrecognized over the service period. \nOther Investments.\nThe Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies \n(\"LLCs\"), and other privately held companies using either the equity method of accounting or at amortized cost net of \nimpairments and observable price changes. The accounting treatment depends upon the Company's percentage ownership or \ndegree of management influence.\nUnder the equity method of accounting, the Company records its initial investment at cost. Subsequently, the \ncarrying amount of the investment is increased or decreased to reflect its share of income or loss of the investee. The \nCompany's recognition of earnings or losses from an equity method investment is based on its ownership percentage in the \ninvestee and the investee's earnings for the reporting period, and is recorded on a one-quarter lag.\nAll of the Company's investments in limited partnerships, LLCs, and other companies are privately held, and their \nfair values are not readily available. Management evaluates the investments in investees for impairment based on the \ninvestee's ability to generate cash through its operations or obtain alternative financing, and other subjective factors.

      "text": "Investments in Tax Credit Entities.\nAs part of its Community Reinvestment Act responsibilities and due to their \nfavorable economic characteristics, the Company invests in tax credit-motivated projects primarily in the markets it serves. \nThese projects are directed at tax credits issued under Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. The Company generates returns on \ntax credit motivated projects through the receipt of federal, and if applicable, state tax credits. The federal tax credits are \nrecorded as an offset to the income tax provision in the year that they are earned under federal income tax law – over 10 to 15 \nyears beginning in the year in which rental activity commences. These credits, if not used in the tax return for the year of \norigination, can be carried forward for 20 years.\nThe Company invests in a tax credit entity, usually an LLC, which owns the real estate. The Company receives a \nnonvoting interest in the entity that must be retained during the compliance period for the credits (15 years for Low-Income \nHousing Tax Credit programs). Control of the tax credit entity rests in the 0.1% interest general partner, who has the power \nand authority to make decisions that impact economic performance of the project and is required to oversee and manage the \nproject. Due to the lack of any voting, economic, or managerial control, and due to the contractual reduction in the \ninvestment, the Company accounts for its investment by amortizing the investment, beginning at the issuance of the \ncertificate of occupancy of the project, over the compliance period, as management believes any potential residual value in \nthe real estate will have limited value. Amortization is included as a component of income tax expense.\nThe Company has the risk of credit recapture if the project does not maintain compliance during the compliance \nperiod. No such events have occurred to date. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had investments in tax credit \nentities of $9.4 million and $11.1 million, respectively, which are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets in \nthe accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nEarnings Per Share.\nBasic and diluted earnings per common share are calculated using the treasury method, \nunder which basic earnings per share is calculated as net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares \noutstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of additional potential common shares \nissuable under stock options and restricted stock awards.\nDiluted income per common share considers common stock issuable under the assumed release of unvested \nrestricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance stock units, shares potentially issuable under the employee stock \npurchase plan, and the assumed exercise of stock options granted. The dilutive effect of share-based payment awards that are \nnot deemed to be participating securities is calculated using the treasury stock method, which assumes that the proceeds from \nexercise are used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Potentially dilutive common stock \nequivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share in periods in which the effect would be \nanti-dilutive.\nEffect of Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\nASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. ASU 2019-12 simplifies \nthe accounting for income taxes by eliminating some exceptions to the general approach in ASC 740, Income Taxes.

The Releases clearly define whether an acquired or disposed business subsidiary is significant; update, expand \nand eliminate certain disclosures; eliminate overlap with certain SEC and U.S.GAAP rules; and add a new subpart of \nRegulation S-K.

Specifically, rather than \napplying the recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs, an entity must apply the loan refinancing and restructuring \nguidance in paragraphs 310-20-35-9 through 35-11 to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a \ncontinuation of an existing loan. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update require that an entity disclose \ncurrent-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope \nof Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses—Measured at Amortized Cost.

The Board included a sunset provision within Topic 848 based on expectations of when the London \nInterbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) would cease being published. At the time that Update 2020-04 was issued, the UK Financial \nConduct Authority (FCA) had established its intent that it would no longer be necessary to persuade, or compel, banks to \nsubmit to LIBOR after December 31, 2021. As a result, the sunset provision was set for December 31, 2022 - 12 months after \nthe expected cessation date of all currencies and tenors of LIBOR. In March 2021, the FCA announced that the intended \ncessation date of the overnight 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month tenors of USD LIBOR would be June 30, 2023, which is beyond the \ncurrent sunset date of Topic 848.\nBecause the current relief in Topic 848 may not cover a period of time during which a significant number of \nmodifications may take place, the amendments in this Update defer the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to \nDecember 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848.

(“BTH”), a Texas corporation and \nthe registered bank holding company of BTH Bank, acquiring 100% of the voting equity interests of BTH. The Company \nissued 6,794,910 shares of its common stock, and all outstanding BTH common stock options were converted into options to \npurchase an aggregate of 611,676 shares of Origin common stock. Based on the closing price of the Company's common \nstock on July 29, 2022, of $43.07 per share, the aggregate consideration to be paid to holders of BTH common stock in \nconnection with the merger is valued at approximately $307.8 million. Goodwill of $94.5 million was recorded as a result of \nthe transaction. The merger added new markets for expansion and brings complementary businesses together to drive \nsynergies and growth, which are the factors that gave rise to the goodwill recorded. The goodwill will not be deductible for \ntax purposes. \nIncluding the effects of the known purchase accounting adjustments, as of the merger date, Origin had \napproximately $9.84 billion in assets, $6.77 billion in loans and $7.99 billion in deposits on a consolidated basis. Origin Bank \nand BTH Bank, N.A. operated as separate banking subsidiaries of the Company until the merger of the banks, which Origin \ncompleted on October 7, 2022, concurrently with the data processing conversion. BTH formerly operated its banking \nbusiness from 13 locations in East Texas, Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, each of which now operates as a banking location of \nOrigin Bank.\nThe purchase price allocation and certain fair value measurements remain preliminary due to the timing of the \nmerger. The Company will continue to review the estimated fair values of loans, deposits and intangible assets, and to \nevaluate the assumed tax positions and contingencies.\nThe Company has determined that the merger of the net assets of BTH constitutes a business combination as defined \nby the ASC Topic 805. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are presented at their fair values as required. \nFair values were determined based on the requirements of ASC Topic 820. In many cases, the determination of these fair \nvalues required management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other \nfuture events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. \nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n97"

      "text": "Loan Acquisition Accounting – The Company accounts for its acquisitions/mergers under ASC Topic 805, \nBusiness Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, \nincluding loans, are recorded at fair value. The fair value for acquired loans at the time of acquisition or merger is based on a \nvariety of factors, including discounted expected cash flows, adjusted for estimated prepayments and credit losses. In \naccordance with ASC 326, the fair value adjustment is recorded as premium or discount to the unpaid principal balance of \neach acquired loan. Loans that have been identified as having experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit \nquality since origination are PCD loans. The net premium or discount on PCD loans is adjusted by the Company’s allowance \nfor credit losses recorded at the time of merger/acquisition. The remaining net premium or discount is accreted or amortized \ninto interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the effective interest rate method. The net premium or discount \non loans that are not classified as PCD (“non-PCD”), that includes credit and non-credit components, is accreted or amortized \ninto interest income over the remaining life of the loan using a constant yield method. The Company then records the \nnecessary allowance for credit losses on the non-PCD loans through provision for credit losses expense.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company continued to analyze the valuations and accounting \nassociated with the acquired assets and assumed liabilities and received updated information resulting in the revised amounts \ndisplayed below.

Consideration is given to (1) the extent to which the fair value is less \nthan the cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company \nto retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.\nManagement does not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position and believes that it is \nmore likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The fair value is \nexpected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments \ndecline. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022, management believes that the unrealized losses detailed in the previous table are \ndue to noncredit-related factors, including changes in interest rates and other market conditions, and therefore no losses have \nbeen recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.\nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n103"

      "text": "The following is a summary description of the Company's internal risk ratings:\n•  Pass (1-6)\nLoans within this risk rating are further categorized as follows:\nMinimal risk (1)\nWell-collateralized by cash equivalent instruments held by the Banks.\nModerate risk (2)\nBorrowers with excellent asset quality and liquidity. Borrowers' capitalization and \nliquidity exceed industry norms. Borrowers in this category have significant levels of \nliquid assets and have a low level of leverage.\nBetter than average risk (3)\nBorrowers with strong financial strength and excellent liquidity that consistently \ndemonstrate strong operating performance. Borrowers in this category generally have a \nsizable net worth that can be converted into liquid assets within 12 months.\nAverage risk (4)\nBorrowers with sound credit quality and financial performance, including liquidity. \nBorrowers are supported by sufficient cash flow coverage generated through operations \nacross the full business cycle.\nMarginally acceptable risk (5) Loans generally meet minimum requirements for an acceptable loan in accordance with \nlending policy, but possess one or more attributes that cause the overall risk profile to \nbe higher than the majority of newly approved loans.\nWatch (6)\nA passing loan with one or more factors that identify a potential weakness in the overall \nability of the borrower to repay the loan. These weaknesses are generally mitigated by \nother factors that reduce the risk of delinquency or loss.\n•  Special Mention (7)\nThis grade is intended to be temporary and includes borrowers whose credit quality has \ndeteriorated and is at risk of further decline. \n•  Substandard (8)\nThis grade includes \"Substandard\" loans under regulatory guidelines. Substandard loans \nexhibit a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes debt repayment in accordance with \ncontractual agreements, even though the loan may be performing. These obligations are \ncharacterized by the distinct possibility that a loss may be incurred if these weaknesses \nare not corrected and repayment may be dependent upon collateral liquidation or \nsecondary source of repayment.\n•  Doubtful (9)\nThis grade includes \"Doubtful\" loans under regulatory guidelines. Such loans are placed \non nonaccrual status and repayment may be dependent upon collateral with no readily \ndeterminable valuation or valuations that are highly subjective in nature. Repayment for \nthese loans is considered improbable based on currently existing facts and \ncircumstances. \n•  Loss (0)\nThis grade includes \"Loss\" loans under regulatory guidelines. Loss loans are charged-\noff or written down when repayment is not expected.\nIn connection with the review of the loan portfolio, the Company considers risk elements attributable to particular \nloan types or categories in assessing the quality of individual loans. The list of loans to be reviewed for possible individual \nevaluation consists of nonaccrual commercial loans over $100,000 with direct exposure, unsecured loans over 90 days past \ndue, commercial loans classified substandard or worse over $100,000 with direct exposure, TDRs, consumer loans greater \nthan $100,000 with a FICO score under 625, loans greater than $100,000 in which the borrower has filed bankruptcy, and all \nloans 180 days or more past due. Loans under $50,000 will be evaluated collectively in designated pools unless a loss \nexposure has been identified. Some additional risk elements considered by loan type include:\n•\nfor commercial real estate loans, the debt service coverage ratio, operating results of the owner in the case of \nowner-occupied properties, the loan to value ratio, the age and condition of the collateral and the volatility of \nincome, property value and future operating results typical of properties of that type;\n•\nfor construction, land and land development loans, the perceived feasibility of the project, including the ability \nto sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or the ability to lease property constructed for \nlease, the quality and nature of contracts for presale or prelease, if any, experience and ability of the developer \nand loan to value ratio;\n•\nfor residential mortgage loans, the borrower's ability to repay the loan, including a consideration of the debt to \nincome ratio and employment and income stability, the loan-to-value ratio, and the age, condition and \nmarketability of the collateral; and\nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n106"

Qualitative factor changes across the Company's risk pools, which includes the impact of the BTH \nacquired loans, drove a $22.4 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease in provision expense during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December \n31, 2020, was primarily due to improvement in forecasted economic conditions during the year ended December 31, 2021, as \ncompared to continuing uncertainty related to ongoing economic impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic during the \nyear ended December 31, 2020. The Company's credit quality profile in relation to the allowance for loan credit losses drove \na decline of $25.1 million in the collectively evaluated portion of the reserve during the year ended December 31, 2021, of \nwhich a $19.6 million decrease was related to qualitative factor changes across the Company's risk pools for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021.

      "text": "There were no loans that defaulted during the year ended December 31, 2022, after having been modified as a TDR \nwithin the previous 12 months. During the year ended December 31, 2021, one loan with an outstanding principal balance of \n$9,000 defaulted after having been modified as a TDR within the previous 12 months. During the year ended December 31, \n2020, no loans defaulted after having been modified as a TDR within the previous 12 months. A payment default is defined \nas a loan that was 90 or more days past due. The Company monitors the performance of the modified loans to their \nrestructured terms on an ongoing basis. In the event of subsequent default, the allowance for loan credit losses continues to be \nreassessed on the basis of an individual evaluation of each loan. The modifications made during the periods presented did not \nsignificantly impact the Company's determination of the allowance for credit losses. \nNote 6 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is the exchange price that is expected to be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) \nin the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on \nthe measurement date. Certain assets and liabilities are recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements at fair \nvalue. Some are recorded on a recurring basis and some on a non-recurring basis.\nThe Company utilizes fair value measurement to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to \ndetermine fair value disclosures. The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates. \nIn cases where quoted market values in an active market are not available, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that are \nconsistent with the market approach, the income approach and/or the cost approach to estimate the fair values of its financial \ninstruments. Such valuation techniques are consistently applied.\nA hierarchy for fair value has been established, which categorizes the valuation techniques into three levels used to \nmeasure fair value. The three levels are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Fair value is based on significant other observable inputs that are generally determined based on a single \nprice for each financial instrument provided to the Company by an unrelated third-party pricing service and is based on one \nor more of the following:\n•\nQuoted prices for similar, but not identical, assets or liabilities in active markets;\n•\nQuoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;\n•\nInputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as interest rate and yield curves, \nvolatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and\n•\nOther inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market inputs.\nLevel 3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant and unobservable in the market. \nThese instruments are valued using the best information available, some of which is internally developed, and reflects the \nCompany's own assumptions about the risk premiums that market participants would generally require and the assumptions \nthey would use. These estimates can be inherently uncertain.\nThere were no transfers between fair value reporting levels for any period presented.\nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n116"

      "text": "Mortgage Servicing Rights (\"MSRs\")\nThe carrying amounts of the MSRs equal fair value, which are determined using a discounted cash flow valuation \nmodel. The significant assumptions used to value MSRs were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nRange\nWeighted \nAverage(1)\nRange\nWeighted \nAverage(1)\nPrepayment speeds\n7.65% - 9.20%\n 8.11 %\n9.10% - 36.51%\n 15.63 %\nDiscount rates\n9.50 - 22.07\n 12.55 \n8.89 - 10.39\n 9.32 \n__________________________\n(1)\nThe weighted average was calculated with reference to the principal balance of the underlying mortgages.\nIn recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in the assumptions listed above. Loans with \nhigher average coupon rates have a greater likelihood of prepayment during comparatively low interest rate environments, \nwhile loans with lower average coupon rates have a lower likelihood of prepayment. The increase in rates since the year \nended December 31, 2021, has caused a decrease in our weighted average prepayment speed and an increase in our discount \nrate assumptions used in the MSR valuation. These fluctuations can be rapid and may continue to be significant. Therefore, \nestimating these assumptions within ranges that market participants would use in determining the fair value of MSRs requires \nsignificant management judgment. \nDuring the second half of 2022, the Company recognized an impairment of $2.0 million and entered into an \nagreement to sell its GNMA MSR portfolio, which met all final sale conditions in early 2023. The Company sold \napproximately $1.8 million in GNMA MSR, with no significant additional gain or loss realized, and derecognized the related \nGNMA repurchase asset and offsetting liability of $24.6 million.\nDerivatives\nFair values for interest rate swap agreements and interest rate lock commitments are based upon the amounts that \nwould be required to settle the contracts. Fair values for risk participations, forward mortgage backed security purchases or \nloan sale commitments and future contracts to purchase United States treasury notes are based on the fair values of the \nunderlying mortgage loans or securities and the probability of such commitments being exercised. Significant management \njudgment and estimation is required in determining these fair value measurements.\nFair Values of Assets Recorded on a Recurring Basis for which the Fair Value Option has been Elected\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis due to the Company's election to adopt fair value \naccounting treatment for those assets.

Please see Note 10 - \nMortgage Banking for more detail.\nThe following methodologies were used to measure the fair value of financial assets valued on a recurring basis for \nwhich the fair value option was elected:\nSecurities at Fair Value through Income \nSecurities carried at fair value through income are valued using a discounted cash flow with a credit spread applied \nto each instrument based on the creditworthiness of each issuer. Credit spreads ranged from 83 to 227 basis points at both \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company believes the fair value approximates an exit price.\nLoans Held for Sale\nFair values for loans held for sale are established using anticipated sale prices for loans allocated to a sale \ncommitment, and those unallocated to a commitment are valued based on the interest rate and term for similar loans \nallocated. The Company believes the fair value approximates an exit price.\nFair Value of Assets Recorded on a Nonrecurring Basis\nEquity Securities without Readily Determinable Fair Values\nEquity securities without readily determinable fair values totaled $67.4 million and $45.2 million at December 31, \n2022 and 2021, respectively, and are shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheets. The majority of the Company's \nequity investments qualify for the practical expedient allowed for equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, \nsuch that the Company has elected to carry these securities at cost adjusted for any observable transactions during the period, \nless any impairment. To date, no impairment has been recorded on the Company's investments in equity securities that do not \nhave readily determinable fair values.\nGovernment National Mortgage Association Repurchase Asset\nThe Company recorded $24.6 million and $43.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, for \nGovernment National Mortgage Association (\"GNMA\") repurchase assets included in loans held for sale on the consolidated \nbalance sheets. The assets are valued at the lower of cost or market and, where market is lower than cost, valued using \nanticipated sale prices for loans allocated to a sale commitment, and those unallocated to a commitment are valued based on \nthe interest rate and term for similar loans allocated. The Company believes the fair value approximates an exit price. \nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n120"

      "text": "During the second half of 2022, the Company recognized an impairment of $2.0 million and entered into an \nagreement to sell its GNMA MSR portfolio, which met all final sale conditions in early 2023. The Company sold \napproximately $1.8 million in GNMA MSR, with no significant additional gain or loss realized, and derecognized the related \nGNMA repurchase asset and offsetting liability of $24.6 million.\nIndividually Evaluated Loans with Credit Losses \nLoans for which it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest due according to \ncontractual terms are measured to determine if any credit loss exists. Allowable methods for determining the amount of credit \nloss include estimating the fair value using the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent loans and a discounted cash \nflow methodology for other evaluated loans that are not collateral dependent. If the loan is identified as collateral-dependent, \nthe fair value method of measuring the amount of credit loss is utilized. Evaluating the fair value of the collateral for \ncollateral-dependent loans requires obtaining a current independent appraisal of the collateral and applying a discount factor \nto the value. If the loan is not collateral-dependent, the discounted cash flow method is utilized, which involves assumptions \nand judgments as to credit risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds, collateral values \nand discount rate. Loans that have experienced a credit loss with specific allocated losses are within Level 3 of the fair value \nhierarchy when the credit loss is determined using the fair value method. The fair value of loans that have experienced a \ncredit loss with specific allocated losses was approximately $20.7 million and $4.8 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively.\nNon-Financial Assets\nForeclosed assets held for sale are the only non-financial assets valued on a non-recurring basis that are initially \nrecorded by the Company at fair value, less estimated costs to sell. At foreclosure, if the fair value, less estimated costs to \nsell, of the real estate acquired is less than the Company's recorded investment in the related loan, a write-down is recognized \nthrough a charge to the allowance for loan credit losses. Additionally, valuations are periodically performed by management, \nand any subsequent reduction in value is recognized by a charge to income. The carrying value and fair value of foreclosed \nassets held for sale was estimated using Level 3 inputs based on observable market data and was $806,000 and $1.5 million at \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $10,000 and $5.9 million, \nrespectively, in principal amount of residential mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure.\nFair Values of Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value\nLoans\nThe estimated fair value approximates carrying value for variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no \nsignificant change in credit risk. The fair value of fixed rate loans and variable-rate loans, which reprice on an infrequent \nbasis, is estimated by discounting future cash flows using exit level pricing, which combines the current interest rates at \nwhich similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality and an estimated additional rate \nto reflect a liquidity premium. An overall valuation adjustment is made for specific credit risks as well as general portfolio \ncredit risk.\nDeposits \nThe estimated fair value approximates carrying value for demand deposits. The fair value of fixed rate deposit \nliabilities with defined maturities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the interest rates currently available for \nfunding from the FHLB. The estimated fair value of deposits does not take into account the value of our long-term \nrelationships with depositors, commonly known as core deposit intangibles, which are separate intangible assets, and not \nconsidered financial instruments. Nonetheless, the Company would likely realize a core deposit premium if the deposit \nportfolio were sold in the principal market for such deposits. \nBorrowed Funds \nThe estimated fair value approximates carrying value for short-term borrowings. The fair value of long-term fixed \nrate and fixed-to-floating-rate borrowings is estimated using quoted market prices, if available, or by discounting future cash \nflows using current interest rates for similar financial instruments. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for \nvariable-rate junior subordinated debentures that reprice quarterly.\nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n121"

The derivative instruments represented by these swap agreements are designated as cash flow \nhedges of the Company's forecasted variable cash flows under a variable-rate term borrowing agreements. During the terms \nof the swap agreements, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recorded in \naccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the periods that the hedged \nforecasted variable-rate interest payments affected earnings. There was no ineffective portion of the change in fair value of \nthe derivatives recognized directly in earnings. The entire swap fair value will be reclassified into earnings before the \nexpiration dates of the swap agreements.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedges\nCustomer interest rate derivative program\nThe Company offers certain derivatives products, primarily interest rate swaps, directly to qualified commercial \nbanking customers to facilitate their risk management strategies. In most instances, the Company acts only as an \nintermediary, simultaneously entering into offsetting agreements with unrelated financial institutions, thereby mitigating its \nnet risk exposure resulting from such transactions without significantly impacting its results of operations. Because the \ninterest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of \nboth the customer derivatives and any offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings as a component of noninterest \nincome.\nFrom time to time, the Company shares in credit risk on interest rate swap arrangements, by entering into risk \nparticipation agreements with syndication partners. These are accounted for at fair value and disclosed as risk participation \nderivatives.\nMortgage banking derivatives\nThe Company enters into certain derivative agreements as part of its mortgage banking and related risk management \nactivities. These agreements include interest rate lock commitments on prospective residential mortgage loans and forward \ncommitments to sell these loans to investors on a mandatory delivery basis. The Company also economically hedges the \nvalue of MSRs by entering into a series of commitments to purchase mortgage-backed securities in the future and U.S. \nTreasury future contracts.\nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n131"

Pursuant to the One-Time \nAward, the CEO RSUs shall vest in five approximately equal installments on each of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh \nanniversaries of the Grant Date, subject to Mr. Mills’ continued employment with the Company on each respective vesting \ndate, or upon the earlier occurrence of Mr. Mills’ death, disability, termination of employment without cause or resignation \nfor good reason. The CEO PSUs shall be eligible to vest based on achievement of five pre-established stock price hurdles \n(each, a “Stock Price Hurdle”) during a seven-year performance period (the “CEO Performance Period”). Achievement of \neach Stock Price Hurdle requires substantial and sustained growth in the Company’s stock price, with each Stock Price \nHurdle representing a twenty percent (20%) price appreciation over the 20-day average closing price of the Company’s \ncommon stock as of the Grant Date (such that 100% appreciation is required for 100% of the CEO PSUs to vest).

The ROAA Unit Group is based upon the Company's \nPerformance Period Return on Average Assets performance, and the ROAE Unit Group is based upon the Company's \nPerformance Period Return on Average Equity performance. The PSUs are initially valued utilizing the fair value of the \nCompany's stock at the grant date, assuming 100% of the target number of units are achieved.

No outstanding stock option has a term that exceeds twenty years, and all of the outstanding options are \nfully vested. The Company recognized compensation cost for stock option grants over the required service period based upon \nthe grant date fair value, which is established using a Black-Scholes valuation model.

Employee Retirement Plan (the \"Retirement Plan\") that is a \ndefined contribution benefit plan, that allows contributions under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The \nRetirement Plan covers substantially all employees who meet certain other requirements and employment classification \ncriteria. Under the provisions of the Retirement Plan, the Company may make discretionary matching contributions on a \npercentage, not to exceed 6%, of a participant's elective deferrals. Any percentage(s) determined by the Company shall apply \nto all eligible persons for the entire plan year. Historically, the Company has matched 50% of the first 6% of eligible \ncompensation deferred by a participant. Eligible compensation includes salaries, wages, overtime and bonuses, and excludes \nexpense reimbursements and fringe benefits. In addition, the Company may make additional discretionary contributions out \nof current or accumulated net profit. Matching contributions are invested as directed by the participant. The total of the \nCompany's contributions may not exceed limitations set forth in the Retirement Plan document or the maximum deductible \nunder the Internal Revenue Code.\nAlthough it has not expressed any intention to do so, the Company has the right to terminate the Retirement Plan at \nany time. The total expense related to the Retirement Plan, including optional contributions, was $2.4 million, $2.1 million \nand $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n136"

Eligibility to participate in a SERP or \nESIA is limited to senior officers and determined by the Board. The SERPs and ESIA are unfunded and designed to be a \nnonqualified deferred compensation retirement plan in compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. \nDeferred compensation has been recorded for these plans as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities in the \naccompanying consolidated balance sheets. The deferred compensation liability was $10.9 million and $10.4 million at \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Typically, payments to participants reduce the accrual and any actuarial \nadjustments are netted with the expense. The expense recorded for the deferred compensation plan totaled $1.1 million, \n$1.1 million, and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \nOn December 7, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved the Origin Bank Nonqualified Deferred \nCompensation Plan (the “DCP”), pursuant to which certain employees, including the Company’s named executive officers, \nmay elect to participate. Pursuant to the DCP, which became effective January 1, 2023, participants may make deferral \nelections with respect to their base salary, bonus or stock units. The Company may make discretionary contributions to the \nDCP, which contributions will be subject to a vesting schedule. Unless otherwise specified by the Company, such Company \ncontributions will have a 5-year ratable vesting schedule, subject to acceleration of vesting in the case of a change in control \nor the participant’s death, disability or retirement. Participants may make individual investment elections that will determine \nthe rate of return on their cash deferral amounts under the DCP. Cash deferrals are only deemed to be invested in the \ninvestment options selected. The DCP does not provide any above-market returns or preferential earnings to participants, and, \nwith the exception of Company contributions, the deferrals and their earnings are always 100% vested. Participants may elect \nat the time they make their deferral elections to receive in-service and/or separation from service distributions, either as a \nlump sum payment or in substantially equal annual installments over a period of 5 years or 10 years, respectively. \nThere was no deferred compensation liability or expense recorded pursuant to the DCP plan during the periods \ncovered by this report. \nNote 16 - Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nYear Ended December 31,\nFederal income taxes:\n2022\n2021\n2020\nCurrent\n$ \n1,378 \n$ \n17,022 \n$ \n18,157 \nDeferred\n \n18,634 \n \n6,077 \n \n(11,545) \nState income taxes:\nCurrent\n \n40 \n \n584 \n \n1,723 \nDeferred\n \n(325)  \n202 \n \n(339) \nIncome tax expense\n$ \n19,727 \n$ \n23,885 \n$ \n7,996 \nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n137"

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain \nmandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect \non the Company's consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for \nprompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures \nof assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital \namounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and \nother factors.\nThe Company is subject to the Basel III regulatory capital framework (\"Basel III Capital Rules\"), which includes a \n2.5% capital conservation buffer. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic \nstress and requires increased capital levels for the purpose of capital distributions and other payments. Failure to meet the full \namount of the buffer will result in restrictions on the Company's ability to make capital distributions, which include dividend \npayments, stock repurchases and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and Origin to \nmaintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total, common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, \nTier 1 capital, and total capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital (as \ndefined) to average total consolidated assets (as defined). Management believes, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, that the \nCompany and Origin met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject, including the capital buffer \nrequirement.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, Origin's capital ratios exceeded those levels necessary to be categorized as \"well \ncapitalized\" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as \"well capitalized,\" Origin \nmust maintain minimum total risk-based, common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set \nforth in the table below. A final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies in February 2019 provides banking \norganizations with the option to phase in, over a three-year period, the adverse day-one regulatory capital effects of the \nadoption of CECL. In addition, on March 27, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that gives \nbanking organizations that were required to implement CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years \nCECL’s adverse effects on regulatory capital. Origin elected to adopt CECL in the first quarter of 2020 and exercised the \noption to delay the estimated impact of the adoption of CECL on the Company's regulatory capital for two years (from \nJanuary 2020 through December 31, 2021). The two-year delay is followed by a three-year transition period of CECL's initial \nimpact on the Company's regulatory capital (from January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2024). The amount representing \nthe CECL impact to the Company's regulatory capital that will be ratably transitioning back into regulatory capital over the \ntransition period is $5.1 million and $7.6 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n139"

In July 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to \nwhich the Company may, from time to time, purchase up to $50 million of its outstanding common stock. The shares may be \nrepurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, depending upon market conditions \nand other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The stock \nrepurchase program is intended to expire in three years but may be terminated or amended by the Board of Directors at any \ntime. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any shares at any time.\nThere have been no stock repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nORIGIN BANCORP, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n140"

      "text": "Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies \nCredit-Related Commitments\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into financial instruments, such as commitments to extend \ncredit and letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of its customers. Such instruments are not reflected in the \naccompanying consolidated financial statements until they are funded, although they expose the Company to varying degrees \nof credit risk and interest rate risk in much the same way as funded loans.\nCommitments to extend credit include revolving commercial credit lines, non-revolving loan commitments issued \nmainly to finance the merger and development or construction of real property or equipment, and credit card and personal \ncredit lines. The availability of funds under commercial credit lines and loan commitments generally depends on whether the \nborrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract and has not violated other contractual \nconditions. Loan commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of \na fee by the borrower. Credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to cancellation if the borrower's credit \nquality deteriorates. A number of commercial and personal credit lines are used only partially or, in some cases, not at all \nbefore they expire, and the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Company.\nA substantial majority of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the Company to fulfill a \ncustomer's financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform. The Company issues standby letters of \ncredit primarily to provide credit enhancement to its customers' other commercial or public financing arrangements and to \nhelp them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors of essential goods and services.\nThe contract amounts of these instruments reflect the Company's exposure to credit risk. The Company undertakes \nthe same credit evaluation in making loan commitments and assuming conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet \ninstruments and may require collateral or other credit support. \nThe table below presents the Company's commitments to extend credit by commitment expiration date for the dates \nindicated:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2022\nLess than \nOne Year\nOne-Three \nYears\nThree-Five \nYears\nGreater than \nFive Years\nTotal\nCommitments to extend credit(1)\n$ \n1,093,744 \n$ \n988,212 \n$ \n553,069 \n$ \n96,783 \n$ \n2,731,808 \nStandby letters of credit\n \n86,922 \n \n2,264 \n \n— \n \n— \n \n89,186 \nTotal off-balance sheet commitments\n$ \n1,180,666 \n$ \n990,476 \n$ \n553,069 \n$ \n96,783 \n$ \n2,820,994 \nDecember 31, 2021\nCommitments to extend credit(1)\n$ \n643,089 \n$ \n620,741 \n$ \n300,863 \n$ \n56,525 \n$ \n1,621,218 \nStandby letters of credit\n \n42,516 \n \n6,633 \n \n— \n \n— \n \n49,149 \nTotal off-balance sheet commitments\n$ \n685,605 \n$ \n627,374 \n$ \n300,863 \n$ \n56,525 \n$ \n1,670,367 \n____________________________\n(1)\nIncludes $594.6 million and $513.0 million of unconditionally cancellable commitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company held 28 unfunded letters of credit from the FHLB totaling $277.4 million, with \nexpiration dates ranging from January 14, 2023, to September 22, 2027. At December 31, 2021, the Company held 43 \nunfunded letters of credit from the FHLB totaling $599.3 million, with expiration dates ranging from January 20, 2022, to \nMarch 22, 2023.\nThe Company has a total contingent liability of $3.1 million as of December 31, 2022, for retention bonuses and \nguaranteed minimum incentives. The contingent liability consists of retention bonuses totaling $1.0 million for former BTH \nemployees, with $523,000, or 50%, due at December 31, 2023, and the remaining $523,000, or 50%, due at December 31, \n2024. Additionally, the Company will pay $2.0 million, in total, in guaranteed minimum incentives to certain employees, \nwith approximately 42% due on or about December 31, 2023, and 29% each due on or about December 31, 2024 and 2025, \nrespectively.

The amount is payable if Davison Insurance Agency, LLC, the acquirer and surviving wholly-\nowned subsidiary of the Company, meets certain revenue growth objectives over three years. The fair value and probability \nof payout of this liability is reassessed annually at the fiscal year end of the Company.\nManagement establishes an asset-specific allowance for certain lending-related commitments and computes a \nformula-based allowance for performing consumer and commercial lending-related commitments. These are computed using \na methodology similar to that used for the commercial loan portfolio, modified for expected maturities and probabilities of \ndrawdown. The reserve for lending-related commitments was $4.6 million and $2.3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively, and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nLoss Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is also party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and \nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control \nobjectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, \nthe Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and \nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange \nAct\")) were effective at the end of the period covered by this report.\nManagement's annual report on internal control over financial reporting — Our management is responsible for \nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules \n13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). At December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial \nreporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in “2013 Internal Control - \nIntegrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As permitted by \nSecurities and Exchange Commission guidance, management excluded from its assessment the operations of BT Holdings, Inc., \nand its wholly owned subsidiary, BTH Bank, which merger, described in Note 3 - Business Combinations of the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, was effective August 1, 2022. The total assets acquired in the \nBTH merger represented approximately 19.1% of the Company's total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2022. Based on \nthe assessment, management determined that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting at December 31, \n2022, based on the specified criteria. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022, \nhas been audited by FORVIS, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report, which is included in Part \nII, Item 8 of this report.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting — There were no changes in the Company's internal control over \nfinancial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control \nover financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures — Our management, including our Chief \nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over \nfinancial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can \nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a \ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to \ntheir costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance \nthat all control issues within a company are detected.\n147"

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, \neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control \n– Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and for \neach of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed \nan unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its \nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s \nAnnual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s \ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  \nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the \nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was \nmaintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial \nreporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating \neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audit also included performing such other procedures as \nwe considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nAs described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, the scope of management’s \nassessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has excluded BT Holdings, Inc. acquired \non August 1, 2022.  We have also excluded BT Holdings, Inc. from the scope of our audit of internal control over financial \nreporting.  BT Holdings, Inc. represented 10.02 percent of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, \nand 14.35 percent of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2022.\nDefinitions and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance \nwith generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies \nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the \ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of \nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely \ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the \nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, \nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \ninadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \ndeteriorate.\nFORVIS, LLP (Formerly BKD, LLP)\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\nFebruary 22, 2023\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n148"
