The Russian-Ukrainian \nconflict, and the resulting humanitarian \nand energy supply crisis, has strained the \nresilience of our economy and communi-\nty. This dramatic event, significantly alter-\ning the geopolitical balance at global lev-\nel, which marked the first months of last \nyear and whose effects, however, persist, \ndraws attention to the need for companies \nto orient their business strategies towards \na path of transition to a more sustainable \neconomy, which places the central focus \non the needs of the communities and terri-\ntories in which they operate. Moreover, the \ncontinuation of the pandemic for the third \nconsecutive year, although presenting an \nopportunity for change and accelerating \ncrucial processes for the country’s devel-\nopment such as the digital transition, risks, \nhowever, aggravating, in a broader context, \ninequalities by eroding social cohesion and \nincreasing the social gap. In fact, this risk, \naccording to the World Economic Forum’s \n2023 Global Risk Report, ranks seventh \nglobally among the most burdensome \nrisks of the next ten years, along with cli-\nmate change, biodiversity loss, large-scale \ninvoluntary migration and the depletion of \navailable natural resources.\nIn order to face the many challenges \narising from the current context, we are \nconvinced of the effectiveness of our sus-\ntainable business model in the medium to \nlong term, with a solid strategy based on \nmeasurable objectives that take into ac-\ncount the demands of all stakeholders, \npart of the commitment to maintaining \nongoing dialogue. Aspects of innovation \nand sustainability have been at the core \nof all Group strategies since 2020, but in \n2022 they were further strengthened and \nintegrated into the challenging goals con-\ntained in the Strategic Plan. Thanks to nu-\nmerous initiatives and projects in line with \nan integrated vision, we can say that the \nGroup is solid and sustainable, capable of \nproviding the most innovative answers to \nseize the best opportunities even in a high-\nly challenging and changing environment. \nPoste Italiane aims to support the sus-\ntainable development of the country and \nto be a guide for responsible growth and \ndigital evolution through the definition and \nachievement of financial, operational and \nsustainability objectives - understood in its \nbroadest sense.

At the national level, \non the other hand, the substantial alloca-\ntions in the PNRR (National Recovery and \nResilience Plan) for the country’s green \ntransition confirm the need to implement \nprocesses increasingly focused on circu-\nlar economy, sustainable mobility, energy \nefficiency of buildings and pollution moni-\ntoring, in order to improve the sustainabil-\nity of the economic system to achieve a \nzero environmental impact society. In this \nregard, in order to meet the demands of \ninstitutions and our stakeholders, we have \ncontinued to pursue numerous activities \nto combat climate change. The ambitious \ncommitments made by Poste Italiane are \naimed at achieving carbon neutrality by \n2030, well ahead of the time-line set by \nthe European Union, and at the same \ntime reflect the innovative green philoso-\nphy adopted by the Group that pervades \nall our services, processes and products. \nThe holistic approach is also reflected in a \ngreater involvement of customers through \na carbon offsetting programme, the “Green \nChallenge”, which rewards their “green be-\nhaviour”, i.e. all those virtuous aspects of \nbehaviour that benefit the environment.\nFrom a social point of view, in 2022 Poste \nItaliane once again demonstrated that it is \nclose to people and territories by making \na significant contribution to the country. In \nfact, the Group, continuing with the ap-\nproach adopted in 2021, made its chan-\nnels available to the public for booking \nrequests for the fourth dose of the Covid \nvaccine, giving them the opportunity to \nbook in different ways. Moreover, Poste \nItaliane’s commitment to accompanying \nthe country’s recovery is further demon-\nstrated by the Polis Project, a social inclu-\nsion programme aimed at countering the \ndepopulation of small towns and contrib-\nuting to their socio-economic develop-\nment by fostering interaction with the local \nareas and synergies with local institutions. \nPoste Italiane has once again been able \nto monitor the changes in an increasingly \ndemanding market, identifying the chal-\nlenges of the future by adopting a long-\nterm perspective to achieve competitive \nadvantage. A demonstration of this is \nthe Group’s recent entry into the energy \nmarket, which confirms the Company as \na reference point for satisfying the needs \nof Italian families, no longer only related to \nsavings, investment, financing, fixed and \nmobile telephony and fibre, but also linked \nto electricity and gas. The evolution of our \nactivities and our growth path have always \nbeen geared towards customers, who can \ncount on the widespread presence of our \norganisation, which boasts a physical net-\nwork of around 13,000 Post Offices, as \nwell as an extensive digital infrastructure \ncapable of serving the entire national pop-\nulation. And it is precisely in order to antici-\npate the economic and social needs of cit-\nizens, especially at a delicate time such as \nthat dictated by the current energy crisis, \nthat Poste Italiane invests in its all-round \nexpertise, with a special focus on the de-\nvelopment and continuous improvement \nof its range of products and services.\n10\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\nSummary\nSection"

The business model adopted \nby Poste Italiane is constantly evolving \nand adapting to the needs dictated by \nthe economic and social context and the \ndemands of the Company’s stakeholders, \nwhile maintaining its values and principles.\nIn particular, Poste Italiane’s Sustainabili-\nty Strategy consists of the Strategic Plan, \nwhich contains sustainability targets and \nobjectives aligned to the highest nation-\nal, European and global targets, and of a \nbody of corporate regulations including \nall the Sustainability Policies that regulate \nthe non-financial aspects of the Group, its \nprinciples and corporate values.\nAlthough in 2022 we were able to expe-\nrience an effective return to the habits \nthat had been lost due to the Covid-19 \npandemic, the desire to establish an in-\ncreasingly resilient business approach was \nreinforced. The integration of social, en-\nvironmental and governance factors into \nour business model - which enabled us to \novercome a period of sudden destabilisa-\ntion - has been and will continue to be the \nkey to a broader risk assessment, enabling \nthe Group to think long-term.\nGiven the historical context in which we \noperate, and as the leading Company in \nthe logistics sector in Italy, the relation-\nship with our stakeholders is increasingly \ncentral, and fostering dialogue with them \nallows us to maintain a solid relationship \nof trust, based on shared values such as \ntransparency and inclusion, which are at \nthe heart of our growth path towards a \nsustainable future. In this regard, this year’s \nMulti-stakeholder Forum once again was \na crucial opportunity to discuss and listen \nto stakeholders, in full agreement with the \nkey objectives of the Group’s Sustainability \nStrategy, based on eight pillars: Integrity \nand transparency, People development, \nDiversity and inclusion, Creating value for \nthe country, Green transition, Customer \nexperience, Innovation and Sustainable fi-\nnance.

Outlook\nSince the beginning of the year 2022, global economic activity has shown progressive signs of slowing down, related initially to \nthe spread of Covid-19 variants and, subsequently, to the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in February. The unstable \ngeopolitical situation continued throughout the year, accompanied by the energy crisis, largely a consequence of the conflict, and \npressures on supply chains; these factors led to an escalation of energy prices, which affected those of other goods and servic-\nes. This was compounded during the period by the repeated interest rate hikes decided by the major central banks to mitigate \nrising inflation. This context has led to growing uncertainty about the economic outlook, with inevitable risks of a deterioration in \nthe macroeconomic scenario for 2023. \nAgainst this backdrop, the Poste Italiane Group achieved record financial results in 2022, in line with the upgraded guidance \ncommunicated to the “financial community” in November 2022, which allowed for an increase in the dividend paid to sharehold-\ners for the year 2022 (DPS at €0.650, +10% y/y compared to the +7% y/y forecast by the dividend policy). The Poste Italiane \nGroup, in addition to distinguishing itself through a diversified business structure that allows it to benefit from a constant natu-\nral balancing effect between the trends affecting its businesses, has historically demonstrated resilience in times of economic \nuncertainty and financial turbulence, indeed establishing itself as a “safe harbour” for savers, thanks to a portfolio of financial \nofferings characterised by products with reduced risk exposure and volatility. In this regard, it should be noted that the Group \nhas negligible exposures to credit institutions recently involved in financial distress. The Group’s cost structure is flexible, with a \nsignificant component of variable costs correlated to revenue; the Group mainly sources and competes in the domestic market, \nhas no production units located in the countries affected by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, or neighbouring countries, and has \nminor commercial relations with these countries; therefore, it has no direct repercussions that could have a significant impact \non its business or on its profitability. Lastly, the Group benefits from the effects of actions implemented during favourable market \nperiods, aimed at mitigating price fluctuations of production inputs or hedging transactions against the risk of fluctuations in fuel \nprices and gas and energy supplies. The National Collective Labour Agreement is valid until the end of 2023.\nOn 30 March 2023, the strategy update for the current year was presented to the financial community, reviewing the outlook \nof the various Strategic Business Units. The objective of configuring Poste Italiane as a platform company evolving towards a \ndiversified and integrated business model to offer Italians a single, omnichannel access point for an increasingly wide range of \nproducts/services was confirmed. \nIn the Mail, Parcels and Distribution Strategic Business Unit: after a 2022 of substantial stability in the parcels and logistics seg-\nment, a return to a growth path is expected, however conditioned by the uncertainty of the macroeconomic reference variables. \nIn this scenario, the Group aims to accelerate the transformation path towards an “all-round logistics operator”: the acquisition of \nPlurima, aimed at entering the specific hospital logistics sector, the renewal of the partnership with Amazon for 5 years, and the \nrecent partnership with DHL (announced on 10 March 2023), which confirms the Group’s commitment to developing its interna-\ntional business, are part of this strategy. The SBU, in the mail segment, will continue to adjust its offer and tariffs, managing the \nstructural mail decline related to e-substitution.\nIn the Financial Services Strategic Business Unit, postal savings will remain at the centre of the Group’s financial services offering, \nwith a renewed and competitive commercial proposition, confirming itself as a simple and transparent tool for savers; at the same \ntime, the net interest income will continue to contribute to revenue supported by higher rates in a changed macro environment.\nThe Insurance Services Strategic Business Unit confirms its relevance for the group’s profitability also following the implementa-\ntion of the IFRS17 accounting standard, with the recognition of a Contractual Service Margin (CSM) in transition of approximately \n€11 billion that will support sustainable profitability over time. The Group builds on its leading position in the life business and aims \nto develop the P&C business with an integrated modular offering of customised protection, assistance and service solutions. The \nacquisition of Net Insurance, which will be finalised during the second quarter, will help accelerate the growth and profitability of \nthe protection business.\nWith regard to the Payments and Mobile Strategic Business Unit, the acquisition of LIS, a leader in proximity payments, will \nensure an acceleration of the Group’s omnichannel strategy, with the development of new services and leveraging the comple-\nmentary nature of the tobacconist network with post offices and digital channels. In addition, the new Poste Energia offer for \nelectricity and gas was launched on the market in January 2023, now available on digital web and app channels, with over 150 \nthousand contracts signed by the end of March. The offer exemplifies the clarity of the business proposition and ease of use of \nPoste Italiane’s services, ensuring a unique omnichannel customer experience.\n33\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n3.

At 31 December 2022, the Punto Poste net-\nwork had more than 15,000 contact points. \n4.4.2 Mail, Parcels and Distribution Strategic Business \nUnit\nMacroeconomic environment\nDuring 2022, the world economy was affected by the repercussions of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the new lockdown meas-\nures taken in China until November, in response to the new wave of Covid-19. The outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict put \npressure on global supply chains and commodity markets, fuelling inflationary dynamics on a global scale.\nIn the major advanced economies, the slowdown in economic activity in 2022 is attributable to weakening demand and the start \nof a cycle of tightening of restrictive monetary policies adopted by major central banks to counter rising inflationary pressures. \nThe easing of pandemic-related restrictions and supply-side bottlenecks, starting in spring, boosted activity until the third quar-\nter, but in recent months uncertainty among economic actors has increased and cyclical indicators point to a worsening of the \ncyclical phase.\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates12 that world output will decelerate to 2.9% in 2023 (from 3.4% in 2022). The slowdown \nwill be more pronounced in the euro area, for which the Fund estimates growth of 0.7% in 2023. The European Commission’s \nestimate in November is just 0.3%.\nThe dynamics of the global economy, already characterised by slowing, if not contracting, areas, will depend heavily in the com-\ning months on an effective calibration of monetary policy, the evolution of the conflict and the emergence of possible new supply \nbottlenecks, linked to new pandemic waves in China.\nInflation continued to remain at high levels during the year; in November \n2022, inflation in the euro area reached 10% and the ECB believes it will \nremain above the 2% target for a prolonged period of time. At its December \n2022 meeting, the Governing Council raised the three key interest rates13 \nby 50 basis points for the fourth consecutive time, permanently abandon-\ning the accommodative monetary policy stance maintained during the pan-\ndemic period. \nIn July 2022, the ECB announced the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), an instrument that will support an effective trans-\nmission of monetary policy in all euro area countries, again to fulfil the primary objective of ensuring price stability.\nAfter the deep recession of 2020, the Italian economy recorded a vigorous recovery, with seven consecutive quarters of high-\ner-than-expected growth, which in the third quarter of 2022 brought GDP 0.5 percentage points above the level of the previous \nquarter and 2.6% above the level of the third quarter of 2021, thanks to the increase in consumption of services and durable \ngoods and the still very favourable trend in investments in capital goods14. Gross domestic product decreased by 0.1% in Q4 \n2022 compared to the previous quarter and grew by 1.4% compared to Q4 202115, consolidating growth for 2022 that remains \nsustained at 3.7% for the whole year.\n11.\tThe Punto Poste network consists of Pick-up Points - businesses offering parcel pick-up and delivery services - and Lockers, self-service points with extended opening hours. \nThe network includes around 14,000 tobacconists licensed to provide mail and parcel services.\n12.\tWorld Economic Outlook Update - January 2023.\n13.\tThe interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were raised to 2.50%, 2.75% and 2.00% respectively, with effect from \n21 December 2022.\n14.\tISTAT - Quarterly economic accounts - Q3 2022.\n15.\tISTAT - Quarterly economic accounts - Q4 2022, published on 3 March 2023.\nPoints for accepting and \ncollecting parcels of the Punto \nPoste Network\n>15,000\nItalian GDP growth \nin 2022 \n+3.7%\n71\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n4.

Growth has also been revised upwards for 2022, with the trend level of \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) increasing to 3.7% from the 3.3% projected by the DEF in September. By contrast, the forecast \nfor 2023 drops substantially, from 2.4% to 0.4%.  \nTax and social security receipts in the first eight months of 2022 were higher than expected, despite impressive energy cost \nmitigation measures. As a result of the change introduced in the accounting treatment of tax credits by ISTAT, the general gov-\nernment net debt for 202219 in relation to GDP, at 8.0% of GDP, increased compared to the government’s forecast (5.1% of \nGDP). According to the new projections20 the high nominal growth of the economy expected this year and the improvement in \nthe primary balance will lead to a descent of the gross debt-to-GDP ratio more pronounced than in the DEF, going from 149.8% \nin 2021 to 144.7% in 2022 (147% in the DEF).\nThe postal services market is going through a period of radical change, primarily linked to the digital transformation, which has \ninfluenced the volume of letters and parcels in circulation. At the macro-trend level, the continuing structural decline in traditional \nmail volumes, replaced by digital forms of communication (e-mail, instant messaging, etc.), is accompanied by an increase in the \nvolume of parcels sent.\nIn particular, for the letter mail market, after the substantial drop in 2020 volumes (-19% compared to 2019) , 2021 confirmed a \ntrend of substantial stability (+0.2% compared to 2020)21. In 2022, the market decreased further (-5.3% compared to 2021)21, \nmainly as a consequence of e-substitution effects. \nThe parcel sector experienced a period of uncertainty in 2022, but this did not affect the value of the market, which grew strongly \nin the pandemic years. The effects conditioning the continuation of the growth trend recorded in recent years can be summarised \nas the generalised increase in costs brought about by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the rise in inflation with the consequent \ndecrease in consumer purchasing power, and the lower propensity for private purchases (including on-line). This trend is also \nvisible on a global level, as witnessed by the results of several leading companies.\nFor the Italian parcel sector, estimates for 202222 therefore point to a stable market value compared to 2021.\n16.\tISTAT Employment and unemployment (provisional data) - December 2022, published on 31 January 2023.\n17.\tEconomic and Financial Document.\n18.\tMultiplication factor used to formally eliminate the effect of inflation on values.\n19.\tISTAT - GDP and general government debt - Year 2022, published on 1 March 2023.\n20.\tISTAT - GDP and general government debt 2020-2022, published on 1 March 2023.\n21.\tInternal calculations based on Agcom data (quarterly observatories and annual report 2022) and the latest available financial statements of companies operating in the postal \nsector.\n22.\tSource: Internal calculations on Cerved Databank data.\n72\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\nSummary\nSection"

The \ncompensation system for the public service obligations undertaken by the Company was deemed to be \nfully compliant with the applicable EU rules on State aid. \nOn 1 July 2021, AGCom Resolution 199/21/CONS was published, concluding the procedure to verify \nthe net cost of the universal postal service incurred by Poste Italiane for the years 2017, 2018 \nand 2019. In particular, the burden of the universal postal service for these years has been quantified at \n€354.5, €334.5 and €175 million respectively. For the 2019 financial year, although the quantified charge \n(€175 million) is lower than the authorised offsets (€262 million), the charge for the provision of the uni-\nversal postal service over the entire period (i.e., the previous 2016-2019 Service Contract) is in any case \nhigher than the offsets authorised by the European Commission. The Authority also established that the \nuniversal service charge for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 is inequitable and that, for the same years, \nin continuity with what was established in previous years, the Compensation Fund referred to in article \n10 of Legislative Decree no. 261/1999 is not established. Poste Italiane appealed the aforementioned \nmeasure on 22 September 2021 before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court (TAR).\nThe Regional Administrative Court, in ruling no. 11416/2022 published on 5 September 2022, partially \nupheld the appeal on the verification of the responsibility for the years 2011-2012 by acknowledging \nthe non-activation of the compensation fund for the year 2011. Poste Italiane and AGCom appealed the \nRegional Administrative Court ruling to the Council of State and the hearing on the merits has been set \nfor 18 May 2023.\nWith AGCom Resolution 28/23/CONS, published on 24 February 2023, the Authority initiated the \nverification procedure for calculating the net cost of the universal postal service for the years 2020 and \n2021.\nPublisher tariff \nsubsidies\nLaw Decree no. 162 of 30 December 2019 - as converted by Law no. 8 of 28 February 2020 - or-\ndered that reimbursements of publisher tariff subsidies to Poste Italiane continue “for a duration equal to \nthat of the universal postal service” (i.e. until April 2026). The application of the regulation is subject to \napproval by the European Commission. \nIn August 2020, the procedure was initiated for pre-notification of the Service of General Eco-\nnomic Interest (SGEI) to the Commission for the period 2020-2026.\nThe 2022 Budget Law (Law no. 234 of 30 December 2021) left unchanged the appropriations for the \nyears 2022 and 2023, amounting to €52.5 million, and provided for the same amount for 2024.\nThe 2023 Budget Law (Law no. 197 of 30 December 2022) stipulated that the reimbursement of pub-\nlishing postal subsidies would be made through the resources of the Fund for Pluralism and Innovation \nin Information.

The Resolution \nprovided for a gradual increase in basic tariffs as of 1 September 2022, with further increases as from 1 \nJanuary 2024, 2025 and 2026, with no impact on the subsidised tariffs paid by senders and with a con-\nsequent increase in the compensation received by Poste Italiane per item sent at the subsidised tariff.\nWith AGCom Resolution 171/22/CONS “Final measure for the analysis of the market for mail delivery \nservices and determination of the maximum tariffs for universal postal services - assessment of the level \nof competition and definition of regulatory remedies” of 6 June 2022, the new tariffs for the Univer-\nsal Service were defined; the Resolution accepts most of the proposals formulated by the Company \nregarding tariff variations, including the proposal to eliminate the ban on price increases up to 2024 \nproposed by AGCom during the public consultation; further future variations may therefore be proposed \nto the Authority.

      "text": "4.4.3 Financial Services Strategic Business Unit   \nMarket context\nFinancial markets\nOverall, 2022 was a particularly difficult year for both equity and bond investors. The capital markets reflected this scenario in their \nstock prices, with bond and share prices falling simultaneously, an event that has occurred only once in the last 50 years (1994); \nglobal stock markets have lost 19.4% since the beginning of the year27, while bond markets have fallen by 13.7%28. Stock mar-\nket performance was driven by a decline in market29 multiples while earnings estimates remained relatively stable in both the EU \nand the US, helped in part by the energy sector and the ability of some companies to pass on to their customers the increased \nproduction costs resulting from higher commodity prices. In 2022, the S&P 500 and Nikkei 225 indexes30 lost roughly 20% and \n9%, respectively, while the EuroStoxx 50 lost around 12%.\nThe cycle of central bank rate hikes has led to a significant repricing of the European bond segment: the yield on the 10-year \nmulti-year Treasury bond (BTP), which stood at around 1.2% at the start of the year, has progressively  increased, reaching 4.8% \nin October, the highest level of the year. At the same time, the BTP-BUND spread also rose, reaching 250 basis points in October. \nFrom mid-October to mid-December, yields on long-term government bonds in the major advanced economies (in particular, \nthe US, Europe, the UK) fell significantly, returning to values close to the yields recorded in the first half of 2022. Contributing to \nthis development was the easing of the central banks’ monetary policy tightening process, which changed traders’ expectations \nregarding the pace and duration of the monetary tightening process. Expectations of a more decisive tightening of monetary \npolicies spread following the December meetings of the central banks of the major advanced economies and the 10-year BTP \nended 2022 with a yield of 4.7% and the BTP-Bund spread in the 210 basis point area.\nIn the Italian stock market, the FTSE MIB  declined by 13% year-on-year in 202231.\nCorporate bonds, against this backdrop of uncertainty and rising yields, rose for much of the year, particularly on the more spec-\nulative component. Towards the end of the year, however, credit spreads partially retraced, helped by a generalised reduction in \nvolatility and a return of interest for the asset class by investors, given the levels reached by spreads in the autumn. \nBelow is a table that represents the precise returns expressed in percentage terms at the end of the period for BTP government \nbonds and Interest Rate Swaps32.\nDec 2021\nMar 2022\nJun 2022\nSep 2022\nDec 2022\nBTP 10Y\n1.17\n2.04\n3.26\n4.52\n4.72\nSWAP 10Y\n0.30\n1.19\n2.17\n3.08\n3.20\nBTP 15Y\n1.54\n2.18\n3.44\n4.40\n4.75\nSWAP 15Y\n0.49\n1.29\n2.35\n3.07\n3.14\nBTP 30Y\n1.99\n2.49\n3.67\n4.34\n4.79\nSWAP 30Y\n0.48\n1.02\n1.98\n2.40\n2.53\nThe following graph shows the trend of the 10-year BTP-Bund spread in recent years with the values recorded up to 31 \nDecember 2022.\n27.\tMCSI World index\n28.\tFTSE World Government Fixed income Index.\n29.\tMarket multiples are ratios between the market prices (quotations) of an equity instrument and a given financial statement size.

The reply report was sent on 10 \nMarch 2022. \nOn 20 May 2022, the Authority sent BancoPosta RFC the Measure concluding the proceedings \nrelating to the imposition of additional capital requirements pursuant to Article 53-bis, para-\ngraph 1, letter d) of Legislative Decree no. 385 of 1 September 1993 (TUB - Consolidated Law on \nBanking). \nSpecifically, as of the supervisory reporting on 30 June 2022, BancoPosta will have to hold the \nfollowing minimum capital requirements: (i) CET 1 ratio: 7.80%; (ii) Tier 1 ratio: 9.55%; (iii) Total \nCapital Ratio: 11.95%. Moreover, in order to ensure compliance with the binding measures out-\nlined above and to ensure that BancoPosta's own funds can absorb any losses arising from stress \nscenarios, taking into account the results of the stress tests carried out by the intermediary as part \nof the ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process), the Bank of Italy has identified the \nfollowing levels of capital that BancoPosta will be required to maintain: (i) CET 1 ratio: 8.55%; (ii) \nTier 1 ratio: 10.30%; (iii) Total Capital Ratio: 12.70%. \nCompliance with these requirements did not result in the need for additional capital contributions \nby BancoPosta.\nOn 20 July 2022, the Authority sent a notice to Poste Italiane SpA– BancoPosta RFC and Poste-\nPay concerning the manner in which the funds received by PostePay in respect of the issuance of \nelectronic money should be managed. It should be noted that the Supervisory Provisions for EMI \nprovide that such funding may be deposited with a bank authorised to operate in Italy, invested \nin qualified debt securities or particular units of harmonised mutual funds. Since the creation of \nPostePay, these sums are deposited in a postal current account (protection account) and con-\ntribute to the funds from private customers of BancoPosta RFC, which are invested in euro area \ngovernment bonds. In this regard, the Authority initiated discussions with BancoPosta and Poste-\nPay in 2021, in view of the fact that BancoPosta was not deemed to be an entity that could be \nassimilated to the concept of \"credit institution\" under the relevant European legislation. In the face \nof a proposed alternative approach, aimed at equating the deposit with BancoPosta of the sums \ncollected by PostePay with a direct investment in qualified debt securities, in the aforementioned \ncommunication the Authority asked BancoPosta and PostePay for further observations, aimed \nat identifying an operational solution that would allow full alignment with the relevant regulatory \nprovisions. Upon completion of the further investigations requested, a transitional solution was \nidentified, also on the basis of the discussions with the Authority. Feedback will be provided by \nBancoPosta by the second quarter of 2023. \nThe Bank of Italy, from 14 March 2022 to 15 July 2022, conducted an inspection at Poste Italiane \nSpA - BancoPosta RFC, on profitability and the business model, governance and control systems, \ninterest rate risk management methods including related internal modelling, new tax credit busi-\nness and associated risks. For further details, please refer to the chapter “Proceedings pending \nand principal relations with the Authorities\" in the section ”Poste Italiane's Financial Statements\".\nOn 10 August 2022, the Bank of Italy launched a survey on the use of DLT (Distributed Ledger \nTechnology) and crypto-assets, in order to have an updated and complete picture of the spread \nof these technologies in the Italian banking and financial system.

The price of gas surpassed the level recorded in the first half \nof 2021 by more than 500%63; the third quarter of 2022 was also characterised by a scenario of significant tensions on energy \ncommodity prices, which were even higher than in the second quarter of the year: the very high purchase costs and elevated \nprice volatility are also related to uncertainties about the reliability of gas supplies from Russia. \nDuring the summer, European gas stocks grew rapidly while alternative sources to gas (hydro, nuclear and coal) had to significantly \nreduce their production due to high temperatures and water shortages; the European institutions announced measures64 to deal \nwith high energy prices and the risk of gas shortages as the winter season approached (plan to reduce electricity and gas con-\nsumption, intervention in the regulation and operation of energy markets, evaluation of “price cap” mechanisms for energy prices).\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the price of gas fell to around €80 per megawatt-hour, thanks to the achievement of the storage \ntargets of the major European countries, although it was seven times higher than the level observed at the beginning of 2021.\nIn order to cope with rising commodity prices, the Government issued a series of emergency measures with the aim of mitigating \nthe energy expenditure of households and businesses, in particular by making changes to general system charges and social \nbonuses for economically disadvantaged households and customers in serious health conditions.

In particular, in line with \nthe main leading practices that place particular emphasis on the integration of sustainability into strategies, risk management \nand remuneration policies, Poste Italiane’s SCIGR aims to contribute to the Company’s sustainable success by defining ESG \nroles and responsibilities, information flows between the players involved in the internal control system and towards corporate \nbodies, and the methods of managing the related risks. Moreover, in order to achieve this objective, the Company has decided \nto promote dialogue with the relevant stakeholders, in order to ensure a constant exchange of views on business strategies and \ntheir implementation.\nIn line with statutory requirements and the related best practices, the SCIGR consists of three levels of control and involves a \nrange of actors within the organisation. The first level controls identify, assess, manage and monitor the risks within their com-\npetence in relation to which they identify and implement specific treatment actions aimed at ensuring the correct performance of \nthe operations. The second-level control units, whose role consists primarily of defining risk management models and carrying \nout monitoring activities, play a key role in the integration and overall functioning of the Internal Control and Risk Management \nSystem. The third level of control, represented at Poste Italiane by the Internal Auditing function, provide independent assurance \non the adequacy and effective operation of the first and second level of control and, in general, on the SCIGR.\nSCIGR assurance activities\nThe Internal Auditing function plays an important role in the internal control and risk management system, as it is responsible for \nthird-level control activities.\nThe action of the Internal Auditing function for the year 2022 continued in line with the approach adopted in previous years and \nwas inspired by the following strategic lines:\n \nz safeguard the achievement of the objectives of the Business Plan and Sustainability;\n \nz support Group Governance;\n \nz promote value creation, efficiency and agile leadership.\nAt its meeting of 22 February 2022, the Board of Directors, having heard the prior opinions of the Risk and Control Committee \nand the Board of Statutory Auditors, acknowledged the SCIGR 2021 Evaluation Report by approving it and, at the same meet-\ning, approved the Audit Plan for the year 2022. The Report, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of \nthe Corporate Governance Code for listed companies and supervisory instructions, has taken account of the results of audits \ncarried out in 2020 on the basis of the Audit Plans of all the Audit functions involved and the general framework of the Poste \nItaliane Group’s SCIGR, considering the impact of organisational changes adopted, developments and events during the year. \nThe Report provides an overall assessment of the Poste Italiane Group’s Internal Control and Risk Management System in terms \nof “Positive Assurance”, noting that, on the basis of the findings at the date of the report and for the period covered by the report, \nthe system is, on the whole, adequate to mitigate the risks that threaten the pursuit of the Group’s objectives.\nMAIN RELATED TYPES \nOF CAPITAL\nNFS\n141\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n6.

The activities envisaged also covered the main resource \nmanagement processes such as IT (with audits of 14 processes/applications), real estate and purchasing (3 facilities), human \nresources (over 42 facilities), administrative-accounting processes (15 facilities) and various compliance areas (21 facilities). \nFinally, to oversee the internal control and risk management system of the entire Poste Italiane Group, 10 Group companies were \naudited in 2022.\nThe programme of activities envisaged in the 2022 Audit Plan document, taking advantage of the experience of the previous \ntwo-year period, ensured the saturation of resources also through the performance of remote audit activities; in fact, the Internal \nAuditing function, capitalising on the impacts generated by the health emergency for Covid-19, further increased its efforts in \nterms of innovation and evolution of the supporting IT tools, as well as defining and developing alternative operating methods \nfor the performance of audit activities; this made it possible to mitigate the impact of absences generated by Covid-19, which, \nduring 2022, increased by approximately 800% compared to the same period of the previous year.\nThe Internal Auditing function, in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the Group’s control system, further integrated the ver-\nification activities to be performed on Group companies without their own Internal Auditing function, in continuity with the lines \nadopted in previous years.\nIn line with the previous two years, for the most significant Group companies that do not have their own Internal Auditing function, \nthese activities are regulated by specific agreements with SDA Express Courier, PosteAirCargo Srl and Postel SpA.\n142\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\nSummary\nSection"

The \nGroup Sustainable Development, Risk and Compliance function (SSRCG), which forms part of the Corporate Affairs function, is \nresponsible for ensuring that these objectives are met. This is primarily done through the definition of an integrated risk manage-\nment process that relies on the coordinated involvement of all the actors in the Internal Control and Risk Management System, \nabove all the specialist forms of second-level control, the use of standardised models and metrics based on Group-wide criteria, \nand the design and implementation of shared tools for assessing and managing risk. In this latter regard, the Group implemented \nan integrated Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) platform in 2018 to support the integrated risk management process. \nThis IT tool assesses and manages operational risks, in accordance with Legislative Decree no. 231/01, of fraud, IT security, \nstrategic, ESG, reputational, fiscal, physical security, Integrated Compliance, privacy and corruption as well as compliance with \nthe rules applicable to financial and payment services. In addition, during 2022, the platform was further expanded through \nevolutionary implementations and the development of new functionalities with reference to existing modules. This is the tool \nthat has enabled the Group to maximise integration of the risk management process, ensuring that risk assessment methods \nare shared across all the specialist second-level control functions. At the same time, it has improved communication with senior \nmanagement and corporate bodies and between the various control functions, minimising the risk of inadequate or redundant \ninformation.\n143\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n6.

The following \nrisks, among others, are closely monitored: i) IT risk, above all the risk that \nmalfunctions and/or shortcomings in information systems could result in the \nloss of data integrity, leaks of personal data or breaches of confidentiality, \npotentially causing disruption to the services provided to customers; ii) health \nand safety risk, with specific regard to the risk of workplace injury to employees \nor contractors as a result of operations (e.g. the collection, transport and \nsorting of parcels and letter post, and the delivery of postal products using \nmotor vehicles); iii) physical security risk, relating to access to the headquarters \npremises of Group companies, to post offices or other private areas by \nunauthorised or unidentified persons, and the limited protection of Poste \nItaliane’s assets and property against criminal behaviour (robberies, losses \nresulting from fraud, theft, ATM attacks, vandalism, etc.).

This process \ndescribes the key nature of the risks, the triggers and the potential \nconsequences or effects, in both financial terms (e.g. losses, increased \ncosts due to delays or the failure to implement restructuring plans \nand efficiencies, reduced revenue), and in other terms (e.g. customer \nsatisfaction).\nThis refers to risks of breaches of existing laws and regulations, such as \nthe risks connected with Legislative Decree no. 231/01, Law 262/05, \nData Protection and Market Abuse regulations or the introduction of new \nlegislation or regulations (or new interpretations legislation and regulations) \nof either general importance (e.g. regarding administrative, accounting, tax \nmatters, etc.) or specific to the sectors in which the Poste Italiane Group \noperates.

In fact, the Committee \nexamines, evaluates and makes proposals on the Group’s environmental, social and governance (the latter with reference to \nSustainability) strategy, including climate change strategies, annual targets and deliverables, considering potential projects related to \nthese topics and monitoring their implementation over time. In addition, the CSost monitors climate-related risks and opportunities \nand all initiatives taken by the Company to address these issues, coordinating with the Control and Risk Committee and reporting \nto the Board of Directors. At managerial level, the main specific functions related to environmental topics are entrusted to the Chief \nExecutive Officer and to the Group Sustainable Development, Risk and Compliance function. In fact, the CEO of Poste Italiane \nSpA has the task of establishing, maintaining and ensuring the effectiveness of the Internal Control and Risk Management System \n(SCIGR), as well as formulating the Sustainability strategies connected to environmental issues and overseeing their implementation, \ncontinuously monitoring their adequacy and effectiveness, always considering the assessment of related risks and opportunities.\nThe Group Sustainable Development, Risk and Compliance function of Poste Italiane SpA, established within the Corporate Affairs \nfunction:\n \nz defines, in collaboration with the departments involved, the guidelines and objectives of Sustainability and corporate social \nresponsibility for the Company, through the identification of a set of indicators for monitoring Sustainability performance, and the \nuse of specific metrics used to monitor climate-related risks and opportunities, in line with best practices and related international \nguidelines; \n \nz constitutes, thanks to the contribution of the specialist units reporting directly to it (“direct controls”), as well as other risk controls \n(“indirect controls”) present in Poste Italiane and the Group companies, the single point of reference for the governance and \nmanagement of all risks. \nFinally, with the aim of correctly identifying and managing climate-related risks and opportunities also for investment and insurance \nprocesses, additional controls were put in place. With regard to investment processes, BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita have \nset up committees responsible for periodically analysing and assessing the ESG risk (including, therefore, also the environmental \nrisk) of the portfolios and the evaluation criteria of the issuers’ ESG profiles. As far as insurance processes are concerned, Poste \nVita’s Risk Office function is responsible for identifying, analysing and assessing the signs of change deriving from the various dimen-\nsions of the external environment, with particular attention to factors linked to climate change. The identification of these signals \ntakes place jointly with the “Products Committee - ESG Assessments”, which periodically examines and evaluates the criteria for \ndefining the ESG profiles and the Group’s product catalogue.\nPoste Italiane considers several risk drivers, attributable to the two macro-areas transition risks and physical risks, to classify them \nin relation to climate change. After identifying and associating the risks with each driver, the Company went on to link the material \nand capital issues impacted, defining opportunities and potential negative impacts related to them, and identifying specific mitigation \nactions to be implemented. During the risk assessment process, Poste Italiane took into account both its own direct activities, as \nwell as upstream and downstream operations, and finally included customers as the main beneficiaries of the Company’s products. \nThe Group has defined activities and actions for the business with respect to short (0-3 years), medium (3-5 years) and long term \n(5-10 years) perspectives, considering the time frame 2019-2030.\nPoste Italiane supports the transition to a low-carbon economy through its commitment to reducing emissions in the business oper-\nations included in the Business Plan, consistent with achieving Carbon Neutrality by 2030, and in support of the Paris Agreement \nin limiting global warming to 1.5°C.\nWith regard to transition risks, considering the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC) organisations and the main literature on the subject as a reference, the Group carried out a review of different scenarios to \nget a picture of potential future developments. In particular, Poste Italiane employed, after an evaluation of possible alternatives, two \nscenarios, IEA 450 and IEA B2DS, considered to be the most consistent with the timeframe envisaged for the assets and activities, \nand consequently the most suitable for the Group’s business and objectives with respect to the alignment towards maintaining the \nglobal temperature at 1.5°C. \nThe IEA 450 scenario describes an energy pathway consistent with the goal of limiting the average global temperature increase to \n2°C by limiting the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to around 450 parts per million of CO2 equivalent. By the \nyear 2030, the scenario envisages the energy sector to be strongly characterised by renewable energies, with a marked improve-\nment in vehicle and process efficiency, and a widespread replacement of coal by natural gas in power generation. With this in mind, \nstarting in 2019, the Group has implemented a Renewal Plan that envisages the complete replacement of the entire vehicle fleet with \nnew-generation, low-emission electric, hybrid and endothermic models, which will guarantee a reduction in energy consumption. \nIn order to measure the value generated by fleet replacement, Poste Italiane adopted a specific investment valuation methodology \nthat combines the traditional financial and non-financial perspectives, the so-called “True Value Bridge”. This methodology is a useful \ntool to develop an integrated strategic planning to create shared value between the Company and the territory, identifying the net \nimpacts generated by the green fleet compared to those that a traditional fleet would generate82. \n82.\tFor more information, please refer to the document “Sustainability and its Impacts”: https://www.posteitaliane.it/files/1476526944361/Report-impatti.pdf\n160\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\nSummary\nSection"

      "text": "With regard to the assessment of physical risks, Poste Italiane’s Governance dedicated to risk and sustainability, in line with what \nthe IPCC has developed worldwide on climate projections, has updated its climate and water risk assessment methodology to \nhave a clear picture of the risk and assessment of potential physical risks and opportunities. In this sense, the Company has \ncarried out a precise assessment, including in the analysis all the Group’s production and sorting sites located in different areas \nof Italy. \nSpecifically, Poste Italiane, following an extensive analysis process that included the evaluation of the main Representative \nConcentration Pathways (RCP) of greenhouse gases, and the consistency of these pathways with the duration of assets and \nactivities, identified and selected two scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. The Group selects RCP 2.6 as the reference scenario, in \nview of the ambitious nature of the risk mitigation activities envisaged in the Business Plan in relation to the landscape identified \nby the IPCC. RCP 2.6 scenario prefigures a peak in emissions at an early stage, with a subsequent decrease caused by the \nactive removal of carbon dioxide within the atmosphere. RCP 2.6 is also known as RCP 3PD, in relation to the mid-century peak \nof ~3W/m², which will be followed by a major decline. With the goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2100, this scenario \nuses massive regulatory and policy intervention, leading to an almost immediate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). \nThe Company also considers the IPCC’s “RCP 8.5” scenario, as it provides an example of the worst-case scenario, i.e. the \ncondition of a continuous increase in emissions during the course of the 21st century. RCP 8.5 pathway results from insufficient \nemission reduction efforts and represents a failure to stem warming by 2100. Regarding the climate projections for the two sce-\nnarios, in fact, for RCP 8.5, areas of the Mediterranean will experience an increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfalls, \nwhich will intensify in the second half of the century with an increasing trend until 2100. According to the RCP 2.6 scenario, on \nthe other hand, there will be similar but smaller effects in the first half of the century, with a decreasing trend in the second half. \nThis leads to a clear difference between the two scenarios in 2100. \nPoste Italiane carried out a risk assessment with the aim of assessing the potential impacts of physical events related to climate \nchange on the business. The risk assessment considered the extent of the risk already existing at the sites and the future risk \nup to the year 2024 (medium-term scenario), under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. In addition to the basic assumptions of the chosen \nmodels, the Company also conducted a further study on the data from the rainfalls and main temperature parameters of the dif-\nferent scenarios, then comparing them with current data with the aim of determining the significance of the variation with respect \nto the existing risk at the sites examined, in line with the RCP 2.6 scenario and taking into account the possible implications of \nthe RCP 8.5 worst case scenario. Future projections of changes in physical risk levels related to natural disasters are relevant in \nstrategic terms, although in most cases there is still no certainty. On the other hand, excessive reliance on what is already known \nfrom climate science must be avoided. Therefore, Poste Italiane’s risk assessment is appropriate to the increasing level of risk in \nits business and operations.\nThe assessment of physical risks covers the entire revenue generated by the Group, amounting to €11.9bn of existing operations \nin 2022, mainly from Post Offices and hubs, which are potentially most impacted by extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, \nwith a view to a long-term time horizon, in line with the Business Plan and the 2030 Carbon Neutrality target, all new operations \nare subject to risk assessments that also take into account physical climate risks.\nThe product result of the risk assessment is subsequently converted into potential days of business interruption and then multi-\nplied by the value in terms of lost revenue (€) of one day of business interruption. The main risks that emerged from the scenario \nanalysis are those related to extreme weather events and changes in rainfall patterns. The greater severity of extreme weather \nevents such as rain, storms, snowfalls and possible floods or frosts, with consequent landslides and floods, could cause inter-\nruptions in production, sorting and therefore logistics activities, as well as damage to sites and higher logistics costs. The Group’s \nfinancial performance, and thus its results and cash flows, are negatively impacted by the occurrence of such acute physical \ndamage and the interruption of power distribution, resulting in a deterioration of reputation and loss of customer confidence. \nExamples are the floods in Genoa in 2016, 2019 and 2020, following which the Group collaborated with national and local insti-\ntutions, as well as the more recent floods in Sicily in 2018, 2020 and 2021. These events led to damage to Poste Italiane’s Post \nRCP 2.6\n°C\nRCP 8.5\n°C\nMore ambitious scenario aims to limit \nthe average global temperature to 1.5°C \ncompared to pre-industrial levels\nBusiness-as-usual scenario with no mitigation \naction leading to atmospheric CO2 tripled \nor quadrupled by 2100 compared to pre-\nindustrial levels\n166\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\nSummary\nSection"

      "text": "7.2 Impacts resulting from the Russian-Ukrainian \nConflict\nFollowing the recommendations issued by ESMA in the course of the year83, an update to 31 December 2022 of the main \neffects on the Group of the crisis in Ukraine is provided below; for a complete review, please also refer to the information \nprovided in the section “Outlook” and in Chapter 3 “Materia events during the year” of the section “Poste Italiane’s financial \nstatements”.\nThe macro-economic context during 2022 was characterised by a combination of factors leading to a widespread slowdown \nin economic growth. In particular, we highlight: the resumption of Covid-19 infections, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, a \ngrowing inflationary dynamic, which has generated an increase in the prices of raw materials (especially energy), and inter-\nventions to normalise monetary policy by the world’s main central banks, which have revised upwards their reference interest \nrates in order to stem the overheating of the economy. These factors interrupted the path of consolidation of the post-pan-\ndemic recovery that began in early 2022, with the global economy continuing to suffer from further increases in the inflation \nrate, negative developments in global financial markets and uncertainty related to the macro-economic scenario in the fourth \nquarter of 2022.\nWith reference to the impact of the ongoing conflict on business, it should be noted that the Group’s sphere of operations is \nmainly domestic and it has limited business relations with the countries involved in the conflict; therefore, the Group has not \nexperienced significant impacts on its business or significant repercussions on profitability, nor fears about the impairment of \nits ability to continue as a going concern.\nNonetheless, the high uncertainty of the reference context and the inflationary dynamics exacerbated by the conflict led to the \nfollowing findings in 2022:\n \nz an increase in the cost of fuel and raw materials in general, and an increase in costs on all services related to international \nroutes, including those outside the areas affected by the conflict; in this regard, actions have been implemented by the \nGovernment to mitigate the effects of these increases, such as, for example, the reduction of excise duties and VAT imposed \nby the State on fuel prices (extended until 31 December 2022), the social bonus electricity and gas and additional benefits for \nenergy-intensive companies84;\n \nz consistent with the downsizing of the market in this sector, there was a slowdown in the growth of parcel volumes, particu-\nlarly in B2C as a result of inflationary effects and thus a reduced purchasing capacity also in e-commerce. The parcel sector, \nespecially in the first part of 2022, was also affected by the repeated lockdowns imposed in China (until November) to curb \nthe spread of Covid-19;\n \nz in the financial sector, in the first half of 2022, postal savings were adversely affected by the socio-economic context characte-\nrised by a significant rise in interest rates, rising inflation, a decrease in households’ propensity to save and a reduction in the \ncountry’s growth prospects. With regard to the Postal Savings product offering, in light of the market context, yields on Postal \nInterest-bearing Certificates were adjusted three times over the course of 2022, and interventions were made in the range of \nproducts offered, including the launch of several offers dedicated to holders of new liquidity. In addition, following an analysis \nof BancoPosta’s cost base, aimed at quantifying the impact of inflationary dynamics, a unilateral change was made to the \ncontractual terms and conditions, related to the justified reason “inflation”. With reference to the financial portfolio, it benefited \nfrom the changed market scenario with rising interest rates;\n \nz in the insurance sector, there is no significant evidence as indirect exposures, within the framework of multi-asset funds, to \ncountries involved in the conflict represent an insignificant amount compared to the insurance group’s investments (0.03% of \nthe total);\n \nz the increase in gas and electricity prices and the considerable volatility of prices, also linked to the risk of reductions and inter-\nruptions in Russian gas supplies to Europe, did not have any significant repercussions for the Group’s new energy business, \nwhose offer was launched in June 2022 for a restricted target (employees, family members and pensioners) and from January \n2023 for all customers. In its raw material procurement policies, the Group also selected suppliers with low or no exposure to \ngas from Russian territory.\n83.\tPublic statement ESMA32-63-1277 “Implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on half-yearly financial reports” of 13 May 2022, Public statement ESMA32-63-1320 \n“European common enforcement priorities for 2022 annual financial reports” of 28 October 2022 and CONSOB Warning Notice no. 3/22 “Conflict in Ukraine - Attention \nReminder for supervised issuers on financial reporting and compliance related to restrictive measures taken by the European Union against Russia” of 19 May 2022.\n84.\tLaw Decree no. 21 of 21 March 2022 (the so-called Energy Decree) and Law Decree no. 176 of 18 November 2022 (the so-called aiuti-quater Decree).

However, during the course of the year, the decrease recorded in \nthe initial part, generated by an uncertain market, gradually eased with a continuously improving trend; in particular, in the last \nquarter of the year, revenue and volumes grew respectively by 5.0% (+€19 million) and 4.2% (+3 million items) compared to the \nsame quarter of 2021. The drop in revenue in 2022 is partially offset by the entry into the hospital logistics business through the \nacquisition of Plurima (+€45 million). \nThe year’s decline was mainly concentrated in the B2B segment, which generated revenue of €224 million, down 14.2% (-€37 \nmillion), against 36 million shipments (-€6 million, -13.3%) compared to 2021. \nThis business segment, which is significantly linked to GDP growth, was strongly affected by international geopolitical tensions, \nwhich put industrial production in crisis during the year, due to price increases especially in the energy sector.\nThe B2C segment showed positive performance mainly concentrated in the second half of the year. In particular, in this segment, \nthe third quarter of 2022 bucked the trend of the first half of the year, with the fourth quarter confirming sharper growth (+6 mil-\nlion items, +11.5%). In this regard, we highlight the substantial increase in shipments directly related to e-commerce during the \nChristmas peak and a recovery of inbound flows from China, which had slowed down due to the entry into force of the low value \nconsignment regulations in July 202186.\nThe C2X segment showed revenue and volumes down by €8 million (-13.4%) and one million items (-16.4%) respectively com-\npared to 2021, mainly as a result of a marked market contraction.\nThe item Other, shows an increase in revenue of €6 million (+1.7%), accompanied, however, by a reduction in volumes of 3 million \nitems (-15.6%) compared to 2021. This positive performance is attributable to the positive contribution of the company Plurima, \nin spite of the foreseeable negative effect related to the reduction in business volume on integrated logistics87 services serving \nthe public administration.\nThere was a further delay in the international business both in revenue (-€9 million, or -10.2%) and in volumes (-1 million items, \n-24.6%) where a progressive slowdown in demand was observed throughout the year.\n86.\tThe European Low Value Consignment Directive introduced the obligation for final customers to pay VAT also on the purchase of low-value goods.\n87.\tPoste Italiane was awarded the integrated logistics contract in May 2020 for the delivery of personal protective equipment to public administrations.\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

Revenue from the distribution of third-party products \namounted to €213 million, down by €8 million compared to the €221 million of 2021, mainly attributable to lower revenue from \npersonal loans.\nRevenue from other sectors amounted to €820 million (+8.1% compared to 2021). The positive change is mainly attributable to \nthe increase in management fees  of insurance policies and the growth in revenue from the placement of products of the \nPayments and Mobile SBU.\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 showed external revenue up by €106 million (+9.7%) compared to the same period of 2021, mainly \ndue to higher net interest income (+€153 million), partly offset by lower revenue from the postal savings deposits and manage-\nment service (-€41 million, -9.3%).\nAVERAGE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEPOSIT  \n(€bn)\nIn 2022, the average balance of current accounts increased compared to the previous year, going from €79.1 billion to €86.5 \nbillion.

      "text": "At the same time, the generalised rise in interest rates led to an increase in the market value of the interest rate swaps entered \ninto to hedge the fair value of the securities portfolio, which transform the yield of the latter from fixed to variable. In February and \nMay 2022, early extinguishment transactions were carried out on part of this derivatives portfolio (amounting to a notional value of \napproximately €7 billion). The transaction as a whole, did not have any significant immediate impact on the statement of profit or \nloss, but made it possible to consolidate a fixed return in line with the Group’s medium-term return objectives, while at the same \ntime improving the profitability profile of a portion of the securities portfolio for subsequent years. \nIn addition, in the first part of the year, the following were entered into: (i) management hedging transactions of the yield on the \ndeposit with the MEF of funding from the Public Administration, with the aim of making it less susceptible to changes in the yields \nof government bonds;(ii) forward sale contracts with value date 2023 in order to start the capital gains realisation programme \nwithin the framework of the pro-active management of the portfolio for the year 2023.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, considering the rise in rates and the narrowing spread, transactions were carried out to sell securities \nhedged with asset swaps and related derivatives, and transactions to purchase domestic government bonds with a 10-year \nmaturity.\nDuring the second half of 2022, against a backdrop of widening Italian credit spreads and rising Eurozone government bond \nyields, forward purchases of securities were made in order to start the programme of early renewal of investments maturing in \n2023.\nPOSTAL SAVINGS NET INFLOWS \n(€m) \nAt 31 December 2022, Postal Savings Net Inflows amounted to approximately -€11.1 billion, approximately €5.8 billion less \nthan in 2021. This negative change affected both products in the segment. A contraction of around €3.9 billion was recorded \non savings books compared to the 2021 figure, due in part to the lower propensity to save linked to the particular national and \ninternational economic context, inflationary pressures and the recovery of consumer spending. In addition, net inflows for the \nyear were affected by outflows from institutional customers related to the general economic scenario (-€1.7 billion). Finally, the \ncomparison with the previous year is not homogeneous: in fact, twelve pension accruals were credited in 2021 as a result of \nthe health emergency-related provisions, compared to eleven in 2022 (the March 2022 pension accrual, credited at the end of \nFebruary, was the last accrual paid in advance), resulting in lower net inflows of €1.5 billion. \nWith regard to Postal Interest-bearing Certificates, the change compared to the 2021 figure is negative by about €1.9 billion; this \nchange was due to early redemptions of €33.6 billion (+109% compared to 2021) and redemptions of certificates that matured \nduring the year (albeit 23% lower than in 2021), which occurred mainly in the first half of 2022 and was partly mitigated by new \nannual subscriptions of €43 billion, up 42% compared to the 2021 figure, which regained momentum following the adjustment \nof yields on the products included in the offering that began on 6 July 2022.\nSaving Books\nInterest-bearing Postal Certificates\n2021\n2022\n(4,479)\n(8,427)\n(819)\n(2,699)\n(11,126)\n(5,298)\n-110.0%\n(5,829)\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n212\nSummary\nSection"

      "text": "SOLVENCY RATIO PERFORMANCE  \n \nThe Poste Vita Group’s Solvency Ratio  stood at 253%95 at 31 December 2022, down on the 261% reported at December \n2021 (-7 p.p.), and remains well above the regulatory requirements and management’s expectations (200%).\nThe change in the period is due to an increase in available own funds (+24 p.p.) as a result of the dynamics of the interest rate \ntrend (+290 bps 10-year swap rate) and the BTP-Swap spread (+64 bps 10-year spread), which on the one hand cause an \nincrease in Own Funds, due to the decrease in technical provisions partially offset by the reduction in the market value of invest-\nments, and on the other hand, an increase in the capital requirement.\nThe increase in the Capital Requirement (-35 p.p.) is mainly due to higher underwriting risks and specifically the “lapse risk” . \nThe latter is calculated, as per the standard formula96, by assuming a 40% lapse scenario for policies. In an economic context of rising \ninterest rates, such as that experienced during the year, the value of policies became more profitable. It follows that with the increase \nin interest rates, the “mass lapse “ scenario envisaged by the aforementioned formula becomes more valuable (i.e. increases the \nvaluation of the related risk), even though the level of actual lapse s has remained substantially stable. The increase in lapse risk was \nnot offset by the reduction in other risks, mainly represented by the lower market risk due to the conditions of the economic scenario \nof the period.\nOn 29 July 2022, the Parent Company increased Poste Vita’s capital endowment by subscribing to a capital instrument, subordinat-\ned for €500 million, under terms and conditions that allow it to be counted as core capital (“Restricted Tier 1” or “RT1”). This capital \nstrengthening is aimed at optimising the company’s capital structure and supporting the future growth and development of the Poste \nVita Group’s business.\nThe Company also signed a treaty to hedge the mass early lapse risk, referring to Class I and Multi-class products, which allows \nfor an increase in the 2022 Solvency Ratio (+30 p.p.). Against the current backdrop of economic uncertainty, the current outlook for \nthe Italian insurance market suggests that early policy termination behaviour by customers may show increasing trends in the future, \nalthough this phenomenon is not evident in the Company’s portfolio to date.\n95.\tThe Transitional Measures , which set the Solvency Ratio at 31 December 2021 at 285%, cannot be adopted at 31 December 2022 because the value of the technical \nprovisions calculated under Solvency II is lower than the value of the statutory technical provisions. The indicator takes into account the dividends expected in favour of the \nParent Company for the year 2022. The value of the Solvency Ratio is currently undergoing the annual review process and will be communicated to IVASS by 19 May 2023.\n96.\tCalculation formula provided by IVASS for the calculation of the capital requirement of insurance companies that do not adopt the internal calculation model.\n261%\nΔ Own funds\nΔ Solvency \ncapital requirement\n10Y SWAP (bps)\n(35) p.p.\n+24 p.p.\nSpread BTP-SWAP 10Y \n(bps)\nDec 2021\n253%\nDec 2022\n30\n-7 p.p.\n87\n320\n151\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n222\nSummary\nSection"

In \naddition, Data Center consolidation activities continued during the year, which saw the closure of the Rozzano (MI) site. \nIn the Financial Services Strategic Business Unit, total investments amounted to €60 million and mainly related to the expan-\nsion of the Postal Savings, Life and Funds product range with a multi-channel perspective and the improvement of the customer \nexperience.\nWith regard to the Insurance Services Strategic Business Unit, design activities continued in 2022 to support industrial \ndevelopment and the continuous functional/infrastructural improvement of the most important business support systems, as \nwell as the interventions to adapt the systems to comply with regulatory obligations.

The following contributed to this change:\n \nz lower trade receivables of €329 million and higher trade payables of €205 million; \n \nz decrease in other receivables and assets net of other liabilities of approximately €355 million (mainly due to the change in tax \nitems related to the operations of the Insurance Services and Financial Services Strategic Business Units).\nThe reduction of working capital by €889 million ensured a lower financial requirement and an internal source of financing, allow-\ning liquidity to be freed up.\nWith regard to trade receivables, the focus in 2022 was on monitoring late payment situations and improving overdue credit \nrecovery activities. Specifically, the prevailing activities focused on systematically sending reminders, reducing the time for block-\ning the service for customers in arrears, and speeding up the dispatch of irrecoverable files to the legal department. \nDuring the year, the Group continued its efforts to set up direct channels with customers in arrears in order to understand their \nreasons and take action to make the collection process more effective. These activities ensured significant improvements in the \nreduction of collection times for both past and current receivables. \nWith specific reference to receivables from the Public Administration, there was a significant reduction in receivables from Cassa \nDepositi e Prestiti due to the new invoicing and collection schedules set forth in the current Convention.\nOn the other hand, the increase in trade payables is mainly attributable to changes in the group’s perimeter due to the corporate \ntransactions of the year, the inflation increase and the increase in investments.\nThe balance of Sundry provisions and Other assets/liabilities at 31 December 2022 amounted to €716 million and decreased \nby €1,182 million compared to 31 December 2021 mainly due to higher net deferred tax assets of €1,053 million (largely due to \nthe negative changes in the fair value of financial instruments classified in the FVOCI category) and the reduction in employee \nseverance indemnities for €217 million, partially offset by the increase in provisions for risks and charges for €88 million (mainly \nbuildings involved in  \nthe Smart Building project  \nat 31 December 2022\n~1,600\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

Investments in tangible and \nintangible assets of €751 million also contributed to the formation of non-current assets, partly offset by amortisation, depreciation \nand impairments of €538 million. Right-of-use assets recorded a positive change of €95 million, which mainly took into account \nacquisitions during the year for new contracts and renewals of existing contracts in the amount of €291 million (mainly related to the \nrental of company vehicles for mail and parcel delivery activities), positive adjustments of €37 million for contractual changes during \nthe year, and depreciation and amortisation for the period of €208 million. The value of equity investments increased by €1,078 \nmillion compared to 31 December 2021 mainly attributable to the effect: i) of the subscription, on 9 September 2022, of PostePay \nSpA’s paid capital increase totalling €700 million aimed at providing the company with the financial resources needed to complete \nthe acquisition of LIS Holding SpA, which was finalised on 14 September 2022; ii) of the recapitalisation, on 3 August 2022, of Poste \nVita SpA through the subscription of a subordinated, non-convertible capital instrument, with perpetual duration and a non-call period \nof 10 years, totalling €500 million, aimed at strengthening its Solvency Ratio; iii) of the purchase on 24 February 2022 from Poste \nVita SpA of 100% of the share capital of Poste Welfare Servizi S.r.l for a total of €70 million; iv) of the capital contribution, on 14 April \n2022, to Poste Welfare Servizi S.r.l for a total of €55 million aimed at providing the company with the financial resources necessary for \nthe acquisition of the company Plurima SpA; v) of the adhesion, on 28 October 2022, by Poste Italiane SpA to the voluntary public \ntender offer for the shares and warrants issued by the company Sourcesense SpA with a total investment of €30 million; vi) of the \nacquisition, on 13 October 2022, of a 70% shareholding in the company Agile Power S.r.l and indirectly of the entire Agile Lab Group, \nfor a total of €18 million, which provided for the payment by Poste Italiane in favour of the founding shareholders, who will retain the \nremaining 30%, of €13 million and the subscription of a paid capital increase in favour of the companies of €5 million; vii) of the merger \nby incorporation into Poste Italiane SpA of the subsidiary PSIA S.r.l, effective as of 1 November 2022, which generated a merger sur-\nplus totalling €330 million, recognised in the specific equity reserve. In addition, on 29 September 2022, the Information Technology \nbusiness unit of BancoPosta Fondi SpA SGR was transferred to Poste Italiane SpA with effect from 1 October 2022.\nNet working capital at 31 December 2022 amounted to €3 million and decreased by €644 million compared to the end of \n2021, mainly due to the combined effect: i) of the decrease in trade receivables mainly attributable to the decrease in receivables \ndue from Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (-€365 million) due to the new billing and payment methods on a monthly basis and no longer \non a quarterly basis, introduced by the Agreement of 23 December 2021, effective from 1 January 2022; ii) of the increase in \ndeferred income mainly due to the non-repayable contribution (€125 million) received in advance from Poste Italiane SpA for the \nrealisation of the “Polis - Casa dei servizi digitali” project; iii) of the increase in the total liability that Poste Italiane SpA has towards \nits subsidiaries in its capacity as tax consolidator (+€113 million). \nThe balance of Provisions for risks and charges amounted to €1,257 million (€1,169 million at the end of December 2021) \nand mainly includes provisions for early retirement incentives of €352 million (€515 million at 31 December 2021); this reflects the \nestimate of liabilities that the Company committed to irrevocably incur, under the current arrangements agreed with the unions, \nas a result of a certain number of personnel taking voluntary early retirement by 31 December 2024.\nThe balance also includes the provision of €320 million for risks on tax credits under Law 77/2020. \nProvisions for disputes with third parties regard the present value of expected liabilities deriving from different types of legal and \nout-of-court disputes with suppliers and third parties, the related legal expenses, and penalties and indemnities payable to cus-\ntomers. At 31 December 2022, the provision amounts to €265 million (€265 million at 31 December 2021). Movements during \nthe year primarily regard updated estimates of liabilities and uses to cover liabilities settled.\nProvisions for operational risks relating to liabilities arising from transactions conducted within BancoPosta and amounting to \n€109 million at 31 December 2022 decreased compared with the balance at 31 December 2021 (€134 million). The net absorp-\ntions for the year, totalling €12 million, mainly reflect the prescription of certain stocks related to the funds transfer business and \nthe adjustment of estimates of risks related to the distribution of postal savings products as well as fraud.\nThe Provision for personnel expenses amounts to €101 million (€120 million at the end of December 2021) to cover expected \nliabilities arising in relation to the cost of labour, which are certain or likely to occur but whose estimated amount is subject to \nchange. They have increased (€89 million) to reflect the estimated value of new liabilities and decreased as a result of past con-\ntingent liabilities that failed to materialise (€33 million) and settled disputes (€75 million).\nThe net balance of Deferred Tax Receivables (Payables) as at 31 December 2022 was positive in the amount of €1,223 mil-\nlion (insignificant balance as at 31 December 2021); the change in the period was largely attributable to the net positive tax effect \non the net negative change in the fair value reserve of investments in available-for-sale securities. \nEquity amounted to €3,808 million and decreased by €3,227 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to the movement \nin the fair value reserve(-€3,326 million), which essentially reflects the fluctuations (positive and/or negative) from the valuation \nof investments classified in the FVTOCI category, as well as the payment of the 2021 balance and the 2022 interim dividend to \nshareholders (-€799 million) and the change in the cash flow hedge reserve (-€93 million).

These regulations describe BancoPosta’s operating model, its organ-\nisational structure and the related responsibilities assigned to the various functions, as well as the processes for assigning \nBancoPosta’s business functions to Poste Italiane and for outsourcing BancoPosta RFC.\nThe process of “Governance of Assignments and Outsourcing” of BancoPosta RFC, already subject to review in 2018, was \nfurther strengthened, lastly in June 2022, with reference to the scope of the activities assigned and/or outsourced, with a view \nto improving the quality of processes.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, preparatory activities were started for the renewal of the Specifications106 expiring in December \n2022. In accordance with the deadlines set out in the regulations, the Disciplinary Rules for Essential or Important Functions \n(EIFs) and Control Functions updated for the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2025 were sent to the Bank of Italy on \n28 October for the relevant checks (so-called “Prior Notice”).

The change in the item is mainly due to the higher income from investments in tax credits purchased \nwith reference to the Relaunch Decree No. 34/2020 (subsequently converted into Law No. 77/2020) and the investments with \nthe MEF of deposits from postal current accounts belonging to public customers, whose yield is variable and is calculated on a \nbasket of government bonds.\nInterest expense, which is essentially attributable to current account transactions, repurchase agreement transactions and collat-\neralisation of derivative transactions, amounted to €172 million and was up compared to €91 million in 2021 (+€81 million equal \nto +89%). The change in this item is mainly due to the increase in interest paid to public customers on postal current account \nbalances.\nNet fee and commission income amounted to €3,238 million, down 2.5% from €3,321 million in the same period of the pre-\nvious year (-€83 million). Fee income amounted to €3,454 million, a decrease of €135 million (-3.7%) compared to 2021. The \nnegative change mainly reflects the effect of lower revenues from postal savings collection and commissions on slips, and is \nmitigated by an improvement in insurance brokerage revenues, higher commissions received for the placement and promotion \nof products issued by PostePay, and the repricing of commissions on account-keeping with customers. Fee expenses amounted \nto €216 million, down from €267 million in 2021 (-€51 million, or -19.1%).  The negative change was mainly due to lower costs \naccrued under the service contract signed with PostePay SpA.\nThe Profits/(Losses) on trading (negative by €68 million) and hedging (positive by €18 million), is attributable respectively to the \neffect of charges generated by derivative instruments entered into to hedge the index linked component to which the remunera-\ntion of government borrowing is linked, and the positive effect of the ineffectiveness component of existing hedging derivatives.\nNet income from disposals of financial assets amounted to €335 million, down on the €407 million of 2021 (-€72 million, -17.7%).\nProfits/(losses) on financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through Profit or loss is positive and equal to €1 million, \nmainly due to the positive change in the fair value of the Visa Incorporated shares.\nNet operating expenses, which totalled €4,633 million, included administrative expenses of €4,627 million and other operating \nincome of a negative €6 million. Administrative expenses were up 4.1% year-on-year, and operating income was down from the \npositive €8 million recorded in 2021. \nNet provisions for liabilities and charges showed a positive balance of €21 million, compared to a negative balance of €48 million \nin the previous year. This positive change was affected by the revised estimate of certain risks related to the distribution of the \nmoney order product and legal disputes with third parties relating to BancoPosta’s RFC.\nNet adjustments and reversals for credit risk amounted to -€1 million (+€4 million as at 31 December 2021). The item reflects the \ncombined effect of higher charges related to value adjustments linked to Expected Credit Losses on the securities portfolio and \nreversals related to the release of an impairment provision to cover an impaired loan, collected in early 2023.\nAfter taking into account taxation for the period of €231 million (€189 million at 31 December 2021), net profit for the year 2022 \nfor BancoPosta RFC amounted to €602 million, an increase of €94 million (equal to +18.5%) compared to the previous year \n(€508 million).\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n248\nSummary\nSection"

The decrease in this \nitem is mainly due to the change in the fair value of securities in the portfolio, amounting to €10,126 million, only partially offset by \nthe positive balance between sales/redemptions and new purchases of securities, amounting to €5,405 million.\nFinancial assets measured at amortised cost amounted to €46,576 million (€53,733 million at 31 December 2021, -€7,157 \nmillion) and are attributable both to investments in Italian government bonds and securities guaranteed by the Italian government \nfor €27,699 million (€33,110 million at 31 December 2021, -€5,411 million) and to sundry deposits and receivables for €18,877 \nmillion (€20,624 million at 31 December 2021, -€1,747 million). \nWith regard to Financial Assets relating to investments in bonds issued by the Italian government and backed by the Italian gov-\nernment, the reduction for the year was the combined result of the reduction in the fair value of securities hedged with fair value \nhedge derivatives (-€5,398 million) and the negative balance between sales/redemptions of securities and new purchases (for \n-€42 million). With reference to Financial Assets referring to deposits and sundry receivables, the decrease of 1,743 compared to \n2021 was mainly due to the reduction in: (i) loans and deposits with the MEF of €804 million (from €14,697 million at 31 December \n2021 to €13,893 million at 31 December 2022); (ii) guarantee deposits of €2,401 million (from €4,858 million at 31 December \n2021 to €2,457 million at 31 December 2022); (iii) trade receivables for €18 million (from €818 million at 31 December 2021 to \n€800 million at 31 December 2022); these changes are partially offset by the increase of €171 million in receivables relating to \nthe balance of cash transactions on which collections and payments with third parties are settled through Poste Italiane, which \nwent from €178 million at 31 December 2021 to €349 million at 31 December 2022 and the increase in accounting changes in \nloan repurchase agreements for €1,358 million.\nThe change in loans and deposits with the MEF is mainly attributable to lower funding from the Public Administration; the reduc-\ntion in guarantee deposits is mainly attributable to the improvement in the fair value of hedging derivatives, recorded both on \nthe assets and liabilities side of the balance sheet offset by higher deposits paid as collateral in repo liabilities, as the fair value of \npledged securities decreased.\nHedging derivatives with a positive fair value at 31 December 2022 amounted to €6,109 million (€873 million at 31 December \n2021, +€5,236 million). The change is mainly due to the overall rise in interest rates, which has a positive impact on the fair value \nof the derivatives portfolio, as these are, for the most part, interest rate swaps to hedge the securities portfolio, which transform \nthe yield of the latter from fixed to variable.\nTax assets amounted to €1,157 million, an increase of €874 million compared to €283 million as of 31 December 2021, mainly \ndue to changes in deferred tax assets in equity or to changes in valuation reserves. \nOther Assets, which amounted to €11,521 million (€8,838 million as of 31 December 2021, +€2,683 million), increased sub-\nstantially due to tax credits acquired by Poste Italiane SpA and allocated, net of offsets, to BancoPosta RFC, and recognised at \n31 December 2022 at €8.6 billion (with a nominal value of approximately €9.7 billion).\nThe principal liabilities are represented by financial liabilities, hedging derivatives, tax liabilities, other liabilities and provisions.\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortised cost amounted to €98,944 million (€95,799 million at 31 December 2021, \n+€3,145 million) and include: (i) amounts due to customers of €86,094 million (€85,098 million at 31 December 2021, +€996 \nmillion) attributable to funding through current accounts, repurchase agreements and payables for guarantee deposits paid by \ncounterparties; (ii) payables to banks for €12,850 million (€10,701 million at 31 December 2021, +€2,149 million) attributable, \nalso in this case, to current account relationships and repurchase agreement transactions and payables for deposits in guarantee \npaid by the banking counterparties.\nFinancial liabilities held for trading, amounting to €4 million, represent the fair value of derivative instruments entered into to \nhedge the fair value of the Visa shares mentioned above.\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n250\nSummary\nSection"

The report contains information on the outcomes of the audit of the services contracted out by BancoPosta to Poste \nItaliane’s Functions under operating guidelines and the activities outsourced to providers external to the Company. The activity \nrevealed a situation of overall adequacy with the highlighting of certain aspects of attention addressed by management with \nspecific strengthening actions.\nThe Annual Report, presented to the Board of Statutory Auditors and the Board of Directors, was subsequently submitted to the \nBank of Italy. The specific section regarding investment services was, on the other hand, submitted to CONSOB.\nThe final audits were in part performed with reference to the findings of Poste Italiane’s Internal Auditing function, which is respon-\nsible, in accordance with the specific operating guidelines for the IT audit and the audit of the local units and distribution channels \nwithin Poste Italiane’s network, which are responsible for BancoPosta’s processes and products. \nInternal Auditing has also drawn up the Annual 2023 and Multi-year (2023-2025) Audit Plan, based on a risk assessment pro-\ncess designed to ensure adequate coverage of BancoPosta’s Business Process Model, including risks, changing aspects of the \nbusiness, regulatory issues and BancoPosta RFC’s organisational structures. \nThis Plan has been presented to the Board of Statutory Auditors and submitted for the attention of the Board of Directors.\nRisk management system\nBancoPosta RFC has an independent Risk Management unit, responsible for ensuring, among other things, in collaboration \nwith the Group Sustainable Development, Risk and Compliance function of Poste Italiane SpA, an integrated, retrospective and \nprospective view of the risk environment and of BancoPosta RFC’s capital and organisational adequacy.

      "text": "BancoPosta RFC events after 31 December 2022\nNo significant events occurred after the end of the financial year that would have an impact on the result.\nOutlook for BancoPosta RFC\nIn the Postal Savings segment, monitoring of developments in the economic context will continue in order to adapt the range of \nproducts offered to market conditions and changing customer needs, including with the introduction of new products issued by \nCassa Depositi e Prestiti. In the course of 2023, activities aimed at developing and releasing projects supported by appropriate \ncommunication activities and aimed at expanding the digitalisation of customers and improving the customer experience on all \nsales channels will continue. Specifically, an evolution of the Libretto Smart is planned that will allow for an improvement in the \nfunctionalities and services that customers can use from an omnichannel perspective.\nWith regard to Investments, the expansion of the product range will continue with the launch of new products. A new combined \noffer between a restricted current account and a plan of scheduled deposits into mutual funds will also be launched: the mechanism \ninvolves the deposit of an initial sum into the current account and subsequent monthly transfers from it to a managed mutual fund.\nIn the Personal Protection segment, a restyling of the personal line products is planned, which aims to simplify accident and \nhealth covers, including the new Temporary Death coverage. The first quarter of 2023 will see the start of the release of the new \ncoverage and underwriting process for Credit Protection Insurance, the optional coverage provided to customers taking out a \nBancoPosta loan.\nIn the area of Business Protection, in the second half of 2023, the new collective policy ‘Poste Welfare Infortuni’, dedicated to \ncovering the risks of occupational and extra-professional accidents of employees of contracting companies, will be placed at \npost offices through the network of Small Business Specialists.\nWith regard to Pensions, new developments are planned with regard to the advisory platform used in Post Offices concerning \nthe internalisation of the cost sheet and refinements on the target market.\nIn the current account segment, with a view to improving the digitalisation of the BancoPosta account, a revised BancoPosta app \naccount opening application service will be made available in early 2023, introducing various simplifications, including customer \nidentification via SPID and digital omni-channelling, i.e. the ability to switch from the app channel to the web and vice versa during \nthe application process. \nAs of 1 April 2023, as market rates structurally return to positive territory, the current account fee will decrease due to the rein-\nstatement of conditions prior to the increase on 1 July 2022. BancoPosta, in fact, had undertaken to monitor the trend of the \nmonthly average of the 6-month Euribor rate in order to verify that the conditions that had led to the increase in the aforemen-\ntioned charges were no longer in place. In the course of 2023, the possibility of opening the BancoPosta account in the corners \nwithin many post offices will be activated in order to increase the possibility of access to the service, and the sales front end of \nthe current account will be migrated to the Single Front End in order to simplify the sales process and bring it into line with that \nalready operating for other products. \nIn the area of credit cards, in view of the changed market scenario, which saw an increase in the operating costs incurred by the \nissuer Deutsche Bank, during the first quarter of 2023, the fee for the Classica and Gold credit cards issued from the start of the \nplacement to 31 December 2020 will increase. Excluded from this change are cards reserved for the categories of Employees \nand Pensioners of the Poste Group and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and Employees and Pensioners of the Companies subject to \nthe management and coordination of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti for whom, in the first quarter of 2023, Deutsche Bank will replace \nthe existing cards, operating on the Mastercard international payment circuit, with new cards adhering to the Visa international \npayment circuit.\nIn the first half of 2023, corporate financing will be further enhanced by the launch of a new partnership. The extension of the \nQuinto BancoPosta offer to employees of other “semi-public” companies is also planned for the first quarter of 2023.\nWith regard to Business and Public Administration current accounts, developments for the migration from all lists to the “Conto \nBancoPosta Business Link” will be completed during 2023. In addition, new digital services such as the SEPA Instant Credit \nTransfer  (SCT instant) will be developed.\nDuring 2023, the cash disbursement of the livelihood contribution will continue at the Post Office network in favour of persons \nfrom Ukraine seeking temporary protection and who have found independent accommodation, as provided for in the Convention \nsigned with the Civil Protection Department. \nFor further information, please see the Business Outlook for the Poste Italiane Group.\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

The General Section provides a description, adapted to the \nbusiness specificity of Poste Italiane, of the contents explicitly required by Legislative Decree \n231/2001, (e.g. the regulation, the governance of the Company, the Supervisory Board, training/\ninformation activities, the system of sanctions, etc.) as well as the Company’s integrated internal \ncontrol and risk management system (e.g. the integrated risk management process, the Com-\npany Regulatory System, the Group’s Code of Ethics and Policies, the Corporate Governance \nSystem); the individual Special Sections outline, according to a logic based on processes, the \ndifferent types of offences concretely and potentially relevant in the Company, as well as the cor-\nporate processes, sensitive activities, rules of conduct and specific control principles analysed for \neach class of offence. \nIn Poste Italiane’s Model 231, sustainability issues are also of significant importance, in line with \nthe Company’s current strategic direction and in consideration of the correlations and synergies \nbetween them and Decree 231.

In this document, Poste Italiane affirms its com-\nmitment to adopting criteria of conduct that exclude conflicts \nof interest with the Group and promote the ability to make \ndecisions that are consistent with the Company’s objectives; \ncriteria that avoid corruption, money laundering and terrorism \nand that encourage conduct of integrity, while respecting the \nhealth and safety of workers and protecting the privacy of all \nthe recipients of the Code.\nIn addition to the Code of Ethics, the Company adopted a \nGroup Integrated Policy, which reflects and documents the \ncommitment made to all Company’s stakeholders, to improve \nits performance and, at the same time, build and develop \ntrusting relationships with them, as part of a process of gen-\nerating and sharing value for the Company as well as for the \ncommunities in which it operates, with a view to achieving \ncontinuity and reconciliation of the related interests. In order \nto further emphasise the central importance of Integrity and \ntransparency issues in relations with all the Group’s stake-\nholders also in line with the requirements of ISO 37301 - \nCompliance Management Systems, the Integrated Policy was \nintegrated with the principles and activities related to compli-\nance management.\nIn addition, Poste Italiane has set up a reporting system \nand an Ethics Committee with the task of managing reports \nand violations.

This Model has been for-\nmalised in the Integrated Compliance Guideline, drafted in \nline with best practices and in particular with the provisions \nof the new ISO 37301:2021 (Compliance Management \nSystems), becoming a further fundamental pillar for the \nstrengthening of the SCIGR, with the specific purpose of \nguarding against the risks of non-compliance to which the \nGroup is exposed, thus fully implementing the principles of \nintegrity, transparency and legality.\nMoreover, in line with the Group’s Integrated Compliance \nProcess and in order to respond to the Group’s opening to \nthe international market as a result of significant agreements \nand the acquisition of foreign companies, Poste Italiane has \ndefined the Foreign Compliance Process that disciplines \ngovernance aspects and reporting flows to and from the \nParent Company, as well as the operating procedures at the \nlevel of individual Foreign Group Companies for the execu-\ntion of the various compliance activities.  \nR\nis\nk\n \nA\ns\ns\ne\ns\ns\nm\ne\nn\nt\nC\no\nm\np\nli\na\nn\nc\ne\nScenario and requiremen\nt \nanalysis regulatory amen\nd\nm\ne\nn\nt\ns\nR\ne\np\no\nr\nti\nn\ng\nC\no\nm\np\nli\na\nn\nc\ne\nC\no\nm\npl\nia\nn\nc\ne\nM\no\nni\nto\nri\nn\ng\nC\no\nm\npl\nia\nn\nc\ne\nRi\nsk\n T\nre\nat\nm\ne\nnt\nGovernance\nCultura\n& Formazione\nGuideline\nGroup Integrated Compliance\nPoste Italiane\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n262\nSummary\nSection"

In par-\nticular, the objectives set out in the document concern: \nensuring compliance with competition and consumer pro-\ntection rules, of which no violation is tolerated; strengthening \nawareness and disseminating knowledge about the impor-\ntance of competition and consumer protection regulations; \nconsolidating an operating and control environment that \nmitigates the risk of commission of antitrust and anti-com-\npetitive offences as well as violation of consumer protection \nregulations; providing guidance to prevent actions, behav-\niours and omissions that violate competition and consum-\ner protection regulations, and outlining monitoring tools to \nidentify any violations.\nOn 28 November 2022, Poste Italiane’s first Compliance Day “Compliance, a strategy for global chal-\nlenges”was held. Its purpose was, on the one hand, to bring together Poste Italiane’s Compliance \nProfessional Family in an institutionalised format, with the contribution to the work of the heads of \nimportant Compliance functions at central level and within the Group, and, on the other hand, to main-\ntain the training profile, broadening the participation to the heads of corporate functions and structures \naffected by the widespread application of regulations and by the management of compliance risks. \nThe event, which took place in the Palazzo delle Poste in Piazza San Silvestro and virtually via the Mi-\ncrosoft Teams platform, involved around 1,400 participants, of which 40 in attendance (managers and \nmembers of the main functions within the Compliance professional family) and the remainder through \na remote connection (managers and executives responsible up to the fifth level of the Group).\nIn line with Poste Italiane’s commitment to disseminating the culture of Compliance at all levels in a \ncontext - characterised by the health emergency, the economic crisis and geo-political instability - that \ncontinues to confront the Company with increasingly demanding challenges, the event was an oppor-\ntunity for all Poste Italiane’s Compliance people and professionals to meet and exchange views, which \nsaw the commitment also of the Top Management reaffirmed in the operational and daily management \nof non-compliance risks as an essential component of the strategy for sustainable development.\nPoste Italiane’s \nCompliance Day: \n“Compliance, \na strategy \nfor global \nchallenges”\nISO 37301 “Compliance management systems - Requirements with guidance for use” governs \nthe elements necessary for an organisation to develop, implement, maintain and improve an ef-\nfective Compliance Management System, focusing on the importance of spreading a culture of \ncompliance within the organisation that contributes to the pursuit of sustainable success. In April \n2022, Poste Italiane was the first company in Italy to obtain this certification from IMQ for the \nmanagement of Integrated Compliance to oversee the processes of design, development and \ndelivery of Postal, Financial and Logistical Services in the areas of administrative, accounting and \nfiscal responsibility.\nIn 2022, Poste Italiane also obtained ISO 37002 “Whistleblowing”, an international standard aimed \nat providing a comprehensive guide to help organisations define, develop, implement, and effec-\ntively maintain a Management System on the process of receiving and handling whistleblowing.\nPoste Italiane \nobtains \nISO 37301 \nand ISO 37002 \ncertifications\nCompliance with the UNI ISO 37001 standard, relating to anti-corruption management systems, \nrepresents an opportunity for Poste Italiane to strengthen its commitment to fight corruption and \ncontribute to consolidating the principle of legality, with obvious benefits for the protection of the \nCompany’s reputation and assets. As far as Group companies are concerned, after Poste Vita, \nPostePay, BancoPosta Fondi SGR, SDA Express Courier head office and Poste Assicura obtained \nthe certification (as of 2019), in 2022, EGI and Postel also obtained this certification, which was \nextended to the territorial areas of SDA Express Courier.\nEGI and Postel \nobtain the \nISO 37001 \ncertification \nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

The Protocol also stipu-\nlates that Poste Italiane shall assist in the work of prevention and law enforcement by sharing with \nGuardia di Finanza its wealth of information against unlawful acts in areas of institutional interest \ncarried out also by exploiting technological and IT means. Under the agreement, Poste Italiane will \nmake available to Guardia di Finanza the data in the “Identity Check” system, which will be useful for \ninvestigations to prevent and repress fraud and any other offence of an economic or financial nature. \nThe Protocol also establishes regular meetings to review the progress of the collaboration and share \ninformation on new fraud scenarios and initiatives to be implemented.\nPoste Italiane \nand Guardia  \ndi Finanza  \ntogether to ensure \nlegality and \ntransparency\nGuardia di Finanza\nThrough the Memorandum of Understanding with Arma dei Carabinieri, Poste Italiane consolidates \nthe rooting of company rules and regulations in its processes and strongly reaffirms - internally and \nexternally - the organisation’s position on issues of legality, safety at work and training.

      "text": "In 2019, the Group introduced the Green Procurement func-\ntion in order to report on ESG issues within its supply chain \nmanagement on a timely basis. This function is able to ensure \na constant integration of sustainability issues within tender pro-\ncesses and ESG criteria in the technical evaluation of offers. \nThe definition of highly relevant projects, such as logistics, \ndecarbonisation of buildings, consumables, and by promoting \na focus on resource utilisation, investment plans and techno-\nlogical development, together with the greening of more tradi-\ntional requirements, promotes the achievement of the sustain-\nable change objective.\nThe upward trend in Environmental, Social and Governance \nindicators is matched by the significant increase in the ESG \nrelevance of the technical offer, measured in over 6 percent-\nage points compared to last year, with the stable presence \nof criteria related to Environmental Management (65%), \nOccupational Health and Safety (64%), Attention to People \n(53.3%) and Integrity and transparency (52.3%). By encour-\naging the adoption of ESG criteria for selecting, evaluating \nand monitoring suppliers, as well as mitigating any ESG risks, \nPoste Italiane pursues the goal of increasing the effective-\nness of business processes and competitiveness. In line with \nprevious years and with the aim of combining sustainability \nin terms of reducing environmental impacts and rationalis-\ning costs, Poste Italiane Group has adopted the criteria set \nforth by the Green Public Procurement, implementing, where \napplicable, the Minimum Environmental Criteria (MEC), estab-\nlished by specific Ministerial Decrees. Furthermore, the ESG \nmodel in the Group’s procurement process was implemented \nthrough the introduction of specific Integrity and transparency \n(Governance) criteria.\nIn the supplier qualification phase, in order to monitor their \nperformance, Poste Italiane implemented a rating meth-\nodology characterised by the adoption of a customised \napproach, which resulted in the definition of an ad hoc ques-\ntionnaire for each supplier (100% of qualified suppliers). The \nmodel is risk-based, as it allows for an assessment of how \neach provider manages the ESG risks identified as relevant \naccording to the company’s sector and size. As far as the \nsector is concerned, suppliers are classified by the Group \nwithin the 99 recognised ATECO sectors. As each sector \nis characterised by specific risks depending on the nature, \nthe companies belonging to it are also affected by them \nand, consequently, are evaluated according to them. Poste \nItaliane used internationally recognised external references \nto identify the various types of risk, identifying around 40 \nmain ones (environmental, social and socio-environmental). \nFor each risk considered relevant to the sector in question, \nan evaluation of the companies is carried out considering the \nspecific safeguards adopted to mitigate the negative impact \nof the individual risks examined. With regard to the size of \nthe organisation, on the other hand, which according to the \nEuropean Commission’s regulations can be small, medium \nor large, the Company highlighted 8 main Governance risks \npotentially relevant for the suppliers under assessment.\n \nSubsequently, the information obtained is analysed and pro-\ncessed through the definition of an ESG scoring process \nthat involves, for each aspect analysed, the attribution of a \nrating for each relevant risk and a total ESG rating. \nThese elements provide the model with the following \nstrengths:\n \nz assessment focused on the supplier’s relevant ESG risks, \nthrough the use of a specific questionnaire for each eco-\nnomic sector (risk-based approach);\n \nz strength of the analysis thanks to the use of a quantitati-\nve algorithm, which guarantees the attribution of a rating \nwhich is extremely representative of the level of risk cove-\nrage guaranteed by the supplier;\n \nz risk visibility on different levels, with the opportunity to \nanalyse ESG risk at the aggregate level, at the level of \nsingle E/S/G aspects, and at the level of individual risks;\n \nz accurate identification of areas for improvement based on \nthe rating given to the way individual risks are managed;\n \nz facilitated completion of the questionnaire, characterised \nby multiple closed answers;\nPoste Italiane’s Vendor Rating (VR) system stems from the need to provide the Company with a system \nto measure the performance of suppliers and to evaluate them in the ESG sphere. This system rep-\nresents an essential element of the supply chain, as it aims to define and implement a scoring model \nthat allows for an accurate assessment of suppliers in relation to quality, safety, punctuality and envi-\nronmental compliance of the services offered, as well as commercial behaviour and billing accuracy. \nThe tool thus enables Poste Italiane to make informed choices on the purchase of goods and services. \nThrough this system, all suppliers who carried out activities in the reporting period and were linked to \nPoste Italiane by contracts such as framework agreements and spot contracts were evaluated.\nPoste Italiane’s \nVendor Rating \nsystem\nSpecific ESG Ratings\nassigned for the selection of suppliers  \non the basis of the controls  \nused to manage the  \nvarious relevant risks\n100%\nof suppliers classified  \nby ATECO sector and size\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

      "text": "Staff training  \nand development\nFor Poste Italiane, human capital plays an extremely impor-\ntant role, as a distinctive element for the achievement of cor-\nporate objectives and an essential aspect for the creation of \ncompetitive advantage. Precisely for this reason, the Group \npromotes and invests in staff training courses that are able \nto prepare people to deal effectively with the demands of an \never-changing business. In particular, the role of training with-\nin the Company is a fundamental aspect of the process of \ncontinuous development of personal and professional skills, \ntargeted at each person in the Group. With this in mind, \nPoste Italiane, through the adoption of innovative formats and \nknowledge sharing tools, is constantly striving to improve the \nlearning experience in order to simplify access to training con-\ntent and ensure continuity of learning.\nThe Company, in line with the Code of Ethics, expresses its \nwillingness to recognise and value the importance of the indi-\nvidual contribution of each member of the Company’s work-\nforce, undertaking to guarantee equal opportunities in career \npaths to all employees, without distinction.  \nThe Group considers training an essential lever for achieving \ncompetitive advantage in the market, constantly promoting its \ninnovativeness and continuity\nConsistent with the Strategic Plan, the training activities are \npart of a much broader project, which, in accordance with \ncorporate principles and the needs of the market, customers \nand regulations, envisages the provision of around 25 million \nhours of training in the 2020-2024 five-year period. In order \nto promote the smooth running of training activities, in 2015, \nthe Company established the Corporate University, identi-\nfied as a Human Resources function that, through organisa-\ntion in various Academies, delivers training on different busi-\nness contents, depending on the skills to be developed. The \nCorporate University aims to define and guarantee the con-\nduct of the training process in its entirety (including operational \ntraining). In particular, the “Training and Operational Training” \nProcedure, addressed to all corporate functions and all person-\nnel, describes the Group’s operational training model, explain-\ning the operating mechanisms and organisational ownership \nof training and operational training activities. The logic guiding \nthe Procedure is geared towards ensuring the effectiveness, \nefficiency and conformity of the expected results, through the \nintroduction of organisational and control measures that are \nalso relevant pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01. In addi-\ntion, the procedure complements other more specific policies/\nprocedures for areas of activity/organisational functions that are \nbeing updated (e.g. funded training, BancoPosta training, etc.). \nIn 2022, the training plan focused on specific drivers identified \nwith a view to promoting and accelerating the implementation \nof the Strategic Plan, in particular:\n \nz innovative content: push on digital skills development, mul-\ntichannel, business development and new business;\n \nz processes: re-focusing processes on the customer, \nby designing tools and solutions for simplification and \nstreamlining;\n \nz skills and costs: continuous investment in staff skills, in line \nwith the Plan objectives, and a continuous push on the \nrecovery of funded training.\nIn 2022, the learning experience improved through the intro-\nduction of new innovative formats, such as the learning \ngame mode, but also through the continuous updating of the \ne-learning platform, which allows simplified access to all train-\ning content, and the adoption of digital learning tools used for \nspecific training objectives.\nIn addition, the use of the Open Learning Area content, freely \naccessible by the entire corporate population for on-demand \nuse of the training offer, is confirmed. The learning area ena-\nbles staff to choose their own training in a self-development \nperspective.\nA total of approximately 6 million training hours were provided \nduring 2022. In response to the various training needs relat-\ned to the Group’s different businesses, training courses were \ndeveloped for specific targets (e.g. tellers, post officers and \nwomen, customer service employees, salespeople) for the \nacquisition, consolidation and development of the specialist \ntechnical skills of the related role. Cross-training courses were \nalso provided on issues oriented towards the adoption of \ncultural tools and models addressed to all company person-\nnel, regardless of their specific role. Finally, through individual \ntraining courses, especially dedicated to developing resourc-\nes, skills useful for more complex roles were strengthened. \nThere were numerous free-participation initiatives dedicated \nto updating and acquiring digital and innovation skills. Among \nthese, the “Digital Voices” programme saw voluntary partici-\npation in a rich cycle of webinars and online content with the \naim of opening a window of observation on the external con-\ntext, analysing the influence of digital on markets, to increase \nthe predictive capacity required for the development of the \nGroup’s businesses.\nThrough the involvement of various organisational functions, \nthe Corporate University represents the core of the training \nprocess and ensures the governance of the entire training \nprocess itself.

Also in the Faculty area, the \ninternal teaching staff was enriched with a new trainer figure \n- the instructor trainer - to manage teaching in operational \ncontexts. In addition, Poste Italiane’s School of Coaches in \n2022 expanded the number of new coaches engaged in the \ndevelopment of high-potential staff and in the support dur-\ning the return to work of fragile resources, including young \nmothers. The other two Academies, on the other hand, \nfocus on transversal core competencies. Specifically, the \nManagerial Academy oversees the development of mana-\ngerial skills for senior roles, professionals and talents who \nwill fill more complex roles, while the Digital Academy and \nInnovation ensures the design and development of online \ncourses and the re-engineering of learning processes and \ntools.\nFinally, there is a Planning and Governance function that \ndeals with the consolidation of the training plan and the peri-\nodic monitoring and control of progress.\nWith the aim of exploiting the synergies of tools, methodolo-\ngies and competencies, in May 2022, the Education initiative \nwas merged into the Corporate University. Its objective is to \npromote campaigns, initiatives and opportunities for discus-\nsion aimed at stimulating dialogue with citizens and increas-\ning customer confidence in products and services.\nThe training process starts with the annual Training Plan, \nwhich incorporates the training needs expressed by the \nlines consistent with the objectives of the Strategic Plan. \nListening to and collecting training needs is, in fact, the first \nstep in creating pathways and designing refresher, role-en-\nhancing and skills-building interventions for the entire popu-\nlation, from new recruits to managers.\nIn addition, the HR Business Partner functions are also \ninvolved through the figures of the training contact persons \nand the resources working in cross-services in the Human \nResources macro-area.\nIn order to verify the achievement of the set training objec-\ntives, the Group has implemented a monitoring and control \nsystem shared periodically with the business lines, which \nincludes: \n \nz a general KPI system monitored on a monthly basis throu-\ngh the verification of:\n\t– hours of training provided (by function/area);\n\t– percentage of coverage;\n\t– value of perceived quality;\n\t– advancement of external costs;\n\t– recovery progress from Fondi;\n \nz a specific control system for the individual training initiati-\nves that evaluates:\n\t– effectiveness, i.e. the ability to achieve the training \nobjectives of the individual course through the pass \nrate of the end-of-course test;\n\t– participation rate;\n \nz specifically for compliance training, there are additional \nperiodic reporting and monitoring systems for the control \nfunctions. In particular, on the progress of the training plan \nin terms of hours, participation, intervention backbones \nand trends, the Company has provided monitoring of utili-\nsation for specific training campaigns being delivered.\nIn addition, the Company has provided for periodic audits \nby internal/external control functions (internal audits/certi-\nfying bodies/supervisory authorities) that assess the model \nadopted.\nTo support the monitoring system, Poste Italiane uses a num-\nber of additional tools such as surveys or focus groups in \norder to improve the design of the initiative and assess the \neffectiveness of the learners. The Company also pays close \nattention to the role of the media (the company website, \nPoste News, interviews on the TG Poste) in order to make \npotential employees aware of the importance of the training \ncourses on offer. Finally, through long-term partnerships with \nleading business schools and suppliers, the Group has made \navailable constantly updated training content that optimises \nthe procurement process.\nFor the improvement of systems, processes and strategies \nPoste Italiane, projected towards the achievement of sustain-\nable business success, uses People Analytics, also known as \nHR Talent or workforce analytics, i.e. the practice of collecting \nand analysing organisational human resources data through \nthe application of statistics and other data techniques. In par-\nticular, the Group used People Analytics practices in 2022 for \nthe following purposes: \na.\t strategic workforce planning through the collection of the \nneeds of the various business lines combined with the \nmanagement levers available (market recruitment, transfor-\nmations from part-time to full-time, mobility flows, etc.) with \nthe aim of defining the medium-term workforce framewor-\nks consistent with the requests. The Group anticipates \nand guides workforce dynamics through People Analytics \ntools, considering in particular the use of incentive redun-\ndancies as a low-impact lever for controlling surpluses and \ndirecting prospective trends in resource deployment.

This metho-\ndology develops statistical and graphical models (maps) \nallowing for the study of the emergence of informal networks \nin the organisation, at the same time enabling the redesi-\ngning/restructuring of formalised organisational structures.\nIn addition, as part of its People Analytics practices, the \nDevelopment function uses a series of additional data (per-\nsonal, organisational, performance and potential data, etc.) \nfor defining, monitoring and initiating people development \nand enhancement paths based on business objectives. The \nintegration and analysis of such data provides a clear pic-\nture of employees with distinctive skills and performance, to \nbe taken into account for possible access to evaluation pro-\ngrammes for potential or for possible activation of pathways \nto specific roles. In particular, POP (Process for Intercepting \nPotential Young People) and MLAB (Process for Intercepting \nSolid Professionals and Managers) are the Company’s main \nscouting processes, which are managed with pre-defined \naccess criteria (e.g. performance, company seniority) and \nallow the identification of eligible individuals. In both initia-\ntives, it is possible to collect a specific amount of information \non the potential that has emerged, with both qualitative and \nquantitative indications referring to the preservation of the \nLeadership Model’s capabilities. In addition, as part of the \nHR Digital actions, an area of the Intranet called “Services \nfor People” was set up, which outlines the services offered \nby the Company . The aim is to evolve the relationship model \nbetween employees and HR according to criteria of usability, \nsimplicity, transparency and personalisation. To this end, the \nGroup has implemented a pilot project for about 400 employ-\nees concerning an assistance tool available in the same area, \nthrough which the people involved can communicate with HR \nin a simple, transparent and fast way. This further innovation, \nthe extension of which is being considered, will enable the \nsystematic and constant collection of data useful not only for \nthe type of requests and problems received, but also for the \nclarity of the services offered and the effectiveness of commu-\nnication with Human Resources.\nAs part of its training model, the Group always pays close \nattention to compulsory regulatory training, which refers to \ncross-cutting issues and is aimed at the entire company pop-\nulation (Safety at Work, Legislative Decree 231/01, GDPR, \nIntegrated Quality and Corruption Prevention System, etc.) \nand specific training aimed at specific professional figures \n(e.g. ESMA/IVASS and Air Safety training).\n2.893 million\nhours of training for compliance\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of each Sub-\nsidiary to assess any additional training needs in this area, taking into account the specific activi-\nties carried out by its employees and the operational and organisational peculiarities of the Com-\npany. Moreover, within the scope of the training initiatives promoted for the managerial roles of the \nPoste Italiane Group, the following training events on the topics of Legislative Decree 231/01 “The \ntypes of corruption offences” and “Market protection and corporate offences” were introduced.\nGDPR \nSince 2019, the Group has been delivering the online course “The GDPR - General Data Pro-\ntection Regulation”, which aims to provide an overview of the new features introduced and the \nobligations established by the General Data Protection Regulation EU 2016/679, focusing on the \nprinciple of accountability and the security measures that the data controller and data processor \nmust take in order to ensure the protection of personal data. The course ends by outlining the \nrelevant supervisory authorities, means of redress and sanctions in the event of a breach of the \nRegulation. The initiative is intended for all Poste Italiane Group staff, as part of the mandatory \ntraining programme. In addition, for the resources that have the role of Data Processing Delegate, \nof Compiler to support the delegate and their collaborators involved in the activity of keeping the \nprocessing register, the Company has organised training workshops on the subject of “Data Pro-\ncessing” delivered through webinars that provide an overview of the organisational and regulatory \naspects of the GDPR, focusing in particular on the management of data processing, and aim to \nstrengthen accountability and specific knowledge on the subject of personal data processing.\nIT security\nLike in previous years, the Group continued the delivery of the online course “Cyber Security”, \nwhich illustrates the topic of cybersecurity, highlighting its importance in relation to the many \naspects of professional life on which it can impact. The initiative is intended for all Poste Italiane \nGroup staff. \nAntitrust\nSince May 2021, Poste Italiane has been delivering the training webinar “New Group Compliance \nProgrammes - Integrated Compliance and Antitrust Compliance” aimed at the Group’s manage-\nment figures. In addition, since January 2022, the Company has started delivering the online \ncourse “Group Integrated Compliance”, which promotes awareness of the guiding principles of \nthe “Integrated Compliance Programme” adopted by Poste Italiane.\nThe course presents the main corporate regulatory tools through the analysis of the reference \nguidelines and contributes to the creation and dissemination of a corporate culture that is aware \nand attentive to the issue of compliance as a strategic objective and fundamental value of the \nCompany. The training initiative is intended for resources working in the Group’s central and ter-\nritorial staff functions. Training continued with a further online course entitled “Compliance for \ncompetition and consumer protection” delivered for the same target group in February.\nAnti-corruption  \nIn continuity with the previous two-year period, training activities continued for all Poste Italiane \nGroup personnel on anti-corruption, describing the integrated Quality and Anti-Corruption Man-\nagement System that Poste Italiane has adopted, focusing on the provisions of the relevant regu-\nlations and, through the description and analysis of concrete cases, on the good practices to be \nfollowed to ensure quality and prevent corruption.\nAnti-money laundering and anti-terrorism\nIn 2022, the usual ESMA/IVASS induction and refresher training programmes were delivered in \nline with the financial and insurance industry regulations, with a particular focus on Anti-Money \nLaundering and Ethics.

There are both \ninstitutional pathways that accompany newly appointed man-\nagers in their new role for the development of competencies \nin an inter-functional perspective, fostering an exchange of \nvalue, both personal and professional, and training initiatives \nin support of the Diversity & Inclusion Plan aimed at develop-\ning skills related to the Corporate Leadership Model. In addi-\ntion, the Group has implemented training measures aimed in \nparticular at Executives, using innovative formats, to strength-\nen managerial skills capable of generating an acceleration in \nthe ability to govern complexity.\nSustainability and corporate policies\nIn this area, the Group continued with the provision of two courses in 2022 in continuity with the \nprevious two-year period: \n“Business and Human Rights Protection”, an online training programme open to all employees \nand aimed at promoting the knowledge and dissemination of the guiding principles adopted by \nthe UN Human Rights Council. The course contents are produced and certified by SIOI (Italian \nSociety for International Organisation), which can be taken through digital learning. \n“Document Management”, a course intended for all Poste Italiane Headquarters personnel, down \nto the third organisational levels, which describes the “Document Management” procedure, es-\nsential to ensure that Poste Italiane’s Corporate Regulatory System achieves its objectives. The \nRegulatory System regulates both the reference principles, architecture and life cycle of regulatory \ndocuments and the roles and responsibilities of the various players involved in the document man-\nagement process. It is therefore fundamental that these players, when drafting or updating com-\npany documents, know and apply the rules defined by the “Document Management” Procedure;\nTransport safety and dangerous goods  \nThe Group has organised “Air Security” training courses aimed at the resources involved in en-\nsuring - for air freight - that security checks are carried out on cargo or mail in accordance with \nthe regulations and in liaison with ENAC. In particular, they are made up of “Initial Training” and \n“Periodic Update Training” separated according to the activities/role performed.\nIn addition, in order to ensure the safety of employees driving HGVs, the Group organised “CQC \n- Carte Qualificazione Conducente” training for them. Again, the course consists of an “Initial \nTraining” (CQC issue) and a subsequent “Periodic Update”. \nFinally, with a view to ensuring regulatory compliance of the services provided by Poste Italiane \nwith regard to the transport of dangerous goods, the Company provided courses on “Dangerous \nGoods”. Organised training is differentiated according to the mode of transport. For air transport, \nthe “Dangerous Goods Regulation” course was delivered, a specific training activity to support \nresources in the proper handling of dangerous goods. With regard to road transport, on the other \nhand, the course “ADR: European Agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous \ngoods by road” was organized.\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

The Group also invested in important training projects, involving \nthe commercial structures of the Private Market and the Corporate and Public Administration \nMarket. In 2022, in line with the regulations of the financial and insurance sector involving the \nCommercial, Customer Service and internal trainers of the BP - Channel Product Support func-\ntion, the usual ESMA/IVASS 60 and 30 hour induction and refresher training programmes were \ndelivered; the mapping of development and training needs (annual assessment) was carried out \nfor both the financial and insurance sectors, with particular focus on Anti-Money Laundering and \nEthics. In December, the 30-hour ESMA tests valid for maintaining the ISO 22222 investment \nadvisory service certification of MP’s sales network were completed. The year saw the completion \nof the training course on aligning the specialised skills of the Financial Claims Management func-\ntion in SAC, which will provide for an annual refresher course from 2023 onwards. In the area of \nCustomer Operations, in particular in the area of Customer Service, training initiatives were carried \nout focusing on the importance of the relationship with the customer and the ability to interpret \nhis needs, as well as on the evolution of the omnichannel value assistance model with a view to \nproactivity and addressing the MP sales network. In the Postal and Logistics area, training initia-\ntives were carried out, in continuity with last year, to foster the orientation towards transformation \nthrough the dissemination of the Lean methodology as a cultural model and approach to work, as \nwell as specific projects concerning postmen and women and other professional figures, thus also \nstrengthening management and operational effectiveness. In particular, training courses were held \nfor Quality Managers and Safety Specialists, with the aim of enhancing integration, proactivity and \ncross-functional relations. Finally, with specific reference to counter operators, the training activity \non relational proactivity aimed at understanding customers’ needs and seizing business opportu-\nnities in synergy with the sales network was completed. To further support technical expertise and \nwith a view to continuous improvement, training initiatives were carried out on the Methods-Time \nMeasurement (MTM) methodology and on the design of internal micro-logistics flows. In the area \nof Information & Communication Technology (ICT), numerous training activities were carried out \nto develop, strengthen and update specialised IT skills. Given the highly specialised and broad \ncontext of Information Technology, the acquisition of an ICT Catalogue of over 4,000 courses \nmade it possible to cover the thematic macro-areas of interest, supporting the training of specif-\nically qualified structures. For Group companies, we highlight the training initiatives implemented \nby SDA to pursue innovation and optimisation in order to meet future challenges related to new \nbusiness, and the training activities carried out by Poste Air Cargo to maintain and develop the \nspecific knowledge of flight and maintenance personnel.\nFinancial Services\nThe Group provided various training activities for the BancoPosta function aimed at learning and \nconsolidating specialised skills and digital skills. During 2022, various initiatives were carried out \nto support the specialist figures dedicated to BancoPosta and BancoPosta Fondi SGR functions, \naimed at supporting specific skills in the area of market scenario and evolution; ad hoc training \nmeasures, in line with regulatory provisions, were also carried out on Compliance and Anti-Money \nLaundering issues, in response to the mapping of skills carried out and aimed at targeting the train-\ning actions to support them. Finally, training activities were carried out at BancoPosta Fondi SGR in \n2022 with the aim of strengthening skills in various areas such as:\n \nz mandatory regulatory: “Knowledge and Competence” course, “Relevant Personal Transactions” \nworkshop (Market Abuse), “Group Business Continuity Management” training and anti-money \nlaundering regulatory training;\n \nz technical specialisation: in-depth analysis of regulatory and civil law aspects applicable to AMC \nin the areas of taxation, inheritance, seizures, privacy; non-banking financial intermediary financial \nstatements; advanced bank risk analysis; corporate credit analysis; financial markets-investment \nchoices and uncertainty factors; the new outsourcing framework between Bank of Italy transpo-\nsition of EBA guidelines and new ESMA guidelines on the cloud;\n \nz managerial: delivery of webinars with SDA Bocconi.\nDiversified skills \ndevelopment \nwithin the Poste \nItaliane Group\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n284\nSummary\nSection"

Effectiveness is measured by means of learning \ntests at the end of the training activities, while efficiency is \nidentified as the ability to achieve the aforementioned objec-\ntives through consistent use of the available economic and \norganisational resources. Finally, quality is measured through \nquestionnaires investigating the degree of employee satisfac-\ntion with the various levels and areas of the training offer.\nThe development system\nThe Development, Change Management and Digital HR \nFunction ensures the growth of the business through the \nvalorisation of people, with a view to employee experience, \ncapturing potential and talent, supporting motivation and \nenhancing experience. Specifically, the function accom-\npanies the evolution of the Company’s culture by promot-\ning the change of mindset, behaviour and modus oper-\nandi of employees in a logic of diffuse leadership, whose \nmain drivers are responsibility, integration and collabora-\ntion. Moreover, through an integrated system of develop-\nment policies, programmes and tools, People Review and \nengagement processes, the Group favours an organisa-\ntional culture focused on the person in all his or her expres-\nsion, both personal and professional.\nEach initiative is dedicated to heterogeneous target pop-\nulations belonging to all corporate functions and all Group \nCompanies. Particular attention is paid to ensuring equal \nopportunities in participation in terms of age, gender, func-\ntional and geographical affiliation, always taking into account \nthe entry criteria specific to each initiative.\nThe Development System is built on the following 3 pillars \nthat integrate an articulated set of processes, tools and \nmethodologies:\n1.\t scouting: allowing the differentiation of growth opportuni-\nties according to target audience and level of professional \nmaturity. Scouting programmes contribute to enhancing \ntalent through activities to detect and develop the poten-\ntial of resources;\n2.\t management planning: aimed at identifying develop-\nment priorities with a view to succession and the reduction \nof “managerial risk”;\n3.\t development: to accompany people in their growth and \nexpand the enhancement of skills in relation to company \nand business needs.\nConsistent with the objective of enhancing business per-\nformance by attracting and developing talent, the Group’s \nDevelopment System can be seen from an employee expe-\nrience perspective, favouring a culture that focuses on the \nindividual and his or her needs.\nAll Development, Talent and Change Management initiatives \nare periodically communicated to the corporate population \nthrough the main internal (TG Poste, newsletter, corporate \nIntranet, etc.) and external (social media, specialised press) \ncommunication channels.\nInsurance Services\nThe aim of the training for the Poste Vita Group (Poste Vita, PosteAssicura) was to update the skills of \nthe various professionals. In particular, the updating of skills has concerned regulatory and compliance \nissues specific to the insurance sector (IVASS regulations, Legislative Decree 231/01, Anti-Money \nLaundering and Anti-Terrorism, Quality and Anti-Corruption, GDPR Privacy, Information Security, Fraud \nManagement, Occupational Safety, Sustainability and Company Policies, ISO 9001 and 37001, Data \nQuality, Business Continuity Plan, Company Regulatory System, Privacy-Processing Register). In addi-\ntion, training initiatives were focused on specialised knowledge development topics (Actuarial training, \nLife and Non-Life insurance product updates, Innovation, Finance, ESG, Fintech, SQL Server standard \ntraining, insurance anti-fraud). Finally, in line with the previous year, ample space was reserved for the \ndevelopment of soft skills, new talent development and managerial skills.\nPayments and Mobile\nThe training courses for Postepay continue to focus on cross-cutting topics, with a focus on digital, \nfinancial and professional effectiveness. The Group promoted the strengthening of skills in banking, \nservice design and ICT.  In order to support managerial development and the acquisition of skills on \ncore issues for the Company, 24 “Executive Lab” courses and annual Master’s courses with stra-\ntegic and innovative content were provided, organised by the Luiss Business School, Fondazione \nCUOA and Scuola Palo Alto. Finally, for specialised training of particular relevance, the “EU Telecoms \nRegulation Master Programme” organised by the Cullen International SA School, which aims to \nprovide a comprehensive overview of regulatory issues and developments in telecommunications \nin the sector; the “Master Program in Advanced Data Science and Quantitative Finance” organised \nby the ARPM School, which addresses topics related to quantitative risk management and portfolio \nconstruction.

In addition, the establishment of the Development, \nChange Management and Digital HR function enabled the \nmaximisation of integration between the scouting, develop-\nment and People Review processes, as well as initiating a \nHR digitisation process within a broader HR and Organisation \nservice evolution strategy.\nThe main drivers directing activities are as follows:\n \nz expand knowledge of people, their skills, potential and \nmotivation, to support business functions in defining talent \npipelines at various seniority levels; \n \nz consolidate People Review processes aimed at the shared \nidentification of talents and the implementation of develop-\nment paths dedicated to them;\n \nz greater impact on the corporate population through a more \nwidespread use of development tools and their consolida-\ntion with a view to continuous improvement;\n \nz promote and systematise the use of relation-based deve-\nlopment programmes, such as mentoring and coaching, \nas enablers for the enhancement of the skills needed for \nchange management; \n \nz ensure equal opportunities in participation in development \nprogrammes, also considering the broadening of career \nprospects for women; \n \nz improve people’s involvement and motivation through bot-\ntom-up processes of participation in initiatives with a stra-\ntegic focus; \n \nz experiment with innovative tools for the promotion of new \nmodels of work, interaction and collaboration;\n \nz improve the knowledge of the initiatives activated and their \nimpact on the organisation, through the activation of multi-\nple channels and communication opportunities. \nPoste Italiane, in order to consolidate its sustainable development strategy, launched in November \n2021, “INSIEME 24 SI’”, the platform for collecting ideas and contributions aimed at the entire \nGroup population. It transversally involves the different areas of the Company’s organisation, con-\nsistent with the objective of responsible growth and the process of digitalisation and social cohe-\nsion, promoting proactivity, innovating and creating shared value. In the context of Poste Italiane’s \nStrategic Plan, “INSIEME 24 SI” represents a space in which the contribution of all stakeholders, \nas contributors, can be taken into account for the purposes of the Plan’s implementation, fitting \nwithin the eight pillars of the sustainability strategy. The initiative is cyclical: the first edition, which \nended in June 2022, saw in its main stages the participation of around 100 teams, comprising a \ntotal of 350 people, in an innovation marathon, the Bootcamp, during which the proposed ideas \nwere discussed in greater depth and pitches presented to the jury of in-house managers. From \nthe Bootcamp, 10 proposals were selected that followed an incubation path typical of start-ups: \nthe teams, comprising a total of 56 people, working with the agile/sprint methodology and thanks \nto internal mentors and external tutors, produced a prototype that was presented to top manage-\nment during the final event. These 10 prototype solutions, thanks to the sponsorship of business \nfunctions, are currently being consolidated and implemented so that they can become concrete \nprojects capable of generating a positive impact inside and outside the Company.\nThe best three ideas further pursued the development of skills related to innovation and sus-\ntainability through participation in the training initiative “Entrepreneurial mindset & Launch your \nstart-up”, developed in collaboration with LUISS Business School. The experience, aimed at \nstrengthening the entrepreneurial approach, allowed the participants to interface with the start-up \neco-system in an immersive way, reflecting on possible internal barriers and facilitating the pro-\ncess of changing existing processes.\nIn September 2022, the 2nd edition was launched. Since the start of the programme, more than \n1,300 ideas submitted by employees have been proposed and evaluated, and as of January \n2023, 2,000 people are registered on the platform as contributors, putting their skills at the dis-\nposal of the Company and the ideas collected.\nBoth editions saw wide participation and engagement, also witnessed by the accesses to the \nintranet and campaign news (27,000 in the 1st edition, over 21,000 in the 2nd edition, until Janu-\nary 2023) and the “likes” receive during the “social” scoring of the ideas of the two waves (about \n18,000 in both the 1st and 2nd editions).\nINSIEME 24 SI” \nplatform\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n286\nSummary\nSection"

      "text": "With regard to people development and the promotion of \nprofessional development, the Group, in line with its work \nin previous years, digitally delivered scouting programmes \nto intercept potential and capabilities that could feed the \ntalent pipeline at various organisational levels. The pro-\ngrammes are part of a digital structure that spans and \nsupports all process steps. Ad hoc platforms allow opti-\nmal access from all devices, both fixed and mobile, thus \nincreasing the efficiency of both dispensing times and the \nenvironmental impact of dispensing in terms of CO2 emis-\nsions and zero paper use.\nThese initiatives return information both with respect to the \nlevel of potential that has emerged and integrated quanti-\ntative and qualitative indications regarding the monitoring \nof the Leadership Model’s capabilities, the orientation of \nparticipants and their motivation. These are:\n \nz POP: the process of identifying high potential young people \nwith limited company seniority, that are inserted, according \nto predefined criteria, in a process of assessment and pro-\nfessional orientation, functional to growth towards mana-\ngerial roles. The process is directed by internal Assessors \ncertified for the digital management of the assessment and \nsubsequent development sessions; \n \nz MLAB: the process of intercepting established professio-\nnals and managers, with consolidated experience in the \nrole of manager to be developed on positions of greater \ncomplexity. This path has also been entirely redesigned in \na digital perspective.\nFollowing the assessment of potential, both programmes pro-\nvide specific interventions to strengthen the profile of skills \ndetected, which find in coaching a privileged support tool. In \naddition, managerial scouting processes, aimed at targeting \nrising middle managers towards roles of greater responsibil-\nity, were further expanded, providing for individual solutions \nalongside those of the Group. Both programs received a pos-\nitive evaluation from the participants with respect to the level \nof usefulness, the degree of professionalism of the Assessors \nand the appreciation of the IT tools made available for use.\nIn addition to the scouting processes, the Leadership \nAssessment programme is aimed at senior managers, with \na view to supporting executive development policies, design-\ning career paths and succession plans. Consistently with the \nDiversity & Inclusion objectives that Poste Italiane has defined \nto support the 24SI strategy, the 2022 programme envisaged \nthe priority involvement of female managers, mainly identified \nas potential ‘successors’ to positions of greater complexity. \nWith this initiative, Poste Italiane proposes further support for \nthe growth of leadership development skills.\nWith the aim of increasing the number of resources involved \nin the potential assessment processes, also involving popula-\ntions not eligible for the scouting programmes already in place \n- POP, MLAB, Leadership Assessment - the significant invest-\nment in the use of smart potential assessment tools, usable \nonline, continued and, thanks to the speed of delivery, allowed \nto involve +397% of people compared to 2021. In particular, \nthis new approach was used in the People Review processes, \nfor the valorisation of PCL postmen and, in MP, for the identi-\nfication of Branch Operations Management Referents.\nThe results of the potential, together with the performance \ntrend and seniority, have guided the structured launch of the \nPeople Review, a Group talent enhancement process involv-\ning the business lines together with RUO in a cross-sectional \ncomparison, aimed at bringing out a shared concept of talent \nwithin the organisation. \nIn 2022, the People Review involved PCL, DTO and Marketing. \nLine managers and HR managers met with a talent pool of \nabout 700 resources to define accelerated development solu-\ntions and to expand the pipeline of candidates to fill business \npositions, also from a cross-Group perspective. In 2022, the \nBlooming Programme, a programme of development initia-\ntives dedicated to personal ‘blossoming’, was launched for \nidentified talent.  \nWith regard to the introduction of innovative tools, in the area \nof skills development, the initiative SkillGym was confirmed, fol-\nlowing the successful pilot test carried out in 2021. In 2022, \nmore than 1,000 employees were involved in practising “critical \nconversations” to strengthen soft skills related to managing the \nfeedback process, through the use of a digital platform that pro-\nvides simulated environments guided by artificial intelligence.\nCoaching activities were also enhanced in 2022, carried out \nby coaches both internally and externally, which involved \nmanagers and young talents in transversal skills enhancement \ncourses. The number of coachees increased by 81% over the \nprevious year, with a significant presence of women (+159% \nvs 2021). A specific programme was then launched - Mums \nat Work - which involves employees returning from maternity \nleave, accompanying them in their effective reintegration into \nthe Company through dedicated coaching courses. The initi-\native is consistent with the Support for Active Parenting Policy, \nlaunched in 2022, which defines the Company’s framework to \nsupport both women before and after motherhood and the \n481\npeople involved in the POP and MLAB \nprogrammes in 2022\n+397% vs 2021\nresources involved in massive scouting\n+159%\npresence of women in coachee  \nactivities compared to 2021\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

      "text": "evolution of the concept of shared parenting. An empowering \nasset within the Policy is the role of leaders and managers \nin creating an environment of trust and engagement for the \nexpression of each employee’s personal and profession-\nal abilities. In order to accompany the cultural and social \nparadigm shift, continuous dialogue, through anticipatory \nplans and time-structured moments, is an enabling lever \nto spread a growing awareness of the value of differences \nand inclusion. The Policy therefore introduced manage-\nment and caring processes that offer a concrete response \nto male and female workers in innovative ways, approach-\nes and perspectives.\nAgain with a view to enhancing the value of people in line \nwith the talent expressed, expertise and results achieved, is \nthe “Territorial Development Paths” project which, in continu-\nity with 2021, has defined specific paths for key roles in the \nterritory, through co-planning between central and territorial \nHR functions and Line, in an agile manner and capable of \nstrengthening, at the same time, the development skills of the \nfunctions concerned. \nMarket pressures and the continuous drive for change require \npeople to become increasingly engaged and motivated, put-\nting the concepts of responsibility, autonomy and flexibility \nat the forefront. In this context, Poste Italiane’s mentoring \nprogramme has evolved, establishing itself as a stable and \nwidespread process throughout the Company as a space \nof exchange for managerial best practices and different role \nmodels. In 2022, more than 440 mentors and mentees were \nactive within the Company with a significant presence of \nwomen (+72% female mentees and +47% female mentors \ncompared to 2021). Mentoring ensures the expansion of a \nglobal vision as it allows a comparison between diversity of \ngender, age and experience. Cross-fertilisation, i.e. transver-\nsality between functions and integration between centre and \nterritory, is the main driver of the programme as it promotes \nmentorship relationships between managers and profes-\nsionals from different areas and functions.\nIn connection with the 2022 Middle Managers evaluation cam-\npaign, the evaluation and feedback tools were further con-\nsolidated, with regard to a greater involvement of managers \nboth in providing information on the development potential of \nemployees and in being empowered, through a specific tar-\nget, to be the main sponsors in their development. The roles \nof the team leader and team members were introduced into \nthe evaluation process as additional providers of feedback on \nthe performance of employees involved in cross-functional \nprojects. This approach allows the direct manager to broaden \nthe view of his or her staff and take this into account in the \noverall performance evaluation.\nThe use of the Oracle HCM Cloud Platform from 2021 allows \nintegrated management of people evaluation and develop-\nment processes. The platform made it possible to rethink the \nevaluation process as a pivotal process for people’s devel-\nopment. Precisely because of the relevance and centrality of \nindividual competence and performance development, the \nevaluation process is called the Performance Development \nPlan (PSP).\nThe PSP is based on conscious engagement and motivation \nof people, combined with a culture of results and collabora-\ntion. Achieving the goals of involvement and participation is \ncontingent on making the links between organisational and \nindividual goals clearer and more transparent, along with \nstrengthening communication processes to make people \nmore aware of their potential for development and growth and \nof their own role.\nFeedback is a pivotal element of the PSP as a tool for growth \nand constructive confrontation that ensures continuous \nimprovement leading to a feed-forward logic based on possi-\nble future improvement actions and solutions.\nIn line with the positive activities undertaken over the past three years, a new edition of Corpo-\nrate Mentoring was launched in 2022, involving 81 aspiring mentors in a learning-oriented group \ncoaching course. The Corporate Mentoring programme, coordinated by the Development and \nPerformance Management function, is part of the personal development initiatives and aims to \nensure a circularity of experience and leadership between company managers (Mentors) and \nemployees (Mentees), through an exchange of values that is enhanced by the logic of inclusion \nand diversity in all its facets (generational, gender, territorial, cross-functional).

This provides:\n \nz self-assessment, with which to give an opinion on the \nachievement of goals and the skills implemented during \nthe year, also for the purpose of further comparison during \nthe feedback interview;\n \nz self-assignment of objectives, both operational and deve-\nlopmental, with the possibility of direct monitoring of the \nprogress of the assigned objectives; \n \nz participation in the evaluation of employees and project \nleaders for members of cross-functional teams. \nThe rest of the corporate population, from 2021 onwards, \nsaw the introduction in the PSP of ad hoc questionnaires for \nproject information and scouting and people review process-\nes, which allow individuals to express their interests, motiva-\ntions, professional orientation and suggestions for improving \nintegration and inclusion in work teams.\nTaking into account the experience of the platform evalua-\ntion cycles, specific working tables were implemented for the \ndesign and implementation of evolutionary practices and for \nthe simplification of the process, tools and system with the \naim of increasing staff participation.\nAn important role within training is certainly covered by cross-training activities, which enable knowl-\nedge to be increased on topics common to several professional families, developing skills from an \ninter-functional perspective and fostering an exchange of value, both personal and professional.\nA significant cross-cutting initiative, carried out during 2022 together with the Corporate Protection \nfunction, was dedicated to the topic of Eco-Driving. This activity is part of the actions implemented \nby Poste Italiane to contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions in the air and raise awareness of \nenvironmentally sustainable driving.\nThe Corporate University also has two in-house Academies that focus on transversal core com-\npetencies, namely the Managerial Academy, which oversees the development of managerial com-\npetencies for senior roles, and the Digital Academy and Innovation, which ensures the design and \ndevelopment of online courses, the re-engineering of learning processes and tools, and scouts for \ninnovative training solutions.\nDigital is a cross-cutting area but it is vital to every activity in the Company. For this reason, several \ninitiatives were carried out during 2022 to increase employees’ skills in this area, such as the “Digital \nVoices” programme.\nIn addition, activities aimed at developing managerial skills related to the Business Units in Post, \nCommunication and Logistics (PCL) continued with training on the Lean methodology (Lean Acad-\nemy), while in the Private Market, courses were developed for Sales Managers and Operational \nManagement Managers aimed at strengthening their roles following the revision of the territorial \norganisational model.

In 2022, the \nGroup increasingly considered responsibilities related to the \ncare and well-being of people through actions aimed at con-\nsolidating the welfare system and spreading the corporate \nculture with initiatives for employees and their families. In \naddition, Poste Italiane pays increasing attention to aspects \nsuch as the personalisation of caring, reconciliation, the sup-\nport and growth of the younger generations, the protection \nof the fragile and the strengthening of the sense of belonging \nand corporate identification\nThe needs of individuals, as well as the improvement of the \nconditions of the entire workforce, are at the heart of Poste \nItaliane’s welfare strategy, and it is around these issues that \ninitiatives are implemented every year to promote the well-\nbeing of each individual\nPoste Italiane is committed to promoting activities that aim to \nimprove the well-being of its employees, enabling easier living \nconditions and promoting better work performance. The ini-\ntiatives are implemented in the process of strengthening staff \nengagement, as a prerequisite for the realisation of a positive \ncorporate climate that ensures social well-being and productiv-\nity levels aligned with business objectives.\nThe implementation of the corporate welfare system is char-\nacterised by the adoption of an integral vision of the person, \nwhich goes beyond the work dimension, capable of taking \ncharge of the individual’s experience, also in the social, fam-\nily and territorial dimensions, and by increasing attention \nto listening to and enhancing individual contributions in a \nlogic of greater involvement towards common and shared \nobjectives.\nWith the aim of keeping welfare initiatives up-to-date, the \nGroup adopts internal policies and specific procedures that \naim to constantly recognise the emergence of new needs. In \nthis regard, the Company uses company networks and dedi-\ncated working tables to develop benchmarks, while it makes \nuse of internal and external questionnaires and surveys for \nemployee satisfaction surveys. In addition, an intergenera-\ntional vision is adopted in the process of designing and devel-\noping the welfare plan, combined with targeted analyses of \ngender, age, professional characteristics, family situation and \npossible vulnerability of the people involved in the initiatives to \nsupport them throughout their life cycle.\nThe path taken by the Group has enabled it to gain expe-\nrience and strengthen collaborative and cross-functional \nworking methods characterised also by participatory models \nin bottom-up logic, because they enable a virtuous path in \nterms of identification, trust and a sense of belonging, which \nconstitute an important link in the adequacy of welfare poli-\ncies. This makes it possible to maximise, on the one hand, \nthe qualitative and quantitative impact, in terms of the oppor-\ntunities offered to people, and, on the other hand, it makes it \npossible to facilitate a faster implementation for the pooling of \ndifferent competences and skills.\nThanks to the adoption of more and more timely and targeted \nwelfare policies, it has been possible to identify certain behav-\niours that promote personal and organisational well-being:\n \nz disclosure: what the Company does for its people must \nbe brought to the knowledge of the entire organisation, \nwithout intermediaries or cascading processes through the \nhierarchy;\n \nz proactivity: managers, the HR function and employees \nmust be mutually active in order to foster the dissemina-\ntion of values and plans that support people’s well-being;\nNFS\nMAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL\nPoste Italiane, in its strategic business vision, aims to increasingly and constantly foster the integration \nof social and relational dimensions in order to improve its competitive positioning in the market. This \nhas led the Company to play a primary role in a wider context than its business scope. The social vo-\ncation towards sustainable growth models, proximity to the territory, and the ability to establish a close \nbond with people has, therefore, led the Group to outline a new backbone of intervention towards \ncommunity welfare logics, in synergy with local communities for corporate welfare services to support \nthe vulnerabilities of employees and citizens.  \nThe Company aims to make community welfare solutions and services available both to employees \nand their families and to local citizens, through forms of collaboration with the Third Sector and local \nauthorities. The plan therefore envisages a reorientation of welfare services to make them usable for \nthe community as well.\nTo this end, a design and feasibility study was launched in 2022 for the redevelopment of a company \nproperty located in Bologna, with the aim of creating meeting and socialisation places for people be-\nlonging to weak or vulnerable groups, such as the disabled, the elderly, unemployed young people, \nand women victims of violence.\nPoste Italiane \nsupports \ncorporate and \ncommunity \nwelfare \nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

In \nthis regard, in 2022 the Company continued to publish in the \ninnovative Postenews app, launched last year, with the aim \nof reporting daily news with features and video reports from \ninside and outside the Group. The Poste Italiane magazine, \ntherefore, offers updates on topics related to logistics, sav-\nings, the economy, institutions, security, welfare, the environ-\nment and digital. TG Poste, on the other hand, was created in \nresponse to the Group’s need to continue its mission of being \nclose to its employees on information issues too, providing \nthe most important news, and to tell the outside world about \nthe Group’s business inspired by the principles of sustaina-\nbility and customer focus. TG Poste is broadcast every day, \nMonday to Friday, and is streamed live on the Poste.it website \nand on screens in Post Offices, as well as being visible on \ndemand at tgposte.poste.it and for employees also from the \ncompany intranet or the NoidiPoste app. . \n \nWork-life balance\nWith regard to the Group’s welfare strategy, the Company pur-\nsues the improvement of its employees’ well-being by seeking \na work-life balance. In line with previous years, Poste Italiane \nhas provided orientation paths for young people and support for \nfamilies, strengthening the focus on the social and family dimen-\nsion of workers, also to support parenthood.\nIn the area of contractual welfare, the Poste Mondo Welfare \nprogramme was launched for the fourth consecutive year, \nimplementing the trade union agreement on the perfor-\nmance related bonus, which allows employees, on a volun-\ntary basis, to convert all or part of the performance bonus in \nwelfare goods and services characterised by specific social, \neducational, recreational and welfare purposes. The pro-\ngramme provides tax benefits related to current legislation \nand additional company welfare credits to increase the pur-\nchasing power of employees and their families. In this regard, \nthe welfare platform has been revamped to make it simpler \nand more intuitive to use, and has received - also using the \nlistening survey published on the NoidiPoste intranet - feed-\nback from both the previous year’s subscribers and those \nwho had not yet undertaken this experience. In 2022, Poste \nMondo Welfare was characterised by an improvement in the \nemployee experience, a widespread and multi-channel inter-\nnal communication plan, information workshops, dedicat-\ned ambassadors, travelling promotional stands in the most \nstaff-intensive organisational structures, and an expansion of \nthe network of goods and services offered to promote greater \nawareness of the related opportunities. In addition, the bene-\nfits of the tax legislation in force were valorised, with specific \nreward measures relating to the recognition of additional fuel \nvouchers - based on the percentage of membership and use \nof the programme - and the reimbursement of household bills \nfor electricity, water and gas.

During this period, the Trade Unions \nmust refrain from any direct action, while the Company \ncannot implement the planned projects. After 25 days, if \nthe outcome of the discussion is negative, the Parties may \nmake their own autonomous decisions; in the event of a \npositive outcome, on the other hand, the Company shall \nprovide adequate information to the competent territorial \nstructures of the Trade Unions. Prior to the start of discus-\nsions at the territorial level, the RSUs (Unitary Labour Union \nRepresentatives) must be consulted, a phase which must \nbe completed no later than 13 working days, including \nSaturdays, from the date on which the hypothesis of agree-\nment was signed. Subsequently, the Parties shall meet at a \nterritorial (regional) level to carry out a joint examination, to \nbe concluded within 7 working days, including Saturdays, \nfollowing the end of the consultation of the RSUs.\nThe continuous dialogue and constructive relationship \nbetween the Company and the Social Partners represents a \ncharacterising and significant element in the Group’s growth \nand evolution strategy. Continuous dialogue with the Trade \nUnions is ensured through significant information and nego-\ntiation activities with the Social Partners conducted by the \nIndustrial Relations function. The most significant outputs of \nthis activity are represented by the signing of specific agree-\nments with the Trade Union Organizations both on the sub-\njects expressly indicated by the National Collective Labour \nAgreement of 23 June 2021 (CCNL), and on further topics \nrelating to the achievement of the Plan objectives that have \nregulatory and/or managerial effects on personnel.\nThe National Collective Labour Agreement\nWith the aim of pursuing the well-being of employees \nand guaranteeing the protection of their rights, both dur-\ning ordinary management and in phases of change in the \nCompany’s organisation, Poste Italiane considers dialogue \nwith employee representatives to be a central aspect of \nthe Group’s organisation and management. Therefore, the \nCompany is committed to a constant dialogue with the \nTrade Union Organisations (OO.SS.), guaranteeing impar-\ntiality and independence in the promotion of relations in \ncompliance with current legislation and ensuring, at the \nsame time, the protection of rights, freedom of association \nand collective bargaining.\nIn this regard, in 2021 the Group renewed the National \nCollective Labour Agreement (CCNL), valid until 31 December \n2023. The Agreement, which introduced important improve-\nments both in the economic area and in the organisation’s reg-\nulatory framework, covers the entire non-managerial staff of the \nPoste Italiane Group and strengthens the focus on the defence \nof workers’ rights, their security and economic stability. The \nconcept of Corporate Social Responsibility is a fundamental \nprinciple for the Company, through which it is possible to com-\nbine the Group’s development objectives and economic results \nwith the respect for social and environmental values, enhancing \nthe continuous and constant contribution of human resources. \nActive labour policies\nIn line with previous years, Poste Italiane signed agreements \non labour policies, realizing its commitment to relations aimed \nat the welfare and protection of workers’ rights.\nWith the Agreement signed on 8 February 2022, the Parties, \nbefore identifying the overall active policy measures to be \nimplemented for the year 2022, defined an extraordinary \nmeasure, of an anticipatory nature, for a total of 1,100 FTE \n(Full Time Equivalent) between counters and placements from \nthe external market, in order to support the needs of front-\nend structures in the most critical territories. The Agreement \nsigned on 12 May 2022, also in order to support the reorgan-\nisation actions already shared and the further organisation-\nal review actions discussed in detail with the Trade Unions, \nprovides that, for the three-year period 2021-2023 - in line \nwith what was defined in the Agreement of 13 June 2018 \n- the Company will ensure an adequate number of Active \nEmployment Policies actions in relation to the incentive-based \nredundancies that will be recorded in the period. Specifically, \nActive Employment Policies (stabilisations, conversions from \npart-time to full-time, recruitment from the external market, \ncounters, job postings) were implemented for a total of over \n6,900 FTE. On 6 September 2022, the Parties agreed that for \n2022, by way of exception, the limit on the use of fixed-term \ncontracts in the regions of Emilia Romagna, Lombardy, Veneto, \nPiedmont, Liguria, Valle d’Aosta, Marche, Campania and \nCalabria is set at 12%. In the Understanding of 21 November \n2022, the Company and Trade Unions agreed on an advance \nof the Active Labour Policy 2023 for Post, Communication \nand Logistics (PCL) by defining strengthening actions both \nin delivery (700 full-time availabilities) and sorting (60 conver-\nsions from part-time to full-time). Similarly, on 19 December \n2022, Active Labour Policies interventions were agreed, again \nin anticipation, in relation to the Private Market, to be imple-\nmented starting from January 2023. In particular: conversion \nfrom part-time to full-time for 350 Counter Operators (175 \nFTE), transfer to front-end roles of 225 postmen and women \neligible for job posting under the Agreement of 12 May 2022 \n(counters) and 250 recruitments from the external market to \nfill specialist roles.

The related employ-\nment effects will be dealt with progressively when the individ-\nual depots are closed. In addition, a Planning and Operational \nControl Specialist role was introduced to support the Depot \nManager. A new credit management model was presented, \ncharacterised by dedicated supervision and a single interface \nwith the customer, to reduce overdue loans and make the \nwhole process more efficient. The new model will be subject \nto a trial with the parties committing to meet no later than May \n2023 to review its progress. A number of actions were also \ndefined to merge and relocate sites of the Territorial Centres, \nwith the aim of optimising processing and consolidating the \nsupervision of document management services through the \nestablishment of a single facility for the sites in the same city. \nThe resources concerned will continue to perform the same \nactivities and, where the conditions are met, they will be grant-\ned the benefits provided for in Article 38 of the current CCNL. In \nrelation to the services of”Customer Assistance”, the Company \npresented the Value Assistance service that will provide support \nin the purchasing phase of products/services and interact with \ncustomers through sales proposition initiatives. The introduc-\ntion of this new service will be accompanied by dedicated train-\ning courses for the staff involved. With regard to Information \nTechnology services, and especially with reference to the \nTechnology Poles, the operational model and the micro-organ-\nisation model were redefined, also through the introduction of \nspecific support figures for the territorial technical structures. \nField Technical Services were introduced with the aim of ensur-\ning a better coordination of technical support interventions and \noffering a quick response to business structures. Finally, as of \nMarch 2023, the remodelled timetables according to the new \norganisation of the Technology Centres will come into force, \ncharacterised by a single nationwide model with a Saturday \npresence as well. The parties agreed on the need for specif-\nic meetings at regional and national level to best accompa-\nny the reorganisation processes of the Digital, Technology & \nOperations function. \nWith the Agreement Report signed between the Company \nand the Trade Unions on 12 May 2022, the process of organi-\nsational revision of the Private Market function initiated with the \nAgreement of 30 September 2021, and which had focused \non strengthening the business model, continued. With this \nlatest agreement, the Company and the Trade Unions imple-\nmented further organisational reviews of both the business \nmodel and the operational platform of the sales support func-\ntions. Specifically, the number of the Protection and Financing \nContact Persons was increased and the relational activities \ncarried out by the Reception Workers were developed. The \nAgreement also provided for the strengthening of the Corner \n2.0 network, which evolved into the “Punto Poste Casa e \nFamiglia” format. The territorial operational management \nmodel was updated by enhancing the coordination, support \nand control activities at the Macro Area level and streamlin-\ning the structure at the Branch level. Finally, new momentum \nwas given to the Hub & Spoke project, with the release, on \na trial basis, of the new posting application, which will be \nadopted by the Hub DUP on the first six branches starting \nfrom June. On 19 December 2022, the Company and Trade \nUnions signed an agreement covering three macro topics: 1. \nthe Polis Project - House of Digital Services; 2. the evolution \nof the organisational model Small Economic Operators (POE); \n3. the anticipation of the Active Employment Policies 2023 \nmeasure. The Polis Project involves about 7,000 Post Offices, \nlocated in municipalities with a population of less than 15,000 \ninhabitants, which will be reconfigured to enable the provi-\nsion of a wide range of PA services, as well as the creation \nof co-working spaces in an interconnected national network \nof 250 properties. The evolution of the POE organisational \nmodel, on the other hand, envisages the reconfiguration of the \nMercato Privati sales chain from a synergic perspective, plac-\ning the POE channel alongside the retail channel. In particular, \nat the Macro Area level, the role of POE Sales Representative \nwas created and the role of the Enterprise Sales Manager \nwas superseded, with the relocation of resources within the \nPrivate Market or Enterprise Market and Public Administration \nfunctions. At the branch level, the Small Business Specialists \n(SSB) and Mail and Parcel Specialists (SPP) were moved to \nreport to the Branch Sales Manager (RCF).\nOn 1 March 2022, the Company signed an Agreement with \nthe Trade Unions, in force until 31 March 2023, which reg-\nulates the application of agile working in Poste Italiane and \nin the Group Companies applying the National Collective \nLabour Agreement (CCNL), renewed on 23 June 2021. The \nAgreement, in tracing the regulatory framework of the previ-\nous 2020 Agreement - which, among other things, provided \nfor the possibility for all employees to activate agile working \nfor a maximum of 3 days per week and 13 days per month \n- introduced some new elements that make it consistent not \nonly with the National Protocol on agile working stipulated by \nthe Social Partners on 7 December 2021, but also with the \norganisational and management evidence that emerged from \nthe observation of the implementation phase of the Institute \nin the Company during the emergency period.

The Trade Unions emphasised the \nneed to study certain issues in greater depth, including, by \nway of example, reasonable accommodation, fragile workers, \netc. The need to provide for agile working for training purpos-\nes for all workers whose work cannot be remotely performed \nwas also emphasised. The Agreement Report signed on 3 \nAugust 2022, taking into account the epidemiological crisis \nfrom Covid-19, extended the possibility of smart working to \nstaff hired on a temporary basis as well as, for training pur-\nposes only, to CTD staff at operational facilities.\t\nAgile working is a useful tool for the Company to optimise \nthe organisation and use of resources in a way that is more \nrespectful of environmental sustainability and collective \nwell-being, by limiting home-work journeys, reducing traffic \nand cutting emissions. Moreover, this working mode is also \nconsidered a welfare tool, as it allows not only to combine \npersonal and family needs with professional ones, but also to \nprotect employees who are in particularly fragile conditions, \nsafeguarding the Company’s production and quality stand-\nards. On 2 March 2023, the Agreement was signed by which \nthe Parties agreed to extend the effects of the agreements of \n1 March and 3 August 2022 until 30 September.\nOn 29 July 2022, the Agreement on performance-related \nbonus for 2022 was signed for Poste Italiane SpA and the \nGroup Companies. With reference to the unit value of the \nbonus, the agreement provided for a 5% increase, allowing \nfor a recovery of the inflationary pressure resulting from the \noverall economic/monetary trend. With respect to the nation-\nal indicators which the payment of the bonus is correlated \nto, Group revenues per employee were introduced for Poste \nItaliane. Moreover, in order to further enhance the importance \nof the professional contribution of individual resources to \nthe achievement of company results, a bonus (an addition-\nal €50 to the individual value of the Bonus) was introduced \nfor employees who did not take any leave of absence in the \nyear of reference, and the incidence of sickness events on the \ndetermination of the sum to be paid as a performance bonus \nto each worker in June 2023 was also revised. In addition, the \npossibility of converting all or part of the bonus into welfare \nhas been confirmed, simplifying and making more advanta-\ngeous the mechanism of credit recognition by the company \nagainst the converted amount.\nWith the Agreement of 2 August 2022, the Parties outlined the \norganisational and management guidelines under which the \norganisational revision processes of some important produc-\ntion areas of the Post, Communication and Logistics (PCL) \nfunction will be implemented. Specifically, the Understanding \nprovides for:\n \nz the evolution of Internal Processing activities, which are \nbrought back into the organisational framework of sorting \nat 150 Centralised Centres; \n \nz the definition of new working hours for the resources \nemployed in the sector;\n \nz the updating of postmen’s entry times as a result of the \nnew timing and feeding methods of the Distribution \nCentres (CDs).\nIn addition, the staff members Market articulation were also \ncalled upon to perform activities at the centralised nodes \n(so-called residual activities on CDs). This move defined the \nnew needs of the sector and, with respect to the manage-\nment of the employment effects generated by the project, the \nlevers to be activated were identified in order to achieve the \ncorrect workforce size (redeployment at centralised nodes, \nprofessional enhancement/mobility in different organisational \nareas, retraining courses, redeployment within the Insourcing \nproject, voluntary redundancies based on incentives, possible \nactivation of the Solidarity Fund). The Parties, in defining the \nmacro-frameworks of intervention, agreed to postpone to a \nfurther Agreement the identification of the detailed rules aimed \nat regulating all the application aspects of the project, includ-\ning the criteria for the relocation of resources. The new model \nwas applied on an experimental basis on 18 centralised nodes \nand 25 connected CDs. The trial started on 10 October on 11 \nCDs and on 24 October on 14 Cds respectively. \nDuring 2022, an agreement was reached between Poste Italiane and the Trade Unions on the cen-\ntralisation of in-house processing relating to the Post Communication and Logistics (PCL) division. \nThe aim of the new agreement is to deliver greater service efficiency in postal communication, \nenhancing the central resources in Poste Italiane’s growth strategy.

Incentivised vol-\nuntary redundancies were activated for those resources that \nmet the requirements. The Parties also redefined the man-\nagement system for unsuitable delivery personnel, in relation \nto both temporary and permanent unfitness, adapting it to \nthe new organisation of the sorting process.

The \nIndustrial relations system accompanying the reorganisation, \nwhich is scheduled to end in 2024, provides for a mecha-\nnism of discussion between the Company and Trade Unions \nat both central and territorial levels.\nOn 11 July 2022, the Company and Trade Unions set 28 \nand 29 March 2023 as the dates for the general elections \nof the Unitary Trade Union Representatives (RSU) and of the \nWorkers’ Safety Representatives (RSL) of the Companies \nPoste Italiane SpA, Postel SpA, Poste Vita SpA, Poste Assicura \nSpA, PostePay SpA and Nexive Network Srl.

Similarly, this provision will \napply to Workers’ Safety Representatives who, only for the year \n2023 and until the date on which the new representatives take \noffice, will be entitled to 1/3 (10 hours) of the 30 hours per \nyear per capita of paid leave.

      "text": "Starting with the integrated policy and the Group policy, each \nemployer has approved the policy for its production unit, making \nit available to all workers. For the purposes of the Occupational \nHealth and Safety Management System (OHSMS), the respon-\nsibility of each production unit of the Parent company and the \nmain Group companies lies with its employer. Within the Parent \nCompany, employers are assisted by the Corporate Affairs/\nCorporate Protection function, which ensures, at Group level, \npolicy, coordination and control activities relating to Health, \nSafety at Work and the Environment, taking care, in particu-\nlar for the Parent Company, of the design, implementation \nand dissemination of Occupational Health and Safety and \nEnvironmental Protection Management systems, in line with the \ncurrent regulatory framework. \nOccupational health and safety issues are a priority for the \nGroup. In this regard, Poste Italiane has defined quantifiable \ntargets for Business Unit managers, which are evaluated on an \naccident reduction target. In fact, the CEO, the top manage-\nment and all those responsible up to the fifth organisational level \nwere assessed on an accident reduction target. The Company \nhas also set up dedicated teams with the specific task of mon-\nitoring the data relevant to the defined quantitative targets on a \ndaily basis.\nPromoting and developing a shared safety culture at all or-\nganisational levels of Poste Italiane is an enabling factor to \nreduce accidents and encourage the constant improvement \nof the management systems adopted\nAmong the main objectives pursued by Poste Italiane, the \ncontinuous awareness and involvement on the subject of \nHealth and Safety at Work of all those who work within the \nGroup is fundamental and a priority. Of particular importance \nis the dissemination and enhancement of the safety culture \nwithin the territorial operational centres (distribution centres \nand Post Offices) and their coordination structures. In addi-\ntion, the Company is committed to the continuous improve-\nment of its Management Systems, through the planning and \nexecution of initiatives aimed at implementing the principles \nset out in the Occupational Safety Policy, and in the periodic \nreview for the definition of new challenging objectives. \nFor years, Poste Italiane has pursued the objective of reduc-\ning accidents, especially in the sectors most exposed to \nroad traffic risk, such as logistics and delivery (postal mech-\nanisation and distribution centres). The constant monitoring \nand control of said phenomenon contributed, also in 2022, \nto the implementation of various initiatives on prevention \nand on occupational health of workers and protection of the \nworkplace. From this point of view, the Occupational Safety \nManagement Systems, which have already been adopted \nfor some time in accordance with the regulations in force, \nconfirm the conviction that an effective management system \nmakes it possible both to manage the safety of workers in \nan organic and systematic manner and to implement and \ndevelop the Company’s safety policy by monitoring the risks \nof all operational processes. Poste Italiane, aware of the \nfact that the continuous improvement of OHS Management \nSystems is conditional on the contribution and participa-\ntion of all workers, according to the roles and responsibil-\nities assigned, is committed to disseminating and enhanc-\ning the culture of safety from a systemic and participatory \nperspective.\nThe activities carried out to achieve the objectives include \ncontinuous training, awareness and involvement of per-\nsonnel on OHS issues, plant-structural site improvements, \ncontinuous improvement and maintenance of Management \nSystem certification, as well as constant risk assessment \nin relation to processes and workplaces, monitoring of the \nimplementation of the Improvement Plans referred to in the \nrisk assessment, and constant checks on compliance with \nthe requirements of current legislation.\nPoste Italiane Group allocates annual budgets dedicated to \nthe implementation of improvement plans for occupational \nhealth and safety aspects. In particular, the Company invests \nheavily in the maintenance of its real estate and in the contin-\nuous improvement of its plant and structural aspects. Equally \nimportant are the resources deployed for the management \nand maintenance of the company fleet, for the implementa-\ntion of training, information and education campaigns, as well \nas those for OHS audits/controls, health surveillance, and the \ndevelopment and maintenance of systems/applications sup-\nporting the management of the issue.\nIn the risk assessment process, the Group analyses all \npotentially hazardous situations related to work processes \nand workplaces and, after identifying their potential to cause \nharm, assesses the associated level of risk. The assessment \ntakes into account the actual manner in which the work is car-\nried out and the exposure of personnel, as well as any protec-\ntive measures already in place in accordance with the criteria \ndefined by current technical regulations, technical standards, \ngood engineering practice and company guidelines. In par-\nticular, the Company considers all foreseeable and objectively \npresent hazards related to work activities, those arising from \nthe correct and normal use of equipment/machines/plants, \nthose foreseeable due to exceptional conditions and those \ndue to possible malfunctions or failures. Systematic control of \nall possible hazards applicable to and correlated with work-\nplaces and processes is guaranteed by the preliminary com-\npilation of a check list annexed to the company procedure \n“Risk Assessment Document Management”. The Employer \nrefers to the skills of the Prevention and Protection Service to \nsupervise and carry out the risk assessment with the conse-\nquent drawing up of the Risk Assessment Document (DVR) \nas well as of all the relevant specialist technical reports.\nIn particular, with regard to occupational health and safety risk \nmanagement, this is also achieved through dialogue and the \ncontinuous exchange of information between human resourc-\nes, managers and the various Business Units. On a quarterly \nbasis, the competent control function coordinates with the \nrisk specialists and, through them, also with the risk owners, \nwith regard to monitoring activities on the trend of risk indica-\ntors and treatment actions related to the Top Risks concern-\ning health and safety at work. The result of the activities is rep-\nresented in quarterly integrated risk monitoring reports and \npresented to senior management and the Control and Risk \nCommittee (CCR).

Within them, the IOS include the obligation (deriv-\ning from Legislative Decree 81/08) for workers to report the \npresence of possible dangers or dangerous situations at work \nto the person in charge and/or the competent Workers’ Safety \nRepresentative, as well as containing a detailed description of \nthe roles and tasks of the main players in safety management. \nSimilarly, the Compliance Officers and Managers are required \nto collect such reports and to act in accordance with the \nCompany procedures identified for the management of critical \nissues, respecting the timescales and methods corresponding \nto the level of risk associated with them. Considering the rel-\nevance of this issue, Poste Italiane has adopted information, \neducation and training mechanisms for all employees, in order \nto adequately manage, in accordance with both the protective \nmeasures set out in the Risk Assessment Document and the \ncorporate reference, any work situations from which injuries or \noccupational diseases could result.\nThe Company, in line with specific processes codified within \nthe adopted health and safety management systems, carries \nout near-miss and accident analysis at work. With a view to \ncontinuous improvement, each production unit of the parent \ncompany and the Group companies carry out constant moni-\ntoring of accidents, specifically related to incidents, in order to \nidentify - or manage - the triggering factors.\nBy means of the three-year moving average, which consid-\ners accident data from 2017 until 2022, before and after \nCovid-19, it is possible to observe the development of the \nnumber of occupational accidents of the Parent company. \nThis metric, in addition to mitigating the distorting effects \ncaused by exceptional events (such as pandemics) in the \ncalculation of the accident trend, makes it possible to assess \nthe effectiveness of management actions aimed at contain-\ning the risk factors controllable by the Company (such as the \nprogressive adoption of the Lean methodology in the sorting \ncentres), with a medium to long term time horizon.\nHealth Surveillance is carried out in the Group by a pool \nof company doctors who, within specific territorial perim-\neters, carry out the provisions of article 41 of Legislative \nDecree 81/08 (visits, inspections, periodic meetings, spot \nconsultations). The network is coordinated by a competent \ndoctor who supports the Employers and the Prevention and \nProtection Service for the governance aspects of health \nsurveillance. The Risk Assessment Document for tabulated \nrisks, pursuant to Legislative Decree 81/2008, as amended, \nand the Group’s five Health Protocols list the activities sub-\nject to health prevention measures:\n \nz specific risk of manual handling of loads;\n \nz specific risk from exposure to display screen equipment;\n \nz night work;\n \nz no addiction to narcotic and psychotropic substances, \nno alcohol dependence;\n \nz specific risk from site inspections.\nWith regard to workers engaged in tasks/activities involving \nexposure to a specific (tabulated or assessed) risk, a health \nsurveillance programme is activated, which includes medical \nexaminations, supplementary health checks and toxicolog-\nical tests. \nDuring 2022, Health Surveillance activities were carried \nout continuously, throughout the country, in compliance \nwith health protocols and current regulations. In addition, \nuntil September 2022, exceptional Health Surveillance was \nensured for personnel with a “Fragility” condition, as well as \nthe management of the post-sickness return process from \nCovid-19 with the adoption of all the necessary precaution-\nary solutions for the worker’s health to cope with the risk \nfrom SARS-CoV-2.\nThe Workers’ Safety Representatives (RLS), who are among \nthe main players in the management of health and safety in \nthe workplace, are chosen directly by the workers within the \nframework of the Company’s trade union representatives, \nas provided for by Legislative Decree 81/08. The RLS are \nperiodically consulted not only following the introduction of \nnew risk assessment methodologies, but also on the occa-\nsion of organisational or process changes that may have an \nimpact on occupational health and safety, as well as during \nthe drafting of the Risk Assessment Document. Adequate, \ntimely and preventive consultation with the RLS allows them \nto obtain useful advice for the timely fulfilment of legislative \nobligations and for the continuous improvement of work-\ners’ health and safety. The consultation may concern all the \nWorkers’ Safety Representatives of the national territory or \nonly those of a specific territory.\nDiscussion between employers and workers, promot-\ned by the Group, takes place through the National Joint \nObservatory (OPN) and the Regional Joint Bodies (OPR). \nThanks to these committees, in which national and territorial, \nemployer, trade union and RLS representatives participate, \nthe Company involves all stakeholders in order to address \nspecific health and safety issues arising also from workers’ \nreports, share occupational health and safety initiatives and \nstart the process of consulting RLS on risk assessment. \nTherefore, Joint Bodies meetings are convened whenever the \nneed arises and not according to a pre-established schedule.\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

Specifically, the protective meas-\nures adopted according to the actual level of risk, the regula-\ntory framework in force from time to time and the indications \nof the Health Authority, were as follows:\n \nz information to external personnel (maintenance staff, con-\nsultants, customers, etc.) and employees about the risk \ncontainment measures adopted by the Company and the \nrelevant rules of conduct;\n \nz distribution, at such intervals as to ensure their availability \nat all times, of respiratory protective masks for all workers;\n \nz publication of safety procedures and operating instructions \nfor the management of symptomatic cases and Covid-19 \ncases in the Company;\n \nz communication campaigns aimed at continuously raising \nstaff awareness on the adoption of correct behaviour \naimed at preventing the risk of infection.\nIn any case, the Committee for monitoring the implementation \nof the described protection measures, established by specif-\nic agreement within the National Joint Observatory, remains \nactive.\nWith specific reference to the logistics and delivery sector, which is the sector most exposed to road \ntraffic risks, Poste Italiane implemented several initiatives, including the constant risk assessment \nand updating of risk assessment documents (DVR) following the reorganisations in the delivery sec-\ntor and the measures taken to combat Covid-19.\nIt is planned to record any type of event (from unsafe condition to unsafe action, medication and \nnear miss) in a new computer application, S-EWO, with an in-depth analysis of the dynamics of \naccidents, as well as to increase the use of the sanctioning lever in cases of non-compliance with \nexisting procedures/instructions.\nIn order to share information on the accident phenomenon with the territory, daily, weekly and \nmonthly reports were produced centrally.

Managing diversity in an inclusive manner not \nonly creates shared social values, but also provides a com-\npetitive advantage for the entire Group and intensifies peo-\nple’s engagement and commitment to the Company’s goals.\nThe projects and initiatives promoted by Poste Italiane in order \nto ensure social inclusion and enhance diversity are part of a \nbroader strategic framework, which is aimed at developing \nbalanced organisational models that favour communication \nand the emergence of personal characteristics, while pro-\ntecting individual vulnerability. The path taken by the Group \nis geared towards evolving from an approach focused only \non the protection and integration of diversity, towards a more \nproactive strategy aimed at overcoming barriers and solving \nthe factors that hinder the employment inclusion of individu-\nals. In fact, the Company’s mission and strategy on diversity \nand inclusion are defined with the aim of creating a collabo-\nrative, supportive and open working environment that allows \nthe Group to maximise the resulting opportunities, both for \nthe well-being of the Company and for competitive advantage \nin the business.\nThe Group has enshrined its guiding principles and values \nthrough the elaboration and formalisation by the Board of \nDirectors of a Diversity & Inclusion Policy, through which \nthe governing body defines measurable, multi-year objec-\ntives. In particular, the Diversity & Inclusion Policy is based \non four pillars: Gender, Generations, Disability/Vulnerability \nand Interculturality/Inclusive Culture, and was developed \nthrough a bottom-up process involving listening to the ideas \nand the needs of the corporate population. Thanks to this \nprocess, numerous projects were proposed on topics such \nas development and opportunity, open communication, \ninclusion and care, participation and dialogue, culture and \nawareness. The Policy is available online on the company \nwebsite, and is communicated to all employees through \nspecific training sessions, based on roles and responsibil-\nities. With reference to updating, the Policy is evaluated at \nleast once a year, based on the evidence emerging from \nthe assessments and from the monitoring of national and \ninternational trends.\nGender\nThe Group has embarked on a path with more than 10 pro-\njects to support gender equality and remove obstacles to \nwomen’s professional development. In particular, the Group \ncontemplates the strengthening of governance systems for \ncareer progression, the design of composite focus groups \naimed at assessing the main conscious or unconscious biases \nthat influence inclusive leadership, improving work life adjust-\nment mechanisms in terms of reconciling and sharing family \nresponsibilities, and adhering to the path for the prestigious \ninternational Equal Salary certification, achieved in November \n2022, as per the ESG plan, further sanctioning and confirming \nthe Group’s commitment to pay equity between women and \nmen within the organisation. \nNFS\nMAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

The aim is to provide an \noverview of gender harassment and its impacts on individu-\nals and organisations, to promote a culture of respect in the \nworkplace.\nGenerations\nPoste Italiane promotes integrated strategies to foster dialogue \nand exchange between the different generations within the \nCompany, taking into account demographic perspectives and \ntheir effects on turnover. The Group promotes the contamina-\ntion of different social, cultural and professional experiences, \nas well as the different skills, knowledge and competences \ntypical of each generation. This openness to complementarity \nand diversity encourages the interchange of experiences to \nsupport inclusion and employment opportunities.\nDisability/Vulnerability\nThe Company has undertaken awareness-raising initiatives at \na collective level to preventively recognise situations of vul-\nnerability and facilitate job placement and quality of work for \npeople with sensory, motor or cognitive disabilities. \nIn this context, Poste Italiane is committed to developing \nintervention policies aimed at spreading an inclusive business \nculture and introducing a distinctive identity that takes into \naccount situations of fragility. \nInterculturality/Inclusive culture\nPoste Italiane has designed multi-year initiatives aimed at pro-\nmoting interaction between different cultures and experienc-\nes through envisioning programmes and the dissemination of \nknowledge in organisational and managerial environments, \nwith the objective of promoting a cross-cultural vision open \nto multi-level confrontation and geared to organisational and \nsocial cooperation. \nThe Diversity & Inclusion programmes, in line with the pro-\nvisions of the Company Policy, are monitored using indica-\ntors developed annually in collaboration with the Group’s \nSustainable Development, Risk and Compliance function in \nthe Corporate Affairs area, in line with the evolutionary guide-\nlines of the corporate sustainability plan. \nPoste Italiane maintains, in continuity with the previous year, \nits Diversity & Inclusion Plan, drawn up following an active \nparticipation process which envisaged the establishment of \ncross-functional working groups made up of professionals \nand middle-managers who operated according to a bot-\ntom-up logic, elaborating project proposals that have been \nevaluated on the basis of two variables, the qualitative-quan-\ntitative impact on the company population and the speed of \nimplementation. The Plan is aimed at generating significant \nchange processes that bring added value to people, organi-\nsational behaviour, leadership styles and relationships within \nthe Group. Through the implementation of targeted projects \nand initiatives, as well as communication and awareness-rais-\ning campaigns, the Group promotes engagement, listening \nand trust, the creation of inclusive working environments, and \nin general, the improvement of the corporate organisation \nthrough the enhancement of differences. \nMoreover, to further spread knowledge and understanding of \nthe importance of each individual within the Company and of \nthe initiatives supporting diversity, and to promote the con-\ntamination of different cultures and experiences in order to \ntrigger participatory processes characterised by the co-pres-\nence of a set of different cultures among people, a special \n“Diversity & Inclusion” section is available on the NoidiPoste \ncorporate intranet, containing news, documents and multi-\nmedia material. Finally, a series of podcasts entitled “In Other \nWords” was launched, which aims to focus on listening in the \ntelling of stories of diversity and inclusion.\nThe Company’s commitment to promoting an inclusive cul-\nture is a cultural journey that can enrich the experience of staff \nthroughout their working careers, with both individual and col-\nlective benefits. To this end, the Company works constantly \nand systematically, implementing synergistic actions to devel-\nop analysis models and indicators consistent with people \nmanagement processes. This system allows management to \nevaluate scenarios, objectives and metrics in a transparent \nand visible manner both within the organisation and for exter-\nnal stakeholders. \nTo underline the Group’s commitment to promoting initiatives for development and integration of the \nmanagement community, Poste Italiane is carrying out the “Smart Café” project, which consists of \nconversations dedicated to managers with the aim of fostering dialogue with a high level of intercul-\nturality at work and beyond. \nThese conversations focus on thematic paths that make different cultures and knowledge visible, \nalso considering generational differences. Using an innovative mode of communication and relation-\nship, the project aims to create an intercultural space for the exchange of contributions, points of \nview and social, cultural and work experiences.\nIn particular, with the special edition of “Smart Café” dedicated to generational confrontation, the \ncontamination of different social, cultural and work experiences is promoted to strengthen the alli-\nance at work between the different generations.\nSmart Café\nThematic paths  \non interculturality \nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n310\nSummary\nSection"

The Company recognised \nthe importance of increasingly integrating the social, relational \nand process dimensions of Diversity & Inclusion into its stra-\ntegic vision. To this end, a survey was launched in November \non the entire company population through the survey “Poste \nIN Diversity & Inclusion according to you”, which aims to \ngather information on individual and collective knowledge \nand perception of Diversity & Inclusion issues, as well as the \nCompany’s commitment in this area. Specifically, employees’ \nperceptions on the following different areas were requested:\n \nz Diversity & Inclusion knowledge of respondents;\n \nz Knowledge of the four areas of D&I;\n \nz D&I attitudes;\n \nz Ratings and opinions on D&I in the Company;\n \nz Knowledge and opinions of D&I projects and policies in \nPoste Italiane.\nThe survey was carried out in cooperation with “Work Wide \nWomen”, and was disseminated online via the company \nintranet, official news, TG Poste and the newsletter.\nIn order to prevent any possible negative impact on the cor-\nporate population to whom the initiatives are addressed, all \nevents are publicised, enhanced and communicated on the \ninternal website, so that the corporate action in this area can \nbe made known and the population can participate. In addi-\ntion, feedback is systematically provided to employee com-\nments and reports on the company intranet community in \norder to ensure timely clarity of information and offer contex-\ntualisation elements useful for participation and contribution \nto the collection of any aspects of process improvement. \nThe main actions aimed at promoting Diversity & Inclusion are \noverseen in the Human Resources and Industrial Relations \narea through the People Care and Diversity Management \nfunction, set up in 2019, within which a contact person \noperates with the role of promoting the implementation of \nthe project initiatives envisaged in the Diversity & Inclusion \nPlan, also taking care of programme management activities \nfor cross-functional projects. To support these initiatives, a \nbudget defined on the basis of annual planning is allocated. \nGenerally speaking, Diversity & Inclusion projects and initia-\ntives are managed by internal databases through dedicated \ncompany systems for mapping participants, reporting and \nmonitoring, as well as through the company intranet.\nIn order to ensure alignment with market trends and best prac-\ntices, the HR Research Centre continued its activities in 2022, \nparticipating in inter-company round tables, also exchanging \nviews with associations and institutions to generate new \nopportunities, visions and enabling orientations with respect \nto corporate objectives. The Centre also provides selected \ncontent, organised in thematic areas presented in an innova-\ntive editorial manner, using the dedicated online site, available \nto all employees in Human Resources and Organisation. The \nuser-friendly platform encourages the exchange of informa-\ntion, the socialisation of experiences and the broad sharing \nof content and approaches in support of inclusive culture and \npeople’s well-being in general. \nIn order to act on the cultural awareness of the context in \nwhich Poste Italiane carries out its activities, professional \nfigures called “Diversity and Inclusion Supporters” have also \nbeen identified, who operate in the Human Resources area \nthroughout the country, with the aim of supporting and dis-\nseminating corporate initiatives and gathering suggestions \nand ideas from staff in the relevant areas, always in a bot-\ntom-up logic of collaboration and expression of needs, involv-\ning all corporate entities. The supporters were also includ-\ned in a training course with the Palo Alto School to acquire \nthe techniques of animation and management of corporate \ncommunities.\nA wide range of initiatives promoted by the Company translate \nthe principles of inclusion and equal opportunities into action. \nFundamental to this was the drafting of the “Framework \nagreement on harassment and violence in the workplace”, \nwith which the Group aims to maintain a working environment \nin which respect and dignity are guaranteed for each person. \nPoste Italiane also cooperates with the two main advocacy \norganisations operating at national level, the Anti-Violence \nNetwork “D.i.Re” (Donne in Rete) and the voluntary associ-\nation “Telefono Rosa”, and finances a fund for the economic \nand working autonomy of women victims of violence, provid-\ning many of them with training opportunities, job placement \nIn 2022, the Company was certified according to the standard ISO 30415:2021 Human resource \nmanagement - Diversity and Inclusion for its ability to integrate the principles of diversity and inclu-\nsion in all processes of design, direction, control, coordination and delivery of postal, financial, insur-\nance and digital services. The Group is the first large company in the FTSE MIB certified according \nto the Uni ISO 30415:2021 standard, an acknowledgement that once again confirms the central role \nthat Poste Italiane assigns to the principles of sustainable development.\nThe conscious management of diversity in an inclusive key, in addition to creating shared social \nvalue, determines a competitive advantage for the entire Group and is functional to promoting peo-\nple’s engagement with respect to corporate objectives.

The principle of equal \ncareer development opportunities is applied by ensuring that \npersonnel selection is carried out on the basis of profession-\nalism and skills in accordance with the Company’s needs, \nregardless of personal characteristics such as age, gender, \nsexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, nationality, political \nopinions and religious beliefs.\nThere are also many good Company practices support-\ning maternity and paternity. In cooperation with “Valore D”, \nan association of companies promoting diversity, talent and \nfemale leadership, Poste Italiane has committed to manage-\nrial training to promote the professional growth of its female \nemployees. Poste Italiane promotes activities to raise aware-\nness of gender-based violence through awareness-raising \ninitiatives and constantly monitors the impact of such activ-\nities on the territory, in accordance with the Memorandum \nof Understanding entered into with the Ministry of Equal \nOpportunities, To this end, institutional messages of aware-\nness-raising on these issues are visible on the screens of \nPostamat ATMs. In addition, the counter monitors also pro-\nvide useful information such as the freephone number 1522 \nand the app for preventing and combating violence, including \nstalking and mistreatment. \nPoste Italiane pays particular attention to every aspect that \ncan increasingly reconcile work and family life, as well as to \ninstances of violence against women. Faced with the emer-\ngency and the difficult consequences of the pandemic on the \ncondition of women victims of violence, and given the avail-\nability of its own residential accommodation, the Group pro-\nmoted the project “Housing autonomy for women victims of \nviolence”. The project, introduced in 2021, is in continuity with \nthe project aimed at the labour inclusion of women victims \nof violence and their job placement launched in 2019. Poste \nItaliane has confirmed its commitment to these issues by fully \nfunding the initiative for the second year running, demonstrat-\ning its leadership among companies on the Italian social sus-\ntainability scene. An important phase of the project was com-\npleted in March 2022, with the identification of 10 housing \nunits belonging to the Company’s real estate throughout the \ncountry to be reserved for the independent living of women \nand their daughters and minor children who find themselves \nin a particularly difficult economic situation, for a maximum \nof about 40 women per year, and for a total of 200 path-\nways to be followed over the entire duration of the project. \nNine regions were involved, namely the provinces of Vercelli, \nBrescia, Padua, Bologna, Macerata, Rome, Bari, Naples, \nSalerno and Messina. The five-year project is coordinated by \nthe Corporate Social Responsibility function in collaboration \nwith the Real Estate function, and is enriched by the consoli-\ndation of the partnership with the associations D.i.Re (Donne \nin Rete) and Differenza Donna, Third Sector organisations \nworking to combat gender-based violence, widely present \nthroughout the country, with the task of selecting women and \nfollowing them along the entire path of housing autonomy.\nMoreover, through the “Mortgage loan instalment suspen-\nsion”, Poste Italiane’s commitment to the inclusion of women \nvictims of violence through the implementation of the memo-\nrandum of understanding between ABI and the Trade Unions, \nto facilitate the repayment of loans by women victims of \ngender-based violence, was confirmed for 2022 as well. In \naddition, the Company signed the three-year Protocol on the \nimplementation of policies on gender equality, equal opportu-\nnities and combating gender-based violence with the Ministry \nfor Equal Opportunities and the Family on 13 April 2022, con-\nfirming its commitment within a broader institutional frame-\nwork. The agreement signed on 25 November 2019 between \nABI and the Trade Unions, which provides for suspending, \nwhere required, the payment of the capital portion of the \ninstalments of mortgages taken out by women victims of gen-\nder-based violence who are on certified protection pathways \nand are in economic difficulty, was recently extended until 25 \nNovember 2023. Therefore, Poste Italiane, in continuity with \nthe actions already undertaken, in agreement with the lending \nbanks Deutsche Bank SpA and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, has \nimplemented the agreement with ABI and offers women the \npossibility of requesting the suspension of the payment of the \nprincipal amount of mortgage loans, with the corresponding \nextension of the amortisation plan, for a period not exceeding \n18 months and in any case not exceeding the duration of the \n“protection path”.\nIn relation to the Company’s commitment to combating gen-\nder-based violence and the Housing Autonomy project, Poste \nItaliane held a webinar dedicated to project contact persons \nand Human Resources Managers. The aim of the initiative \nwas to raise awareness on the topic of gender-based har-\nassment and violence and the main tools to recognise the \nphenomenon and prevent it, while offering an overview of \nprogrammes for the employment and housing inclusion of \nwomen victims of violence.\nFurthermore, during 2022, in order to strengthen the Group’s \ncommitment to its diversity and inclusion policies, an interven-\ntion plan has been identified in the area of affective orientation \nand gender identity, divided into the following areas, for which \nfour working tables have been set up:\n \nz Active parenthood: concerns the regulation of the employ-\nment relationship and in particular the institutes pertaining \nto parenthood and their application to homogeneous fami-\nlies.

In addition, the Policy recommends specific \nprofessional expertise in the areas of finance or contribution \npolicy, accounting and risk management, as well as adequate \nknowledge of the sector in which the Company operates in \norder to assess the associated risks.\nThe Company has started a partnership with “Parks - Free and Equal”, a non-profit association \nwhose members are exclusively employers, whose aim is to help member companies, organisa-\ntions and institutions understand the business potential of developing diversity-friendly strategies \nand best practices, in order to create inclusive and respectful workplaces for all employees, and in \nparticular those belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community.\nPoste Italiane promotes policies of inclusion to protect diversity, and the collaboration with Parks \nallows this path to be further strengthened. Awareness-raising initiatives were implemented to value \nthe richness of plurality, accompaniment in cases of gender transition, counselling in the definition \nof training and communication programmes, and evolutionary integration in work processes and \nrelations.\nThe collaboration thus aims to strengthen the cultural positioning of the Company in its diversity \nmanagement path.\nIn this context, Poste Italiane has undertaken a series of initiatives to promote an inclusive working \nenvironment that is attentive to the needs of people according to their different identities. These ini-\ntiatives include the production of an episode of the company podcast “In other words”, available on \nthe company intranet and the NoidiPoste app, in which the Company emphasises the importance \nof creating an inclusive working environment that takes into account the different identities of people \nand their needs.

These initiatives represent \nan important chapter of the Diversity & Inclusion Plan, which \nalso includes strengthening management systems for career \nprogression in middle management positions, enhancing \nwork life adjustment mechanisms in terms of sharing family \nresponsibilities, and removing potential obstacles to gender \nequality, including those related to sexual orientation and \ngender-based violence.

This is confirmed by the numer-\nous awards obtained by Poste Italiane, including global lead-\nership in gender equality according to Bloomberg’s Gender-\nEquality Index and entry into the Top 100 global rankings on \ngender equality compiled by Equileap.\nThe recognitions obtained by Poste Italiane for its policies \nof attention to gender diversity demonstrate the rooting of \nthese values in the corporate culture and the sharing of the \npath at every level of responsibility, further enhancing the \nGroup’s reputation in the markets and among the financial \ncommunity. \nAlliance between the generations\nThe Company supports school and career guidance projects, \nrecognising the responsibility of socially responsible compa-\nnies to promote the growth of the younger generation and to \ncollaborate with the school system and families. For this rea-\nson, Poste Italiane collaborated with Consel-Consorzio Elis to \nparticipate in the two-year “School4Life 2.0” project, aimed at \nfostering a structured connection between schools and busi-\nnesses and preventing school drop-outs.\nPoste Italiane has also implemented programmes to strength-\nen the alliance between the corporate world and the world \nof education, with initiatives for orientation and dialogue \nbetween generations.

This project aims to \nset up a desk offering services in sign language to custom-\ners with hearing disabilities. The customer is assisted by staff \nable to express themselves in Italian sign language for normal \ncounter activities, such as paying bills and sending mail and \nparcels. Currently, the initiative involves 10 Post Offices with \na total of 11 resources in the six Macro Territorial Areas. In \nSeptember 2022, on the occasion of the International Day of \nSign Language, Poste Italiane broadcast the webinar “Digital \nCitizens”, which illustrated the essential elements to pay \nattention to when surfing the web and also provided food for \nthought to increase digital awareness. The webinar is in addi-\ntion to the multimedia content available on the Poste Italiane \nwebsite, created to meet the different needs of users in terms \nof accessibility and communication methods. In fact, tools \nwith predominantly visual characteristics such as infographics \nand video briefs, playful-educational narrative elements such \nas interactive games were created. These initiatives are part \nof Poste Italiane’s broad programme to offer services and \ntools accessible to all users.\nSupporting vulnerability\nIn 2022, Poste Italiane continued its commitment to the “Noi \nSiamo Qui” (We Are Here) caring initiative, aimed at supporting \nworkers with fragility due to serious illnesses or chronic dis-\neases with dedicated listening actions, work flexibility interven-\ntions, and the activation of business coaching paths with an \ninclusive approach to accompany an effective reintegration into \nwork. The aim is to offer, among other measures, a listening \npathway to identify the main cultural, organisational and man-\nagement implications of fragility conditions and, at the same \ntime, to spread growing awareness and company proximity on \nthe issue. Among the new services launched for the project \ntarget group, the possibility of requesting a second opinion for \noncological and cardiovascular diseases was also introduced \nin cooperation with the Company’s Medical Centre.\nPoste Italiane, as part of its actions in support of intergenerational exchange within the organisation, \nhas promoted the “Generazioni Connesse” (Connected Generations) survey, an initiative in conti-\nnuity with the “FishBowl generation” project, which aims to focus on the languages, working styles \nand needs of the main generations present in the Company in order to identify and enhance shared \nactions capable of stimulating generational alliance.\nThe survey analysed, among other aspects, the frequency and quality of relations between employ-\nees of different generations and gathered feedback and suggestions for improving collaboration \nbetween them. Numerous employees with a wide range of skills, including tellers, delivery personnel \nand staff members, participated in the survey. The results showed that most of the participants \nregularly have the opportunity to work with people from different generations and believe that gen-\nerational differences represent an added value.\nThe research also provided relevant insights to develop further initiatives to foster dialogue and ex-\nchange between generations in labour relations, such as the experimental project “The value of ex-\nperience”, job training between pairs of employees of different generations to compare techniques, \napproaches and skills acted upon.\n“Generazioni \nconnesse”\nEnhancing \nintergenerational \ncollaboration\nIn December, Poste Italiane organised the first Diversity Day event “Poste Plurale Universale”. \nThe aim of the event was to share a moment of transversal attention on the inclusive path under-\ntaken by the Company, in line with the objectives of the Group’s Strategic Plan and the pillars of the \nSustainability Strategy.\nDuring the event, external guests and employees gave testimonies on the four dimensions of Diver-\nsity & Inclusion: Gender, Generations, Vulnerability and Interculturality, offering an immersive expe-\nrience in diversity.\nThe event was made accessible to the entire corporate population in streaming, which is also ac-\ncessible thanks to the presence of LIS interpreters. \nIn addition, an itinerary was created at the event to raise awareness among families on digital inclu-\nsion and the risks involved in building a digital identity. \nA feedback questionnaire was also conducted anonymously to employees who attended the corpo-\nrate event to gather ideas and reflections for improvement.

The Company \nparticipated in the project by making an intercompany \nvideo with testimonies of people from different cultures and \ninvolved the entire company community in the “Let’s Movie” \ninitiative, through which employees were able to share their \npreferences on diversity and inclusion, suggesting films and \nTV series on stories of inclusion and respect for diversity to \nbuild a virtual commented and shared list.\nAs part of the promotion of diversity and inclusion, Poste \nItaliane further intensified its cultural awareness and train-\ning activities, including through six “Diversity Innovation \nMeetings”, with the aim of exploring the main aspects of \ndiversity, focusing specifically on the issues of gender equal-\nity, intergenerational alliance, vulnerabilities, interculturality \nand inclusive language. During these meetings, start-ups, \nthird sector organisations and institutions were invited to \nshare their experiences and knowledge on promoting inclu-\nsion.

The testing phase was also useful to monitor \nand develop the management of the information collected by \nthe boxes, which through IoT technology are able to detect \ncertain parameters such as temperature, humidity, atmos-\npheric pressure, and the detection of particulate matter and \nnitrogen dioxide. Through the low-power e-ink screen, both \nenvironmental and logistics-related information can be con-\nveyed. In fact, the new boxes make mail collection even more \nefficient and sustainable: the presence of sensors that check \nwhether or not there is mail inside the box allows post officers \nto know, by consulting their hand held devices, whether the \nbox needs to be emptied. Therefore, the benefits of the oper-\nation of the new cassettes can be found in a reduced environ-\nmental impact, since it avoids the passage of the post officer \nif the cassette is empty, and in increased work efficiency of the \npost officer himself.\nDuring 2022, coinciding with the dramatic events related to the humanitarian crisis linked to the \noutbreak of the conflict in Ukraine, Poste Italiane took the lead in working with institutions to support \npeople in need.\nThanks to the cooperation with the Fire Department of the Ministry of the Interior, Poste Italiane \ndelivered 500 sleeping bags to Ukrainian refugees accommodated in Latvia, and two radiation de-\ntectors to the embassies in Prague and Krakow, useful in the event of exposure of the population \nto radiation.\nThe Civil Defence also requested support from the Company for the correct and safe provision of \na subsistence contribution for refugees: this is a measure that is paid directly to the beneficiary, for \na maximum of three months and for a total amount of €900. Poste Italiane also ensured timely re-\nporting of the contributions made. In addition, thanks to the synergy of BP, MP, MIPA and DTO, and \nwith the collaboration of PostePay, the design of the process shared with the Civil Protection and the \ncontinuous and constant alignment between all company structures made it possible to activate the \ndisbursement of the contribution in a very short time, so much so that the first payment was made \nat the end of May, while the engagement of Poste Italiane took place in April. Finally, all the problems \npresented, related to the tax code and cyrillic writing, were solved promptly. Thanks to the support of \nPoste Italiane, a total of more than 140,000 payments were made to over 30,000 refugees in 2022.\nPoste alongside \ninstitutions\nThe Company’s \nsupport for the \nhumanitarian \ncrisis caused by \nthe war in Ukraine\nZero\nPost Offices closed in 2022\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

With regard to environmental sustainability, \nPoste Italiane’s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality \ntargets by 2030 and thus reducing emissions and the envi-\nronmental impact generated by its activities is also strength-\nened in relation to the initiatives undertaken by the Group \nto support small municipalities. In this regard, the Company \naims to offer zero-emission services in 800 small municipal-\nities and 35 historical centres by 2024.\nThis is the background to the ambitious “Polis Project - \nDigital Citizenship Service Houses”, which through tools \nsuch as proximity “Single Points of Contact” aims to trans-\nform the 6,933 municipalities with fewer than 15,000 inhab-\nitants, with at least one Post Office, by equipping them with \na cutting-edge technological and digital infrastructure that \nenables the automation of services and the rapid dissem-\nination of new PA digital service. The project represents a \nsignificant milestone in the fight against depopulation of \nsmall municipalities, also with a view to supporting the coun-\ntry’s digital transition, as envisaged by the PNRR (National \nRecovery and Resilience Plan) and the PNC (National Plan \nfor Complementary Investments). Poste Italiane not only \nstrengthens the relationship with its vast customer base, but \nalso contributes in this way to the streamlining of process-\nes within the public administration. Some 35 million people \ncurrently use the physical and virtual counters provided by \nPoste Italiane and will be able to benefit from the project’s \nadvantages.  \nThe core of the agreement signed by Poste Italiane and the Unione Nazionale Pro Loco d’Italia is \nthe offer of innovative services and products to support the activities of UNPLI Pro Loco organi-\nsations. The agreement will enable the approximately 221 Pro Loco organisations in Friuli Venezia \nGiulia to use the services offered by the Group at advantageous conditions, thus being able to \nfulfil the new obligations imposed by the Third Sector reform, thanks to digital payment systems \nincluding “Codice Postepay” and “Mobile Pos Postepay”. Through the “Codice Postepay” service, \ntransactions made by framing a QR code from a smartphone can be accepted through biometric \nrecognition and PosteID entry, without the use of Postamat or prepaid cards. The service can be \nused by around 29 million Postamat or prepaid card holders, 5 million of whom already have the \nPostePay app. The “Mobile Pos Postepay” service, on the other hand, allows mobile acceptance \nof transactions via Mobile POS with payment cards belonging to the circuits for which authorisa-\ntion has been requested.\nThe agreement between Poste Italiane and Unione Nazionale Pro Loco d’Italia confirms the \nGroup’s central role in supporting not only local businesses, but also Third Sector organisations.\nPoste Italiane in \nsupport of local \ncommunities\nThe agreement \nsigned by Poste \nItaliane and \nUnione Nazionale \nPro Loco d’Italia\nOn 20 April 2022, a new Post Office was opened at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus \nBio-Medico, located at Via Alvaro del Portillo 200, Rome. This is an important achievement for the \nbenefit of the citizens of the neighbourhood: in fact, the facility serves the university campus in Trig-\noria, at the gates of the Decima Malafede Nature Reserve.

      "text": "Poste Italiane is taking an active part in the mission to boost training, the efficiency of the public admin-\nistration, and the competitiveness of the Italian production system, thanks to a specific line of action \ncalled “Polis Project”, financed with €800 million from PNRR funds and a further 400 million from the \nPoste Italiane Group, which will involve almost 7,000 Post Offices. The Project constitutes a major social \ninclusion programme and comprises two lines of action: the first consists of bringing telematics services \nof the Public Administration inside Post Offices with the creation of proximity “Sportelli Unici” (One-Stop \nShops): in the 6,933 municipalities with a population of less than 15.000 inhabitants, equipped with at \nleast one Post Office; the second, “Spazi per l’Italia” (Spaces for Italy), plans to make 250 spaces available \nthroughout the country, 80 of which will be activated in municipalities with less than 15,000 inhabitants, \nconverting them into co-working spaces of small (about 100 square metres), medium (about 450 square \nmetres) and large (about 1,500 square metres) size, all interconnected to form a single digitalised and \nsmart network. Poste Italiane, which has already built 28 Post Offices, plans to start or complete a total \nof 1,500 sites by 2023.\nIn particular, with regard to the “Sportelli Unici” line of action, the aim is to equip the Post Offices con-\ncerned with new technologies and tools to allow, 24 hours a day, a complete, fast, easy and digital use \nof services relating to: identity documents, civil registration certificates, judicial certificates, social security \ncertificates, services to the regions and other types such as, for example, the exemption from the RAI \nlicence fee. Through the development of physical-digital access channels such as the Counter, the Totem, \nthe evolved ATM, the Call centre and the Web channels, and thanks to the support of a special IT platform \ndeveloped to deliver services in multi-channel mode, Post Offices will be transformed in order to make a \nwidespread, concrete and resilient contribution to the achievement of the objectives that the European \nUnion and Italy have set themselves with the “Next Generation EU” plan, in terms of digitalisation and \nsocial inclusion. In addition, the Post Offices network, thus transformed, can also be made available for \nthe deployment of further government and PA initiatives on connectivity and cloud services. Specifically, \nthe line of intervention envisages the installation of 4,000 self-service columns for the use of public utility \nservices, 7,000 evolved ATMs for the provision of services to citizens, 500 lockers for the use, 24 hours \na day, of mail, parcel, e-commerce and public utility delivery services, and 4,000 interactive digital shop \nwindows for communication with citizens. In addition, the Project also envisages the implementation at \nPost Offices of interventions aimed at environmental sustainability and social growth of communities. In \nparticular, the following will be installed: 5,000 electric vehicle recharging stations available to the Group’s \ndelivery fleet, which will be made entirely green, and to local communities; 1,000 photovoltaic systems \nthat will help reduce CO2 emissions; smart building systems and environmental monitoring sensors; 1,000 \noutdoor spaces equipped to host cultural, health and wellness initiatives. In addition, by providing the \npossibility to access public administration services from a One-Stop Shop, citizens’ journeys and the con-\nsequent congestion of roads and public offices will be reduced, allowing the reduction of CO2 emissions.\nThe objective of the second line of intervention is to create the most widespread, digitalised, accessible \nand immediately available co-working network in the country: workstations, meeting spaces, shared ser-\nvices, areas dedicated to events and training whose use will be open to private individuals, companies \nand the public administration, universities, and research centres with which service agreements can be \ndefined to best meet the needs and vocations of each type of stakeholder. The national co-working and \ntraining network will be able to offer interested administrations and local stakeholders physical locations \nwhere they can test innovative solutions of broadband-supported services dedicated, for instance, to \ndistance learning, health, safety, becoming an essential partner for the transformation of services and \nthe acceleration of economic and social growth. The network, which is based on the transformation of \nimportant Poste Italiane office buildings and large Post Offices entirely made available to the Project, will \nalso be an important reference point for the innovation of small and medium-sized enterprises and for the \nenhancement of cultural and natural assets, being present in various industrial districts and in the areas of \ngreatest cultural and tourist attraction.\nThe Polis Project covers an area where approximately 40 million people reside, or 65% of the Italian pop-\nulation. In this regard, Poste Italiane has estimated that in the first six years of operation, the Polis Project \nwill generate a positive impact on the community and the environment worth a total of €380 million, of \nwhich 348 million will be for road safety and the reduction of traffic and waiting times, and 32 million for the \nreduction of polluting emissions. The Group also estimated an impact generated by the Project over the \ninvestment period 2022-2026 and the operation of the Post Offices until 2031 of €1,061 million in terms \nof GDP and €484 million in terms of the distribution of labour income, for a total of 18,600 jobs created.\nFinally, the Polis Project generates significant impacts throughout the territory, also with a view to achieving \nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Gender equality (SDG No. 5); Clean and affordable energy \n(SDG No. 7); Decent work and economic growth (SDG No. 8); Enterprise, innovation and infrastructure \n(SDG No. 9); Sustainable cities and communities (SDG No. 11); Combating climate change (SDG No. 13); \nLife on earth (SDG No. 15); Peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG No. 16). \n“Polis \nProject”\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

This commitment has been reaffirmed with the Group’s \nadoption of an internal procedure called “Defining, developing \nand monitoring corporate volunteering initiatives”, which is con-\nsistent with the Poste Italiane Group’s Sustainability Strategy, \nand which identifies the strengthening of corporate volunteer-\ning as a means of creating a network of solidarity in the area \nand strengthening the collaborative capacity between people \nby fostering the development of social networks that can bring \nlong-term value to the Company, consolidating its reputation \nin terms of social responsibility. The ultimate goal is to make a \nsignificant impact on society by creating virtuous volunteering.\nThe definition of activities to promote corporate volunteer-\ning and fundraising for social projects in compliance with \nPoste Italiane’s Code of Ethics, is part of the Memorandum \nof Understanding signed in February 2022 between Poste \nItaliane and the Forum of the Third Sector, aimed at promot-\ning the development of inland areas through targeted projects \nand services and to encourage the re-employment of the most \nvulnerable people. The memorandum of understanding, which \nleverages Poste Italiane’s widespread territorial distribution, \nis aimed at the creation of a corporate volunteering platform, \nthrough which the 100 national member organisations of the \nForum, representing over 158,000 territorial branches, can \npresent projects in which Poste Italiane employees can take \npart as volunteers, outside working hours.\nMoreover, the protocol envisages Poste Italiane’s participation \nin shared events and initiatives organised by the National Forum \nof the Third Sector, thanks also to the support of a permanent \ndiscussion table with the Forum, in line with the Group’s stake-\nholder engagement policies, by providing information material \non Poste Italiane’s tools and products dedicated to the Third \nSector and communities. Similarly, the Forum is committed to \nparticipating in the activities and events organised by Poste \nItaliane, with the aim of disseminating knowledge of the incen-\ntives managed by the Company among the non-profit entities \nbelonging to its organisation, in order to facilitate their use by \nthe associated organisations. The Forum can also avail itself \nof the technical support of Poste Italiane in defining propos-\nals for public finance interventions to support Third Sector \norganisations.\nClose to young people\nIn continuity with previous years, Poste Italiane is supporting \nthe digital transformation path in collaboration with the aca-\ndemic world. After last year’s meeting with around 100 students \nfrom the master’s degree course in Data Science at Rome’s La \nSapienza University, who were the protagonists of the initia-\ntive promoted by the Data Science Industrial Liaison Program \n(ILP), Poste Italiane continued its path of bringing together \nItaly’s most important industrial realities and the students of the \ndegree course at the same university. The objectives of the ILP \ninclude identifying opportunities for internships or final projects \nfor students, including presenting the latest industrial products \nfor big data management and analysis, and explaining their use \nin the development of innovative solutions for business and the \nCompany. In general, the aim of the initiative is to introduce \nstudents to the labour market, showing them opportunities in \nlarge companies such as Poste Italiane, a company with the \nhighest number of employees in Italy.\nMarch 2022 also saw the conclusion of the “Future Lab” pro-\nject, which had already started last year. The initiative was \naimed at the children of Poste Italiane employees between the \nages of 16 and 23, who set out to find out what path to take \nin their future. The aim of the project was to support boys and \ngirls in their study choices, bringing them closer to the world \nof work in a more conscious manner, to undertake paths in \nline with their skills and passions and to learn about the main \nmarket orientations on future professions.\nIn 2022, the School4Life 2.0 project, aimed at combating \nhigh school drop-outs, continued. The initiative involved 133 \nschools, 15,000 students from all over Italy and 11 major \ncompanies, including Poste Italiane, with the co-ordination \nof Consel Consorzio ELIS, a non-profit training organisation \nthat brings together more than 100 large groups and SMEs. \nSchool4Life 2.0 consists of school and career guidance, in \nthe awareness that socially responsible companies should \ntake charge of the younger generations, accompanying \nthem towards a professional future through a structured link \nbetween school and business. The aim of the project is to \ngive young people a more direct insight into the world of work \nand a greater awareness of their own potential. The lines of \nintervention, which made up the project in 2022, were: pro-\nject-based teaching approach with technical interventions \nby corporate figures; motivation and inspiration through role \nmodels and corporate mentors; training on topics such as \nthe SDGs and Agenda 2030; bringing the female population \ncloser to STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, \nMathematics). The Company experts with their testimonies \ntrained over 530 young people from 14 schools nationwide.\nFinally, Poste Italiane promoted ten special projects to sup-\nport children and young people with fragility and their families, \nincluded in the wide-ranging social action plan “Presenti sul \nterritorio, vicini alle comunità” (Present in the territory, close to \nthe communities). The package of actions in support of chil-\ndren was realised in collaboration with ten non-profit organi-\nsations of national importance selected by Poste Italiane.

The agreement for the \nthree-year period 2020-2022 envisages, among other things, strategic initiatives aimed at promoting a new corporate culture involving business models and choices geared \ntowards innovation and economic and social sustainability. For the association year 2022, the membership fee stands at €3.2 million.\nThe Framework Agreement also established the Cantiere \nConsumatori, a regular monthly consultation with represent-\natives of the Associations aimed at presenting products and \nservices and explaining them in detail.\nA further objective of the relationship with the associations is \nto follow up the Conciliation procedures, also provided for in \nthe Agreement, for the amicable settlement of disputes for all \nareas of the Company’s activities. Finally, also on the basis \nof the Agreement, which lays down the principles for trans-\nparent cooperation and information sharing for the benefit of \ncustomers, the newsletter “Dialogue with Consumers” was \nestablished.\nConstant and transparent relations with consumer asso-\nciations continued in 2022, therefore, on the basis of the \nFramework Agreement, the Consumer Forum and the news-\nletter “A dialogue with consumers”.

On the subject of training, \na new course for conciliation experts was organised during \nthe year, as well as 8 local refresher training meetings at the \nBologna and Landriano hubs. Finally, on the topic of anti-\nfraud, four thematic webinars were held, organised in coop-\neration with CERT. This activity is regulated and described \nby the Company procedures pursuant to Legislative Decree \n231/2001 and by the procedures defined on the basis of the \nFramework Agreement entered into between the Company \nand Consumer Associations, referred to in the procedures \npursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001. The success of the \npolicies adopted is verified and evaluated in relation to the \nlack of critical interventions by consumer associations in the \nmedia, both at national and territorial level.\nRelations with consumer associations at central level are \nmanaged by the “Relations with Trade and Consumer \nAssociations” function, which consists of a manager, four \nresources in the Rome office and one in the Milan office. \nOn the other hand, relations with consumer associations at \nthe territorial level, in particular with regard to Retail Postal \nConciliation procedures, are managed in connection with the \nterritorial offices of the function. The objectives of the function, \nwhich are included in the MBO of the managers in charge, are \nmeasured by analysing the discussion questions by assess-\ning the percentage of questions conciliated, i.e. concluded \nwith an agreement with the consumer associations, in rela-\ntion to the total number of questions discussed. Conciliation \nprocedures are governed by the “Retail Postal Products \nConciliation” Procedure, updated in 2021 and drawn up in \ncooperation with several consumer associations.\nAmong the main central institutions and regulatory and \nsupervisory bodies with which Poste Italiane interacts are: \nthe Italian Communications Authority (Autorità per le Garanzie \ndelle Comunicazioni - AGCom), the Ministry of Economic \nDevelopment (Ministero per lo Sviluppo Economico - MISE), \nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

Thanks to its extensive network, the Group was \nable to stay close to the community also during 2022, a year \nfurther affected by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\nPoste Italiane supports the protection of the rights of local \ncommunities in order to ensure the accessibility of its prod-\nucts and services to those territories and categories of users \nwho would otherwise not be able to access them, as set out \nin the Company’s Policy on the Protection and Safeguarding of \nHuman Rights. At the same time, the Company undertakes to \npromote initiatives aimed at disseminating and supporting the \nright to study, economic sustainability and social connection, \nintercepting, thanks to the network of company resources, the \nneeds deriving from the various forms of disadvantage.\nThanks to its widespread presence throughout Italy, Poste \nItaliane maintains its proximity to the communities in which it \noperates, guaranteeing products and services accessible to \nall and aimed at social inclusion\nNFS\nMAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL\nDuring 2022, Poste Italiane maintained its commitment to an all-round sustainable future by expand-\ning its range of offerings with the introduction of new services. In this regard, the Group promoted, \nlike in the previous year, the “risparmiosemplice” (simple savings) formula. The Savings Plan, which \ncan be subscribed to at any Post Office by holders of a BancoPosta current account or a Post \nOffice Savings Booklet, has an indefinite duration with a periodicity defined by the customer, and is \nbased on the 4-year postal savings bond issued by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA. By subscribing to \nthis bond within the Savings Plan, it is possible to periodically set aside amounts - even small ones \n- in order to build up capital over time, with the possibility of also making additional subscriptions. \nThe sums deriving from the maturity of Postal Savings Bonds, subscribed under the Plan itself, will \nbe automatically reinvested in the “risparmiosemplice” Savings Plan and, in addition to the capital \ninvested, also include the accrued interest, net of tax charges. In addition, the postal savings agree-\nment with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, renewed in 2021, offers the Group a sustainable remuneration \nover the four-year period 2021-2024, with an annual fee for collection targets of between €1.6 and \n1.85 billion.\nA further service, launched in November 2022 in cooperation with Banca Aidexa SpA, is the “Pres-\ntito BancoPosta Business Link Online”, which allows digital loans to be offered to sole proprietor-\nships and small businesses. In the area of insurance services, on the other hand, the mixed life \ninsurance product “Poste Progetto Dinamico Bonus” was launched, with a duration of 15 years, \naimed at combining a performance-linked insurance project with unit-linked insurance investment \ncomponents. In addition, the new “Digital Protection” feature of “Poste Vivere Protetti” has been \nincluded in the modular offer. Through PostePay’s omnichannel platform, the Group has assumed a \nstrategic role in the provision of payment services, reaching a number of “Evolution” cards of almost \nnine million and more than 23 million users who have adopted PosteID to certify their digital identity. \nPoste Italiane’s \noffering    \nThe expansion \nof the Group’s \nservices in 2022\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n332\nSummary\nSection"

      "text": "The Group is aware that energy efficiency is crucial to suc-\nceed in combining economic growth and sustainable devel-\nopment. Therefore, in adopting an exemplary environmental \nbehaviour, Poste Italiane bases its strategy on the following \nareas of intervention:\nRenewable energy sources. Poste Italiane promotes the \ninstallation of photovoltaic panels in its buildings, located \nthroughout Italy, in order to make the impact of its activities \neven more sustainable. The renewable energy project envis-\nages the development of around 300 photovoltaic plants \non flat-roofed property sites totalling 18MWp and around \n25 GWh/y of expected production when fully operational. In \naddition, in 2022, 96 realisations were completed with pro-\ngressive networking of plants.\nThe initiative has a two-year duration and started in the first \nhalf of 2021, with a total investment of €31.5 million, of which \n€16.5 million in 2022.\nPoste Italiane has undertaken a number of initiatives to ensure that its buildings are increasingly \nsustainable. One of the relevant initiatives in Central Italy was the reclassification of the Passo Varano \nsorting centre in the Marche region. The centre underwent a major energy upgrade, with a view to \ndecarbonize the buildings. \nSpecifically, work was carried out on the conditioning system. The system, consisting of a gas-fired \ncentral heating plant and cooling units, has been replaced by more modern and less impactful elec-\ntric heat pumps, which, thanks to their state-of-the-art technology, have better energy performance \nand are also less harmful to the environment in the event of gas leaks.\nEnergy \nrequalification \nPoste Italiane \nin support of the \nPasso Varano \nsorting centre\nFor Poste Italiane Group, the decarbonisation strategy relating to property management is a sus-\ntainable choice, also in view of the effects on energy prices caused by the Covid-19 pandemic \nand the war in Ukraine.\nIn this regard, in July 2022, Poste Italiane opened a new photovoltaic power plant in Palermo, \ncapable of satisfying the equivalent of one year’s energy consumption of as many as 250 homes. \nThis is only the latest of the major environmental sustainability measures implemented by Poste \nItaliane in the Region of Sicily. Despite the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic crisis has dramatically \naltered the timeframe for the commissioning of the system, due to the restrictive regulations ap-\nplied across the country, Poste Italiane, with its 769 Post Offices and 122 delivery centres in Sicily, \nhas embarked on a path that will lead it to achieve zero net carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. \nThe Company launched five parallel projects in Sicily, investing in LED, photovoltaic and other \ntechnologies. The first plan of interventions includes the replacement of classic lighting fixtures \nwith LED fluorescent lamps to reduce electricity consumption by around 50%, and over 9,000 \ninstallations have already been carried out on 378 sites on the island. Lighting systems, along \nwith air conditioning systems, are also part of a “smart building” project involving an integrated, \ntimed and remotely controlled in-building consumption management system. Through an inte-\ngrated management of the systems, as well as their replacement and modernisation, 200 Post \nOffices in Sicily are currently working to achieve an average consumption saving of 15% for the \nelectricity component and 10% for the gas component, according to the “energy efficiency” plan \nfor air conditioning, electrical and lighting systems. Green areas have also become central to the \nCompany’s operations. The fourth project, which involved 12 locations, involved the conversion \nof old underground heating fuel tanks into water collection systems for new or existing trees and \nhedges planted in areas outside the buildings.\nThe photovoltaic plan was also implemented, with the installation of panels at 39 Sicilian sites \ncapable of producing around 3 million 700,000 kWh a year, equal to the annual energy supply of \nmore than 750 homes (with traditional 3 kW meters). \nPoste Italiane’s \ngreen strategy \nA new \nphotovoltaic \npower plant in \nPalermo\n99%\nof the Group’s electricity requirement \ncomes from 100% renewable sources, \ncertified by Guarantees of Origin\n-19%\nScope 1 and Scope 2 emission \nreductions achieved through building \nenergy efficiency initiatives\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

This intervention will create a production \ncapacity of 18 MW with a projected annual output of 25 GWh, \nequal to around 6% of current consumption, progressively lead-\ning to the connection of the first 9 MW of photovoltaic power \nto the national grid. The best practices for this type of plant are: \nthe Padua Sorting Centre with 1,300kW of power that will be \ncompleted within the year, the Milan Roserio plant with 524kW \nand the Palermo Sorting Centre with 858kW completed and \nsoon to be connected to the national grid.\nSmart buildings. Confirming the Group’s commitment to \nenvironmental protection, in continuity with previous years, \nthe Smart Building project was promoted for the creation \nof a management system for Poste Italiane’s medium-small \nsites by monitoring consumption, climatic conditions inside \nand outside the buildings, and the automatic implementation \nof regulation and management systems for air conditioning, \nheating and lighting systems. The project, financed by the \nEuropean Investment Bank, envisages the implementation \non 2,000 Poste Italiane buildings of a Building and Energy \nManagement System (BEMS) with a unique platform of inte-\ngrated plant supervision, management and control aimed at \noptimising maintenance management and energy efficiency. \nThe intervention includes both the installation in the build-\nings of sensors and plant control and monitoring systems, \nand the connection to a centralised platform that allows the \nprogressive optimisation of plant and room management. \nWith thousands of buildings scattered in every climatic zone \nand at every latitude and altitude in Italy, Poste Italiane is \nfully representative of the extreme diversity of climatic condi-\ntions that characterise the territory in which it operates. For \nthis reason, the Company needs technical solutions that can \nbe adapted to different conditions and that can optimally \nmanage the comfort of environments for both staff and cus-\ntomers, in an attempt to use as little energy as possible and \nmake the best possible use of the systems, so as to reduce \nbreakdowns and increase the service life of the systems. \nMore than 1,600 locations, mainly Post Offices and delivery \ncentres, are already connected to the BEMS platform and \ntherefore, efficiently managed and monitored remotely, also \nthrough the implementation of a dedicated Control Room, \nand the expected electricity saving is about 7.6 GWh/year \nwhen fully operational. By 2022, more than 950 addition-\nal locations were installed, in addition to the progressive \nimprovement of the Software of the BEMS platform, also \nshared with some professionals in the area. During the year, \nmore than 1,600 sites were installed and on-boarded on \nthe supervisory system, despite some difficulties in the pro-\ncurement of materials, with an investment of €6.5 million, of \nwhich more than 3 in 2022. The project is scheduled to be \ncompleted during 2023, with an overall target of approxi-\nmately 2,000 locations. \nEnergy optimisation. With regard to energy efficien-\ncy, Poste Italiane has started installing gas and electricity \nmeters in the Company’s main buildings, in accordance with \nthe provisions of Legislative Decree 102/14, and expects \nthe gradual completion and use of measurement data also \nfor the new series of energy diagnoses by 2023. \nIn continuity with previous years, in 2022, Poste Italiane \nplanned a series of measures aimed at achieving lower \nresource consumption, in particular for the heating and \ncooling management of its buildings. The levers that are \nused are manifold and range from the renewal of end-of-life \ninstallations with more efficient equipment to the renovation \nof buildings to improve thermal efficiency, as well as revise \nthe heating and cooling modes by switching from vectors \nsuch as oil to natural gas, to electrically powered heat \npumps. Again, interventions are carried out according to \ntechnical parameters renewed year by year by the “Gestore \ndei Servizi Energetici - GSE” (Energy Services Manager) \nwhich indicate the types of solutions that qualify for incen-\ntives for the increased efficiency of installed equipment. \nApproximately 270 interventions were completed in 2022.\nAs part of the so-called “green project”, between 2020 and \n2022, the decommissioning of diesel tanks no longer in use \nand their conversion into water tanks capable of collecting \nrainwater to be used for the irrigation of newly planted trees \nwill be carried out at 81 locations.\nIn addition, the Company launched an energy efficiency \nproject aimed at optimising the air-conditioning and heating \nsystems at some of the Group’s structural sites for more \nthan 40 interventions and an investment budget of approx-\nimately €3 million in 2022.\n~10,900\ntonnes of saved carbon dioxide \nthanks to the energy efficiency initiatives \nimplemented \n90\nenergy efficiency projects conducted  \non the territory, focused on reducing \nconsumption (gas and electricity)  \nand emissions\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n342\nSummary\nSection"

The aim is to pursue sustainable change \nthrough the definition of projects with a significant impact, such \nas logistics, decarbonisation of buildings and consumables, \nfavouring a focus on resource exploitation, investment plans \nand technological development, together with the greening of \nmore traditional needs.\nFor the planning and preparation phase of tenders, the \nSustainable Procurement Model adopted by the Group envis-\nages a differentiated approach that, on the one hand, encourag-\nes sustainable innovation of materials and processes also with \na view to the Circular Economy, and on the other hand, verifies \nand proposes the possible reference to the general framework \nof Green Public Procurement (GPP - Green Procurement of \nthe Public Administration) recommending the use of KeyESG \napplicable to the individual procedure, taking into account the \nmaturity of the reference market, the role in the supply chain \nand the business size of the economic operator. Specifically, \nKeyESGs represent the non-financial criteria for assessing a \ncompany’s performance, measuring its sustainability in envi-\nronmental, social and governance terms.\nThe upward trend in environmental, social and governance \nindicators is matched by the significant increase in the ESG \nincidence of the technical offer, recorded at over 6 percentage \npoints compared to last year. In order to increase the effec-\ntiveness of business processes and the competitiveness of the \nsupply chain, Poste Italiane aims to encourage the adoption of \nESG criteria for selecting, evaluating and monitoring suppliers, \nmitigating any ESG risks.\nLike in previous years, Poste Italiane has implemented the cri-\nteria set out in GPP, in order to combine sustainability in terms \nof reducing environmental impacts and cost rationalisation, \napplying, where required, the indications on the MEC, estab-\nlished with specific Ministerial Decrees. Tender procedures with \ntechnical offers (OEPV) almost always include ESG criteria.\nPoste Italiane promotes the supply of foodstuffs of BIO, IGP, \nDOP, sustainable fishing, etc. products, which are higher than \nthe minimum quantities prescribed by the MEC. Therefore, \neven local suppliers involved in the supply chain of food prod-\nucts for canteens and bars are required to guarantee certified \nproducts.\nFurthermore, in order to significantly reduce its environmental \nfootprint, the Company has embarked on a path of eliminating \nplastic of the canteens since 2019. In this regard, the register of \nsuppliers is developed through a qualification system for region-\nal areas and territorial areas. By favouring the presence of local \nlabour with a zero-kilometre supply of material in the process of \nawarding works contracts, especially for those involving build-\ning and plant works, Poste Italiane is able to keep procurement \ncosts low while reducing its impact on the environment.\nPoste Italiane’s entry in the market of selling energy to Italian households\nThe Poste Italiane Group’s entry into the electricity and gas \nsector was accompanied by the “Energia160” promotion, \nthrough which the Company provided a discount on elec-\ntricity and gas supplies for its employees and pensioners. \nThe transparent and completely green offer was introduced \nin honour of Poste Italiane’s 160th anniversary and includes \nthe supply of both gas and electricity for users. The pillars \nof Poste Italiane’s “Poste Energia” electricity and gas solu-\ntion, aimed at the free market and available at all Post Offices, \non poste.it and on the Postepay and BancoPosta apps, are: \ntransparency, predictability and sustainability.\nIn terms of how the offer works, the price of the raw material \nfor electricity and gas is locked in for 24 months, and there \nare two payment options: the traditional one, with a variable \namount based on how much is consumed in the month, and \nthe fixed instalment option, which is calculated on the basis \nof the previous year’s consumption. This innovative solution \nallows the customer to pay the same amount per month for \n12 months, and thus plan energy expenses in the household \nbudget. At the end of the year, the instalment is recalculated \nfor the following year, upwards or downwards, on the basis of \nthe actual consumption recorded.\nIn line with the Group’s philosophy, “Poste Energia” is a trans-\nparent, predictable, innovative and sustainable service that \nstrengthens the relationship of trust between citizens and the \nCompany. The service represents another step along the path \ndefined in the Strategic Plan, and contributes to the strategic \nobjectives of a multi-platform company with a diversified busi-\nness consisting of postal and logistics services, finance, insur-\nance, payment, telephony and, from now on, energy.\nIn addition, the “Poste Energia” offer is distinguished by its \nfocus on environmental sustainability, with particular refer-\nence to conscious consumption. In fact, the Company is \ncommitted to guiding the customer towards good practices \nin the use of the service, aimed at limiting its consumption. \nFurthermore, the electricity sold comes 100% from renewable \nsources produced in Italy and the carbon dioxide emissions \nof the gas released for consumption are fully offset. Finally, \n“Poste Energia” is easy to subscribe to, simply submitting a \nrecent bill, minimising paper consumption.\nThe supply of electricity and gas expands the multi-channel \noffer of services already offered by the Group, from postal ser-\nvices to financial services, from insurance to digital payments, \nfrom telephony to fibre Internet connection and other servic-\nes.

Most of the waste \nproduced by Poste Italiane is non-hazardous waste such as \npaper, cardboard and plastic packaging and wooden pallets. \nHowever, within some sites the production of special waste \nclassifiable as special hazardous waste, such as containers \nof printing inks or ink waste, may originate, albeit residually. \nIn this regard, the Group is constantly committed to the grad-\nual elimination from the purchasing cycle, also through the \nadoption of CAMs, of the products and materials that at the \nend of their life cycle give rise to the production of hazardous \nspecial waste, favouring similar but more sustainable prod-\nucts. Special waste is sent for recovery/disposal under liability \ncycle contracts that the Company enters into with authorised \ncompanies, in compliance with the requirements concerning \nthe handling and traceability of waste as set out in Legislative \nDecree 152/2006 and the like (e.g. forms, loading/unloading \nregister, MUD). The share of recyclable waste is instead sent \nfor recycling/recovery through asset transfer contracts. This \nactivity currently includes the recycling/recovery of paper and \ncardboard, plastic, wood and, partially, iron ore.\nWaste management is a critical issue for the Group, and \nconsists of planning, monitoring and control processes. The \nfollowing are also mentioned among the sensitive activities \nreferred to in the organisational model pursuant to Legislative \nDecree 231/01, including those relating to the management \nof waste that should arise as a result of the adoption of spe-\ncial protective or organisational measures to oversee extraor-\ndinary situations arising from exogenous factors (e.g. health \nemergencies), with reference to the definition of appropri-\nate behavioural and organisational rules and related control \nmeasures.\nPoste Italiane ensures the constant assessment of impacts \nand the implementation of countermeasures also through the \nprecise definition and identification of roles and responsibilities \nwithin its organisations. The responsibilities of the Company’s \nvarious organisational structures with regard to activities that \ninfluence waste management and, more generally, environ-\nmental impact issues, are documented in the organisational \nstructures and specified in the activity declarations therein. \nThe verification of the conformity of the processes related to \nthe correct management of waste is constantly carried out \nthrough the control of the technical and professional suitabil-\nity requirements of the suppliers of the collection and recov-\nery and disposal service, through the control of service levels \nand through controls on the correct management of oper-\national processes within the sites. The plant-structural audit \nactivity carried out at the sites also includes verification of the \nconformity of the waste management processes produced, \nwith particular reference to the correct management of col-\nlection points, temporary storage, separation by type and \nthe processing and keeping of the required documentation \n(Forms, MUD, etc.). In addition, the Group has undertaken \ninitiatives aimed at raising awareness on the issue of waste \nmanagement, especially at sites where proper separation and \ndisposal are an added value in terms of recovery/recycling \npossibilities.\nControl over the proper performance and management of the \nwaste collection and recovery/disposal service is carried out \nby verifying: \n \nz the correct supply of various types of containers for the \ntemporary storage of waste; \n \nz the labelling of waste/containers; \n \nz the execution of the planned waste movements; \n \nz that the waste management documentation has been \ncompleted correctly; \n \nz compliance with the limits for temporary storage; \n \nz transport by suitable and authorised means; \n \nz valid registrations and authorisations for transporters and \ndisposers/recoverers.\nFinally, with the aim of planning actions for continuous \nimprovement in waste management, a risk and opportunity \nassessment is carried out within the framework of the adopt-\ned Environmental Management Systems. The criteria used \nare established according to the specifics of the activity per-\nformed. To this end, the following are therefore determined: \n \nz risk and opportunity scenarios for environmental impacts \nand relevant internal and external factors, and consistent \nwith compliance obligations;\n \nz the business processes/functions concerned;\n \nz the assessment of likelihood, impact and level of control;\n \nz the classification of risks;\n \nz risk mitigation and control measures;\n \nz the level of inherent and residual risk;\n \nz new interventions and actions to be implemented.\nActions implemented to address risks and, where possible, \nseize opportunities, are proportional to the impact of waste \nproduction according to site and type, and monitoring of \nwaste production data is carried out both within the spe-\ncific procedures/methods referred to in the Environmental \nManagement System, and during periodic reporting, such as \nthe preparation of annual activity reports.\nIn particular, in 2022, the Environmental Management System, \nadopted and certified according to ISO 14001 at the Roma \nEur headquarters, was extended to all sites throughout the \ncountry with a number of employees greater than 300.

The Group’s \nobjective is to minimise the use of water resources by moni-\ntoring their overall consumption and to minimise the volume \nof water resources to be disposed of as industrial waste by \nmonitoring their production.\nWith regard to the activities of Postel SpA, water is taken from \nlocal aqueducts or from wells for which it has a concession, \nfor use mainly in connection with activities similar to domes-\ntic use or for air conditioning systems. Only at the Melzo and \nPomezia sites, water is used for industrial purposes, and waste \nfrom industrial processing is delivered to disposals. In contrast, \nwater that can be assimilated to domestic water or rainwater is \ndischarged in accordance with local concessions. \nWith reference to the activities of SDA SpA, the water sup-\nply of the sites comes mainly from municipal aqueducts and \nonly in 3 of these is water derived from wells used. Water \nuse is mainly for sanitary purposes, bathrooms and cleaning. \nIn addition, the water supply for the Rome hub, Milan and \nBologna sites is provided by a rainwater harvesting system, \nwhich is used to irrigate the adjacent green areas, while in the \nleased sites the activity is completely managed by the lessor.\nWith regard to consumption monitoring, Poste Italiane uses \nan integrated quality/environmental/safety management sys-\ntem certified according to ISO 14001:2015. In particular, a \nMeter Reading Register is compiled monthly at the SDA SpA \npremises, where water consumption readings are record-\ned. These data are collected centrally to calculate the total \nannual consumption and the average daily consumption. \nOn the basis of consumption, through an ad-hoc indicator \ncalled “WCI” (Water Consumption Indicator), it is possible \nto relate consumption to productivity, i.e. ‘litres/shipping’. \nSubsequently, a ranking is drawn up that highlights which \nlocations have high and excessive consumption, in order to \ncheck for abnormal situations. The objective of SDA SpA is \nto keep within the standard of the average value of the WCI \nindicator, with the aim of reducing the WCI by 5%. The quan-\ntities of water resources used and discharged in the manner \ndescribed in the concessions of the various water resource \nsites are reported to the local administrations, which then \ncarry out the prescribed analyses. Suppliers using the water \nresource, contracted under Group agreements, manage the \nresource in accordance with the local contracts and conces-\nsions of the various sites where they operate. \nEnvironmental \nimpacts of logistics\nAware of its capillary presence within the country and the \npotential contribution it can make in reducing environmental \nimpacts, Poste Italiane Group considers these issues a pri-\nority in carrying out its activities, as well as in the process of \ndefining its Sustainability Strategy.\nIn order to generate a positive environmental impact with re-\ngard to logistics activities, the Group aims to support the gre-\nen transition of its fleet  \nLike in previous years, in 2022 Poste Italiane continued to \nimplement sustainability initiatives, with particular reference to \nreducing the environmental impact of the corporate fleet. In \nthis regard, 11,409 alternatively fuelled vehicles (electric, nat-\nural gas and LPG) are already deployed in the fleet. \nThe Fleet Renewal Plan, which had already been activated \nin 2019 with the aim of replacing the entire fleet of vehicles \nused for the delivery of postal products with green vehicles, \ncontinued in 2022 through measures to reduce energy con-\nsumption, lower atmospheric emissions, increase safety \nand increase load capacity for delivery. In fact, in addition \nto increasing safety parameters by replacing two-wheelers \nwith three- and four-wheelers, electrically powered vehicles \nhave been increased in order to promote ‘green mobility’. \nWith regard to improving the organisation of the delivery load, \nPoste Italiane also introduced larger and more functional vehi-\ncles for the transport and delivery of parcels, and set up new \nfittings.\nImproving the environmental performance of the Group’s fleet \ngenerates significant impacts on the reduction of greenhouse \ngas emissions. For this reason, Poste Italiane demonstrated \nits commitment to pursuing the plan for the complete renew-\nal of its vehicle fleet, increasing the green component of the \nfleet itself, through the introduction of electric and hybrid cars \nand motorbikes in line with ESG targets of a 40% reduction \nin emissions. The results of this policy are evident, as the \nCompany has gone from 11% green vehicles in 2016 to 37% \nin 2022, more than doubling this percentage by 2021, with \nthe aim of replacing the entire company fleet with low-emis-\nsion vehicles by 2024, resulting in a CO2 reduction equal to \nthat of around 80,000 trees.\nIn line with the Group’s objectives aimed at the efficient use \nof renewable sources and the rationalisation of energy con-\nsumption from fossil fuels, since 2018, the Company has \nbeen promoting and supporting the new plan for the green \nNFS\nMAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

Through the “Joint \nDelivery” plan, Poste Italiane adopts a model that allows \nthe Group to radically reorganise the delivery network and \nits operating model, implementing a delivery style that pro-\nvides for the transition from a single network structure to a \nstructure with two networks, which differ in terms of deliv-\nery methods, frequency and type of product managed. The \nFleet Evolution Plan and the Joint Delivery Plan reduce both \nthe number of kilometres travelled for delivery activities and \nthe need for a marshalling fleet itself.\nRegarding the details of the green fleet transformation pro-\nject, in 2022, Poste Italiane completed the fleeting of 1,956 \nelectric vehicles, of which 1,170 cars, 264 vans, and 511 \ntricycles and quadricycles, 7,003 hybrid electric or methane \nvehicles, and 6,154 low-emission vehicles. \nThe green fleet reached 37% of the total Poste Italiane fleet \nin 2022: there are about 7,500 bifuel vehicles between cars \nand vans - well above the approximately 2,800 in 2021 - and \nover 3,600 low-emission motorbikes. Specifically, 15,113 \nlow-emission vehicles were fleeted in 2022: 1,956 electric \nvehicles including 1,170 cars, 264 vans and 511 tricycles/\nquadricycles; 7,003 hybrid electric or natural gas vehicles; \n6,154 low-emission vehicles. The total number of environ-\nmentally-friendly vehicles introduced as of 2019 is 22,610, \nand by 2023, a further 3,710 environmentally-friendly vehi-\ncles are expected to be introduced in the fleet, including: \n2,250 electric vehicles; 684 hybrid electric or natural gas \nvehicles; 776 low-emission vehicles, a total of 26,320 envi-\nronmentally-friendly vehicles by the end of 2023. The inter-\nventions are in line with the goal of reaching 27,800 vehicles \nby 2024.\nThrough the “Green Delivery” delivery model, the Poste Italiane Group has made a proximity net-\nwork available to the territory, which guarantees greater flexibility for customers and, at the same \ntime, generates environmental benefits.\nPoste Italiane customers, in fact, can make use of both the PuntoPoste network (consisting of \nmore than 15,000 pick-up points such as tobacconists, bars, stationers, newsagents, Kipoint \nshops, Carrefour, API and lockers) and the Post Office network for the delivery of parcels, as an \nalternative to home delivery. \nThis delivery model also allows for greater efficiency in Poste Italiane’s logistics as more parcels \ncan be delivered to a single collection point, thus limiting the number of pick-ups and fleet move-\nments.\nIn the course of 2022, through the PuntoPoste network and Post Offices, around 4 million parcel \ndeliveries could be avoided, resulting in savings around 495,000 kilometres by the Italian Post \nOffice fleet. \nThe journeys saved and kilometres avoided thanks to the Green Delivery model avoided the emis-\nsion of 53 tonnes of CO2eq and 244 kg of air pollutants into the atmosphere (i.e. COVNM, NH3, \nSO2, NOx, PM10, PM2.5).\nIn particular, each parcel delivered through the Green delivery model resulted in a saving in CO2eq \nemissions and air contaminants of approximately 5.3 grams.\nThe Green \nDelivery \nModel\nBenefits:\n• \u0007about 4 million \npassages saved and \nabout 495,000 km \navoided\n• \u0007avoided emissions \nof 53 tonnes CO2eq \nand 244 kg of air \ncontaminants \n• \u0007each parcel delivered \navoided the emission \nof 5.3 grams of CO2eq \nand air contaminants \n-18%\nPCL fleet emissions  \ncompare to 2019\n37%\nof the fleet consisting  \nof green vehicles \nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n348\nSummary\nSection"

The portfolio of retail customers is one of the pillars of \nPoste Italiane’s strategy to achieve its objectives and is the \nlever for effective customer management based on the new \nadvisory service model.\nThe impact of digital transformation is relevant in many sectors and even more so in the postal \nsector. Poste Italiane is structuring an omnichannel service model that provides value and quality \nto both the many customers who prefer the digital mode and those who prefer to frequent Post \nOffices. \nPoste Italiane’s model is based on a strong integration between physical and remote accessibility \nto the services provided, and is based on four pillars:\n \nz new reception model;\n \nz relational desk;\n \nz strengthening the tools that enable the Company to bring about this change;\n \nz valorisation of consulting rooms.\nThe integrated model is necessary since 94% of Italians live within five minutes of a Post Office \nor PuntoPoste.\nThe full integration of its channels enables the Poste Italiane Group to effectively manage cus-\ntomers, from engagement to sales, through a data-driven service model supported by technolo-\ngy-intensive processes and customer operations. This model also contributes to the digitalisation \nprocess of the country by reducing the digital divide. Through its omnichannel interaction platform, \nPoste Italiane handles 20 million daily customer interactions, 6.7 million of which come from digital \nchannels.\nIn addition, the “Punto Poste Casa & Famiglia”, a new space where citizens can find the entire \nrange of products and services dedicated to the home and family, designed to simplify and en-\nhance customer relations, is active in many Post Offices. At the “Punto Poste Casa & Famiglia”, it \nis also possible to find out about the offers of PosteMobile Casa, easily activate PostePay Evolu-\ntion, subscribe to a Poste Guidare Sicuri RCA policy, or apply for all of Poste Italiane’s more “tra-\nditional” products, such as the “Libretto di Risparmio Postale” or the “Buono Fruttifero Postale”.\nPoste \nItaliane’s \nomnichannel \nstrategy\n381\nimprovement actions addressed  \nby the Quality and CX Task Force \nin 2022\n83%\nof customers say they are satisfied \n(engaged) with the Group’s services \nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n356\nSummary\nSection"

Among the most important interventions are the evolu-\ntion of the access model in the Post Office, through an initial \nsimplification of the booking process that will be completed \nin 2023, the simplification of identification in the Post Office, \nthe completion of the customer profile to enable it to operate \nin multi-channel mode, and the signing of the digital signature \nalso from the Post Office.\nThe areas for improvement that have emerged in relation \nto customer feedback constitute an important stimulus for \nprocess assessment and revision activities, together with \nthe support activities functional to maintaining quality cer-\ntifications and those identified by the “inter-functional com-\nmunities”. In this area, the use of a process mining platform, \npurchased in 2022 by the Group, continued in 2021, which \nenables more effective service quality improvement projects \nwith a strongly data-driven approach. During the year, the \nplatform was used on improvement projects related to trans-\nversal processes such as “successions” and the “invoicing \nphase of the asset cycle”.\nSince 2021, Poste Italiane has held UNI ISO 22222 certifica-\ntion for financial advisers who assist savers in their investment \nchoices. The certification confirms the Group’s commitment \nto supporting the widest application of ethical and sustaina-\nbility principles to enhance the development of professional \nskills and offer services dedicated to customers’ needs. Poste \nItaliane was, in fact, the first among large Italian companies to \nachieve UNI ISO 22222 and UNI TS 11348 certifications for \nthe Investment Advisory Service Model of financial advisors \nengaged in the role of personal financial planners. In addition, \nthe concomitant certification on purchasing methods places \nPoste Italiane among the country’s leading economic and \nproduction entities qualified in sustainable management of \npurchasing processes and supplier relations.\nPoste Italiane brings the system for collecting and manag-\ning complaints under the responsibility of the “Customer \nCare Services” function. The objective of this structure is \nto address and guide the customer’s expectations through \na series of customised solutions, adopting a model that \nmakes service a competitive lever both of the customer \nrelationship and of the support of the business. The Group’s \nobjective is to build a customer support journey for each \nbusiness segment, enabling over time more efficient man-\nagement of the customer experience, with the progressive \nadoption of innovative technological tools. With the spread \nof artificial intelligence within Customer Care Services, \nPoste Italiane managed to increase the number of man-\naged contracts by 10% in 2022 compared to 2021, with AI \naccounting for 39% of managed contracts (33% in 2021).\nPoste Italiane has always paid the utmost attention to the \nneeds of its customers to ensure their complete satisfac-\ntion, in order to offer the product or service best suited to \ntheir needs and preferences. In cases where the customer’s \nexpectations are not met, the cooperation of the customer \nbecomes essential for the Company to identify and remove \nthe causes of the inconvenience. Co-operation, in fact, on the \none hand allows the interested party to have its needs met, \nand on the other hand to put in place the necessary corrective \nactions and activities to improve business processes. In this \nregard, Poste Vita has adopted a Complaints Policy that pre-\ncisely defines the principles for handling customer grievances \naimed at their correct and timely handling. In addition, the \npreparation of a monthly Complaints Report allows the mon-\nitoring of the above activities, highlighting the main causes of \ncomplaints and the corrective actions put in place to resolve \nthem.\nThe issue of quality, which is also strongly integrated within \nthe corporate development strategy, takes on a primary role \nwithin the Poste Italiane Group’s Integrated Policy, with the \naim of mapping, within the framework of quality manage-\nment systems, all the processes that contribute to the design, \ndevelopment and implementation of a product or service.\nMoreover, Poste Italiane considers it of fundamental impor-\ntance to build customer relationships characterised by the \npursuit of maximum transparency and fairness. For this rea-\nson, the Company requires its employees to constantly strive \nto meet its customers’ expectations, and envisages that the \nprinciples set out in the Integrated Policy should be trans-\nposed by the Group Companies, according to their autonomy \nand independence, adapting them according to their size, \norganisational and operational context and any regulatory \nprovisions (e.g. Financial and Insurance sectors).\nIn order to ensure the highest level of effectiveness and effi-\nciency of processes, activities and resources, the Company \nhas adopted an Integrated Management System that allows it \nto produce reporting that represents the trend of complaints \nand customer experience indicators.

The System plays an essential role in defining the rules \nand limits applicable to quality control at all levels.

Large Customer Accounts and SME/\nPOE Accounts thus have an always-on survey through which \nthey can point out areas for improvement in sales and after-\nsales customer management. During the year, the frequen-\ncy of NPS measurement of large customers was increased \nand the ‘Inner Close The Loop’ process was implemented, \nwhich consists of the analysis of customer verbatims by an \ninter-functional team with the aim of structuring a follow-up, \nwhich is returned to each individual customer by the Account.\nAs far as customer interaction is concerned, recall manage-\nment is crucial for the Poste Italiane Group because it can be \nan instrumental indicator in defining the Group’s level of ser-\nvice. It also contributes to the assessment and management \nof operational and reputational risks, as well as non-compli-\nance and conduct risks. In this regard, specific reporting sys-\ntems are used to analyse the progress of complaints, carried \nout on a weekly and monthly basis, which communicate the \nresults to top management. Each Poste Italiane Group com-\npany has adopted and implemented specific procedures out-\nlining the principles and procedures for handling complaints, \nand these procedures are periodically submitted to their \nrespective Boards of Directors for approval.\nDuring 2022, the Poste Italiane Group implemented its financial services offering.

The Framework Agreement signed in \n2011, and then renewed in 2018, through which the “Cantiere \nConsumatori” was set up, a permanent working and con-\nsultation group made up of a single representative of each \nAssociation and Group representatives, whose purpose is to \nidentify the best solutions to reconcile the Company’s needs \nwith those of its customers in the context of consumer-oriented \ncorporate initiatives. Through the working group, the Company \nhas been able to increase the quality of its products and ser-\nvices over time by adopting a constructive and transparent \napproach between the parties. \nFurthermore, in order to follow up on the issues that emerged \nand were addressed at the round table and to promote ini-\ntiatives, the newsletter “Dialogando con i Consumatori” was \ncreated, an information tool addressed to the territorial rep-\nresentatives of Consumer Associations. The aim of this pro-\nject is to inform stakeholders about the main news related to \nPoste Italiane’s activities and to provide them with new insights \nand recommendations, in order to further tighten the bond of \nknowledge and cooperation that has always characterised the \nrelationship between the Company and consumers.\nIn order to guide consumers through the online purchasing \nprocess, Poste Italiane has made available to them the “E@\nsy commerce” manual, created in collaboration with nineteen \nConsumer Associations and Netcomm, the Italian E-commerce \nConsortium whose members include the most important \nnational operators in the e-commerce sector.\nIn order to ensure the availability of all the information neces-\nsary for the efficient use of postal products and to describe the \nquality objectives that the Company is committed to achiev-\ning for each of them, Poste Italiane makes available the Postal \nServices Charters, which provide all the information on the \nmain products, delivery targets and times for Italy and abroad, \ncomplaints and refunds.

Therefore, the adoption of valid computer \nsecurity systems is instrumental to the correct functioning and \nprovision of own services and guarantees the confidentiality of \ndata and information, preventing any type of access to unauthor-\nised parties.\nAmong the priorities of the Poste Italiane Group is the protection \nand safeguarding of the information assets of customers and \nstakeholders. This is made possible by technologically advanced \nsystems and state-of-the-art defence measures\nThis includes the Corporate Affairs - Information Security struc-\nture, which carries out a monthly cyber risk assessment for the \nGroup. The methodology currently in use considers this risk from \na purely technological point of view based on preventive technical \nsecurity audits carried out on the three applications: Vulnerability \nAssessment, Static and Dynamic Code Review, Penetration Test. \n \nz Vulnerability Assessment, is the process of identifying, \nmeasuring and prioritising the vulnerabilities of a system. The \nassessment is performed with special tools twice a year for \neach application;\n \nz Code Review (Static and Dynamic), represents the pro-\ncess of checking the source code of an application to verify \nthat the correct security controls are in place and that they are \nworking as intended. By means of special tools, the verifica-\ntion is carried out of both the source code (“Static CR”) and of \nthe code in execution (“Dynamic CR”);\n \nz Penetration Test, the process of evaluating the security of a \nsystem or a network through the simulation of attacks that aim \nto gain undue access to the system. Being a time-consuming \nactivity, it is performed on a specific perimeter of applications.\nWith the aim of ensuring effective and efficient management of \npotential cyber risks in the Company, Poste Italiane combines \nthese precautionary measures with two other indispensable \nparameters: patching and hardening. Together, these activities \nare aimed at resolving vulnerabilities by keeping the operating \nsystem, firmware and applications up-to-date, activating only \nrequired ports and services, and obfuscating easily breached \nsystem components.\nThe cyber risk assessment revolves around two main dimen-\nsions, Severity and Confidence. Severity identifies the severity \nlevel of cyber vulnerabilities; on the contrary, confidence refers \nthe level of reliability of the cyber risk value, which depends on the \ncoverage degree of the checks carried out in terms of number of \ncompleted analyses. Downstream of the entire analysis process, \nRecovery Plans are drawn up, i.e. the main corrective measures \nnecessary to fill the safety gaps identified during the various anal-\nyses, including the technical ones.

The tasks for \nwhich this function is responsible include:\n \nz real-time control, 24 hours a day, of the services provided \nby the Group;\n \nz the protection of the safety of customers inside Post \nOffices and of personnel in all workplaces;\n \nz combating fraud and cybercrime;\n \nz experimentation of the services offered by the Company.\nThe BCC consists of seven control rooms that use state-of-\nthe-art applications and instrumentation to ensure the prop-\ner functioning of the postal-logistics network and guarantee \nthe delivery of services and correct communication to Poste \nItaliane’s customers.\nPoste Italiane also maintains its strong collaborative relationship \nwith the Postal and Communications Police. This agreement \nenvisaged activities aimed at preventing and combating offenc-\nes relating to the products and production processes of the ser-\nvices offered by the Poste Italiane Group; surveillance at Post \nOffices during scheduled payment periods; the establishment of \ntask forces to analyse new methods of computer fraud; and the \ndevelopment of new cybersecurity tools. These measures were \nnecessary to cope with changing scenarios and new types of \nmalicious events. This has prompted the Company to quickly \nreadjust its operations over the years, especially with reference to \npayment systems for e-commerce and financial and insurance \nservices, for which it was necessary to intensify the activity of \ncontrol and updating of the physical and IT security structures.\nPersonal data protection  \nOver the years, the Company has attached great importance \nto the issue of personal data protection, constantly upgrad-\ning its corporate regulatory system and ensuring full compli-\nance with current provisions and the General Data Protection \nRegulation (GDPR), taking charge of the control of the man-\nagement review process at Group level, as set out in art. 32. \nThis regulatory system, consisting of procedures, guidelines \nand policies, is also applied in relations with all partners and \nsuppliers, in order to ensure proper management of the risks \nrelated to privacy in all the Group’s operations.  Failure to \ncomply with the standards defined by the system that leads \nto the occurrence of violations, may result in the application \nto employees of the disciplinary sanctions provided by the \nCCNL of Poste Italiane, gradually stricter based on the sever-\nity of the violation (written warning, fine, suspension of service \nwith loss of pay, dismissal without notice, etc.).  In this regard, \nPoste Italiane has drawn up a Corporate Policy on Personal \nData Protection and Privacy Guidelines and a Personal Data \nProtection Management System, the latter introduced with \nthe aim of ensuring uniform data management at Group \nlevel. In particular, the Guidelines define the Company privacy \nmodel and implements the principles of Privacy by Design \nand Privacy by Default, which establish the need for the \nCompany to ensure adequate protection of personal data \nfrom the design of products/services and IT systems and to \nguarantee compliance with privacy legislation by default in \nprocesses for the collection and processing of data. Poste \nItaliane is also committed to ensuring proper management of \ndata protection risks, including by carrying out the periodic \nmanagement review process at the Group level.\nBy adopting policies and information campaigns aimed at \nraising data protection awareness, the Group promotes the \nprotection of the personal data of all stakeholders\nPoste Italiane’s Privacy Framework was created with the aim \nof ensuring compliance with these obligations and aspiring \nto the continuous improvement of the management system. \nThis framework provides an overview of the areas of interven-\ntion in which the relevant organisational and technical frame-\nworks that have been developed operate, in order to provide \ncontinuous monitoring of the progress achieved.\n-90%\ncustomers involved in IT security  \nbreaches compared to 2021\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

For Poste Italiane, innovation and \ndigitalisation are two central drivers of strategic progress \nand enable it to guarantee its customers innovative tech-\nnological solutions, also through the integration of its own \nproducts and services with those of third parties. Through \nthese drivers, the Company not only guarantees the acces-\nsibility and efficiency of its offer to all citizens, but also pro-\nmotes the connection with the Public Administration and \nthe Italian entrepreneurial world, setting itself as a reference \npoint on the path towards innovation and digitalisation of the \ncountry. In February 2023, Poste Italiane plans to expand its \nrange of services by entering the energy sector with a 100% \ngreen product. The Poste Energia offer provides custom-\ners with electricity produced exclusively in Italy from renew-\nable sources and certified through guarantees of origin. \nThis project allows the Group to correlate green transition \nissues with those of innovation and digitalisation, while rep-\nresenting a major opportunity for sustainable development \nat national level.\nFor the Poste Italiane Group, innovation and digitalisation are \nthe main drivers of strategic progress, fundamental to ensu-\nring cutting-edge technological solutions\nBy adopting an innovative approach, the Company has \nmanaged to supplement its traditional offer with new pro-\nposals and to adapt quickly and effectively to a changing \nsocio-economic context. In the aftermath of the Covid-19 \npandemic, the country was forced to accelerate the digi-\ntalisation and innovation path started in previous years and \nPoste Italiane, thanks to customer-oriented technological \nsolutions implemented directly through digital channels, \nsupported companies in the transition.\nInnovation and digitalisation of products and services  \nDuring 2022, Poste Italiane achieved important results in \nterms of development and value creation for the country and \nthe community, and thanks to its constant commitment to the \nsearch for cutting-edge digital solutions and the integration of \nnew business models, it was able to revisit its range of prod-\nucts and services.\nPayments and current accounts\nIn order to mitigate potential negative impacts, measures were \nimplemented in the area of payments to streamline existing \nprocesses aimed at improving the customer experience by \nincreasing the use of PostePay’s products/services increasingly \nfocused on omnichannel. These actions also concerned com-\nmunications, so as to make the information easily accessible to \nthe customer. In particular, in the area of issuing, the Company \nconfirmed its commitment to implementing communication \nactivities in order to make the status of its charter and its oper-\nations clearer and more transparent. In addition, the content of \nthe website and the documentation related to the services and \nproducts available for the Customer Service function are peri-\nodically updated using the feedback gathered through listen-\ning to the customer. Consistent with the PostePay Operating \nRules (ROF) and in compliance with the Product Oversight \nGovernance (POG) process, periodic monitoring is carried out \nfor the products issued, with particular regard to:\n \nz information flows between distributor and manufactu-\nrer concerning the coherence between the target mar-\nket identified for the product and how it was placed with \ncustomers;\n \nz evaluation of the results and critical issues that emerged \nduring the marketing phase.\nSpecifically, in order to address the actual negative impacts, \nan internal PostePay cross-functional table was opened to \nidentify and map the critical points and take timely action on \nthem.\nIn 2022, in continuity with previous years, the Company \nimplemented the digital payment services available, through \nan ecosystem of collection services available to consum-\ner, business and PA customers, which can be used either \nthrough the physical network or through web or app chan-\nnels. Still considering digital payments, the Group extended \nthe “SoftPOS” service not only to the express courier SDA \n- the first entity to be enabled for the service - but also to \npost officers. Thanks to the new PDA, Poste Italiane’s oper-\nators are able to handle cash-on-delivery mail and parcels \nand, through Tap on Phone (“SoftPOS”) technology, authorise \ncontactless payments through PostePay’s “Pay with code” \nfunctionality. Furthermore, in 2022, “SoftPOS” saw the ena-\nbling of a “posless” electronic payment acceptance service \non proprietary devices of large merchants.\nNFS\nMAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL\n+20%  \nincidence of digital operations\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

Premium consultants are carefully selected following \ncontinuous and highly specialised training.\nAs far as current accounts dedicated to Business and \nPublic Administration are concerned, in 2022, “BancoPosta \nBusiness Link”, a current account for Small Business cus-\ntomers, introduced in the previous year and provided with \na modular offer accessible online, was awarded at the MF \nBanking Awards with the Innovation Award in the category \n“Accounts and payments for business customers”.\nThe offer launched in 2021, whereby the fee for the first \nyear of the Postepay Evolution Business card is reimbursed \nwith the request for the “Tandem Mobile POS” or “Tandem \nPhysical POS” acquiring service and, at the same time, with \nthe request for the card itself, was activated for the duration \nof 2022. \nIn line with the Group’s Strategic Plan, BancoPosta’s contribution proved to be extremely relevant \nin 2022, confirming its position as the most reliable financial institution in Italy thanks to its om-\nnichannel approach that guarantees a wide range of insurance and investment products. \nThe three pillars that guarantee the offer of an innovative business model are: people, the invest-\nment target for growth and the development of technical and professional skills; the platform, \nwhich increasingly guarantees adequate support for commercial activity and appropriate interac-\ntion with customers; and the products, which include, for example, multi-class policies, numerous \npartnerships and joint ventures. \nBy adopting an omnichannel logic, which allows for integration and synergy between channels for \naccessing products and services, BancoPosta is constantly adapting its activities to an increas-\ningly customer-centric perspective.\nBancoPosta\nTowards an \nincreasingly \ncustomer-centric \napproach\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n370\nSummary\nSection"

The service \nprovides the possibility of creating up to 5 savings targets at \nthe same time for a maximum total amount of €5,000. The \ncustomer chooses the sum to be accumulated, the date of \nattainment (from 1 to 24 months) and the relevant category \n(e.g. travel, leisure) with the option of customisation. Through \nthe sharing functionality, it is also possible to ask family and \nfriends for a contribution to the achievement of the objec-\ntive. Through the Digital Money Box, the Poste Italiane Group \nencourages and promotes savings education, customer loy-\nalty and the attraction of new customers, also encouraging \nthe younger target group.\nSince 2021, Poste Italiane customers have the option of using \nthe SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (or SCT Instant) service on \ndigital channels. Holders of Postepay cards with IBANs and \nholders of BancoPosta current accounts can have payments \ncredited to the beneficiary in less than 10 seconds, as well \nas being able to independently manage their payments on \nthe web and app channels. Customers can consult their pay-\nments and individual debit history, activate and revoke new \nmandates, enter specific amount limits and change debit \nIBAN coordinates also in omnichannel mode. Consistent \nwith the European Central Bank’s Roadmap, the process of \nadhering to the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) \nsystem was completed, enabling BancoPosta account hold-\ners and Postepay holders with IBAN, as well as holders of \n‘Smart’ savings books, to receive instant credit transfers also \nfrom PSPs participating in the TIPS circuit.\nThe implementation of these initiatives aims at improving the \nuser experience by enabling new use cases and facilitating \nthe replacement of traditional payment instruments such as \ncheques and money orders.\nThe “Supersmart” offer, dedicated to customers bringing \nin new liquidity, allows them to access higher than stand-\nard interest rates on the amounts set aside at maturity. The \n“Supersmart 180 Days” offer can be activated at post offices, \non poste.it and the BancoPosta app.\nAlso in 2022, the Group provided the service in the third-par-\nty motor liability market, with the Poste Guidare Sicuri prod-\nuct, which saw the Company adopt a gradual sales enabling \napproach for the distribution network. The service provides \nextensive coverage and includes a number of free warranty \nextensions.

As a result of a co-innovation project of Poste Italiane \n(thanks to the internal teams in DTO Open Innovation and in BancoPosta), together with the start-up \nGamindo, an initiative to invent and realise video games was carried out. An advergame, a branded \nvideo game, was developed to promote Poste Italiane and the Conto BancoPosta - Start Giovani op-\ntion. This race game allowed users to be immersed in a new user experience, involving and informing \nyoung people about the services and benefits of the current account dedicated to them, with a strong \nmessage of innovation and digitalisation. Through “Conto BancoPosta Start Giovani - The Game”, \nyoung people can have fun and at the same time discover new information on the services offered, \nincluding the possibility of subscribing to the account in the BancoPosta app.\nAround 25,000 matches were played by Poste Italiane customers who went online to learn about the \nBancoPosta Start Giovani account. By playing an average of more than 2 minutes per game (on the \nvarious social platforms TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn etc.), around 1,400 accounts were opened at the \nend of the trial, including through commercial e-mails and links to product site pages.\nThe game, developed for the BancoPosta Start Giovani account, consists of driving a small blue car on \na “suspended” road, preventing it from ending up off the track. Along the way, bonus icons depicting \nPoste Italiane products are collected. What is of particular interest is the way in which customers are \ninformed about the various services: every time they start to play, or start again after a mistake, users \nhave to answer a simple question dealing with the BancoPosta world.

In fact, thanks to its air connections, \nPoste Italiane has made it possible to deliver parcels within 24 \nhours throughout Italy, including the islands. The Company’s \naircraft fleet consists of six vehicles in total: five Boeing 737-\n400 Cargo and one ATR 72-500 Cargo. Domestically, it oper-\nates permanently at 8 airports.\nIn the delivery area, the Group continued its growth strategy \nin the logistics segment related to e-commerce purchases by \nstrengthening the potential of its partnership with Amazon. \nPuntoPoste, Poste Italiane’s network for the collection of \nonline purchases and the delivery of any returns, is part of \nthis strategy. It complements the 12,800 Post Offices and \nconsists of around 15,000 alternative collection points includ-\ning tobacconists, bars, stationers, newsagents, shops and \nKiPoints, as well as 320 lockers and 80 enabled Carrefour \nsupermarkets. The choice by customers to pick up or send \na parcel at one of these points is what is now called “green \nbehaviour”, a more responsible and sustainable behaviour as \nthe logistical process behind the use of the service helps to \nreduce CO2 emissions. This stems from the fact that Poste \nItaliane, instead of using numerous vehicles to deliver to cus-\ntomers’ multiple domiciles, can concentrate collection at a \nsingle collection point, thus reducing the number of passages \nand vehicle movements of the company fleet.\nFurthermore, the agreement signed with the partner Italiana \nPetroli (IP) provides for an increase in pick-up points dedicat-\ned to purchases online, to the dispatch of pre-stamped par-\ncels and returns from the main e-commerce sites that adhere \nto the PuntoPoste Network.\nRegarding the partnership with Amazon, renewed in 2021 for \nanother three years, the aim is to meet the growing demand of \ncustomers throughout Italy through innovative delivery servic-\nes. In this regard, operators running an e-commerce site can \nactivate the “Reverse Paperless” function of Poste Delivery \nBusiness, which not only makes the return service easier for \nthe e-shopper without the need to print the shipping label, but \nis also beneficial for the retailer as it increases sales volume.\nAdditionally, in 2022 the Group continued its cooperation \nwith Zalando, offering the possibility of using the PuntoPoste \nnetwork for returns management and outward shipments. In \ncontinuity with previous years, the “Scegli Tu” (You Choose) \nservice remained active, providing flexibility in the delivery of \na shipment to the recipient, allowing it to be managed and \ncustomised even when in transit.\nOne year after its inauguration, the activities of the Landriano e-commerce plant have continued, \nensuring fast deliveries throughout Italy. Landriano represents Italy’s first major hub for e-commerce \nand express courier services, capable of processing up to 320,000 parcels per day and ensure fast \ndeliveries throughout Italy. The Landriano hub represents for Poste Italiane a further step in the trans-\nformation process of its logistics infrastructure, focused on innovation and sustainability. The facility \nenables the strategic development of the logistics network along the entire value chain to capture \nthe full growth potential of e-commerce. Furthermore, the Landriano hub is a key part of Poste Itali-\nane’s sorting line together with the hubs in Bologna, Piacenza and the Centro di Passo Corese hub \nin Rome. The four centres are connected to the more than 90 branches and 1,700 delivery centres \ndistributed throughout Italy for the operational handling of parcels that will then be delivered by the \nnetwork of post officers and couriers.\nAt the Landriano hub, the sorting system, the operation used to sort goods and shipments, consists \nof four interconnected machines that automatically sort parcels by destination and weight/volume \nover 694 outlets, allowing the handling of 39,000 items per hour, using the highest technological \nstandards. The state-of-the-art equipment also includes an innovative sorting system based on \n‘autonomous mobile sorting’ technology, through which goods are sorted according to weight/\nvolume by one of four machines that handle objects by type: small, medium, large and abnormally \nshaped. Objects with abnormal shapes are sorted by a specific machine operated by 17 robots to \nbe subsequently processed by one of the system’s four machines.\nThe new Landriano plant strictly adheres to the sustainability principles promoted by the Group. \nThe structure has obtained the BREEAM In-Use Excellent certification, one of the most relevant \ninternational certifications in the field of sustainability, for the design and construction choices made. \nState-of-the-art photovoltaic panels covering a total area of 2,500 square metres were installed on \nthe roof of the facility, providing the hub’s daytime energy needs and reducing annual CO2 emissions \nby 210 tonnes.

In fact, the services made available \nare differentiated according to the required delivery speed \n(express or standard) and destination, and can be custom-\nised according to the customer’s needs. For example, the \n“Reverse” option allows merchants to offer a simple and \nconvenient return service, giving their customers the pos-\nsibility to return purchases to Post Offices or PuntoPoste, \nwhile with the “Scegli Tu” (You Choose) option, the customer \ncan change the destination address, reschedule the deliv-\nery at any time and view real-time updates on the expected \narrival time.

The centre was \ndesigned and built in accordance with the “Joint Delivery”, the delivery model introduced throughout \nthe province that guarantees the delivery of mail and parcels even during the afternoon hours and on \nSaturdays, as well as having state-of-the-art equipment to optimise the work of employees. \nIn addition to the Viterbo distribution centre, the Group opened other distribution centres in 2022, \nincluding Bracciano and Firenze Novoli. The new centres were designed in a functional way for \n“Joint Delivery” and allow a considerable increase in the volume of mail handled by Poste Italiane. \nIn the new distribution centres, all post officers are equipped with PDAs with which they handle \nordinary mail and signatures in a quick and traceable manner. The recipient can pay from home or \nwork, at the same time as the mail or parcel is delivered, by Postamat card, Postepay card or using \ndebit cards from the Cirrus/Maestro circuit.

      "text": "Integration of ESG  \nfactors into investment \npolicies\nThe growing popularity of sustainable finance and the expan-\nsion of responsible investment testify that the integration of \nESG considerations has now become a strategic axis, and that \ninstitutional investors have a duty to work towards the creation \nof long-term sustainable value.\nThis principle has, for years now, underpinned the responsible \ninvestment approach that the Poste Italiane Group has adopt-\ned and implemented in the investment activities of BancoPosta \nFondi SGR and Poste Vita. In fact, the Group has long integrat-\ned this vision into its strategy, translating the principles of sus-\ntainability into all the sectors in which it operates, including the \nfinancial sector, strong in its conviction that, thanks to effective \ninvestment processes, the asset management and insurance \nsectors can help protect society, promote innovation and sup-\nport economic growth.\nPoste Italiane believes that the integration of ESG risks and \nopportunities in the management of investment portfolios \ncan provide a concrete response to the social and environ-\nmental needs expressed by society, positively influencing \nthe entire Country System\nIn order to define a holistic approach for the integration of \nenvironmental, social and governance (“ESG”) considerations \ninto investment activities, as of 2019, a path was undertaken \nto develop the strategies and general approach of responsible \ninvestment for the Group’s financial companies, BancoPosta \nFondi SGR and Poste Vita. The first step along this path is the \nformal commitment to integrate ESG criteria into investment \nactivities, following the two companies’ signing of the \nPrinciples for Responsible Investment (PRI). This is an interna-\ntional network of investors, promoted by the United Nations, \nwhose aim is to encourage the integration of ESG issues with-\nin their investments and the companies they invest in, propos-\ning a long-term vision in the interests of the signatories, the \neconomy, the environment and society. The commitment \nmade is not limited to the integration of ESG criteria, but also \ntranslates into a form of accountability with respect to policies \nand to the ESG integration processes adopted by signatories, \nwho are obliged to report on progress in implementing the \nresponsible investment approach after stipulation and on an \nannual basis. This step is therefore consistent not only with \nthe Group’s perspective that the inclusion of ESG issues in \ninvestment processes is necessary to pursue long-term sus-\ntainable performance and reduce portfolio risk, but also with \nthe principles of transparency and integrity in conduct. \nIn Poste Italiane’s vision, an important contribution to the \ndissemination of sustainable development models and the \nachievement of ESG objectives from an international perspec-\ntive is possible through dialogue with issuers where Group \ncompanies choose to invest, involving them in initiatives ded-\nicated to the management of ESG criteria. In line with this \nconviction, in 2022, BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita \nrenewed their commitment to engagement as a pillar of ESG \nintegration strategies in their investment processes, taking part \nin collaborative initiatives, with the aim of fostering the achieve-\nment of concrete results through the shared mobilisation of \nresources, in line with the guidelines governing the exercise of \nvoting rights and engagement activities. \nNFS\nFestival of Sustainable Development\nPoste Italiane participated to the Festival \nof Sustainable Development represented \nby the CEO of BancoPosta Fondi SGR, \nbringing its experience in sustainable \ndevelopment and as an institutional \npartner of the event\nMAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL\nThe last few years have seen increasing regulation at the European level in the area of sustainable \nfinance, thanks to regulations enacted by the legislature with the aim of redirecting capital flows \ntowards sustainable investments and promoting transparency and long-term vision in economic \nand financial activities.\nDuring 2022, regulatory technical standards were defined. “RTS”, Delegated Regulation (EU) \n2022/1288) governing the presentation and content of the disclosures required under Regulation \n(EU) 2019/2008 (“Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation” or “SFDR”) and Regulation (EU) \n2020/852 (“Taxonomy Regulation”). \nIn view of the entry into force of the RTS, BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita have been called \nupon to adapt to the provisions, in particular by updating the disclosure in the pre-contractual \ndocumentation with the preparation of the annexes and the adaptation of the disclosure on the \nwebsite for all Group products that promote environmental or social characteristics (as per Art. 8 \nSFDR).

This strategy is based on the principle of includ-\ning the environmental, social and governance profile of issuers \nin investment assessment processes, with the adoption of \nmonitoring tools to identify the presence of inadequate sus-\ntainability profiles.

In addition to the resulting financial instability, the huge increase in energy prices helped \npush up inflation rates, leading the relevant central banks to intervene by raising interest rates.\nThe price shocks experienced have once again underlined the urgency, also on the part of the \nfinancial and insurance sector, to accelerate the climate transition, working along global pathways \nof decarbonisation and promotion of clean energies, while ensuring long-term social development.\nIn line with this, the Poste Italiane Group, BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita signed the “Busi-\nness letter ahead of the publication of the RePowerEU Plan” addressed to the President of the \nEuropean Commission Ursula Von der Leyen to support the European Union in ending its supply \ndependency on Russia and promoting the green transition by enhancing energy security and resil-\nience.\nThe impact \nof war on \nmarkets and \nsupport for \nthe green \ntransition\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n386\nSummary\nSection"

In par-\nticular, the extension of the investment product offering \nincludes, in addition to the application of the policies and \nguidelines implemented by Group companies, investment \nstrategies aimed at achieving the best performance through \ninvestments selected on the basis of ESG characteristics, \naccording to different possible approaches. \nThe offering of investment solutions classified under Article \n8 SFDR, in line with the regulatory framework indicated by \nRegulation (EU) 2019/2088, stems from both the launch of new \nproducts and the revision of the investment strategies applied, \nwith the introduction of additional ESG integration strategies.\nThis commitment was shared by both BancoPosta Fondi SGR \nand Poste Vita, which, with reference to its range of insurance \ninvestment products, finalised the configuration and launch of a \nproduct with a strengthened profile in terms of ESG integration \nin its investment activities.\nGreen Funds\nFollowing the marketing in 2021 of BancoPosta Focus \nAmbiente 2027, BancoPosta Fondi SGR doubled its range of \nthematic products focused on the environment during the year, \nwith the launch of BancoPosta Focus Ambiente March 2028. \nThe funds, managed under delegation by Anima SGR, invest \nprimarily in funds classified as products that promote environ-\nmental and/or social characteristics or pursue a sustainability \nobjective (within the meaning of the SFDR regulation), in par-\nticular focusing on sectors and economic segments related \nto environmental protection such as, for example, the circular \neconomy, water management, blue economy, renewable ener-\ngy and climate transition.\nWith regard to insurance, there is a multi-class product whose \nclass III component can be invested in an internal insurance \nfund linked to a benchmark consisting mainly of ESG indices, \nincluding, for 20%, a global equity index aiming to reduce car-\nbon emissions by at least 50% compared to the main index. \nIn addition, Poste Vita’s portfolio includes investments in alter-\nnative asset classes with an ESG component: for example, \nthe Real Estate Diamond Eurozone Office (DEO) fund, which \nreceived a high sustainability rating from GRESB114 and was \nawarded the title of Green Fund, and the Real Estate Diamond \nCore investment fund whose underlying assets are WELL/\nLEED Gold-certified real estate and which received the first \ngreen financing in the Italian real estate sector.\nESG funds of funds  \nAs part of the ESG integration implemented by fund-of-funds \nproducts, BancoPosta Fondi SGR operates as an asset man-\nager through flexible solutions based on the structuring of a \nproprietary model to support investment decisions. In particu-\nlar, the two funds of the Universo family, BancoPosta Universo \n40 and BancoPosta Universo 60, have been joined by three \ninternal funds representing the sustainable investment options \noffered by the first Article 8 SFDR product launched by Poste \nVita, namely “Poste Vita Valore Sostenibilità Dinamico”, “Poste \nVita Valore Sostenibilità Equilibrato” and “Poste Vita Valore \nSostenibilità Sviluppo”.\nIn all cases, the selection of funds in which to invest is based \non the consideration of ESG criteria that allow for the prefer-\nence of the most virtuous fund houses from the point of view of \nthe responsible investment approach adopted and the relevant \nfunds with investment policies aimed at selecting issuers with \npositive ESG profiles. The evaluation of the fund house is, in \nfact, a selection criterion that ensures the consistency of its \ncommitment with that of the SGR. To this end, a proprietary \nESG rating methodology has been developed that assigns an \ninternal rating to investable UCITS based on an assessment \nof the degree of commitment and application of responsible \ninvestment strategies.\nAt the beginning of 2023, BancoPosta Fondi SGR launched \nthe placement of its new fund Universo Tematico, which uses \nthe same criteria for selecting UCITs as described above, while \nfocusing investments on three mega-trends (planet, innovation, \npopulation) that will drive future changesi.\nPoste Gestione Patrimoniale\nIn 2022, Poste Italiane, in collaboration with \nBancoPosta Fondi SGR and Moneyfarm, \nlaunched Poste Gestione Patrimoniale, a \nnew portfolio management composed of 4 \nlines, the investment decisions of which take \nESG factors into account\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n388\nSummary\nSection"

In \nparticular, issuer selection is conducted with the aim of mini-\nmising exposure to certain business sectors and maintaining \na minimum level of ESG rating per issuer or portfolio.\nThe transition of the three BancoPosta funds Mix 1, Mix 2 and \nMix 3 from Article 6 to Article 8 SFDR will also become effec-\ntive in the course of 2023. The investment policy will be \nrevised to include the application of sustainable finance crite-\nria such as the exclusion of controversial sectors and the \nimplementation of a best-in-class strategy.\nIntegration of ESG \nfactors into insurance  \npolicies\nThe increasing scale of environmental and social issues and the \nmacro-trends that have emerged in recent years have led to \nan urgent need to ensure adequate coverage of environmen-\ntal, social and governance risks as well, drawing the attention \nof the insurance industry and the essential role it plays in this \narea. In fact, through proper and effective implementation of \nrisk management processes also by industry players, the insur-\nance sector can contribute to the protection of the community \nand the sustainable development of society. \nIn light of these considerations, the path of ESG integration \nin the financial business was also initiated with reference to \ninsurance activities and Poste Vita, on the basis of this aware-\nness, decided to define a robust approach formalised within \nits “Responsible Insurance Policy”, which will undergo a review \nprocess during 2022. This Policy describes the principles, \nobjectives and processes underlying the Company’s approach \nto managing risks and opportunities related to ESG factors \nwithin traditional insurance processes. In particular, the Policy \nprovides the principle of the systematic assessment of envi-\nronmental, social and economic context variables that have a \npotential impact on people, with the aim of guaranteeing ade-\nquate management of the risks involved with a view to busi-\nness continuity in the long term. In order to ensure the concrete \neffectiveness of its initiatives, the Policy also includes articulat-\ned management and monitoring processes through the defini-\ntion of predetermined roles and tools. \nThe early adoption of an ESG integration approach in the finan-\ncial business has enabled Poste Vita to anticipate developmen-\nts in the relevant market scenarios by introducing innovative \nand sustainable insurance products with social and environ-\nmental impacts \n \nSince 2019, the Poste Vita Group has been a signatory to the \nPrinciples for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) promoted by the \nUnited Nations, affirming its formal commitment to the inclu-\nsion of sustainability criteria relevant to the insurance sector in \nits decision-making processes. This commitment is also \nemphasised through collaboration paths with customers and \npartners aimed at raising awareness in this area and the pro-\nmotion of synergies with bodies and institutions with the aim \nof bringing about widespread and cohesive action on ESG \nissues \nInsurance products with social \nand environmental value\nThe Poste Vita Insurance Group, consistent with its corpo-\nrate objectives, defines and markets its products pursuing \nthe objectives of enhancing the social role of insurance pro-\ntection and inclusiveness facilitating economic affordability. \nFor this reason, the Group develops insurance solutions \nthat, on the one hand, encourage the adoption of sustain-\nable and responsible behaviour by its policyholders and, \non the other, are functional to the mitigation of ESG risks. \nDuring the development phase of its offering, the Group is \nMAIN RELATED TYPES OF CAPITAL\nNFS\nBrand Finance Global 500\nIn 2023, Poste Italiane ranks 283rd in \nthe ranking of the 500 brands with the \nhighest financial value worldwide\nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

Specifically, in the area \nof individual pension plans, Poste Vita offers special comple-\nmentary forms, accessible also to the younger generations, \nwho find themselves having to fill a substantial pension gap, \nreducing the difference between the expected basic com-\npulsory pension and what is needed to guarantee a decent \nstandard of living. \nMoreover, in so-called risk coverages, such as term life or \nhealth policies, which play a crucial social role, the Group \nseeks to broaden the pool of potential policyholders as \nmuch as possible by adopting inclusive underwriting crite-\nria. With reference to Poste Assicura, as part of its impor-\ntant social responsibility to bridge the insurance gap, the \nCompany pursues the objective of providing coverage for \nhomogeneous groups of companies and their employees.\nStarting in 2021, the Group has put in place a process to \nevolve the services and functionalities available to customers \non the main digital channels (Insurance Reserved Area and \nBancoPosta app) with respect to life and protection policies. \nIt is thanks to this update that policyholders have the possi-\nbility of viewing, in their Private Insurance Area, the summa-\nry of the characteristics of the insurance product they have \nsubscribed to and of activating additional services, such as, \nfor life policies, the possibility of requesting partial or total \nredemption before maturity or requesting the settlement of \na policy close to maturity, while for protection policies the \npossibility of managing their claims from the opening of the \nclaim to settlement. In the same year, as part of the evolution \nof Poste Italiane’s advisory model, an experimental phase \nwas launched, as part of the distribution strategy for insur-\nance investment products (Multi-class and Class I policies), \nof remote offerings through the dispatch by the BancoPosta \ndistributor, in the reserved area of customers, of personal-\nised advice tailored to their profile. In this way, customers \nhave the possibility of finalising the remote consultations \nthey receive online via “Firma Elettronica Avanzata - FEA” \n(Advanced Electronic Signature). This new mode of offering, \nwhich was included in most of the products in the catalogue \nin 2022, alongside the offering at Post Offices, confirms the \nmulti-channel approach followed by the Group to improve \nthe customer experience.  \nIn line with its strategic objectives, during 2022, the Poste \nVita Group continued the evolution of its range by consid-\nering the development of solutions that allow it to access \nthe opportunities offered by the financial markets, includ-\ning by seizing the return opportunities arising from invest-\nments in securities with positive ESG profiles. In particu-\nlar, in May 2022, Poste Vita launched the placement of \nthe first product in its range classified as a product that \npromotes features within the meaning of EU Regulation \n2019/2088 (“SFDR”), namely “Poste Progetto Valore 360”: \nin addition to satisfying the needs of customers oriented \ntowards more sustainable investment choices, this product \nwas designed to offer customers a 360-degree advisory \nservice, which responds in an integrated manner to their \ninvestment needs and those of life and non-life protection, \nhaving, among others, the possibility to access in a single \nsimplified process also “Poste Vivere Protetti”, one of the \ninsurance offers offered by Poste Assicura in the area of \nprotection most recognised by customers, which aims to \nprovide an integrated and modular solution of protection, \nassistance and services in the areas of the person, prop-\nerty and assets. \n“Poste Progetto Valore 360” is a multi-class insurance solution that provides for the allocation of \nthe investment, according to a predefined combination, between the “Posta ValorePiù” segregated \naccount and one of the internal insurance funds, which operate with the objective of achieving \ngrowth of the invested capital, namely “Poste Vita Valore Sostenibilità Dinamico”, “Poste Vita Valore \nSostenibilità Equilibrato” and “Poste Vita Valore Sostenibilità Sviluppo”. Although characterised by \ndifferent risk profiles, each internal fund adopts a responsible investment strategy aimed at promot-\ning environmental and/or social characteristics.\nIn particular, the funds, the management of which is delegated to BancoPosta Fondi SGR, select \nUCITS instruments through a quantitative and qualitative evaluation process based on an analysis \nof the management company and an analysis of the individual UCITS, favouring those that apply \nat least one responsible investment strategy among the following: promotion of environmental or \nsocial characteristics, pursuit of sustainable investment objectives, or use of benchmarks with ESG \ncharacteristics. \n“Poste Progetto \nValore 360”\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n390\nSummary\nSection"

In this regard, as can be seen through the indicator ‘Occupational accidents net of Covid-19 cases’, the figure for \naccidents recorded in 2022 shows an increase compared to 2021 due to the predominant impact of Covid-19 cases (out of 27,302 accidents, 21,422 are related to Covid \ninfection).\n*****\tAccident occurring during the normal journey between home and place of work or during the worker’s normal journey to the place where meals are usually taken, if there is \nno company canteen.

The GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards envisage two calculation methods \nfor Scope 2 emissions – the location-based method and the market-based method. The Market-based method (methodology used by Poste Italiane) is based on CO2 emitted \nby the energy suppliers from whom the organisation purchases, through a contract, electricity (in this case, certificates of guarantee of origin from renewable energy sources) \nand for the remaining 1% emission factors from the national electricity grid (emission factor for the calculation of the Market-based method for: 2022 0.457 kg CO2e/kWh, \nsource European Residual Mixes 2021, for 2021 0.459 kg CO2e/kWh, source European Residual Mixes 2020, for 2020 0.466 kg CO2e/kWh, source European Residual Mixes \n2019). Conversion factors used to convert thermal energy into CO2 e: for 2020, 0.17 Kg CO2 e/kWh, for 2021, 0.17 Kg CO2e/kWh and for 2022, 0.17 Kg CO2e/kWh. The \ntarget set for 2022 is 3,000 tCO2 e.\n\t\nThe Location-based method, on the other hand, is based on average emission factors for regional, sub-national or national power generation. Applying the Location-based \nthe total Group emissions of Scope 2 in 2020 150,168 tCO2 e, in 2021 142,966 tCO2e and in 2022 139,206 tCO2e (emission factor for the calculation of the Location-based \nmethod 0.315 kg CO2 e/kWh, source: ISPRA 2022). \n****\tEmission factors used for conversion of fuels to CO2 e: Jet fuel for 2020 2.54 kg CO2 e/l (source DEFRA 2020), for 2021 2.55 kg CO2e/l (source DEFRA 2021) and for 2022 \n2.55 kg CO2e/l (source DEFRA 2022). The target expected for the year 2022 is 280,000 tCO2 e, an increase compared to 2021 as a result of a gradual outsourcing of transport. \nThe increase recorded, however, is small compared to the target set.\n[GRI 306-3] Waste generated [GRI 306-4] Waste recovered [GRI 306-5] Waste disposed of*\nWaste by type (t)\n2020**\n2021**\n2022\nWaste \ngenerated\nWaste \nrecovered\nWaste \ndisposed of\nWaste \ngenerated\nWaste \nrecovered\nWaste \ndisposed of\nWaste \ngenerated\nWaste \nrecovered***\nWaste \ndisposed of ****\nTotal waste \n29,240.6\n28,738.7\n501.9\n34,471.7\n33,202.5\n1,269.2\n37,245.3\n36,443.2\n802.1\nof which: \nPaper/cardboard \n12,642\n12,636.6\n5.4\n13,584.9\n13,539.2\n45.8\n15,588.5\n15,467.8\n125.2\nPlastic \n1,080\n1,080\n0\n1,359.3\n1,359.3\n0\n1,282.4\n1,282.4\n0\nWood\n8,617.7\n8,617.7\n0\n10,481.8\n10,478.2\n3.6\n10,097.9\n10,097.9\n0\nOther\n6,901\n6,404.4\n496.6\n9,045.8\n7,825.9\n1,219.8\n10,276.5\n9,595.2\n676.9\n*\t\nThe figures for the quantity of waste produced are provided by the companies that provide waste management services.\n**\t The 2020 and 2021 values have been updated following a refinement of the reporting system.\n***\t The target expected for 2022 with respect to recovered waste is 35,000 tonnes.\n****\tThe target set for 2022 in relation to waste sent to disposal (landfill, incinerated and other types of disposal) is 1,000 tonnes. \nReport on Operations at 31 December 2022\n7.

As a result of Law No. 77 of 17/07/2020, the scope of \nthe analysis has changed compared to 2020 when, instead, the observation was intended for the 38 offices with more than 300 employees located in 18 cities for a sample \nof 24,316 resources. The 2021 analysis also took into account the Company’s adoption of the agile working mode on the reduction of home-work kilometres travelled, \napplied to help contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus and taking into account the guidelines of the competent authorities, adopted by 80% of staff (12.5% of the company \npopulation) from January to September 2021 and by 50% in October-December 2021; the calculation was carried out excluding 17 cities for which the redemption rate of the \nquestionnaire was not sufficient to allow an estimate of the pollutants emitted in the home-work commute. It should be noted that, in implementation of the provisions of the \naforementioned Act, the methodology applied is that proposed by the new MITE-MIMS Guidelines introduced in August 2021, which therefore differs from the methodology \nused for the 2020 analysis.\n***\t The value indicated refers to the estimate of the polluting emissions generated by the home-work commute of Poste Italiane employees and refers to all the Group offices \nsubject to the home-work commute analysis in 2022 (offices > 100 employees located in municipalities with a population over 50,000 inhabitants) which, at present, amount to \n140 located in 77 municipalities of the national territory, for a sample of about 40,363 total resources. This is due to the provisions of Law No. 77 of 17/07/2020. The calculation \nalso takes into account the impact of smart working on the reduction of home-work kilometres travelled (adopted for 50% of staff with 2 returns per week). Consistent with \nthe provisions of Articles 18 et seq. of Law no. 81/2017 and the trade union agreements signed, this modality will continue, as of 01/04/2022, on the basis of individual \nagreements between the Company and the worker with 3 returns per week of the entire company staff population (13% of the company population, 123,000 employees - \nSource RUO as of 01/02/2022).

These indica-\ntors are clearly identified in the table on pages 476-477 and are to be considered additional \nto the disclosure prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards to meet the requirements of \nLegislative Decree 254/16.\nThe Statement is included in the Report on Operations, which in turn is contained in the 2022 Annual Report and constitutes \nPoste Italiane’s Integrated Report, prepared in accordance with the principles included in the “International Framework”, pub-\nlished by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).\nThe NFS was approved by Poste Italiane SpA’s Board of Directors on 29 March 2023, pursuant to art. 3, paragraph 10 of the \nDecree. The NFS was approved by Poste Italiane SpA’s Board of Directors on 29 March 2022, pursuant to art. 3, paragraph \n10 of the Decree. The NFS, with the exception of disclosures relating to SASB, WEF, TCFD and SDGs requirements, as well \nas the disclosure related to the process of determining “financial materiality” and related outputs, carried out in anticipation of \nthe requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), with the scope of making an exercise of applying \nthe concept of double materiality (as defined in Chapter 5 “Strategy”), has been subjected to a limited assurance engagement \nin accordance with the criteria indicated in the “International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 Revised - \nAssurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” issued by the International Auditing \nand Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) by Deloitte & Touche SpA, which expresses its opinion in a special “Report of the \nIndependent Auditors” contained in the document.\nIn order to define the contents of the NFS and thus identify the material issues to be included in the Group’s Sustainability \nStrategy, Poste Italiane revised and refined its materiality analysis methodology, aligning it to the provisions contained in the \n2021 update of the GRI standards and taking into account the provisions of the EFRAG, albeit still in draft form. The degree \nof detail with which material topics are treated in the reporting was determined on the basis of the significance of the related \nimpacts, determined through the aforementioned materiality analysis process, which involved top management and the Group’s \nstakeholders through specific engagement activities (for more information, please refer to the section ‘Priority Sustainability \nIssues for Poste Italiane’).\nFor each material topic, the company’s management and organisational model, policies including due diligence policies, the \nresults achieved through them and some non-financial performance indicators, as well as the related impacts on the economy, \nenvironment and people, including human rights impacts and how these impacts are managed, were reported.\nKey Performance Indicators are collected on an annual basis; indicators reported refer to 2022, and where available to the \n2020-2022 period as well. The qualitative and quantitative information comes from the Group’s corporate information systems \nand from a non-financial reporting system specifically implemented to meet the requirements of the Decree. The data is based \non punctual calculations and, where specifically indicated, on estimates. In particular, the estimated data regard certain items \nrelating to energy consumption inside and outside the organisation - data regarding electricity consumption (for security pur-\nposes and relating to outsourced Data Centres), natural gas, diesel, LPG and district heating for the Group’s real estate facilities \n- and water consumption, which was calculated on the basis of the costs incurred and the average tariff payable. Consumption \nlinked to logistics is estimated in terms of distance travelled and/or average consumption of the means and the transported \nload, except for motor vehicles used in last mile logistics. Moreover, it should be pointed out that in this document the figures \nin millions of Euro have been rounded up or down, so the sum of the rounded amounts may not add up to the rounded total. \nDuring the period, following the update of the Poste Italiane Business Plan, the Group’s targets and objectives were updated.\nAll GRI Standards indicators reported are shown in the GRI Content Index of this section starting on page 465.\nAll the data refer only to the companies consolidated using the line-by-line method for financial reporting, as indicated in the \ntable “Scope of consolidation and highlights of investments” (Note 13 - pages 780-782). Exceptions to this scope are explicitly \nindicated within the document. In addition, each reported indicator always has a coverage equal to the total of the information \nrequest, net of explicit specification.

Renewing its commitment to a rapid transition \nto a modern, competitive, climate-resilient, resource-efficient and resource-efficient economy in line with the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) and the European Green Deal, the European Commission introduced the Taxonomy Regulation with \nthe aim of establishing a unified classification system for sustainable activities and, at the same time, using a common language \nto establish a clear definition of what is ‘green’. \nThe identification of a unified classification system based on harmonised criteria at EU level to define an environmentally sus-\ntainable activity is the most important action within the Action Plan to finance sustainable growth. To this end, the Taxonomy \nRegulation is set in a challenging context undertaken by the European Union to boost the contribution of the financial sector in \nsupporting the European Union’s climate and sustainable development agenda.\nEU Regulation No. 852/2020 establishes the basis for the Taxonomy, the environmental objectives and the ways in which an \neconomic activity can be defined as environmentally sustainable, and identifies itself at European level as a tool that can help:\n \nz companies to evaluate their activities, to adopt corporate policies aimed at greater environmental sustainability and to report \nmore comprehensively and comparably to their stakeholders;\n \nz investors in the integration of sustainability issues within investment policies and to understand the environmental impact of \nthe economic activities in which they invest or want to invest;\n \nz public institutions to define and improve their ecological transition policies.\nFurthermore, the Taxonomy Regulation allows market participants to have an unambiguous definition of sustainable assets to \nuse in their decision-making processes and at the same time promotes the transparency of financial markets with respect to \nsustainability issues in terms of investment choices, providing investors with adequate information to steer capital flows towards \nsustainable choices.\nIn compliance with the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation, companies subject to the obligation to publish a non-financial \nstatement must provide information on how and to what extent their business activities are ‘eco-sustainable’.\nAccording to the Taxonomy Regulation, an economic activity can be defined as environmentally sustainable (aligned to the EU \nTaxonomy) if it fulfils the following criteria: \n \nz contributes substantially to the achievement of one or more of the six environmental objectives defined in the regulation; \n \nz does not cause significant harm to other environmental objectives (Do Not Significant Harm - DNSH);\n \nz is carried out in compliance with minimum safeguards.\nIn this regard, the European Commission has defined a set of requirements (so-called technical screening criteria) that must be \nmet by operators carrying out economic activities impacting on the objectives defined by the Taxonomy.\n453\nReport on operations at 31 December 2022\n9.

      "text": "European Taxonomy: methodological Approach to the \nReporting Process \nThe Poste Italiane Group has adopted a methodological approach that provides an adequate and representative disclosure of \nits business profile. In particular, this approach was introduced following a careful analysis of the economic activities as well as \nof the regulatory framework of reference, as part of the commitment to play an active part in achieving the European Union’s \nSustainable Development Goals. \nIn line with the principle of transparency towards the market that has always been followed, Poste Italiane has provided for a \nreporting method capable of providing evidence of both industrial operations (Non Financial Undertakings) and financial oper-\nations (Financial Undertakings). In particular, pursuant to the regulations in force relating to the reporting methods of mixed \ngroups, Poste Italiane has decided to pursue a dual reporting method: within this document, in fact, disclosure is made on a \nconsolidated basis of the KPIs envisaged for the Non Financial Undertakings119, as well as of the KPIs envisaged by the regula-\ntions, and deemed to be more representative of the financial and insurance business of the Poste Italiane Group, for the Financial \nUndertakings. This choice was guided by the conviction that this method of reporting can contribute to completing the informa-\ntion framework for both investors and, more generally, Poste Italiane’s stakeholders, enabling them to have information consistent \nwith the regulatory provisions in force, which are still being completed.\nThe process of reporting on the information requirements outlined in the Taxonomy Regulation involved a careful analysis of \nthe regulations and related developments, in order to identify, assess and consolidate the qualitative and management and/\nor accounting information necessary for the relative calculation of the indicators representing alignment for Non-Financial \nUndertakings and eligibility for Financial Undertakings. This process, therefore, involved numerous functions of the Group that \nown the data, requiring the participation of the main business structures to identify the activities aligned with and eligible for \nthe Taxonomy, in compliance with the related eco-sustainability criteria associated with the individual economic activities being \nassessed, as well as the related management of the data collection process. \nFinally, in line with the previous year, it was deemed appropriate and efficient to request the support of the external provider \nMoody’s in order to process certain data necessary for the calculation of the KPIs of the Financial Undertaking. At the same \ntime, also for this year, with the aim of guaranteeing a correct reconciliation with the economic and financial figures shown in the \nfinancial reporting, the eligibility analyses carried out by the external provider Moody’s on potentially eco-sustainable investments \nwere accompanied by the constant monitoring by the Administration, Finance and Control function.\nEco-sustainable business activities of Poste Italiane\nThe indicators required by the regulations for Non-Financial Undertakings are shown below, which, as previously outlined, in \norder to avoid any potential risk of double counting, have been calculated on a consolidated basis, net of intra-group items, thus \nconsidering the same scope of consolidation as the consolidated financial statements.\nIn line with the regulatory requirements concerning the manner in which the key performance indicators for Non-Financial \nUndertakings, presented in table form are respectively the share of turnover, of capital expenditure (Capex) and operating \nexpenditure (Opex) arising from products or services associated with aligned, eligible but not aligned and non-taxonomy eligible \neconomic activities.\nIn connection with the taxonomy alignment analyses performed for this financial year, pursuant to Article 3 (c) of Regulation \n852/2020, the Group conducted its business activities in compliance with the minimum safeguards120, i.e. in line with the OECD \nGuidelines, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the principles and rights set forth in \nthe eight core conventions identified in the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights \nat Work and the International Bill of Human Rights.\nFurthermore, it should be noted that, with reference to the disclosure pursuant to Article 8 paragraphs 6 and 7 of EU Delegated \nRegulation No. 2178/2021, which provides for the use of the templates provided in Annex XII for the disclosure of nuclear and \nfossil gas activities, all the templates have been omitted as they are not representative of the company’s activities.\n119.

In fact, following a careful analysis of the management information covering \nthe respective criteria of substantial contribution to the Climate Change Mitigation and DNSH objectives, the Group’s corporate \nfleet vehicles, falling within the perimeter of delivery only, of category N1122 were identified that have direct (tailpipe) CO2 emissions \nof zero and do not significantly harm the objectives of Climate Change Adaptation, Transition to a Circular Economy and Pollution \nPrevention and Reduction. \nInstead, with reference to the total turnover at the consolidated level, the total “Net revenues from ordinary operations” for the \nyear 2022 was determined, as reported in the “Consolidated Statement of Profit/(Loss) for the Year” in the Consolidated Financial \nStatements, in accordance with IAS 1.82(a).\n121.

      "text": "Eco-sustainable investments by the Poste Italiane Group\nIn order to ensure maximum transparency towards the market, the Group decided to also disclose the indicators provided for \nin the Taxonomy Regulation for Financial Undertakings. In fact, in relation to the financial operations of Asset Management and \nInsurance carried out by BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita respectively, the respective KPIs governed by the regulations \nare reported below. \nAs mentioned above, for financial undertakings, a reduced information content has been envisaged for the first two years of \nreporting, with the share of eligible and ineligible exposures being published in the Taxonomy. For this year, however, it was pos-\nsible to disclose KPIs on the share of eligible and non-eligible exposures performed on the basis of actual/reported Turnover and \nCapex percentages derived from the counterparties, i.e. timely data that allow mandatory reporting and no longer solely based \non estimates and proxies.\nIn line with last year’s reporting year, and with the aim of ensuring a higher level of data certification and methodologically robust \nprocessing, the Group considered it appropriate to involve the external provider Moody’s ESG Solutions (MESG, formerly Vigeo \nEiris), specialising in ESG solutions and mapping issuers according to Taxonomy criteria. In this regard, in fact, the methodology \nadopted by MESG has allowed it to analyse the assets falling within the scope of application of the Technical Delegated Acts \nreferring to the first two environmental objectives of Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change, and to use punctual eligibility \ndata on a Turnover and Capex basis in the calculation of KPIs. \nThe provider’s support in the analyses conducted for the purpose of reporting the various \nindicators enabled the screening necessary for the disclosure of the KPIs, which showed \na coverage of 98.4% and 97.7% of the corporate assets held directly and indirectly by Poste Vita and BancoPosta Fondi126. \nIn relation to the methodology adopted by MESG, consistent with the relevant regulations, the numerator of the KPIs was defined \nas a function of the exposures held in the portfolio in terms of eligible economic activities to financial entities and non-financial \nentities subject to non-financial reporting requirements and covered by the MESG EU Taxonomy research. The denominator, on \nthe other hand, is the sum of portfolio exposures held to counterparties within the scope of the MESG EU Taxonomy research, \nderivative exposures, liquidity and cash, net of sovereigns.\nTherefore, with the exception of the “Share of exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers”, for \nwhich KPI the total Assets under Management has been adopted as the denominator, in accordance with the regulations, for the \nindicators shown below it is specified that the Total Assets, corresponding to the Assets under Management net of investments \nin central governments, central banks and supranational issuers (sovereigns), has been used as the denominator.\nFinally, for BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita, total assets represent 19% and 20% of total Assets Under Management, \nrespectively.\nAsset Management KPIs\nWith a view to representing the results of the analyses conducted in an increasingly complete manner and in accordance \nwith regulatory requirements, for the present financial year, accurate data referring to the percentages of Turnover and Capex \nobtained for the counterparties in the portfolio were used. Therefore, it was possible to calculate the share of eligible and ineligible \nTurnover-based and Capex-based investments, respectively, below:\n \nz taxonomy-weighted eligible investments are 13.3%;\n \nz the share of Capex-based eligible investments is equivalent to 6.3%.\nIt should also be noted that these eligibility percentages represent the results of analyses conducted on BancoPosta Fondi \nSGR’s investments that potentially contribute to the environmental objectives of Climate Change Mitigation and Climate Change \nAdaptation.\nThus, the share of ineligible investments on a Turnover basis is 86.7%, while the share of ineligible investments on a Capex basis \nis 93.7%.\n126.  \u0007Non-hedged assets constitute a very residual share and are mainly invested in mid- and small-capitalisation companies, which, to date, have not reported the necessary \ndata for the taxonomy. It should also be noted that the Poste Vita assets subjected to screening were deducted of the assets managed by BancoPosta Fondi SGR, in order \nto avoid double counting.\n461\nReport on operations at 31 December 2022\n9.

      "text": "Insurance KPIs\nAs previously reported for the KPI relating to BancoPosta Fondi SGR’s asset management operations, two percentages were \nderived for the Poste Vita Group’s share of investments - Investment KPI - in eligible and non-eligible assets, respectively, as a \nresult of weighting the exposures against the accurate data. Investments potentially contributing to the environmental objectives \nof Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation, and therefore eligible on a Turnover and Capex basis are 11.2% and 5.7% of total \nassets.\nTherefore, the share of investments not eligible for the Taxonomy, as a function of Turnover and Capex percentages, are equiva-\nlent to 88.8% and 94.3% respectively.\nFurthermore, within the Group’s insurance business, the Underwriting KPI, representative of non-life underwriting, was per-\nformed. In this regard, revenues related to the underwriting of fire and other property damage policies were identified, valued in \nrelation to the activity ‘10.1 - Non-life insurance: underwriting of climate-related perils’, in accordance with Annex II of the Climate \nAct. Therefore, following the alignment and eligibility analyses, as also reported in the section on turnover KPIs, it was only pos-\nsible to identify the share of eligible business related to the underwriting of non-life insurance policies on climate-related perils, \nwhich is equivalent to 3.5% of the total revenue generated in the non-life insurance business; therefore, the share of non-eligible \nbusiness represents 96.5%.   \nOther KPIs\nLastly, with reference to the additional indicators required by the regulations for the categories of financial companies in which \nBancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita fall, the results for the current year are set out below:\n \nz the “Share of exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers” of BancoPosta Fondi SGR and \nPoste Vita is 81.5% and 79.8% respectively;\n \nz the “Share of derivatives”127 of BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita is equal to 1.9% and 1.8% respectively;\n \nz BancoPosta Fondi SGR’s and Poste Vita’s “Share of exposures in companies not subject to non-financial reporting require-\nments” is 39.6% and 48.2%, respectively.\n127. \u0007In continuity with what was reported at 31.12.21, the absolute values of derivatives at mark-to-market for both BancoPosta Fondi SGR and Poste Vita were also considered \nfor this year\n462\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\nSummary\nSection"

The choice of asset classes is crucial for \nportfolio construction because it is the individual components \nthat are evaluated in the asset allocation process.\nSALARY-BACKED LOANS    \nIt is a special type of guaranteed financing, intended for \npensioners and employees. The repayment of instalments \nis made by assigning a portion of the pension or salary to \nthe lender. This share, deducted directly from the pension \nor pay slip, may not exceed the fifth part of the net monthly \nemolument. This type of financing requires insurance to cover \nlife risk (for Pensioners) and life and loss of employment risk \n(for Employees). The policies are underwritten directly by the \nBank/Financial Company (as policyholder and beneficiary), \nwhich bears the costs. The customer is not required to pay \nany insurance premium.\nATM (AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE)       \nThis is an automated counter, activated directly by users by \ninserting their card and typing in their PIN (personal identifica-\ntion code), which allows them to carry out both ordering and \ninformative operations (e.g. balance request or movement list).\nBTP (MULTI-YEAR TREASURY BONDS)      \nMedium-/long-term Italian government bonds. The return is \ngiven by six-monthly fixed-rate interest coupons and the dif-\nference between the redemption price, equal to the nominal \nvalue (100), and the issue or subscription price on the sec-\nondary market.\nBUFFER      \nThe agreement with the Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(MEF) provides that a percentage of the funds deriving from \nprivate customer deposits may be placed in a special “Buffer” \naccount at the MEF, with the objective of ensuring flexibili-\nty with regard to investments in view of daily movements in \namounts payable to current account holders.\nCAPITALISATION      \nWith reference to a company, it represents the product of the \nnumber of outstanding shares and their unit price; with ref-\nerence to a market, it represents the total value – at market \nprices – of all listed securities.\nCHATBOT   \nThe word comes from chat- chat and bot- short for robot. \nIt is a virtual assistant able to answer a series of questions, \ninterpreting the customer’s intentions. The application is fre-\nquently used by large companies in customer service: typing \nin a question gives the impression of talking to a person.\nCLOUD  \nLiterally ‘computer cloud’, it refers to the technology that \nallows data to be processed and stored on a network and \nenables access to applications and data stored on remote \nhardware instead of the local workstation. Hybrid Cloud is a \nsolution that combines a private cloud with one or more pub-\nlic cloud services, with proprietary software enabling commu-\nnication between each service. A hybrid cloud strategy offers \ncompanies greater flexibility by moving workloads between \ncloud solutions according to needs and costs.\nCONTACTLESS  \nIt is the innovative payment method that allows to make pur-\nchases by simply bringing the card close to the card reader \n(POS terminal) with the Contactless symbol; the transaction \ntakes place in a few moments.\nCONTAINERISATION  \nProcedure consisting in the creation of a ‘container’, i.e. a \nlogical structure (software environment) consisting of all the \ncomponents necessary for the operation of a single applica-\ntion. This new paradigm enables greater efficiency in the man-\nagement of hardware resources, the possibility of increasing \nthe processing resources available to the system in real time, \nand the portability of applications between the on premises \ninfrastructure and the public cloud of Poste Italiane’s Hybrid \ncloud platform.\nCREDIT CARD  \t \t\n\t\nIt is a payment instrument that enables the holder, on the \nbasis of a contractual relationship with the issuer, to make \npurchases (via POS or online) of goods or services at any \nestablishment belonging to the relevant international circuit or \ncash withdrawals (via ATMs). The amounts spent are debit-\ned to the cardholder at predefined intervals in arrears (usu-\nally monthly) either as a lump sum (‘classic’ credit card) or \nin instalments (the so-called instalment/revolving credit card).\nCYBERSECURITY  \nThis term is intended to represent the tools and process-\nes needed to ensure the security of computers, networks, \ncommonly used devices (such as smartphones and tablets), \napplications and databases, protecting them from potential \nattacks that may come from inside or outside the organi-\nsation.

The regulation introduced a classification of clients \non the basis of different degrees of financial experience: retail \nclients (retail), professional clients (professional clients), and \neligible counterparties. The purpose of this subdivision is to \nadopt protection measures consistent with each category \nof investor, respecting the different protection needs aris-\ning from the information gathered about its knowledge and \nexperience in investment matters, its financial situation and \nits investment objectives, in order to verify the suitability or \nappropriateness of the investment service or financial instru-\nment requested and/or proposed. In addition, intermediaries \nare obliged to provide correct, clear and not misleading infor-\nmation by describing the financial services and instruments \noffered, providing information on losses incurred, fees and \ncosts related to the services provided and the presence of \npossible conflicts of interest. Entered into force on 3 January \n2018 (replacing the so-called MiFID I, from which it takes \nprinciples and aims), the MiFID II Directive aims to increase \nthe efficiency and transparency of the markets by raising the \nlevel of investor protection, by means of measures aimed at \ninforming clients of the essential characteristics of the activity \nprovided, including in terms of the risks and costs of the pro-\nposed transactions, and by reinforcing certain organisational \nrequirements and rules of conduct in the phase of designing \nand offering products to clients, as well as in terms of training \nof investment advisors.\nMOBILE HOST OPERATOR  \nReference operator for the provision of mobile network \naccess services.\nMUTUAL FUNDS  \nThese are collective investment undertakings, managed by \nasset management companies (AMC), which pool the liquid-\nity provided by their clients and invest it, as a single asset, in \nmovable financial assets (shares, bonds, government securi-\nties, etc.) or, for some of them, in real estate assets, respect-\ning rules aimed at reducing risk.

Introduction\nPoste Italiane SpA (the “Parent Company”) is the company formed following conversion of the former Public Administration \nentity, “Poste Italiane”, under Resolution 244 of 18 December 1997. Its registered office is at Viale Europa 190, Rome (Italy). \nPoste Italiane’s shares have been listed on the Mercato Telematico Azionario (the MTA, an electronic stock exchange) since 27 \nOctober 2015. At 31 December 2022, the Company is 35% owned by CDP and 29.3% owned by the MEF, with the remaining \nshares held by institutional and retail investors. Poste Italiane SpA continues to be under the control of the MEF. At 31 December \n2022, the Parent Company holds 7,535,991 treasury shares (equal to around 0.58% of the share capital).\nThe Poste Italiane Group (the “Group”) provides a universal postal service in Italy as well as integrated communication, logis-\ntics, financial and insurance products and services throughout the country via its national network of approximately 13,000 post \noffices.\nThe Group’s business is assessed and presented on the basis of four operating segments: (i) Mail, Parcels and Distribution, (ii) \nPayments and Mobile, (iii) Financial Services and (iv) Insurance Services. \nIn addition to the mail, parcel and logistics service, the Mail, Parcels and Distribution segment also includes the activities of the \nsales network, the Post Offices and the corporate functions of Poste Italiane SpA that provide services to the other segments in \nwhich the Group operates. The sector also includes the provision of Welfare services.\nThe Payments and Mobile Services segment includes the management of payments and e-money services, also carried out \nthrough the network of LIS points of sale, as well as mobile and fixed telephone services and energy (electricity and gas) sales \nservices to end customers by PostePay SpA.\nThe Financial Services segment refers to the placement and distribution of financial and insurance products and services by \nBancoposta, such as current accounts, postal savings products (on behalf of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti), mutual investment funds, \nloans provided by banks, policies and the activities of BancoPosta Fondi SpA SGR. \nThe Insurance Services segment regards primarily the activities of Poste Vita SpA, which operates in ministerial life assurance \nClasses I, III and V, and of its direct subsidiary, Poste Assicura SpA, which operates in P&C insurance. \nIn addition, it should be noted that in the first half of 2022 the company Poste Welfare Servizi, previously allocated to the \nInsurance Services Strategic Business Unit, is represented in the Mail, Parcels and Distribution Strategic Business Unit. The \ncomparative statement of profit or loss and statement of financial position figures have therefore been reclassified to reflect this \norganisational change.\nThis section of the Annual Report (Poste Italiane’s Financial Statements) at 31 December 2022 includes the consolidated financial \nstatements of the Poste Italiane Group, the separate financial statements of Poste Italiane SpA and BancoPosta RFC’s Separate \nReport. The Report has been prepared in euros, the currency of the economy in which the Group operates. \nThe Group’s consolidated financial statements consist of the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated state-\nment of profit or loss, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, \nthe consolidated statement of cash flows and the notes to the financial statements. All amounts in the financial statements and \nthe notes are shown in millions of euros and rounded (without decimal figures), unless stated otherwise. It follows that the sum \nof the rounded amounts may not coincide with the rounded totals.\nThe separate financial statements of Poste Italiane SpA consist of the statement of financial position, the statement of profit or \nloss, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows and the notes. \nAmounts in the financial statements are shown in euros (except for the statement of cash flows, which is shown in thousands of \neuros), whilst those in the notes are shown in millions of euros (without decimal figures), unless stated otherwise.

The compa-\nnies of the Poste Italiane Group, as a going concern, prepare their financial statements on a going concern basis, also taking \ninto account the Group’s economic and financial outlook derived from the Strategic Plan approved on 18 March 2021 (and the \nrelated updates approved by the Board of Directors on 22 March 2022) and the 2023 Budget approved by the Board of Directors \non 29 March 2023. \nThe statement of financial position has been prepared on the basis of the “current/non-current distinction”128. In the \nStatement of profit (loss) for the year, the classification criterion based on the nature of the cost components has been \nadopted; details of interest income calculated using the effective interest criterion, as well as gains and losses deriving from the \nderecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost (as per IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements paragraph 82) \nare provided in section 4.3 Notes to the Statement of profit or loss. The statement of cash flows has been prepared under the \nindirect method129. \nThe accounting standards and the recognition, measurement and classification criteria adopted in these annual accounts are \nthe same as those used in the previous year’s preparation, with the exception of what is stated in Section 2.5 - New accounting \nstandards and interpretations. \nThe disclosures provided in these annual financial statements take into account the guidelines and recommendations of the \nEuropean regulatory and supervisory bodies (ESMA)130 published during the year in order to provide a guideline in the current \neconomic context, which is heavily influenced by the Russia/Ukraine conflict. The accounting implications of complying with \nthese recommendations are described in section 2.4 - Use of estimates.\nIn preparing the annual accounts, the CONSOB regulations contained in Resolution 15519 of 27 July 2006 and in Ruling \nDEM/6064293 of 28 July 2006 have been taken into account.\n128. \u0007Current assets include assets (such as inventories and trade receivables) that are sold, consumed or realised as part of the normal operating cycle even when they are not \nexpected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period (IAS 1, par. 68).\n129. \u0007Under the indirect method, net cash from operating activities is determined by adjusting profit/(loss) for the year to reflect the impact of non-cash items, any deferment or \nprovisions for previous or future operating inflows or outflows, and revenue or cost items linked to cash flows from investing or financing activities.\n130. \u0007Public statement ESMA32-63-1320 of 28 October 2022 “European common enforcement priorities for 2022 annual financial reports”.\nSummary\nSection"

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\nIn accordance with CONSOB Resolution 15519 of 27 July 2006, the statement of financial position, the statement of profit or \nloss and the statement of cash flows show amounts deriving from related party transactions. The statement of profit or loss \nalso shows, where applicable and of significant amount, income and expenses deriving from non-recurring transactions, \nor transactions that occur infrequently in the normal course of business. Detailed information about non-recurring events and \ntransactions, including their impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the company and/or the \ngroup, is provided in the section “Material non-recurring events and/or transactions”. \nThe values shown in the financial statements are compared with the corresponding values for the same period of the previous \nyear.

Therefore, it is envisaged that the Annual \nFinancial Report be prepared in XHTML format and that, for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2022, the Notes to \nthe Consolidated Financial Statements, in addition to the Notes to the Financial Statements, be prepared using the ESMA-IFRS \ntaxonomy and the integrated computer language (iXBRL).\n2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies and \nmeasurement criteria\nThe Poste Italiane Group’s financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, with the exception of certain items \nfor which fair value measurement is obligatory.\nThe accounting policies adopted by the Poste Italiane Group are described below. \nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at acquisition or construction cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated \nimpairment losses. Where the condition is met, this cost is increased for charges directly related to the purchase or construction \nof the asset, including – where identifiable and measurable – that relating to employees involved in the planning and/or preparation \nfor use phase. Interest expense incurred by the Group for loans specifically for the acquisition or construction of property, plant and \nequipment is capitalised together with the value of the asset; all other interest expense is recognised as finance costs in profit or loss \nfor the year in question. Costs incurred for routine and/or cyclical maintenance and repairs are recognised directly in profit or loss in \nthe related year. The capitalisation of costs attributable to the extension, modernisation or improvement of assets owned by Group \ncompanies or held under lease is carried out to the extent that they qualify for separate recognition as an asset or as a component \nof an asset, applying the component approach, which requires each component with a different estimated useful life and value to \n131. \u0007The tax authorities have issued regular official interpretations only in respect of certain of the tax-related effects of the measures contained in Legislative Decree 38 of 28 \nFebruary 2005, Law 244 of 24 December 2007 (the 2008 Budget Law) and the Ministerial Decree of 1 April 2009, implementing the 2008 Budget Law, which introduced \nnumerous changes to IRES and IRAP. The MEF Decree issued on 8 June 2011 contains instructions regarding the coordinated application of EU-endorsed international \naccounting standards coming into effect between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010, in addition to regulations governing determination of the tax bases for IRES and \nIRAP. In addition, the new standards are subject to the rules contained in the endorsement tax decrees issued by the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, in application of \nthe provisions of Law no. 10 of 26 February 2011 (Decreto Milleproroghe).\nSection\nSummary"

For details on the useful life of the Group’s investment \nproperty, please refer to Note 2.4 - Use of estimates.\nIntangible assets\nAn intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, which is controllable and capable of gen-\nerating future economic benefits. The initial carrying amount is adjusted for accumulated amortisation, where an amortisation \nprocess is envisaged, and for any impairment losses.\nIn particular, Industrial patents, intellectual property rights, licences and similar rights are initially valued at purchase cost. \nThis cost is increased for charges directly related to the purchase or preparation for use of the asset. Interest expense that the \nGroup may incur for loans specifically for the purchase of industrial patents, intellectual property rights, licenses and similar rights \nare capitalised together with the value of the asset; all other interest expense is recognised as finance costs in profit or loss for the \nyear. Amortisation starts once the asset is available for use. Amortisation is applied on a straight-line basis, in order to distribute \nthe purchase cost over the shorter of the expected useful life of the asset and any related contract terms, from the date the entity \nhas the right to use the asset. \nIndustrial patents, intellectual property rights, licenses and similar rights include costs directly associated with the internal pro-\nduction of unique and identifiable software products that will generate future economic benefits with a time horizon of more than \none year. Direct costs include - where identifiable and measurable - the charge related to employees involved in software devel-\nopment. Costs incurred for the maintenance of internally developed software products are charged to profit or loss for the year \nin question. Amortisation begins when the asset is available for use and extends, systematically and on a straight-line basis, over \nits estimated useful life. Any research costs are not capitalised.\nAmong the Group’s intangible assets, Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the \nGroup’s share of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the company or business acquired, at the date of acquisition. Goodwill \nattributable to investments accounted for using the equity method is included in the carrying amount of the equity investment. \nGoodwill is not amortised on a systematic basis, but is tested periodically for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. This \ntest is performed with reference to the cash generating unit (“CGU”) to which the goodwill is attributable. The method applied \nin conducting impairment tests and the impact on the accounts of any impairment losses are described in the paragraph, \n“Impairment of assets”.\nSummary\nSection"

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\nLease arrangements\nAt the conclusion of the contract, the actual existence of a lease component is assessed. The contract is, or contains, a lease \nif in return for consideration it confers the right to control the use of a specified asset for a period of time. The activity is usually \nspecified as explicitly stated in the contract or when it is available for use by the customer. The right of control is evaluated on the \nbasis of the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits deriving from the use of the asset and the right to decide on its \nuse. The initial assessment is only reviewed during the term of the contract if there are modifications to the contract conditions \nwith substantial impact on the right to control the underlying asset. \nIf the lease contract also contains a non-lease component, the latter is separated and treated in accordance with the relevant \naccounting standard. However, if separation cannot be achieved on the basis of objective criteria, the lease and non-lease com-\nponent are submitted jointly to the accounting rules of the lease.\nOn the contract commencement date, a right to use the leased asset is recorded, equal to the initial value of the corresponding \nlease liability, plus payments due before or at the same time as the contract commencement date (e.g. agency fees). Subsequently, \nsaid right of use is measured less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation starts on \nthe commencement date of the lease and extends over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying asset.\nThe lease liability is initially recorded at the present value of the lease instalments not paid on the date the contract commenc-\nes132, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate, defined by loan period and for each Group company. The lease liability is \nsubsequently reduced to reflect the lease payments made and increased to reflect interest on the remaining amount. \nThe lease liability is restated (resulting in a right-of-use adjustment) in the event of a change in:\n \nz the lease term (for example, in the case of early termination of the contract or an extension of the lease);\n \nz the assessment of a purchase option for the underlying asset; in these cases, lease payments due are reviewed on the basis \nof the revised lease term and to take account of the change in the amounts payable in view of the purchase option;\n \nz future lease payments deriving from a change in the index or rate used to determine the payments (e.g. ISTAT), or as a result \nof a renegotiation of the financial conditions. \nOnly in the case of a significant change in the lease term or in future lease payments, the remaining lease liability is remeasured \nwith reference to the incremental borrowing rate at the date of the modification; in all other cases, the lease liability is remeasured \nusing the initial discount rate.\nIf events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the right of use cannot be recovered, this asset is \ntested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets.\nThe Group avails itself of the option granted by the principle of non-application of the provisions provided in the standard to \nshort-term contracts (with a duration of no more than twelve months) and to contracts in which the individual underlying asset is \nof low value (up to €5,000); for these contracts, lease payments are recognised in profit or loss as matching entry to short-term \ntrade payables.\nImpairment of assets\nAt the end of each reporting period, property, plant, equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are analysed to assess \nwhether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired (as defined by IAS 36). If any such indication exists, the recoverable \namount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the impairment loss to be recognised in profit or loss. The recoverable \namount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell, and its value in use, represented by the present value of the future \ncash flows expected to be derived from the asset. In calculating value in use, future cash flow estimates are discounted using \na rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, the period of the investment and the risks specific \nto the asset. The realisable value of assets that do not generate separate cash flows is determined with reference to the cash \ngenerating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. \n132. \u0007The payments included in the initial measurement of the lease liability include:\n•\tfixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable; \n•\tvariable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date (e.g. ISTAT indexes);  \n•\tthe exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option.\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are, in contrast, not included in the initial measurement of the lease liability. These payments are recognised \nas a cost in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which the event or the condition giving rise to the obligation occurs.\nSection\nSummary"

In particular, if the impairment loss regards goodwill and is higher than \nthe related carrying amount, the remaining amount is allocated to the assets included in the CGU to which the goodwill has \nbeen allocated, in proportion to their carrying amount133. Except in the case of goodwill, if the impairment indicators no longer \nexist, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reinstated and the reversal recognised in profit or loss. The reversal must \nnot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised and depreciation \nor amortisation been charged.\nInvestments\nIn the Poste Italiane Group’s consolidated financial statements, investments in subsidiaries that are not significant (individually or \nin the aggregate) and are not consolidated, and those in companies over which the Group exerts significant influence (“associ-\nates”) and in joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method. See note 2.6 – Basis of consolidation.\nIn Poste Italiane SpA’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted for at cost (including \nany directly attributable incidental expenses), after adjustment for any impairments. Investments in subsidiaries and associates are \ntested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Any \nimpairment losses (or subsequent reversals of impairment losses) are recognised in the same way and to the same extent described \nwith regard to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in the paragraph, “Impairment of assets”.\nFinancial instruments\nIn accordance with IFRS 9 - Financial instruments, the classification of financial assets and liabilities is determined at the time of \ninitial recognition and at the relative fair value, according to the purpose for which they were acquired. The purchase and sale of \nfinancial instruments is recognised by category, either on the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset (the \ntransaction date), or, in the case of insurance transactions and BancoPosta’s operations, at the settlement date134. Any changes \nin fair value between the transaction date and the settlement date are recognised in the financial statements.\nOn the other hand, trade receivables are recognised at their transaction price, in accordance with IFRS 15 - Revenue from \nContracts with Customers.\nOn initial recognition, financial assets are classified in one of the following categories, based on the business model adopted \nto manage them and the characteristics of their contractual cash flows:\n \nz Financial assets measured at amortised cost\nThis category reflects financial assets held to collect the contractual cash flows (the held to collect or HTC business model) \nrepresenting solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). These assets are measured at amortised cost, that is the value \nassigned to the financial asset or liability on initial recognition, net of any principal reimbursement, plus or minus the cumulative \namortisation by using the effective interest rate method on the difference between the initial value and the value at maturity, \nafter deducting any impairment. The business model on which the classification of financial assets is based permits the sale \nof such assets; if the sales are not occasional, and are not immaterial in terms of value, consistency with the HTC business \nmodel should be assessed.\n \nz Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)\nThis category includes financial assets held both to collect the relevant contractual cash flows and for sale (the held to collect \nand sell or HTC&S business model), with the contractual cash flows representing solely payments of principal and interest.\nThese financial assets are measured at fair value and, until they are derecognised or reclassified, gains or losses from valu-\nation are recognised in other comprehensive income. Exceptions to this are gains and losses due to impairment and foreign \n133. \u0007If the amount of the impairment loss is greater than the carrying amount of the asset or CGU, in accordance with IAS 36, no liability is recognised, unless recognition of a \nliability is required by an international accounting standard other than IAS 36.\n134.

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\nexchange gains and losses recognised in the profit or loss in the year in question. If the financial asset is derecognised, the \naccumulated gains/(losses) recognised in OCI are recycled to profit or loss.\nThis category also includes equity instruments that would otherwise be recognised through profit or loss, for which the irrev-\nocable election was made to recognise changes in fair value through OCI (the FVTOCI option). This option entails the recog-\nnition of solely dividends through profit or loss.\n \nz Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss\nThis category includes: (a) financial assets primarily held for trading; (b) those that qualify for designation at fair value through \nprofit or loss, exercising the fair value option; (c) financial assets that must be recognised at fair value through profit or loss; (d) \nderivative instruments, with the exception of the effective portion of those designated as cash flow hedges. Financial assets \nbelonging to the category in question are measured at fair value and the related changes are recognised in profit or loss. \nDerivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss are recognised as assets or liabilities depending on whether the fair \nvalue is positive or negative; positive and negative fair values deriving from transactions with the same counterparty are offset \nduring the collateralisation phase, where contractually provided for.\nThe classification as “current” or “non-current” of financial assets measured at amortised cost and financial assets measured at \nfair value through other comprehensive income depends on the contractual maturity of the instrument, since current assets are \nthose whose realisation is expected within twelve months of the reporting date. Financial assets measured at fair value through \nprofit or loss are, on the other hand, classified as “current” if held for trading and are expected to be sold within twelve months \nof the reporting date.\nAn expected credit loss (ECL) provision must be made for financial assets recognised at amortised cost and financial assets at \nfair value through OCI, as follows: (i) specific provisions for doubtful debts are made for expected losses on financial assets meas-\nured at amortised cost; (ii) expected losses on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are \nrecognised in profit or loss, with a contra entry in the fair value reserve in equity. The method utilised is the “General impairment \nmodel”, whereby:\n \nz if on the reporting date the credit risk of a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a \n12-month ECL is recognised (stage 1). Interest on the instrument is calculated on the gross carrying amount (amortised cost \ninclusive of the ECL);\n \nz if on the reporting date the credit risk of the financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, a lifetime \nECL is recognised (stage 2). Interest on the instrument is calculated on the gross carrying amount (amortised cost inclusive \nof the ECL);\n \nz if a financial instrument is already impaired on initial recognition or shows objective evidence of impairment as at the reporting \ndate, lifetime expected losses are recognised. Interest is recognised at amortised cost (stage 3), i.e. on the basis of the expo-\nsure value - determined using the effective interest rate - adjusted for expected losses.\nIn determining whether credit risk has increased significantly, it is necessary to compare the risk of default of the financial instru-\nment as at the reporting date with the risk of default of the financial instrument on initial recognition. However, there is a rebut-\ntable default presumption if the financial instrument is more than 90 days past due, unless there is reasonable and supportable \ninformation to demonstrate that a default criterion with greater lag is more appropriate. Regarding trade receivables, a simplified \napproach is applied to measure the expected credit loss, if these receivables do not contain a significant financing component \npursuant to IFRS 15. The simplified approach is based on a matrix of observed historical losses.\nIn the extremely rare event of the entity deciding to change its business model, previously recognised financial assets are reclas-\nsified to the new accounting category; the effects of the reclassification are recognised only prospectively, and therefore, the \npreviously recognised gains/losses and interest must not be restated. The effects of the reclassification are as follows:\n \nz if the financial asset is reclassified from amortised cost to fair value through profit or loss, the fair value of the asset is deter-\nmined on the reclassification date. Gains and losses resulting from the difference between the previous amortised cost and \nfair value are recognised through profit or loss;\n \nz if the financial asset is reclassified from fair value through profit or loss to amortised cost, the fair value on the reclassification \ndate becomes the new gross carrying amount;\n \nz if the financial asset is reclassified from amortised cost to fair value through other comprehensive income, the fair value of the \nasset is determined on the reclassification date. Gains and losses resulting from the difference between the previous amor-\ntised cost and fair value are recognised through other comprehensive income. The effective interest rate and the expected \ncredit loss are not adjusted following reclassification;\n \nz if the financial asset is reclassified from fair value through other comprehensive income to amortised cost, the cumulative \ngain (loss) recognised previously through other comprehensive income is derecognised from equity through an adjustment to \nthe fair value of the financial asset on the reclassification date. Consequently, the financial asset is reported as though it had \nalways been reported at amortised cost, by not changing the effective interest rate and the expected credit loss;\nSection\nSummary"

If the substantial transfer of risks and rewards \ncannot be ascertained, financial assets are derecognised if no control is retained over them. Finally, transferred assets are derec-\nognised if the contractual right to receive the cash flows of the assets is retained, but at the same time a contractual obligation \nis assumed to pay these flows to a third party, without delay and only to the extent of those received.\nIn addition, for impaired financial assets, derecognition may take place following the write-off of the same, following the acknowl-\nedgement that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery (e.g. prescription).\nFinancial liabilities, including loans, trade payables and other payment obligations, are measured at amortised cost using \nthe effective interest method. If there is a change in the expected cash flows and they can be reliably estimated, the value of \nborrowings is recalculated to reflect the change on the basis of the present value of estimated future cash flows and the internal \nrate of return initially applied. Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities, unless there is an unconditional right to defer \nsettlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the end of the reporting period.\nWhen required by the applicable IFRS (e.g. in the case of derivative liabilities), or when the irrevocable fair value option is exer-\ncised, financial liabilities are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. In this case, changes in fair value attributable to \nchanges in own credit risk are recognised directly in equity, unless this treatment creates or enhances an accounting asymmetry, \nwhereby the residual amount of the changes in the fair value of liabilities is recognised through profit or loss.\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished or when the obligation specified in the contract expires, is can-\ncelled or discharged.\nFor hedge accounting transactions, the Poste Italiane Group has elected to use the option made available by IFRS 9 and has \nretained the accounting treatments provided for by IAS 39. In accordance with this standard, derivatives are initially recognised \nat fair value on the date the derivative contract is executed and if they do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and \nlosses arising from changes in fair value are accounted for in profit or loss for the period. \nIf, on the other hand, derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting, gains and losses arising from changes in fair \nvalue after initial recognition are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, \nas described below.\nThe relationship between each hedging instrument and the hedged item is documented, as well as the risk management objec-\ntive, the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction and the methods used to assess effectiveness. Assessment of whether \nthe hedging derivative is effective takes place both at designation of each derivative instrument as hedging instrument, and \nduring its life. \n \nz Fair value hedges135 \nWhen the hedge is related to recognised assets or liabilities, or an unrecognised firm commitment, the changes in fair value \nof both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are recognised in profit or loss. When the hedging transaction is not \nfully effective, resulting in differences between the above changes, the ineffective portion represents a loss or gain recognised \nseparately in profit or loss for the period. \nIAS 39 allows, in addition to individual financial assets and liabilities, the designation of a cash amount, representing a group \nof financial assets and liabilities (or portions thereof) as the hedged item in such a way that a group of derivative instruments \nmay be used to reduce exposure to fair value interest rate risk (a so-called macro hedge). Macro hedges cannot be used for \nnet amounts deriving from differences between assets and liabilities. Like micro hedges, macro hedges are deemed highly \neffective if, at their inception and throughout the term of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the cash amount are offset by \nchanges in the fair value of the hedges, and if the effective results fall within the interval required by IAS 39.\n135. \u0007A hedge of the exposure to a change in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or of an unrecognised firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, and that could \nhave an impact on profit or loss.\nSummary\nSection"

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\n \nz Cash flow hedges136\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges after initial \nrecognition is recognised in a specific equity reserve, with movements in the reserve accounted for in “Other comprehensive \nincome” (the “Cash flow hedge reserve”). A hedging transaction is generally considered highly effective if, both at inception of \nthe hedge and on an ongoing basis, changes in the expected future cash flows of the hedged item are substantially offset by \nchanges in the fair value of the hedging instrument. If the hedging transaction is not fully effective, the gain or loss arising from \na change in fair value relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss for the period.\nAmounts accumulated in equity are recycled to profit or loss in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. In \nparticular, in the case of hedges associated with a highly probable forecast transaction (such as the purchase of fixed income \ndebt securities), the reserve is reclassified to profit or loss in the period or in the periods in which the asset or liability, subse-\nquently accounted for and connected to the aforementioned transaction, will affect profit or loss (for example, an adjustment \nto the return on the security).\nIf, during the life of the derivative, the forecast hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the related gains and losses \naccumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve are immediately reclassified to profit or loss for the period. When a hedging instru-\nment expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the related gains and losses accu-\nmulated in the cash flow hedge reserve at that time remain in equity and are recognised in profit or loss at the same time as the \noriginal underlying. \nEmbedded derivatives\nAn embedded derivative is a derivative included in a combined contract or hybrid instrument, also containing a non-derivative \ncontract or host contract, which originates all or part of the cash flows of the combined contract. Embedded derivatives are \nseparated from the host contract and recognised as a derivative when:\n \nz the host contract is not a financial instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss; \n \nz the economic risks and characteristics of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract; \n \nz a separate contract with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative.\nWithin the Group, contracts that may contain embedded derivatives are contracts for the purchase of non-financial items entered \ninto by PostePay SpA with clauses or options that influence the contract price, for which, however, embedded derivatives are \nnot separable from the host contract. \nRepurchase agreements\nAny securities received as part of a transaction entailing subsequent re-sale and the delivery of securities as part of a transaction \nentailing their subsequent repurchase are not either recognised or derecognised in these financial statements. Consequently, in \nthe case of securities purchased under a resale agreement, the amount paid is recognised as an amount due from customers \nor banks under Financial assets measured at amortised cost; in the case of securities sold under a repurchase agreement, the \nliability is recognised as an amount due to banks or customers under Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. The trans-\nactions described are subject to offsetting if, and only if, they are carried out with the same counterparty, have the same maturity \nand offsetting is provided for in the contract.\nTax credits Law no. 77/2020 \nIn order to identify the correct accounting treatment of receivables acquired in relation to Relaunch Decree no. 34/2020 \n(later converted into Law no. 77 of 17 July 2020), since it is not possible to identify the framework directly applicable to this \ncase, in compliance with the provisions of IAS 8, an accounting policy was defined suitable for providing relevant and reliable \ninformation aimed at ensuring a faithful representation of the financial position, income and cash flows and which reflects the \neconomic substance and not merely the form of the transaction.

The reclassification, effective as of 1 October 2022, became necessary \nas a result of the lack of development in the market for second sales between financial intermediaries, which therefore required \nBancoPosta RFC to revise its business model for these loans.\nClassification of receivables and payables attributable to \nBancoPosta RFC\nReceivables and payables attributable to BancoPosta RFC are treated as financial assets and liabilities if related to BancoPosta’s \ntypical deposit-taking and lending activities, or services provided under authority from customers. The related operating expens-\nes and income, if not settled or classifiable in accordance with Bank of Italy Circular 272 of 30 July 2008 – The Account Matrix, \nare accounted for in trade receivables and payables.\nOwn use exemption\nThe standards establishing the principles for the recognition and measurement of financial instruments are also applied to deriv-\native contracts to buy or sell non-financial items that are settled net in cash or in another financial instrument, with the exception \nof contracts entered into, and that continue to be held, for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accord-\nance with the entity’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (the own use exemption). This exemption applies to the \nrecognition and measurement of forward electricity and natural gas contracts entered into by the subsidiary Postepay SpA if the \nfollowing conditions have been met:\n \nz the contract involves the physical supply of a commodity;\n \nz the entity has not entered into an offsetting contract;\n \nz the transaction must be entered into in accordance with expected purchase and/or sale or usage requirements.\nWhen the above conditions are met, the contract for the purchase or sale of non-financial items is classified as a “normal contract \nof sale”.\n137. \u0007On 5 January 2021, the Bank of Italy, CONSOB and IVASS published Document no. 9 of the Coordination Round-Table Group on the Application of IAS/IFRS “Accounting \nTreatment of Tax Credits Associated with the “Heal Italy” and “Relaunch” Law Decrees Acquired as a Result of Disposal by Direct Beneficiaries or Previous Purchasers”.\nSummary\nSection"

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\nTaxes\nCurrent income tax expense is based on the best estimate of taxable profit for the period and the related regulations, \napplying the rates in force. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on all temporary differences arising between the \ntax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related \ndeferred tax assets are realised or the deferred tax liabilities are settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised \nif the temporary differences derive from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the \nreversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group or it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse \nin the foreseeable future. In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on goodwill deriving from a \nbusiness combination. \nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the \ntemporary differences can be utilised. \nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised in profit or loss, with the exception of taxes charged or credited directly to equity, \nin which case the tax effect is recognised directly in equity. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they \nare applied by the same tax authority to the same taxpaying entity, which has the legally exercisable right to offset the amounts \nrecognised, and the entity has the intention of exercising this right. As a result, tax liabilities accruing in interim periods that are \nshorter than the tax year are not offset against related assets deriving from withholding tax or advances paid.\nThe Group’s taxation and accounting standards take account of the effects of Poste Italiane SpA’s participation in the national tax \nconsolidation scheme, for which the option has been exercised in accordance with the law, together with the following subsidiar-\nies: Poste Vita SpA, SDA Express Courier SpA, Poste Air Cargo Srl, Postel SpA, Europa Gestioni Immobiliari SpA, Poste Welfare \nServizi Srl, Poste Assicura SpA, BancoPostaFondi SpA SGR, PostePay SpA, Poste Insurance Broker Srl, MLK Deliveries SpA, \nIndabox Srl and Nexive Network Srl. The tax consolidation arrangement is governed by Group regulations based on the princi-\nples of neutrality and equality of treatment, which are intended to ensure that the companies included in the tax consolidation are \nin no way penalised as a result. Following adoption of the tax consolidation arrangement, the Parent Company’s tax expense is \ndetermined at consolidated level on the basis of the tax expense or tax losses for the period for each company included in the \nconsolidation, taking account of any withholding tax or advances paid. Poste Italiane SpA posts its IRES tax expense to income \ntaxes for the period, after adjustments to take account of the positive or negative impact of tax consolidation adjustments. \nShould the reductions or increases in tax expense deriving from such adjustments be attributable to the companies included in \nthe tax consolidation, Poste Italiane SpA attributes such reductions or increases in tax expense to the companies in question. \nThe economic benefits deriving from the offset of tax losses transferred to the consolidating entity by the companies participating \nin the tax consolidation arrangement are recognised in full by Poste Italiane SpA. Other taxes not related to income are included \nin “Other operating costs”.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of interchangeable items and goods for resale is \ncalculated using the weighted average cost method. In the case of non-interchangeable items, cost is measured on the basis \nof the specific cost of the item at the time of purchase. The value of the inventories is adjusted, if necessary, by provisions for \nobsolete or slow-moving stock. When the circumstances that previously led to recognition of the above provisions no longer \nexist, or when there is a clear indication of an increase in the net realisable value, the provisions are fully or partly reversed, so that \nthe new carrying amount is the lower of cost and net realisable value at the end of the reporting period. Assets are not, however, \nrecognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has incurred an expense that, based on the best information \navailable at the date of preparation of the financial statements, is deemed unlikely to generate economic benefits for the Group \nafter the end of the reporting period. \nIn the case of properties held for sale138, if present, cost is represented by the fair value of each asset at the date of acquisition, \nplus any directly attributable transaction costs, whilst the net realisable value is based on the estimated sale price under normal \nmarket conditions, less direct costs to sell. \nLong-term contract work is measured using the percentage of completion method, using cost to cost accounting139.\nEnvironmental certificates not used in the reporting period are recognised in inventories.\n138. These are properties held by EGI SpA and not accounted for in “Investment property” as they were purchased for sale or subsequently reclassified as held for sale.\n139. \u0007This method is based on the ratio of costs incurred as of a given date divided by the estimated total project cost. The resulting percentage is then applied to estimated total \nrevenue, obtaining the value to be attributed to the contract work completed and accrued revenue at the given date.\nSection\nSummary"

This corresponds to the issue, free of charge, of a set number of emission allowances by \nthe competent national authorities. During the year, depending on the effective volume of greenhouse gas emissions produced \nwith respect to the above cap, each company has the option of selling or purchasing emission allowances on the market.\nThe issue, free of charge, of emission allowances involves a commitment to produce, in the relevant year, a quantity of green-\nhouse gas emissions in proportion to the emission allowances received: this commitment, commensurate with the market value \nof the emission allowances at the time of allocation, is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. At the end of the year, \nthe commitment is reduced or derecognised in proportion to the greenhouse gas emissions effectively produced and any residual \nvalue is reported in the section, “Additional information”, in the Annual Report. \nGuarantees of origin and carbon credits\nGuarantees of Origin are certifications attesting to the renewable origin of the sources used by IGO (Guarantee of Origin Plants) \nclassified plants. For each MWh of renewable electricity fed into the grid by IGO-qualified plants, the GSE (Gestore Servizi \nEnergetici) issues a GO certificate to the producer, in accordance with Directive 2009/28/EC. As of 1 January 2013, electricity \nsales companies are obliged to procure a quantity of GO certificates equal to the electricity sold as renewable. To do this, each \ncompany is required, by 31 March of the year following the year in which electricity was supplied to end customers, to cancel a \nquantity of GOs equal to the electricity sold as renewable.\nCarbon credits, on the other hand, represent a negotiable security that allows a company or organisation to offset the car-\nbon dioxide (CO2) emitted in the course of its activities (in the case of Postepay SpA, the CO2 emissions of the gas marketed \nto end customers), by adhering to environmental sustainability projects aimed at pursuing a path of ecological transition and \nde-carbonisation.\nCO2 offsetting takes place through the acquisition of carbon credits for a value equivalent to the CO2 emissions resulting from the \ngas consumption of the Company’s end customers. Each carbon credit represents the offsetting of one tonne of CO2. \nThe accounting treatment of emission allowances, as well as guarantees of origin and carbon credits to the extent that they are \nsimilar, is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the OIC “Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowances”, as well as with the \nreference best practice for the main IAS adopters.\nThe purchase and sales of environmental certificates are accounted for in profit or loss in the year in which the transaction occurs. At \nthe end of the year, any surplus deriving from purchases are accounted for in closing inventory at the lower of cost and net realisable \nvalue141. In the event of a deficit, the resulting charge and related liability are accounted for at the end of the year at market value.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness combinations are recognised using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is \nequal to the sum of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred, and any interest issued \nby the acquirer. Costs directly attributable to the transaction are recognised in the Statement of profit or loss.\n140. Introduced into the Italian and European regulatory system by the Kyoto Protocol.\n141.

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\nThe amount transferred is allocated by recognising the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree at the \nrelated fair values at the acquisition date. \nAny positive difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its recoverable value is recognised as goodwill and record-\ned under intangible assets:\n \nz the sum of the consideration transferred, measured at fair value at the acquisition date, the amount of any non-controlling \ninterest, and, in the case of business combinations achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previ-\nously held equity interest in the acquiree; and\n \nz the net value of the amounts, at the acquisition date, of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are identifiable in the \nacquiree measured at fair value. \nIn the event of a negative difference, this surplus represents the profit from a purchase on favourable terms and is recognised in \nthe statement of profit or loss.\nIf at the time of preparing the financial statements the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities arising from the \ntransaction can only be determined provisionally, the business combination is recognised using these provisional values. Any \nadjustments resulting from the completion of the valuation process are recognised retrospectively within twelve months of the \nacquisition date.\nIn the case of a business combination achieved in stages, the interests previously held in the acquiree are remeasured at fair \nvalue at the new acquisition date and any difference (positive or negative) is recognised in the statement of profit or loss or in the \nstatement of comprehensive income if appropriate.\nCash and deposits attributable to BancoPosta\nCash and securities held at post offices, and bank deposits attributable to the operations of BancoPosta RFC, are accounted \nfor separately from cash and cash equivalents as they derive from deposits subject to investment restrictions, or from advances \nfrom the Italian Treasury to ensure that post offices can operate. This cash may only be used in settlement of these obligations. \nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents refer to cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, amounts that at 31 December 2022 the Parent \nCompany has temporarily deposited with the MEF and other highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of ninety \ndays or less. Current account overdrafts are accounted for in current liabilities.\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held \nfor sale and discontinued operations\nIn compliance with IFRS 5, non-current assets, disposal groups and discontinued operations are measured at the lower of their \ncarrying amount and fair value, less costs to sell. \nWhen it is highly probable that the carrying amount of a non-current asset, or a disposal group, will be recovered, in its present \ncondition, principally through a sale transaction or other form of disposal, rather than through continuing use, and the transaction \nis likely to take place in the short term, the asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale or as a discontinuing operation \nin the statement of financial position. The transaction is deemed to be highly probable, when the Parent Company’s Board of \nDirectors, or, when so authorised, the board of directors of a subsidiary, has committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal \ngroup), and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated. Sale transactions include exchang-\nes of non-current assets for other non-current assets when the exchange has commercial substance. \nNon-current assets and net assets in a disposal group held for sale are recognised as discontinued operations if one of the fol-\nlowing conditions is met: i) they represent a major line of business or geographical area of operation, ii) they are part of a single \ncoordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation, or, iii) they are subsidiaries \nacquired exclusively with a view to resale. The profit or loss from discontinued operations, and any gains or losses following the \nsale, are presented separately in a specific item in profit or loss, after the related taxation.

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\nRetained earnings\nThis relates to the portion of profit for the period and for previous periods which has not been distributed or taken to reserves or \nused to cover losses and actuarial gains and losses deriving from the calculation of the liability for employee termination benefits, \nand transfers from other equity reserves, when they have been released from the restrictions to which they were subjected. In \nthe consolidated financial statements, the item also includes any effects arising from transactions with minority shareholders.\nInsurance contracts\nThe following policies and classification and measurement criteria refer specifically to the operations of the Poste Italiane Group’s \ninsurance companies. in application of the provisions of IFRS 4, replaced in its entirety as of 1 January 2023 by the new account-\ning standard IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts, for the discussion of which reference should be made to Note 2.5 New account-\ning standards and interpretations and those soon to be effective.\nInsurance contracts are classified and measured as insurance contracts or finance contracts, based on their prevalent features. \nContracts issued by Poste Vita SpA primarily relate to life assurance. In 2010 Poste Assicura SpA began operating in the P&C sector. \nUnder IFRS 4, contracts that transfer significant insurance risk are considered insurance contracts. These contracts are account-\ned for and valued in accordance with the principles used to prepare the separate financial statements, observing the applicable \nlaws and regulations142. \nInsurance risk is significant if, and only if, an insured event could cause the insurer to pay significant additional economic benefits \nunder any circumstances, other than those that have no identifiable effect on the economic aspect of the transaction, even if the \ninsured event is highly unlikely. The reference accounting standard does not provide a specific indication of the level of signifi-\ncance. Therefore, it is up to the Group insurance companies to define a threshold beyond which the additional payment in the \nevent of the insured event may generate the transfer of a significant insurance risk143. \nThe separation of a contract, classified as insurance, into deposit component and insurance component is mandatory in some \ncircumstances and optional in others. In the case of separation, which can only occur under certain conditions, the deposit \ncomponent falls under IFRS 9, while the insurance component falls under IFRS 4. Group insurance companies do not perform \nthis breakdown.\nThe Group applies the following bases for classification and measurement of these contracts.\nContracts classified as insurance contracts in accordance with IFRS 4: include Class I and Class V life insurance policies, \nClass III policies that qualify as insurance contracts and P&C insurance contracts. These products are accounted for as follows:\n \nz insurance premiums are accounted for when the policies are written, recognised as income and classified in revenue; they \ninclude annual or single premiums accruing during the period and deriving from insurance contracts outstanding at the end of \nthe reporting period, net of cancellations;\n \nz technical provisions are made in respect of earned premiums to cover obligations to policyholders; such provisions are calcu-\nlated on an analytical basis for each contract using the prospective method, based on actuarial assumptions appropriate to \ncover all outstanding obligations. The technical provisions and charges relating to the claims are recognised with the relevant \nsign as positive income components. \nIn the case of contracts for separately managed accounts with discretionary participation features144 (DPF, as defined \nin Appendix A of IFRS 4), IFRS 4 makes reference, as illustrated above, to national GAAP. The contracts are classified as “finan-\ncial”, but accounted for as “insurance” as follows: \n \nz premiums, changes in technical provisions and other claim expenses are recognised in the same way as the insurance con-\ntracts described above; \n \nz unrealised gains and losses attributable to policyholders are assigned to them and recognised in technical provisions (deferred \nliabilities payable to policyholders) under the shadow accounting method.\n142. \u0007In detail, reference is made to the provisions of Legislative Decrees no. 173/2997 and no. 209/2005 as well as ISVAP Regulations no. 16, no. 21 and no. 22 (as amended \nand supplemented by ISVAP measure no. 2771 of 29 January 2010, ISVAP measure no. 2845 of 17 November 2010 and IVASS measure no. 53 of 6 December 2016).\n143. \u0007This threshold, defined by aggregating individual contracts into homogeneous categories based on the nature of the risk transferred to the Company, has been set by Poste \nVita SpA’s Board of Directors at 5%.\n144. \u0007A contractual right of investors to receive returns on the separately managed account. This category includes contracts relating to the life business and referring to Class I \nand Class V products that envisage clauses for the revaluation of the insured benefit based on the returns achieved by a separately managed account.\nSection\nSummary"

      "text": "508\n508\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\nThe calculation technique used in applying the shadow accounting method is based on the prospective yield on each separately \nmanaged account, considering a hypothetical realisation of unrealised gains and losses over a period which is consistent with \nthe characteristics of the assets and liabilities held in the portfolio. The amount to be recognised as a deferred liability also takes \naccount, for each separately managed account, of contractual obligations, the level of minimum returns guaranteed at the time \nof concluding the contract and any financial guarantees provided.\nProvisions for risks and charges\nProvisions for risks and charges are recorded to cover losses that are either probable or certain to be incurred, for which, howev-\ner, there is an uncertainty as to the amount or as to the date on which they will occur. Provisions for risks and charges are made \nwhen the Group has a present (legal or constructive) obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of \nresources will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured on the basis of management’s best estimate of the \nuse of resources required to settle the obligation. The value of the liability is discounted, where the time effect of money is rele-\nvant, at a rate that reflects current market values and takes into account the risks specific to the liability. Provisions are reviewed \nat each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the expected charge to meet existing obligations at the \nreporting date. Any effect of the passage of time and the effect of changes in interest rates are shown in the statement of profit \nor loss. With regard to the risks for which the occurrence of a liability is only possible, specific information is provided without \nmaking any provision. In those rare cases in which disclosure of some or all of the information regarding the risks in question \ncould seriously prejudice the Group’s position in a dispute or in ongoing negotiations with third parties, the Group exercises the \noption granted by the relevant accounting standards to provide limited disclosure.\nEmployee benefits\nThe Short-term employee benefits are those that will be fully paid within twelve months of the end of the year in which the \nemployee provided his or her services. Such benefits include wages, salaries, social security contributions, holiday pay and sick pay.\nThe undiscounted value of short-term employee benefits to be paid to employees in consideration of employment services pro-\nvided over the relevant period is accrued as personnel expenses.\nThere are two types of post-employment benefit:\n \nz Defined benefit plans\nDefined benefit plans include employee termination benefits payable to employees in accordance with article 2120 of the \nItalian Civil Code. \nAs a result of the supplementary pension reform, for all companies with at least 50 employees, from 1 January 2007 vesting \nemployee termination benefits (TFR) must be paid into a supplementary pension fund or into a Treasury Fund set up by INPS. \nAccordingly, the company’s defined benefit liability is applicable only to the provisions made up to 31 December 2006145. \nIn the case of companies with less than 50 employees, vested employee termination benefits continue to fully increase the \naccumulated liability for the company. \nUnder these plans, given that the amount of the benefit to be paid is only quantifiable following the termination of employment, \nthe related effects on profit or loss or the financial position are recognised on the basis of actuarial calculations in compliance \nwith IAS 19. In particular, the liability to be paid on cessation of employment is calculated using the projected unit credit \nmethod and then discounted to recognise the time value of money prior to the liability being settled. The liability recognised in \nthe financial statements is based on calculations performed by independent actuaries. The calculation takes into account the \nemployee termination benefits accrued for work already performed and is based on actuarial assumptions that mainly con-\ncern: demographic assumptions (such as employee turnover and mortality) and financial assumptions (such as rate of inflation \nand a discount rate consistent with that of the liability). In the case of companies with at least 50 employees, as the company \nis not liable for employee termination benefits accruing after 31 December 2006, the actuarial calculation of employee ter-\nmination benefits no longer takes account of future salary increases. Actuarial gains and losses at the end of each reporting \nperiod, based on the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the present value of the Group’s obligations at \nthe end of the period, due to changes in the actuarial assumptions, are recognised directly in Other comprehensive income.\n \nz Defined contribution plans\nEmployee termination benefits fall within the scope of defined contribution plans provided the benefits vested subsequent \nto 1 January 2007 and were paid into a Supplementary Pension Fund or a Treasury Fund at INPS. Contributions to defined \ncontribution plans are recognised in profit or loss when incurred, based on their nominal value. \n145. \u0007Where, following entry into effect of the new legislation, the employee has not exercised any option regarding the investment of vested employee termination benefits, the \nGroup has remained liable to pay the benefits until 30 June 2007, or until the date, between 1 January 2007 and 30 June 2007, on which the employee exercised a specific \noption. Where no option was exercised, from 1 July 2007 vested employee termination benefits have been paid into a supplementary pension fund.\nSummary\nSection"

Performance obligations can be fulfilled:\n\t– “at a point in time”: in the case of obligations fulfilled at a point in time, revenue is recognised only as control over the \ngood or service is passed to the customer. In that respect, consideration is given not only to the significant exposure \nto the risks and benefits related to the good or service but also physical possession, customer’s acceptance, the \nexistence of legal rights, etc.;\n\t– “over time”: in the case of obligations fulfilled over time, the measurement and recognition of revenue reflect, virtually, \nthe progress of the customer’s satisfaction. An appropriate approach is defined to measure progress of the perfor-\nmance obligation (the output method).\nEvery single supplier obligation with the customer is considered, measured and recognised separately. This approach involves a \npreliminary accurate analysis of the contract to identify every “single product/service” or every “single component” of a product/\nservice that the supplier promises to provide, attributing to each the relevant consideration, and to monitor each such obligation \nduring the life of the contract (in terms both of manner and timing of fulfilment and the customer’s level of satisfaction).\nFor revenue recognition purposes, the principle provides for the identification and quantification of the so-called variable com-\nponents of the consideration (discounts, rebates, price concessions, incentives, penalties and other similar) to include them to \nsupplement or adjust the transaction price. Among the variable components of the consideration, of particular importance are \nthe penalties (other than those provided for compensation for damages): said negative income components are recorded as a \ndirect decrease in revenue, instead of allocating them to a provision for risks and charges. \nIn the presence of multiple performance obligations, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation to the \nextent of the consideration that the entity is entitled to receive for the transfer of the relevant goods and services to the customer. \nThe transaction price will be allocated on the basis of the standalone selling price of the goods and services associated with the \nperformance obligation. The standalone selling price is the price at which an entity would sell the goods and services separately \nto the customer, under similar circumstances and to similar customers. If the standalone selling price is not observable, the \nCompany would need to estimate it considering all the information available (market conditions, information on the customer or \nthe class of customers) and the estimation methods used in similar circumstances.\nThe incremental costs of obtaining a contract are capitalised and amortised over the useful life of the contract, if longer than 12 \nmonths, while any non-incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred to fulfil performance \nobligations related to a contract that do not qualify for treatment under other standards (IAS 2 – Inventories, IAS 16 – Property, \nPlant and Equipment and IAS 38 – Intangible Assets) are capitalised only if the following conditions are met:\n \nz the costs related directly to a contract (general and administrative costs are not capitalised);\n \nz the costs generate or enhance resources;\n \nz the costs are expected to be recovered.\nThe Group recognises the obligation to transfer to the customer goods or services for which payment has already been obtained \n(or for which the customer’s consideration is due before the goods and services are provided) classified as liability deriving from \nthe contract.\nRevenue from activities carried out in favour of or on behalf of the state is recognised on the basis of the amount effectively \naccrued, with reference to the laws and agreements in force, taking account, in any event, of the provisions contained in legisla-\ntion regarding the public finances. The return on the current account deposits held by the MEF is determined using the effective \ninterest method and is recognised as revenue from financial services. The same classification is applied to income from Eurozone \ngovernment bonds, in which deposits paid into accounts by private customers are invested. \nFor details on the distinction between revenue from contracts with customers recognised at a point in time or over time, see \nsection “4.3 Notes to the Statement of profit or loss”.\nGovernment grants\nGovernment grants are recognised once they have been formally allocated to the Group by the public entity concerned and only \nif, based on the information available at the end of the year, there is reasonable assurance that the project to which the grant \nrelates will be effectively carried out and completed in accordance with the conditions attached to the grant. Grants are recog-\nnised in profit or loss under Other operating income as follows: operating grants in proportion to the costs actually incurred for \nthe project and accounted for and approved to the public entity; grants related to property, plant and equipment are recognised \nin proportion to the depreciation charged on the assets acquired and used to carry out the project. \nSummary\nSection"

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\nFinance income and costs\nFinance income and costs are recognised on an accruals basis based on the effective interest method, i.e. using an interest rate \nthat discounts all cash flows relating to a given transaction in the same way.\nDividends are recognised as finance income when the right to receive payment is established, which generally corresponds with \napproval of the distribution by the Shareholders Meeting of the investee company. Otherwise, dividends from subsidiaries are \naccounted for as “Other operating income”. \nEarnings per share\nIn the Poste Italiane Group’s consolidated financial statements, earnings per share is determined as follows:\nBasic: basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Group’s profit for the year by the weighted average number of Poste \nItaliane SpA’s ordinary shares in issue during the period.\nDiluted: at the date of preparation of these financial statements no financial instruments have been issued which have potentially \ndilutive characteristics146.\nRelated parties\nRelated parties within the Group refer to Poste Italiane SpA’s direct and indirect subsidiaries and associates. Related parties \nexternal to the Group include the MEF and its direct and indirect subsidiaries and associates. The Group’s key management per-\nsonnel are also classified as related parties, as are funds providing post-employment benefits to the Group’s employees and the \nrelated entities. The state and public sector entities other than the MEF are not classified as related parties. Related party transac-\ntions do not include those deriving from financial assets and liabilities represented by instruments traded on organised markets.\n2.4 Use of estimates\nThe preparation of financial information requires the use of estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on the final \nvalues indicated in the financial statements and in the disclosure provided. The preparation of these estimates involves the use of \navailable information and the adoption of subjective assessments, also based on historical experience, used for the formulation \nof reasonable assumptions for the recognition of operating events. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the \nimpact of any changes is reflected in the financial statements for the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision only influ-\nences the current period, or also in future periods if the revision influences both current and future periods. Due to their nature, the \nestimates and assumptions used may vary from year to year and, therefore, it cannot be excluded that in subsequent years, the \nvalues recorded in these Financial Statements may also vary significantly as a result of changes in the subjective valuations used.\nAccounting treatments that require greater subjectivity in the preparation of estimates are described below, also taking into account \nthe geopolitical uncertainty arising from the war between the European countries Russia-Ukraine and the unique characteristics of \nthe macroeconomic environment of reference recorded during the year (in line with ESMA requirements147).\nRevenue and amounts due from the State\nRevenue from activities carried out in favour of or on behalf of the State and Public Administration entities is recognised on the \nbasis of the amount effectively accrued, with reference to the laws and agreements in force, taking account, in any event, of \nthe instructions contained in legislation regarding the public finance. The legal framework of reference is still subject to change \n146. \u0007Diluted earnings per share are calculated by taking into account the potentially dilutive effect of all instruments which can be converted into ordinary shares issued by the \nParent Company. The calculation is based on the ratio of profit attributable to the Parent Company, adjusted to take account of any costs or income deriving from the con-\nversion, net of any tax effect, and the weighted average number of shares outstanding, assuming conversion of all convertible securities.\n147.

Elements of variable consideration are identified at \nthe inception of the contract and estimated as of every close of the accounts for the entire contract term, to take into account \nnew circumstances and changes in the circumstances already considered for the previous estimations. Elements of variable \nconsideration include refund liabilities.\nProvisions for risks and charges\nThe Group makes provisions for probable liabilities deriving from disputes with staff, suppliers, and third parties and, in general, \nfor liabilities deriving from present obligations. These provisions cover the liabilities that could result from legal action of varying \nnature, the impact on profit or loss of seizures incurred and not yet definitively assigned, and amounts expected to be refundable \nto customers where the final amount payable has yet to be determined.\nSummary\nSection"

      "text": "513\n513\nPoste Italiane’s Financial Statements at 31 December 2022\n2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\nDetermination of the provisions for risks and charges involves the use of estimates based on current knowledge of factors that \nmay change over time, potentially resulting in outcomes that may be significantly different from those taken into account in pre-\nparing these financial statements.\nIn order to reflect in the financial statements the risks arising from potential fraud perpetrated against Poste Italiane and, there-\nfore, to determine the accounting impacts associated with the potential risk on tax credits, as described in greater detail in Note \nA10 - Tax credits Law no. 77/2020, without prejudice to compliance with Bank of Italy/CONSOB/Ivass Document no. 9 as to all \nother aspects related to the accounting recognition of the tax credits in question (see the section “Tax credits Law no. 77/2020” \nof paragraph 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies and measurement criteria for further details), the decision was taken \nto refer to the provisions of IAS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities, with regard to the measurement of \nthe risks in question. The applicability of IAS 37, in order to reflect in the financial statements the risk of not being able to offset \nthe tax credits on which fraud was ascertained, was considered because the possible failure to recover the carrying amount of \nthe tax credits would not derive from a characteristic of the asset being measured or from significant increases in the credit risk \nafter the initial recognition of the asset or, more simply, from the ascertained default of the debtor, but rather from the possibility \nthat, for those ascertained to be cases of fraud, the liability of the assignee - even if a third party in good faith or an offended \nparty to the offence - will also be called to account for assumptions other than the possible irregular use of the tax credit or for \nuse to a greater extent than the tax credit received148. As a result of the in-depth analyses carried out on the tax credits acquired, \nalso with the support of external legal, tax and accounting consultants, a specific provision was estimated, recorded consistently \nwith the above and for clarity in the liability item “Provisions for risks and charges”. It should be noted that the determination of \nthe above-mentioned provision necessarily required the application of a significant degree of professional judgement, the main \nelements of uncertainty of which relate to the outcome of the proceedings under way, the identification of the receivables whose \ndeductions have been assigned are effectively non-existent, and the outcome of the initiatives that will be activated by Poste \nItaliane to recover the amounts paid to the entities in respect of which cases of fraud have been ascertained.\nImpairment and stage allocation for financial instruments\nFor the purposes of calculating impairment and determining the stage allocation, the main factors estimated by the Poste Italiane \nGroup are as follows, relating to the internal model developed for Sovereign, Banking and Corporate counterparties:\n \nz estimates of ratings by counterparty;\n \nz estimation of the probability of default “PD” for counterparties.\nWith regard to trade receivables, on the other hand, the Poste Italiane Group does not apply stage allocation in accordance with \nthe Simplified Approach. Impairment, for these items in the Financial Statements, is based on:\n \nz analytical impairment: when a defined credit threshold is exceeded, the individual credit position is analytically monitored on \nthe basis of internal or external evidence; or\n \nz forfeit impairment: elaboration of a provision matrix for historical losses.\nFor further details, see Note 6 - Risk management.\nImpairment tests of goodwill, cash generating units and \nequity investments\nGoodwill and other non-current assets are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets. Impairment \ntesting involves the use of estimates based on factors that may change over time, potentially resulting in effects that may be \nsignificantly different from prior year estimates.\nIn accordance with the relevant accounting standard, when it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual \nasset, the Group identifies the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of those from \nother assets or groups of assets (Cash Generating Units - CGUs). The process of identifying such CGUs necessarily involves \nmanagement’s judgement as to the specific nature of the assets and business to which they belong and evidence that the cash \ninflows from the group of assets are closely interdependent and largely independent of those from other assets (or groups of \nassets). The number and scope of CGUs are systematically updated to reflect the effects of new aggregation and reorganisation \n148. \u0007As provided for in Article 121, paragraph 4 of Law Decree no. 34/2020, which states “...omissis...Suppliers and transferees shall only be liable for any use of the tax credit \nin an irregular manner or to an extent greater than the tax credit received...omissis...”.\nSection\nSummary"

Compared \nto previous years, the companies Plurima, Agile and Sourcesense are included in the explicit cash flows and net invested capital \nof the Mail, Parcels and Distribution CGU as a result of the acquisitions completed in the current year.\nIn order to estimate the value in use of the CGU, reference was made to the 2023 Budget approved by Poste Italiane SpA’s Board \nof Directors on 29 March 2023 and to the best economic and financial forecasts for the two-year period 2024-2025 approved at \nthe same meeting by the Board of Directors. In determining the terminal value, calculated on the basis of the last year of explicit \nforecasts, income was normalised. Reference was also made to the transfer prices that BancoPosta RFC is expected to pay for the \nservices provided by Poste Italiane’s distribution network. A long-term growth rate of 2.1% and a WACC (Weighted Average Cost \nof Capital) of 6.19% were used. The analysis made it possible to conclude positively on the appropriateness of the figures of the \nfinancial statements, as well as the related sensitivity analyses on the significant variables that have confirmed the carrying amounts.\nAs in the past, in determining the value of properties used as post offices and sorting centres, Poste Italiane SpA’s universal \nservice obligation was taken into account, as was the inseparability of the cash flows generated from the properties that provide \nthis service, (which the Parent Company is required to operate throughout the country regardless of the expected profitability of \neach location); the unique nature of the operating processes involved and the substantial overlap between postal and financial \nactivities within the same outlets, represented by post offices, were also considered. On this basis, the value in use of the Parent \nCompany’s land and buildings used in operations is relatively unaffected by changes in the commercial value of the properties \nconcerned and, in certain critical market conditions, certain properties may have values that are significantly higher than their \nmarket value, without this having any impact on the cash flows or results of the Mail, Parcels and Distribution segment.\nThe fair value of the Parent Company’s properties used in operations continued to be higher than their carrying amount, as con-\nfirmed by the property valuations carried out.\nSummary\nSection"

Assessments of expected \ntaxable income depend on factors which may change over time, impacting on the valuation of the deferred tax assets in the \nstatement of financial position.\nTechnical provisions for insurance business\nThe measurement of technical provisions for the insurance business is based on estimates made by actuaries employed by \nPoste Vita SpA, based on a series of material assumptions, including technical, actuarial, demographic and financial assump-\ntions, as well as on projections of future cash flows from the insurance contracts entered into by Poste Vita and Poste Assicura \nand effective at the end of the year.  \nIn order to verify the adequacy of the technical provisions, the Liability Adequacy Test (LAT) is performed periodically. It measures \nthe ability of future cash flows from insurance contracts to cover liabilities to the policyholder149. The LAT is conducted on the \nbasis of the present value of future cash flows, obtained by projecting expected future cash flows from the existing portfolio to the \nend of the reporting period, based on appropriate assumptions regarding the cause of termination (death, surrender, redemption, \nreduction) and the performance of claim expenses. If necessary, technical provisions are topped up and the related cost charged \nto profit or loss. \n149. \u0007For example, with reference to the Life business, the approach adopted for the quantification of technical items useful for the implementation of the LAT consists in the \ndevelopment, for each product line, of a calculation model that replicates the (probable) economic commitments of the Group insurance company over the entire projection \nhorizon coinciding with the residual duration of the contracts. The projections of future cash flows take into account the general and special policy conditions, with particular \nreference to the time structure of premiums, insured benefits, payments per claim, maturities or redemptions, as well as revaluation clauses and any other contractual options \npresent. Future assumptions express reliable estimates of the probability of exit for the various causes, impacting future cash flows of investment returns, policyholder \nparticipation rates, and levels of acquisition and operating expenses.\nSummary\nSection"

The plan terms and conditions link the award of the related options to \nthe occurrence of certain events, such as the achievement of performance targets and performance hurdles and, in certain areas \nof operation, compliance with certain capital adequacy and liquidity requirements.

The \ncalculation takes account of termination benefits accrued for the period of service to date and is based on various demographic \nand economic-financial assumptions. \nThe main actuarial assumptions applied in the calculation of employee termination benefits at 31 December 2022, also based on \nthe experience of each Group company and the reference best practice, are as follows:\nEconomic and financial assumptions\n31.12.2022\nDiscount rate\n3.63%\nInflation rate\n2.30%\nAnnual rate of increase of employee termination benefits\n3.225%\nDemographic assumptions\n31.12.2022\nMortality\nISTAT 2018\nDisability\nINPS tables broken down by age and gender\nRetirement age\nAchievement of general mandatory insurance requirements\nFrequency of employee termination benefits advances\nSpecific table with rates differentiated by Company\nEmployee turnover frequency\nSpecific table with rates differentiated by Company\nDetermination of the lease liability\nTo determine the financial lease liability, the Group has opted to use an incremental borrowing rate (IBR) determined in line with a \nhypothetical loan obtained in the current economic environment, and applied to groups of contracts with similar remaining terms \nand to similar companies. In particular, each IBR takes account of the risk-free rate identified on the basis of factors such as the \neconomic environment, currency, contract term and credit spread reflecting the companies’ organisation and financial structure. \nThe IBR associated with the commencement of the contract will be reviewed whenever there is a lease modification, meaning \nsubstantial and significant changes to the contract conditions over the life of the agreement (e.g. the lease term or the amount \nof future lease payments).

This has resulted in a \nset of rules for determining the lease term, to be applied to leased properties classified previously in three distinct clusters: properties \nwhere the lease is subject to legal restrictions and high commercial-value properties; properties for civilian use, such as the company \naccommodation for Group employees and executives; and other properties used in operations. \nThe lease term for all of the other agreements was set as equal to the duration of the obligation agreed upon between the parties, \nin keeping with future intent in wanting and being able to complete the term and past experience. \nOptions on minority interests150\nIn the context of particular corporate transactions, there are call and put options that will allow Poste Italiane to purchase, at cer-\ntain future dates, shares held by minority shareholders. The exercise price of these options is generally determined on the basis \nof a formula that provides for the application of a multiplier to certain economic/equity targets of the company acquired. For said \ncases in the consolidated financial statements, a financial liability has been recognised (in addition to the portion of equity attrib-\nutable to non-controlling interests), to take account of the possible exercise of options, as matching entry to Group’s equity, the \nvalue of which depends on estimates made internally and which could change even significantly in the current and future years. \nSubsequent changes in the value of the financial liability will be reflected in the Group’s statement of profit or loss.\nFor details of the corporate transactions from which the need to recognise this financial liability arose, see Note B8 - Financial \nLiabilities.\nInformation on non-financial issues\nClimate change\nClimate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy are becoming increasingly relevant to businesses, banks, govern-\nments, regulators, and investors.\nDuring the year under review the process of identifying and assessing risks and environmental management methods continued, \nenabling the Poste Italiane Group to pursue the ambitious goal of contributing to the achievement of international carbon neu-\ntrality objectives, as specified in greater detail in the section of the Non-Financial Statement to which reference should be made \nfor further details.\nRisks related to climate change have been taken into account in the preparation of these financial statements. With particular \nregard to the accounting treatment reserved for greenhouse gas emission allowances relating to the Group’s airline, Poste Air \nCargo, as well as guarantees of origin and carbon credits held by the company Postepay and relating to the provision of Energy \n(electricity and gas) sales services, please refer to “Note 2.3 - Summary of significant accounting policies and measurement \ncriteria”.\nMacroeconomic environment\nThe estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements adequately take into account the particular macroeconomic \ncontext of reference, at 31 December 2022 heavily impacted by a number of factors such as: pandemic effects, inflation, rising \n150. \u0007An option contract that allows an entity to purchase the interests of minority shareholders of a subsidiary in exchange for cash or other financial assets gives rise to a financial \nliability in the consolidated financial statements for the present value of the amount payable. Any change in the financial liability from the date of recognition is accounted for \nwith a different balancing entry depending on whether it refers to:\n•\tminority shareholders directly interested in the performance of the subsidiary’s business with regard to the transfer of risks and benefits on the shares subject to the option. \nOne of the indicators of this interest is the fair value measurement of the option exercise price. In addition to the presence of this indicator, the Group makes a case-by-case \nassessment of the facts and circumstances that characterise existing transactions. In this case, the discounted value of the option is initially deducted from the Group’s \nequity reserves. Any subsequent changes in the valuation of the option exercise price are reflected in the statement of profit or loss;\n•\tminority shareholders not directly interested in the performance of the business (e.g. exercise price of the predetermined option). The exercise price of the option, duly \ndiscounted, is deducted from the corresponding amount of Capital and Reserves pertaining to non-controlling interests. Any subsequent changes in the valuation of the \noption exercise price follow the same logic, with no impact on the statement of profit or loss.\nSummary\nSection"

      "text": "520\n520\nAnnual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\nIn accordance with the new accounting standard, it is necessary to identify those contracts that meet the definition of an insur-\nance contract, thus defining the scope of application of the new standard. \nThe insurance contracts within the scope of application will initially be subdivided according to the year they were underwritten \nand their profitability. In fact, the standard provides that groups of insurance contracts are, following the performance of an \n“onerousness test”, divided into:\n\t– profitable contracts;\n\t– onerous contracts;\n\t– contracts that at the time of initial recognition do not have a high probability of becoming onerous.\nThe groups of contracts identified can be measured by applying the General Model (also referred to as the Building Block \nApproach - BBA); this approach involves defining the cash flows associated with the insurance contract, consisting of:\n\t– future cash inflows and outflows;\n\t– an adjustment that takes into account the time value of money and the financial risks associated with the flows \nthemselves;\n\t– an adjustment for non-financial risk (risk adjustment). \nThe final result of the sum of the preceding components, if positive, determines the so-called Contractual Service Margin (CSM) \nthat will be issued over the life of the insurance contract according to the so-called Coverage Unit, while if negative the Loss \nComponent, recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.\nThe standard provides for the possibility of using two further measurement models:\n\t– Premium Allocation Approach (PAA), an optional and alternative model to the general model, is applicable to contracts \ncharacterised by a coverage period of no more than one year, as well as to groups of contracts for which the company \nconsiders that simplification linked to the model would not lead to a significantly different result from that obtained with \nthe general model;\n\t– Variable Fee Approach (VFA), a mandatory measurement model for investment contracts with discretionary participa-\ntion features, such as separately managed accounts and unit-linked insurance.\nThe provisions of the new standard are to be applied to insurance contracts issued, reinsurance contracts issued and held, and \ninvestment contracts with a discretionary participation feature (DPF). The preliminary effects resulting from the initial application \nof IFRS 17 at 1 January 2022 are presented in the section “Accounting standards and interpretations soon to be effective: ESMA \nDisclosure - Quantitative impacts”.\n \nz Amendments to IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts aimed at introducing a transition option regarding comparative information \non financial assets presented at the date of initial application of the new standard, in order to avoid temporary accounting \nmismatches between financial assets and liabilities of insurance contracts, and thus to improve the usefulness of comparative \ninformation for readers of financial statements.\n \nz Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in \nAccounting Estimates and Errors aimed at improving disclosure on accounting policies so as to provide more useful \ninformation to investors and other primary users of financial statements, as well as to help companies distinguish changes in \naccounting estimates from changes in accounting policies.\n \nz Amendments to IAS 12 - Income Taxes to clarify how deferred taxes should be accounted for on certain transactions that \nmay generate assets and liabilities of equal amount, such as leases and decommissioning obligations, with the objective of \nreducing diversity in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities on such transactions.\nLastly, at the reporting date, the IASB has issued the following amendments, still not yet endorsed by the European Commission:\n \nz Amendments IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current e Non-\nCurrent Liabilities with Covenants;\n \nz Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback.\nThe potential impact on the Poste Italiane Group’s financial reporting of the accounting standards, amendments and interpreta-\ntions due to come into effect is currently being assessed.

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\nAccounting standards and interpretations soon to be \neffective: ESMA disclosure\nOn 13 May 2022, the European Securities and Markets Authority (hereinafter referred to as ESMA) published Public Statement \nESMA32-339-208 “Transparency on implementation of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts”151 with the aim of identifying certain infor-\nmation that listed companies are encouraged to provide in their 2022 Half-Year and Annual Financial Reports regarding the \nimpacts of the first-time application of IFRS 17- Insurance Contracts.\nThe IFRS 17 implementation project was launched by the Poste Italiane Group during 2019 and concerned the insurance com-\npanies of the Poste Vita Group (Poste Vita SpA and Poste Assicura SpA) as well as, limited to the related impact on the consoli-\ndated financial statements, the Parent Company, with the assistance of a consultant with proven expertise and professionalism. \nBelow we provide some preliminary relevant information required by ESMA concerning the effects of applying IFRS 17. \nScope of application\nThe application of the principle requires an analysis of existing contracts in order to identify those that reflect the definition of an \n“insurance contract”, i.e. a contract under which one party accepts a significant insurance risk from another party, agreeing to \nindemnify the insured or the beneficiary in the event that the latter suffers loss as a result of a specific event, i.e. the insured event.\nTherefore, insurance contracts issued by companies belonging to the Poste Vita Group, as well as reinsurance contracts held, fall \nwithin the scope of the standard. With regard to the contracts issued by the other Poste Italiane Group companies, no elements \nwere identified that could be brought within the definition of an insurance contract, i.e., although falling within this definition, the \nGroup opted to continue applying IFRS 15 and/or IFRS 9 instead of IFRS 17 as permitted by the new standard.\nLevel of portfolio aggregation\nThe Poste Italiane Group will apply IFRS 17 to its entire portfolio of contracts issued by Group companies and reinsurance con-\ntracts held. The level of aggregation defined envisages an initial distinction between Life and P&C business and then a distinction \ninto different Unit Of Accounts that accommodate contracts with similar contractual characteristics and product risk. This clas-\nsification was also made taking into account the Solvency II Lines of Business, where possible.\nApplication of exemption to annual cohorts\nAs envisaged in the endorsement of the final version of the standard, the Poste Italiane Group will adopt the exemption option \nrelating to the application of the annual cohorts152, limited to the portfolios pertaining to the Line of Business “With Profit \nParticipating” and the hybrid products with separately managed components of Poste Vita. These contracts will therefore not be \ndivided into annual cohorts, but will be managed together by exploiting the mutualisation effect of returns153, typical of segregated \nmanaged accounts. No impact on P&C business is expected.\nThis exemption stems from the fact that in insurance practice, the revaluation rules for insurance liabilities are a function of the \nreturns on the related financial assets, which are calculated through a common management of these assets and therefore not \ndifferentiated according to the specific sub-portfolios included in a specific separately managed account or between product \ngeneration years. The presence of cohorts generates complexities in terms of quantifying the “mutualisation effect” arising from \nthe inclusion of different Units of Account (new production) in a pool of Units of Account pertaining to pre-existing portfolios, as \nwell as complexities in terms of allocation of return on assets to specific Units of Account that could generate distorting effects \nin IFRS 17 results.\n151. \u0007Also referred to by ESMA Public Statement 32-63-1320 “European common enforcement priorities for 2022 annual financial reports”, which identifies the key information \nthat listed companies are required to present in their 2022 Annual Financial Reports.\n152. Cohort means the division of contracts according to the year of signing.\n153. \u0007Intergenerational mutuality is generated on those products of long duration that provide for the entry of policyholders even at different times in the life of the product. In these \ncases, the mutualisation effect makes it possible to offset losses and gains from portfolio management between the different generations of policyholders participating in \nthe product.\nSection\nSummary"

This measure represents an adjustment of the estimated Present Value Future \nCash Flow, which will affect the determination of the CSM. \nTo determine the Risk Adjustment, the Poste Italiane Group decided to use the percentile metric. According to this approach, the \nRisk Adjustment represents the potential loss in relation to the obligations assumed towards policyholders (Technical Reserves) \nthat companies would incur, at a given level of probability (percentile level), to cover the insurance risks assumed, thus reflecting \nthe companies’ risk appetite.\nIn the identification of the confidence level for the Risk Adjustment, equal to 70% for the Life business and 80% for the P&C \nbusiness, among other elements, the Solvency II valuation framework was taken into account, considering the same perimeter \nof underlying risks.\nEvaluation models adopted\nThe Premium Allocation Approach, adopted exclusively for P&C Business, will be used for all contracts that include one or more \nof the following features:\n \nz duration of 720 days or less;\n \nz single premium with duration ≤ 7 years;\n \nz multi-year duration and membership of the Collective Business;\n \nz multi-year duration and belonging to a Portfolio where the weight of the Multi-year Business is less than or equal to 5% in the \nlast 3 financial years.\nIt is specified that, in order to determine these requirements, sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify which features of \nthe contracts had a non-significant impact in terms of the outcome when applying the PAA compared to those that would have \nbeen obtained by applying the BBA.\nWith reference to the VFA model, adopted exclusively for the Life business, the Group assessed the eligibility for the model for \nthe following types of products:\nSummary\nSection"

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\n \nz With Profit Participating;\n \nz Unit-linked standalone insurance;\n \nz Hybrid products with investment components.\nThe BBA model will be applied in both P&C and Life business and adopted for portfolios other than those described above.\nDefinition of the Contractual Service Margin release pattern choice\nWith reference to the Life business, the Poste Italiane Group determines the CSM release by adopting a Coverage Unit (CU) \nbased on a Volume-based driver, defined separately for each measurement model adopted:\n \nz BBA model: the CU is defined with a driver based on the sums insured, which are similar to the lump-sum death benefit for \npure risk contracts, and on the mathematical provisions, for annuities (in the payout phase) not under the Separately managed \naccounts from Long-Term Care products;\n \nz VFA model: the CU for DPF contracts is defined using a driver based on mathematical provisions.\nAs part of the CSM release pattern of the P&C business, for contracts valued under the BBA Model, the Group decided to use \na release driver based on earned premiums before commissions. The evaluation of the driver also takes into account the effect \nof any premium refunds and related commission reversals.\nMethod of determining contract boundaries \nThe valuation of a group of insurance contracts must take into account the Contract Boundaries, i.e. the contractual elements \nthat can change the cash flows linked to the contract. The identification of these elements makes it possible to distinguish future \ncash flows related to existing contracts, which must be included in the estimate at the measurement date, from cash flows that \nwill arise in the future and which must be measured separately in accordance with IFRS 17. The contract boundary identification \ntechniques adopted by the Group are the same as those used in the Solvency II context, with the exception of the case relating \nto non-cancellable tacit renewals of certain P&C business products, which define a new initial recognition and, therefore, a new \ncohort.\nMethod of determining the investment component\nThe investment component represents the amount under the insurance contract that the issuing entity must recognise even if \nthe insured event does not occur. The standard expressly requires that this component be displayed separately if distinct. The \nGroup identifies the investment component for certain insurance contracts and defines it as follows:\n \nz for investment products and annuities in the accumulation phase, the investment component is equal to the difference \nbetween the liquidated value and the surrender value net of penalties;\n \nz for annuities that are certain to be paid out, the value of the investment component corresponds to the value of the benefits \npaid out.\nFinally, with respect to P&C business, the investment component is identified in outward reinsurance contracts that provide scalar \nor profit sharing.\nInsurance finance income/expenses\nThe recognition of insurance finance income and expenses, i.e. the effects of changes in the time value of money and financial \nrisk, as required by the standard, will be calculated separately per measurement model:\n \nz for the VFA portfolio, insurance finance income/expenses will be recognised in the statement of profit or loss or in Other \nComprehensive Income (OCI) in relation to the result of Fair Value Underlying Items defined in accordance with IFRS 9;\n \nz with regard to the BBA measurement model, finance income and expenses items will be calculated on the basis of the valu-\nation curves adopted for the calculation of IFRS 17 flows.\nSection\nSummary"

Financial assets and liabilities \nrelating to repurchase agreements managed through the CC&G that meet the requirements of IAS 32 are offset. The effect of \nnetting at 31 December 2022, already included in the exposure to net balances, amounted to €3,217 million (€1,577 million at \n31 December 2021). At 31 December 2022, the fair value159 of said item was €1,358 million.\nReceivables include: \n \nz Deposits with the MEF, for €11,907 million, including public customers’ postal current account deposits, which earn a \nvariable rate of return, calculated on a basket of government bonds160. The deposit has been adjusted to reflect accumulated \nimpairments of approximately €5 million, to reflect the risk of counterparty default (unchanged compared to 31 December \n2021). During the 2022 financial year, hedging (management) derivative contracts were concluded on the 10-year index-linked \nremuneration component. The hedging transaction was carried out through forward purchases of the 10-year BTP with set-\ntlement of the differential between the pre-set price of the security and its market value.\n \nz Other financial receivables, relating for €2,457 million to collateral deposits - of which €1,447 million for amounts paid to \ncounterparties for repo transactions on fixed-income securities (collateral provided for by specific Global Master Repurchase \nAgreements), €978 million for amounts paid to CC&G (€613 million for outstanding repo transactions and €365 million as a \npre-financed contribution to the Default Fund161), €31 million for amounts paid to counterparties for interest rate swap trans-\nactions (collateral provided for by specific Credit Support Annexes). The year-on-year decrease in guarantee deposits is due \nto the upward shift in the interest rate curve, which mainly generated a decrease in amounts paid to counterparties with which \ninterest rate swap transactions are in place as a result of the positive change in the fair value of hedging derivatives, partially \noffset by the increase in amounts paid to counterparties with which repo transactions are in place as a result of the negative \nchange in the fair value of collateral securities.\n159. In terms of fair value hierarchy, which reflects the relevance of the sources used to measure assets, this amount qualifies for Level 2.\n160. \u0007The variable rate in question is calculated as follows: 40% is based on the average return on 6-month BOTs recognised monthly and the remaining 60% is based on the \naverage ten-year BTP return recognised monthly.\n161. \u0007A guarantee fund established with payments from participants in the derivative, equity and bond markets, as a further guarantee for the transactions carried out.

These receivables are shown gross of the collection of an unavailable amount of €125 million, relating to the tariff \nsubsidies applied in 2020, 2021 and the first half of 2022, deposited by the Cabinet Office - Publishing Department, \nin a non-interest-bearing account held by the Parent Company with the State Treasury and for this reason recorded \nunder Payables for advances received. Release of the amount deposited and extinguishment of the receivables in \nquestion are awaiting approval from the European Commission. At 31 December 2022, following the integration of the \nappropriations for the period 2018-2021 in the State Budget 2023, the provisions for doubtful debts, allocated over \nthe years, were released in the amount of approximately €17 million.\n\t– Integrated Notification and mailroom services rendered to central and local government authorities, amounting to €83 \nmillion.\n\t– Reimbursement of real estate, vehicles and surveillance expenses incurred on behalf of the Ministry of Enterprise and \nMade in Italy (MiMIT) in the amount of €49 million169. This receivable is made up of the remaining €24 million from the \noriginal claim of €62 million that was the subject of legal action brought by Poste Italiane for recognition of charges \narising from the use of real estate until 2012. On 30 April 2020, a partially favourable judgement was published for \nPoste Italiane; the judgement was notified to MIMIT and the latter appealed before the Court of Appeal with a request \nfor suspension. On 3 December 2020, the request was not granted and a decision is now pending in the second \ninstance. In December 2021, in compliance with the first instance judgment, MIMIT paid approximately €38 million to \nthe Company, the effects of which were reflected in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021. \nThe supplement to the balance consists of €25 million and, during the year, following joint audits, the charges arising \nfrom the use of real estate by MIMIT, in the period 2013 - 2021, for a total value of approximately €15 million, were \ndefined. This amount, which had been allocated to the provisions for doubtful debts, was therefore released. \n\t– Unfranked mail services provided on credit, totalling €38 million, to central and local government authorities.\n\t– Market Registered Mail services, totalling €38 million, provided to central and local government entities.\n\t– Mail forwarding and notification services provided following a tender procedure for a total of €30 million.\n\t– The payment of pensions and vouchers on behalf of INPS (the National Institute of Social Security), totalling €21 million.\n168. \u0007At 31 December 2022, the balance of trade receivables includes €10 million, net of the related provisions for doubtful debts, relating to rental income falling within the scope \nof IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\n169. \u0007See “Revenue and amounts due from the State” below, showing overall amounts due from the Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy (€50 million), including amounts due \nfor postal and other services.\nSummary\nSection"

In this regard, during the 2022 financial year, the Parent Company recovered approximate-\nly €43 million by means of an adjustment with the contributions due to the Social Security Institute.\n \nz Receivables relating to fixed-term contract settlements consist of salaries to be recovered following the agreements \nof 13 January 2006, 10 July 2008, 27 July 2010, 18 May 2012, 21 March 2013, 30 July 2015 and 19 June 2018 between \nPoste Italiane SpA and the labour unions, regarding the re-employment by court order of personnel previously employed \non fixed-term contracts. This item refers to receivables with a present value of €112 million from personnel, from INPS and \npension funds recoverable in the form of variable instalments, the last of which is due in 2042. Amounts due from INPS (for-\nmerly IPOST) of €42 million, covered by a specific agreement with IPOST dated 23 December 2009. Payment of this amount \nconsists of six instalments of €6.9 million each, falling due between 30 June 2012 and 31 December 2014; negotiations are \nin progress with the debtor for their recovery.\n \nz Amounts that cannot be drawn on due to court rulings include €59 million in amounts seized and not assigned to cred-\nitors, in the process of recovery, and €12 million in amounts stolen from the Parent Company in December 2007 as a result \nof an attempted fraud and that have remained on deposit with an overseas bank.

The reclassification, effective as of 1 October 2022, became necessary as a result of the lack of development \nin the market for second sales between financial intermediaries, which therefore required BancoPosta RFC to revise its business \nmodel for these loans.\nChanges in these tax credits during 2022 are shown below:\ntab.

At that date, the fair value of only the tax \ncredits subject to reclassification was €2,425 million; the overall change in fair value recognised during the year, of €14 million, \nwould have been recognised in equity in the absence of the reclassification.\nAs part of the actions aimed at combating tax fraud perpetrated through the monetisation of tax credits, starting from the end of \nthe 2021 financial year, a number of Public Prosecutors’ Offices have implemented preventive seizures that, in some cases also \ninvolved tax credits acquired by Poste Italiane (some of which were subsequently released from seizure in the course of 2022) for \na nominal value of the credits of approximately €410 million, against a value paid to customers that was lower and corresponding \nto a carrying amount of approximately €334 million at 31 December 2022, including interest capitalised for the recognition at \namortised cost of the credits in question. \n172. \u0007With the conversion into Law no. 106 of 23 July 2021 of Law Decree no. 73 of 25 May 2021, BancoPosta RFC is allowed, as part of the 50% of its funding from private \ncustomers that can be invested in securities guaranteed by the Italian State, to use up to 30% of this portion to purchase transferable tax credits.\n173.

Poste Italiane Group Financial Statements at 31 December 2022\n567\nIn a regulatory context that is constantly evolving, and taking into account the position taken by the case law174, starting in the \nsecond half of the 2022 financial year, on the unusability of tax credits due to conduct unrelated to the transferee and the inter-\npretations of the Agenzia delle Entrate, a legal and accounting analysis was conducted to comprehensively assess the potential \nrisks to which Poste Italiane could be exposed if the tax credits acquired over time by the same were to derive from fraudulent \nconduct. In particular, in order to determine the accounting impact related to this potential risk, reference was made to the pro-\nvisions of IAS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities (as better illustrated in the section Use of estimates), \nas the possible non-recovery of the carrying amount of the tax credits would not derive from a characteristic of the asset being \nmeasured or from significant increases in the credit risk after the initial recognition of the asset or, more simply, from the ascer-\ntained default of the debtor, as envisaged by the impairment model set forth in IFRS 9, but rather from the possibility that, for \nwhat will be ascertained cases of fraud, the liability of the assignee - even if a third party in good faith or an offended party to the \ncrime - will also be called to account for assumptions other than the possible irregular use of the tax credit or for a use in excess \nof the tax credit received. As a result of the in-depth investigations conducted on the tax credits acquired, also with the support \nof external legal, tax and accounting consultants, a total provision for these risks of €320 million was recognised under the liability \nitem “Provisions for risks and charges”.  \nIt should be noted that the determination of the above-mentioned provision necessarily required the application of a significant \ndegree of professional judgement, the main elements of uncertainty of which relate to the outcome of the proceedings under \nway, the identification of the receivables whose deductions have been assigned are effectively non-existent, and the outcome of \nthe initiatives that will be activated by Poste Italiane to recover the amounts paid to the entities in respect of which cases of fraud \nhave been ascertained.\nA11 – Cash and deposits attributable to BancoPosta (€5,848 \nmillion)\ntab.

They have increased by €95 million to reflect the \nestimated value of new liabilities and decreased as a result of past contingent liabilities that failed to materialise (€35 million) \nand settled disputes (€77 million).\n \nz Provisions for early retirement incentives reflect the estimated costs to be incurred as a result of the Group’s binding \ncommitment to pay early retirement incentives on a voluntary basis, under the current redundancy scheme agreed with the \nlabour unions for a determinate number of employees who will leave by 31 December 2024.

The decrease is partly mitigated by \nthe positive contribution from the hospital logistics business conducted by the company Plurima acquired by the Group during \nthe year. In addition, there was a decrease in other revenue, mainly due to the lower contribution of revenue from the PosteMotori \nConsortium, whose activities are in the process of being concluded.\nUniversal Service compensation relates to amounts paid by the MEF to cover the costs of fulfilling the USO.

      "text": "Annual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n626\n5.2 Information on BancoPosta RFC\nAs required by art. 2, paragraphs 17-octies et seq. of Law 10 of 26 February 2011, converting Law Decree 225 of 29 December \n2010, in order to identify ring-fenced capital for the purposes of applying the Bank of Italy’s prudential requirements to \nBancoPosta’s operations and for the protection of creditors, at the Shareholders’ Meeting held on 14 April 2011 Poste Italiane \nSpA’s shareholder approved the creation of ring-fenced capital to be used exclusively in relation to BancoPosta’s operations \n(BancoPosta Ring-fenced Capital or BancoPosta RFC), as governed by Presidential Decree 144 of 14 March 2001, and estab-\nlished the assets and contractual rights to be included in the ring-fence as well as By-laws governing its organisation, manage-\nment and control. BancoPosta RFC was provided originally with an initial reserve of €1 billion through the attribution of Poste \nItaliane SpA’s retained earnings. The resolution of 14 April 2011 became effective on 2 May 2011, the date on which it was filed \nwith the Companies’ Register. Following on from the Board of Directors’ resolution of 25 January 2018 and the subsequent \nExtraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting of Poste Italiane SpA’s shareholders, on 27 September 2018, Poste Italiane injected €210 \nmillion of fresh capital into BancoPosta RFC.\nIn 2021, Poste Italiane SpA placed a hybrid subordinated perpetual bond issue with a non-call period of 8 years aimed at institu-\ntional investors. Following this issue, on 30 June 2021, there was an injection of capital into BancoPosta RFC, via the granting of \na €350 million perpetual subordinated loan with an 8-year non-call period, under terms and conditions that allow it to be counted \nas Additional Tier 1 (“AT1”) capital, designed to strengthen its leverage ratio.\nThe separation of BancoPosta from Poste Italiane SpA is only partly comparable to other ring-fenced capital solutions. Indeed, \nBancoPosta is not expected to meet the requirements of articles 2447 bis et seq. of the Italian Civil Code or for other special \npurpose entities, in that it has not been established for a single specific business but rather, pursuant to Presidential Decree 144 \nof 14 March 2001, for several types of financial activities to be regularly carried out for an unlimited period of time. For this reason, \nthe above legislation does not impose the 10% limit on BancoPosta’s equity, waiving the provisions of the Italian Civil Code unless \nexpressly cited as applicable.\nNature of assets and contractual rights and authorisations\nBancoPosta’s assets, contractual rights and authorisations pursuant to notarial deed were conferred on BancoPosta RFC exclu-\nsively by Poste Italiane SpA without third-party contributions. BancoPosta’s operations consist of those listed in Presidential \nDecree 144 of 14 March 2001, as amended183, with the exception of activities linked to card payments and payment services, \ncarried out by the subsidiary, PostePay SpA. More details on this aspect are provided below:\n \nz the collection of all forms of savings deposit from the public in accordance with art. 11, para. 1 of Legislative Decree no. \n385/1993 of 1 September 1993 - Consolidated Law on Banking (Testo Unico Bancario, or TUB) - and all related and conse-\nquent activities;\n \nz the collection of savings through postal securities and deposits;\n \nz payment services, including the issuance, administration and sale of prepaid cards and other payment instruments pursuant \nto art. 1, para. 2, letter f) numbers 4) and 5), TUB;\n \nz foreign currency exchange services;\n \nz promotion and arrangement of loans issued by approved banks and financial brokers;\n \nz investment and related services pursuant to art. 12, Presidential Decree 144/2001;\n \nz debt collection services;\n \nz professional gold trading, on own behalf or on behalf of third parties, in accordance with the requirements of Law 7 of 17 \nJanuary 2000.\nAll of the assets and rights arising out of various contracts, agreements and legal transactions related to the above activities have \nalso been conferred on BancoPosta RFC.\nFollowing the receipt of clearance from the Bank of Italy, the Shareholders’ Meeting of Poste Italiane held on 29 May 2018 \napproved the proposed removal of the assets, liabilities and contractual rights attributable to the card payments and payment \nservices business unit from the ring-fence that applies to BancoPosta RFC. On 1 October 2018, this business unit was trans-\nferred to the subsidiary PostePay SpA, in assets earmarked for card payments and payment services, in order to enable the \n183.

In addition, in order to complete the process of centralising e-money \non the above-mentioned EMI, on 28 May 2021, Poste Italiane’s Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting, after obtaining all the \nauthorisations required by law, approved the removal of the restriction on the allocation of BancoPosta RFC, assets and legal \nrelations constituting the so-called “Debit Branch”, with the deed of contribution in favour of Postepay SpA taking effect from 1 \nOctober 2021.\nBancoPosta RFC’s operations\nBancoPosta RFC’s operations consist of the investment of cash held in postal current accounts, in the name of BancoPosta but \nsubject to statutory restrictions, and the management of third parties’ collections and remittances. This latter activity includes the \ncollection of postal savings (Postal Savings Books and Interest-bearing Postal Certificates), carried out on behalf of Cassa Depositi e \nPrestiti and the MEF, and services delegated by Public Administration entities. These transactions involve the use of cash advances \nfrom the Italian Treasury and the recognition of financial items awaiting settlement. The specific agreement with the MEF requires \nBancoPosta to provide daily statements of all cash flows, with a delay of two bank working days with respect to the transaction date.\nIn compliance with the 2007 Budget Law, from 2007 the Company is required to invest the funds raised from deposits paid into \npostal current accounts by private customers in Eurozone government securities185. Funds deposited by Public Administration \nentities are, instead, deposited with the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and earn a variable rate of return linked to a basket of \ngovernment securities, in accordance with a specific agreement with the MEF regarding treasury services, expired on 31 December \n2022 and being renewed. In addition, under the agreement with the MEF, expired on 31 December 2022 and being renewed, a \npercentage of the funds deriving from private customer deposits may be placed in a special “Buffer” account at the MEF, with the \nobjective of ensuring flexibility with regard to investments in view of daily movements in amounts payable to current account holders. \nThese loans bear interest from 1 January 2022186 at a variable rate equal to the Euro Short Term Rate (ESTR)187.\nCost and revenue allocation and measurement of \noperations contracted out by BancoPosta RFC\nGiven the fact that Poste Italiane is a single legal entity, the Company’s general accounting system maintains its uniform charac-\nteristics and capabilities. In this context, the general principles governing administrative and accounting aspects of BancoPosta \nRFC are as follows:\n \nz Identification of transactions in Poste Italiane SpA’s general ledgers relating to BancoPosta’s ring-fenced operations which are \nthen extracted for recording in BancoPosta’s separate ledgers.\n \nz Allocation to BancoPosta RFC of all relevant revenue and costs; in particular the services rendered by the different functions \nof Poste Italiane SpA to BancoPosta RFC, are exclusively recorded as payables in BancoPosta’s separate books, in special \nintersegment accounts only, and subsequently settled.\n \nz Settlement of all incoming and outgoing third party payments by Poste Italiane SpA’s Chief Financial Office.\n \nz Allocation of income taxes based on BancoPosta RFC’s separate report after adjusting for deferred taxation.\n \nz Reconciliation of BancoPosta’s separate books to Poste Italiane’s general ledger.\n184. \u0007The business unit consists of assets and contractual rights linked to:\nOwn products: prepaid cards (card payments), payment services, acquiring services, tax payments using forms F23/F24 and international money transfers (Moneygram) \nforming part of the operations carried out independently by the EMI. In particular, these products are issued by the EMI, which is responsible for their conception, development \nand management, whilst BancoPosta RFC acts as distributor of the products through the Group’s physical distribution network. \nProducts handled under Service Contracts: payment products and services and money transfers carried out exclusively within the scope of BancoPosta RFC’s operations, as \nthey are “reserved to” the ring-fence by Presidential Decree 144/01. In particular, with the aim of leveraging the infrastructure of the hybrid EMI, BancoPosta has outsourced \noperations relating to payment products and services issued by BancoPosta, and distributed by BancoPosta through Poste Italiane’s physical network, to the EMI under an \noutsourcing agreement between BancoPosta and the EMI.\n185. \u0007Moreover, following the amendment of art. 1, paragraph 1097 of Law 296 of 27 December 2006, introduced by art. 1, paragraph 285 of the 2015 Stability Law (Law 190 of 23 \nDecember 2014), it became possible for BancoPosta RFC to invest up to 50% of its deposits in securities guaranteed by the Italian government. Lastly, with the conversion \ninto Law no. 106 of 23 July 2021 of Law Decree no. 73 of 25 May 2021, BancoPosta RFC is allowed, as part of the 50% of its funding from private customers that can be \ninvested in securities guaranteed by the Italian State, to use up to 30% of this portion to purchase transferable tax credits pursuant to Law Decree no. 34/2020 (the so-called \n“”Decreto Rilancio” “) or other transferable tax credits pursuant to current legislation.\n186. \u0007Until 31 December 2021, these deposits are remunerated at a variable rate calculated on the basis of the Euro OverNight Index Average (EONIA), the rate applied in overnight \nlending and calculated as the weighted average of overnight rates for transactions on the interbank market reported to ECB by a panel of banks operating in the euro zone \n(the biggest banks in all the euro zone countries).\n187. \u0007Rate calculated and published by the ECB using a new methodology consistent with ECB Regulation (EU) no. 1333/2014 of 26 November 2014 and based on uncollateralised \nfixed-rate overnight deposit facility transactions exceeding €1 million.\nSection\nSummary"

The transfer prices set out in the Operating Guidelines are determined according to objective \ncriteria that reflect the real contribution of the various functions to BancoPosta RFC’s results. The transfer prices paid, inclusive \nof commissions and any other form of remuneration due, are determined on the basis of market prices and tariffs for the same \nor similar services, identified, where possible, following a benchmarking process. When the specifics and/or the particular nature \nof a service provided by one of the Issuer’s functions do not allow the use of a comparable market price, a cost-based method \nis used, again with the support of benchmarking to ensure that the price charged is adequate for the service provided.

Poste Italiane SpA Financial Statements at 31 December 2022\n637\n \nz Purchase on 24 February 2022 of 100% of the share capital of Poste Welfare Servizi Srl from Poste Vita SpA for a total of €70 \nmillion. The transaction, carried out in compliance with the provisions of the Assirevi Preliminary IFRS Guidelines - OPI no. \n1 “Accounting Treatment of Business Combinations under Common Control in the Financial Statements and Consolidated \nFinancial Statements”193, provided for the recognition of the investment in Poste Welfare Servizi Srl at historical cost (€21 \nmillion) and the consequent increase in the investment in Poste Vita SpA (€49 million) for the difference between the consid-\neration paid and the carrying amount of the investment acquired;\n \nz Capital contribution, on 14 April 2022, in favour of Poste Welfare Servizi Srl of a total of €55 million for the purpose of providing \nthe company with the financial resources necessary for the acquisition of Plurima SpA194; \n \nz Subscription, on 9 September 2022, of the paid capital increase of PostePay SpA for a total of €700 million aimed at pro-\nviding the company with the financial resources necessary to complete the acquisition of LIS Holding SpA, completed on 14 \nSeptember 2022;\n \nz Merger by incorporation of the subsidiary PSIA Srl into Poste Italiane SpA, approved by Poste Italiane’s Board of Directors and \nthe Shareholders’ Meeting of PSIA on 24 June 2022. The transaction, effective from 1 November 2022, was accounted for at \nhistorical cost, generated a merger surplus of €330 million, and is recognised in the appropriate equity reserve;\n \nz Adhesion, on 28 October 2022, by Poste Italiane SpA to the voluntary takeover bid for the shares and warrants issued by \nSourcesense SpA with a total investment of €30 million. The consideration due to the holders of the shares and warrants, \namounting to €4.20 per share and €0.78 per warrant, respectively, was paid against the simultaneous transfer to Poste Italiane \nof the right of ownership over these shares and warrants. On 29 December 2022, following the exercise of convertible war-\nrants by the other shareholders, Poste Italiane SpA’s stake in Sourcesense SpA increased from 70.75% to 70%.\nFinally, on 29 September 2022, the IT business unit of BancoPosta Fondi SpA SGR was transferred to Poste Italiane SpA, effec-\ntive as of 1 October 2022.\nFurther details of the main corporate actions during 2022, are provided in Note 3.1 – Principal corporate actions.\nThe impairment tests required by the related accounting standards have been conducted in order to identify any evidence of \nimpairment. Based on the available information and the impairment test results195, there was no need to adjust the carrying \namount of the investments.\nIn particular, with regard to the controlling equity investments operating in the Mail, Parcels and Distribution business segment, \nthe individual equity investments, although relevant as individual assets from an accounting point of view, do not have autono-\nmous capacity to generate and manage cash flows, in consideration of the Group’s organisational model. Therefore, these con-\ntrolling equity investments do not assume individual relevance for the purposes of carrying out the impairment tests in the sepa-\nrate financial statements, but are aggregated (together with the operating activities carried out directly by the Parent Company) \nin a single CGU; this approach is linked to the organisational model used by the Group, so that given the inability of the individual \nequity investments to generate independent cash flows with respect to the other equity investments, it would be impossible to \ncalculate their individual recoverable value, according to the provisions of IAS 36.\n193. \u0007According to the ASSIREVI document, in the case of transactions involving the purchase of a controlling interest from another entity under common control for cash \nconsideration, if the transaction is not carried out at arm’s length, any difference between the carrying amount of the business acquired and the transaction consideration \nconstitutes a shareholder transaction. (section 1.1 - Acquisition and Transfer of Business Units).\n194. \u0007With the finalisation of the transaction, Poste Welfare Servizi Srl holds 70% of the share capital of Plurima Bidco Srl, a company engaged in the holding and management of \nshareholdings, which was specifically set up to acquire 100% of the share capital of Plurima SpA. \n195. \u0007The method applied and the criteria used in conducting impairment tests at 31 December 2022, are described in Note 2.4 – Use of estimates, with regard to the impairment \ntesting of goodwill, cash generating units and investments. \nSection\nSummary"

Financial assets and liabilities \nrelating to repurchase agreements managed through the CC&G that meet the requirements of IAS 32 are offset. The effect of \nnetting at 31 December 2022, already included in the exposure to net balances, amounted to €3,217 million (€1,577 million at \n31 December 2021). At 31 December 2022, the fair value196 of said item was €1,358 million. \nReceivables include:\n \nz Deposits with the MEF, for €11,907 million, including public customers’ postal current account deposits, which earn a \nvariable rate of return, calculated on a basket of government bonds197. The deposit has been adjusted to reflect accumulated \nimpairments of approximately €5 million, to reflect the risk of counterparty default (unchanged compared to 31 December \n2021). During the 2022 financial year, hedging (management) derivative contracts were concluded on the 10-year index-linked \nremuneration component. The hedging transaction was carried out through forward purchases of the 10-year BTP with set-\ntlement of the differential between the pre-set price of the security and its market value. \n \nz Other financial receivables, relating for (i) €2,457 million to collateral deposits - of which €1,447 million for sums paid \nto counterparties for repo transactions on fixed-income securities (collateral under specific Global Master Repurchase \nAgreements), €978 million for sums paid to CC&G of which €613 million for outstanding repo transactions and €365 million \nas a pre-funded contribution to the Default Fund198, €31 million for amounts paid to counterparties for interest rate swap \ntransactions (collateral provided for in specific Credit Support Annexes) and (ii) €80 million in receivables due from the sub-\nsidiary PostePay SpA for amounts mainly debited in early 2023. The year-on-year decrease in guarantee deposits is due to \nthe upward shift in the interest rate curve, which mainly generated a decrease in amounts paid to counterparties with which \ninterest rate swap transactions are in place as a result of the positive change in the fair value of hedging derivatives, partially \noffset by the increase in amounts paid to counterparties with which repo transactions are in place as a result of the negative \nchange in the fair value of collateral securities.\n196. In terms of fair value hierarchy, which reflects the relevance of the sources used to measure assets, this amount qualifies for Level 2.\n197. \u0007The variable rate in question is calculated as follows: 40% is based on the average return on 6-month BOTs recognised monthly and the remaining 60% is based on the \naverage ten-year BTP return recognised monthly.  \n198. \u0007A guarantee fund established with payments from participants in the derivative, equity and bond markets, as a further guarantee for the transactions carried out.

Payment of this amount consists of six instalments of €6.9 million each, falling due between 30 June 2012 and 31 \nDecember 2014; negotiations are in progress with the debtor for their recovery.\n \nz Amounts that cannot be drawn on due to court rulings include €59 million in amounts seized and not assigned to \ncreditors in the process of recovery, and €12 million in amounts stolen from the Company in December 2007 as a result of \nan attempted fraud and that have remained on deposit with an overseas bank.

For the recovery of said receivable, \ntwo disputes were brought before the Provincial Tax Tribunal of Rome, which upheld Poste Italiane’s appeals, ordering the \nAgenzia delle Entrate in Rome to refund the amounts claimed. The Agenzia delle Entrate have appealed both judgments \nbefore the Regional Tax Tribunal and, on 23 March 2018, the Tribunal upheld the Agenzia delle Entrate ‘s appeal against one \nof the judgments (proceedings pursuant to Law Decree no. 201/2011).

In the last quarter of 2019, the Court of Cassation had the opportunity to rule on other pro-\nceedings concerning the operation of the reimbursement pursuant to Law Decree no. 201/11; with respect to the judgement \nissued, there is a homogeneity of legal-formal circumstances that lead to the conclusion that the principle of law, referred to in \nthe aforementioned judgement of the Court of legitimacy, can also have its effects in existing judgements. Also the judgement \nconcerning Law Decree no. 185/2008, is currently pending before the Supreme Court of Cassation following Poste Italiane’s \nchallenge, on 23 January 2023, of the Lazio Regional Tax Tribunal’s judgment in favour of the Agenzia delle Entrate.

Poste Italiane SpA Financial Statements at 31 December 2022\n655\nThe item Other changes includes the positive effects, amounting to €130 million, recognised on 1 October 2022 as an increase \nin equity, following the reclassification of tax credits to the amortised cost category, partially offset by the derecognition of certain \nmaturing credits not offset during the year. \nAt 31 December 2022, the fair value208 of tax credits at amortised cost is €8,172 million. At that date, the fair value of only the tax \ncredits subject to reclassification was €2,425 million; the overall change in fair value recognised during the year, of €14 million, \nwould have been recognised in equity in the absence of the reclassification.\nAs part of the actions aimed at combating tax fraud perpetrated through the monetisation of tax credits, starting from the end of \nthe 2021 financial year, a number of Public Prosecutors’ Offices have implemented preventive seizures that, in some cases also \ninvolved tax credits acquired by Poste Italiane (some of which were subsequently released from seizure in the course of 2022) for \na nominal value of the credits of approximately €410 million, against a value paid to customers that was lower and corresponding \nto a carrying amount of approximately €334 million at 31 December 2022, including interest capitalised for the recognition at \namortised cost of the credits in question. \nIn a regulatory context that is constantly evolving, and taking into account the position taken by the case law209, starting in the \nsecond half of the 2022 financial year, on the unusability of tax credits due to conduct unrelated to the transferee and the inter-\npretations of the Agenzia delle Entrate, a legal and accounting analysis was conducted to comprehensively assess the potential \nrisks to which Poste Italiane could be exposed if the tax credits acquired over time by the same were to derive from fraudulent \nconduct. In particular, in order to determine the accounting impact related to this potential risk, reference was made to the pro-\nvisions of IAS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities (as better illustrated in the section Use of estimates), \nas the possible non-recovery of the carrying amount of the tax credits would not derive from a characteristic of the asset being \nmeasured or from significant increases in the credit risk after the initial recognition of the asset or, more simply, from the ascer-\ntained default of the debtor, as envisaged by the impairment model set forth in IFRS 9, but rather from the possibility that, for \nwhat will be ascertained cases of fraud, the liability of the assignee - even if a third party in good faith or an offended party to the \ncrime - will also be called to account for assumptions other than the possible irregular use of the tax credit or for a use in excess \nof the tax credit received. As a result of the in-depth investigations conducted on the tax credits acquired, also with the support \nof external legal, tax and accounting consultants, a total provision for these risks of €320 million was recognised under the liability \nitem “Provisions for risks and charges”.  \nIt should be noted that the determination of the above-mentioned provision necessarily required the application of a significant \ndegree of professional judgement, the main elements of uncertainty of which relate to the outcome of the proceedings under \nway, the identification of the receivables whose deductions have been assigned are effectively non-existent, and the outcome of \nthe initiatives that will be activated by Poste Italiane to recover the amounts paid to the entities in respect of which cases of fraud \nhave been ascertained.\nA11 – Cash and deposits attributable to BancoPosta (€5,848 million)\nThis item breaks down as follows:\ntab.

In terms of fair value hierarchy, which reflects the relevance of the sources used to measure assets, this amount qualifies for Level 3.\n209. \u0007The Court of Cassation, through a number of rulings made in the course of 2022, confirmed the reconstruction postulated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, recognising the \nlegitimacy of the seizure orders due to the non-existence of the claims subject to the precautionary measure.\nSection\nSummary"

In \n2022, the decreases in fair value totalled €4,608 million, reflecting:\n\t– a net decrease of €4,405 million in financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and \nattributable to BancoPosta RFC;\n\t– a net decrease of €81 million in financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income held \noutside the ring-fence;\n\t– for €122 million the net decrease in tax credits pursuant to Law no. 77/2020 measured at fair value through other \ncomprehensive income. On 1 October 2022, the negative fair value reserve totalling €130 million (€93 million net of tax \neffect) was cancelled as a result of the reclassification of the receivables into the amortised cost tax credit category, as \nbetter described in Note A10 - Tax Credits Law no. 77/2020.\nIn addition, during the year, as better described in the preceding paragraphs, following the merger by incorporation of PSIA \nSrl, Poste Italiane directly held an equity investment in NEXI SpA, whose fair value reserve, accrued from 1 January to the \nmerger date, was negative €240 million. \n \nz The cash flow hedge reserve represents changes in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedges outstanding. \nIn 2022, the fair value gain of €279 million reflects a net gain of €280 million on derivative financial instruments attributable to \nBancoPosta RFC and a net loss of €1 million on the value of financial instruments held outside the ring-fence.\n \nz The Incentive Plans reserve includes the estimate of the valuations for the year relating to the long-term “Performance \nShare LTIP” incentive plans and the MBO short-term incentive plans, carried out on the basis of the provisions of IFRS 2.\n \nz The Merger Surplus/Deficit Reserve, which increased compared to 31 December 2021, refers for €330 million to the \nmerger surplus generated following the merger by incorporation into Poste Italiane SpA of the subsidiary PSIA Srl described \nin Note A5 - Equity investments.\nB3 – Availability and distributability of reserves\nThe following table shows the availability and distributability of Poste Italiane SpA’s reserves. Retained earnings include the profit \nfor 2022 of €847 million.\nDuring the year, dividends were distributed for a total of €799 million, based on the following resolutions:\n \nz on 27 May 2022, the Shareholders’ Meeting resolved the distribution dividends of €526 million (dividend per share equal to \n€0.405), which took place on 22 June 2022 as the balance for 2021, taking into account the interim dividend of €241 million \n(dividend per share equal to €0.185) already paid in November 2021;\n \nz on 9 November 2022, Poste Italiane’s Board of Directors, in line with the Group’s dividend policy, resolved to advance part of \nthe ordinary dividend for 2022 as an interim dividend. The interim dividend of €273 million was distributed on 23 November \n2022 (dividend per share of €0.210). \n211. \u0007The main features of the issue are:\n– \u0007The bonds have no fixed maturity and must be redeemed only in the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, as specified in the relevant terms and conditions, \nsubject to the right of early redemption (call) in the cases provided for. Specifically, the call is scheduled to occur at any time from the First Call Date of 24 March 2029 \nthrough 24 June 2029 and on each interest payment date thereafter.\n– \u0007The fixed annual coupon is 2.625% until the first Reset Date set for 24 June 2029. From that date, the annual interest is determined on the basis of the 5-year Euro Mid \nSwap rate, plus an initial spread of 267.7 basis points, increased by a further 25 basis points from 24 June 2034 and by a further 75 basis points from 24 June 2049. \nInterest is payable at the option of the issuer and on a cumulative basis, commencing 24 June 2022.

The Resolution provided for a gradual increase \nin basic tariffs as of 1 September 2022, with no impact on the subsidised tariffs paid by senders and with a consequent increase \nin the compensation received by the Company per item sent at the subsidised tariff.

Risk Management\nIntroduction\nThe note on “Risk management” is common to both the Poste Italiane Group and Poste Italiane SpA and deals with both financial \nrisk (as defined by IFRS 7) and other types of risk that the Group deems it appropriate or necessary to disclose, and also the \nprovisions of the Public Statement ESMA 32-63-1320 published on 28 October 2022. \nQuantitative disclosures for Poste Italiane SpA alone are provided in the specific section of this note, unless otherwise indicated.\nFinancial Risks\nInformation on financial risk management at 31 December 2022 is provided below, in accordance with the requirements of the \ninternational financial reporting standard, IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures.\nResponsibility for coordinating and managing investment and hedging strategies related to BancoPosta RFC and Poste Italiane \nhas been assigned to BancoPosta Fondi SpA SGR.\nPoste Italiane SpA financial activities, related to treasury management, medium-term funding transactions, including capital \nmarket transactions, and extraordinary and subsidised finance are the responsibility of the Parent Company’s Administration, \nFinance and Control function. \nManagement of the Group’s financial transactions and of the associated risks relates mainly to the operations of Poste Italiane \nSpA and the Poste Vita insurance group.\n \nz Poste Italiane SpA’s financial transactions primarily relate to BancoPosta’s operations, asset financing and liquidity investment. \nBancoPosta RFC’s operations consist in the active management of liquidity generated by postal current account deposits, \ncarried out in the name of BancoPosta but subject to statutory restrictions, and collections and payments on behalf of third \nparties. The funds raised by private customers on postal current accounts must be used in euro area government securities \nand, for a portion not exceeding 50% of the funds raised, in other securities backed by the Italian government guarantee220, \nwhilst deposits by Public Administration entities are deposited with the MEF. Moreover, within the 50% of deposits from private \ncustomers that can be invested in Italian government-guaranteed securities, BancoPosta RFC may use up to a maximum \nof 30% of that portion to purchase tax credits transferable pursuant to Law Decree no. 34/2020 (the so-called ”Decreto \nRilancio”) and subsequent amendments and additions, or other tax credits transferable pursuant to current legislation221. \nThe investment profile is based on the constant monitoring of habits of current account holders and the use of a statistical/\neconometric model that forecasts the interest rates and maturities typical of postal current accounts. Accordingly, the portfolio \ncomposition aims to replicate the financial structure of current accounts by private customers. Management of the relationship \nbetween the structure of deposits and investments is handled through an appropriate Asset & Liability Management system. \nThe above-mentioned model is thus the general reference for the investments, in order to limit exposure to interest rate risk \nand liquidity risks. The prudential requirements introduced by the third revision of the Bank of Italy Circular 285/2013 require \nBancoPosta to apply the same regulations applicable to banks in terms of its controls, establishing that its operations are \nto be conducted in accordance with the Consolidated Law on Banking (TUB) and the Consolidated Law on Finance (TUF). \nBancoPosta RFC is, therefore, required to establish a system of internal controls in line with the provisions of Circular 285222, \n220. As provided for by Law no. 296 of 27 December 2006 and subsequent amendments provided for by the 2015 Stability Law, no. 190 of 23 December 2014.\n221. As provided for in Law no. 106 of 23 July 2021 of Law Decree no. 73 of 25 May 2021.\n222. See in particular the provisions laid down in Part I – Section IV – Chapter 3.\nSummary\nSection"

Risk Management\n703\nwhich, among other things, requires definition of a Risk Appetite Framework (RAF223), the containment of risks within the limits \nset by the RAF, protection of the value of assets and against losses, and identification of material transactions to be subject \nto prior examination by the risk control function.\nBancoPosta’s capital structure, which is subject to the prudential provisions introduced with the 3rd update of Bank of Italy \nCircular 285/2013, is particularly solid due to its CET1 ratio, which stood at 20.3% at 31 December 2022. With reference to \nthe Leverage Ratio, the latter had a value, again at year-end, of 2.9%; the evolution of the indicator compared to 31 December \n2021 was mainly affected by the loss of the benefits of the sterilisation of the items “Cash and deposits with the central bank”, \napplied until the first quarter of 2022 due to the Covid emergency.\nBy contrast, operations not covered by BancoPosta RFC, primarily relating to management of the Parent Company’s own \nliquidity, are carried out in accordance with investment guidelines, which require the Company to invest in instruments such as \ngovernment securities, high-quality corporate or bank bonds, term bank deposits and tax credits. Liquidity is also deposited \nin postal current accounts, subject to the same requirements applied to the investment of deposits by private current account \nholders.\n \nz Financial instruments held by the insurance company, Poste Vita SpA, primarily relate to investments designed to cover its \ncontractual obligations to policyholders on traditional life policies and unit-linked policies. Other investments in financial instru-\nments regard investment of the insurance company’s free capital.\nTraditional Life policies, classified under Class I and V, primarily include products whose benefits are revaluated based on the \nreturn generated through the management of pools of financial assets, which are separately identifiable in accounting terms \nonly, within the company’s assets (so-called separately managed accounts). In the case of policies sold in previous years, \nthe Company has guaranteed a minimum return payable at maturity on such products (at 31 December 2022, this minimum \nreturn at maturity on existing policies ranged between 0% and 2.1%). Gains and losses resulting from measurement are \nattributed in full to policyholders and accounted for in specific technical provisions under the shadow accounting method. \nThe calculation technique used by the Group in applying this method is based on the prospective yield on each separately \nmanaged account, considering a hypothetical realisation of unrealised gains and losses over a period of time that matches \nthe assets and liabilities held in the portfolio (see note 2.3 in relation to “Insurance contracts”). \nThe impact of financial risk on investment performance can be absorbed in full or in part by the insurance provisions. In par-\nticular, this absorption is generally based on the level and structure of guarantees of minimum returns and the profit-sharing \nmechanisms of Separately Managed Accounts for the policyholder. The company determines the sustainability of minimum \nreturns through periodic analyses using an internal financial-actuarial (Asset-Liability Management) model which simulates, \nfor each separate portfolio, the change in value of the financial assets and the expected returns under a “central scenario” \n(based on current financial and commercial assumptions) and under stress and other scenarios based on different sets of \nassumptions. This model makes it possible to manage the risks assumed by Poste Vita SpA on a quantitative basis, thereby \nfostering reduced earnings volatility and optimal allocation of financial resources. \nUnit-linked products, relating to Class III insurance products, regard policies where the premium is invested in mutual invest-\nment funds. The Company constantly monitors the evolution of the risk profile of individual products.\nPoste Assicura SpA’s investment policies are designed to preserve the Company’s financial strength, as outlined in the \nframework resolution approved by the Board of Directors of Poste Vita SpA on 5 December 2022. Regular analyses of the \nmacroeconomic context and market trends for the different asset classes, with the relevant effects on asset-liability manage-\nment, are conducted. For the P&C business, the focus is on the management of liquidity in order to meet claims.\nWithin the above context, balanced financial management and monitoring of the main risk/return profiles are carried out and \nensured by dedicated organisational structures that operate separately and independently. In addition, specific processes are in \nplace governing the assumption and management of and control over financial risks, including the progressive introduction of \nappropriate information systems.\nIn this regard, on 16 February 2021, Poste Italiane SpA’s Board of Directors adopted a revised version of the Guidelines for \nInternal Control and Risk Management System (SCIGR), which contains integrated guidelines for Poste Italiane SpA’s Internal \nControl and Risk Management System.\nFrom an organisational viewpoint, the model consists of: \n \nz the Control and Risk Committee, established in 2015 within the Board, has the task of supporting, through an appropriate \ninvestigative, proposal-making and advisory activity, the evaluations and decisions of the Board of Directors on the internal \ncontrol and risk management system and on the approval of the relative periodic financial and non-financial reports;\n223. \u0007The RAF consists of a framework that defines, in keeping with the maximum acceptable risk, the business model and strategic plan, the risk appetite, risk tolerance \nthresholds, risk limits, and risk management policies, together with the processes needed to define and implement them.\nSection\nSummary"

They relate to a portion of investments invested in fixed-income \nsecurities totalling €2,285 million, of which €3 million related to Poste Assicura, and to the position in Other investments consist-\ning of alternative fund units for €1,982 million and the remaining €21 million from the bond issued by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti as \na private placement.\nWithin the context of derivative financial instruments, the risk in question primarily concerns:\n \nz forward sales of government bonds with a nominal value of €1,099 million, and forward purchase contracts for a nominal value \nof €3,433 million, classified as cash flow hedges, entered into by BancoPosta RFC;\n \nz a derivative contract entered into by the Parent Company to protect cash flows relating to the variable-rate bond for a nominal \nvalue of €50 million.\nAt 31 December 2022, with reference to the interest rate risk exposure determined by the average duration224, the duration of \nBancoPosta’s overall investments went from 5.39 to 5.01. On the other hand, with respect to Class I and Class V policies sold \nby Poste Vita SpA, the duration of the matching assets went from 7.34 at 31 December 2021 to 6.95 at 31 December 2022, \nwhilst the duration of the liabilities went from 9.42 to 7.50 (assessment of the duration was carried out using the new Coherent \nDuration method225). The financial instruments intended to cover the technical provisions for Class III policies have maturities that \nmatch those of the liabilities.\nSpread risk\nThis is the risk of a potential fall in the value of bonds held, following deterioration in the creditworthiness of issuers. This is due to \nthe importance that the impact of the spread of returns on government securities had on the fair value of euro zone government \nand corporate securities, reflecting the market’s perception of the credit rating of issuers.\nThe value of the portfolio of bonds issued or guaranteed by the Italian government is much more sensitive to the credit risk \nassociated with the Italian Republic than to changes in so-called risk-free interest rates. This is due to the fact that changes in \ncredit spreads are not hedged and regard the entire securities portfolio, meaning both the fixed and variable-rate components. In \nthis latter case, in fact, fair value derivatives, used to convert variable-rate instruments, hedge only the risk-free interest rate risk \nand not credit risk. This means that a change in the credit spread has an equal impact on both fixed and variable instruments. \nThe 2022 financial year was characterised by an increase in yields on Italian government bonds (the 10-year BTP fell from 1.17% \nto 4.72%), which brought the BTP-Bund spread to 214 basis points compared to 135 last year. These movements led to a \nreduction in the price of securities.\nThe performance of the Group’s portfolio in the period under review is as follows: \ni.\t the portfolio of Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income held by Poste Italiane SpA (notional amount \nof approximately €37 billion) has undergone an overall net decrease in fair value of approximately €10 billion: this change was \npartly recognised in profit or loss for an amount of approximately €6 billion relating to the change in the fair value of securities \nhedged against interest rate risk, whilst the change in the fair value of unhedged securities and the spread risk component \n(not hedged) was reflected in consolidated equity for approximately €4 billion;\n224. Duration is the indicator used to estimate the percentage change in price in response to a shift in market returns.\n225. \u0007The Coherent Duration of assets and liabilities is defined as changes in the value of assets and liabilities, in proportion to the total amount of assets exposed to interest rate \nrisk, following parallel shocks raising and lowering interest rates by 10 basis points.\nSummary\nSection"

Below, the methods adopted to manage credit risk are described.\nGeneral description of the models utilised \nThe Group uses the general impairment model in accordance with risk ratings estimated on the basis of the type of counterparty:\n \nz Securities/deposits with Sovereign, Banking and Corporate counterparties: internal models for estimating risk parameters;\n \nz Public Administration and Central Counterparties: risk ratings deriving from agency ratings or average default rates for the \nsector.\nThe simplified approach is applied to trade receivables, as described in greater detail later.\nSignificant increase in credit risk\nBased on the impairment model adopted by the Poste Italiane Group to meet the requirements of the accounting standard, any \nsignificant increase in credit risk associated with the financial instruments held, other than trade receivables, is determined on the \nbasis of a change in the relevant credit rating between the time of the initial investment and the reporting date. \nThis change in notches is compared with a threshold that takes into account the following factors:\n \nz the rating of the financial instrument at the time of investment;\n \nz the rating of the financial instrument at the reporting date;\n \nz the seniority of the position within the portfolio (vintage factor);\n \nz an additive factor to mitigate the non-linearity of PD with respect to the rating classes227;\n \nz a judgemental factor to be used only in the presence of sudden changes in the creditworthiness not yet reflected by the \nrating228.\nThe ratings used in stage allocation derive from internal models in the case of banking, sovereign and corporate counterparties, \nand external info providers in the case of Public Administration and Central Counterparties. Based on the above information, the \nPoste Italiane Group rebuts the presumption that there have been significant increases in credit risk following initial recognition, \nwhen financial assets are more than 30 days past due.\n227. The additive factor is built in view of the rating level at the reporting date, where the better the final rating the higher the threshold for the transition to Stage 2.\n228. \u0007The judgemental factor can summarise significant aspects in determining the significant increase of credit risk, considering such elements as:\n•\t\nan actual or expected significant change of the internal/external credit rating of the financial instrument;\n•\t\nactual or expected negative changes in economic, financial or business conditions that might cause a significant change in the borrower’s ability to honour its obligations, \nsuch as an actual or expected increase in interest rates or an actual or expected significant increase in the unemployment rate.\nSummary\nSection"

Risk Management\n713\nThe Poste Italiane Group decided not to adopt the Low Credit Risk Exemption and to proceed instead with stage allocation of \nthe financial instruments concerned.\nRegarding trade receivables, given the adoption of the simplified approach under the new accounting standard, expected credit \nlosses are determined throughout the lifetime of the instrument.\nDefinition of default\nThe Poste Italiane Group defines default on the basis of ad hoc assessments that take into account:\n \nz any payment delays;\n \nz market information such as a default rating by the rating agencies;\n \nz internal analyses of specific exposures.\nCollective and individual provisions\nThe collective impairment of a homogenous group of financial assets defines the expected credit loss (ECL) of the instrument, \neven though it cannot be associated with a specific exposure. Grouping takes place in relation to the type of counterparty on the \nbasis of the estimated PD.\nIndividual provisions are considered only following the review of trade receivables for amounts in excess of a given threshold and \nonly in relation to single receivables.\nForward looking information\nAccording to the standard, the ECL calculation must also factor in forward looking components based on broad consensus \nscenarios.\nThe Poste Italiane Group incorporates forward looking information directly in the PD estimation. In particular, for sovereign \ncounterparties, for which authoritative forward-looking estimates are available, these values are used to calculate PD; for other \ncounterparties, on the other hand, the internal model adopted allows the input dataset needed to calculate PD to be completed \nfrom scenario values referring to some of the model variables. The objective of the approach is to estimate the unknown variables \nby using the historical correlation of the available information229. \nEstimation techniques used\nSince events of default cannot be used, as they are not very frequent, to develop credit scoring models for Sovereign, Banking \nand Corporate counterparties, a shadow rating approach has been adopted.\nThis method entails the use of target variables related to the level of external rating produced by the agencies. The target could \nbe directly the rating or, alternatively, the default rate linked to the rating level.\nA key rating agency was selected to construct the target, taking into account both the large number of rated counterparties and \nthe availability of historical data over what was deemed to be an adequate period of time.\nThe models have been constructed by extracting and utilising the following types of data for each country in the sample:\n \nz macroeconomic data; \n \nz market data: domestic equity indices, global energy/non-energy indices, Eurostoxx and S&P 500;\n \nz financial statement data. \n229.

In the development account was taken of specific indexation assumptions for every asset class (fixed income securities, \nvariable-rate securities, inflation-indexed securities, etc.);\n \nz TF: the effective interest rate of each exposure was used as discount factor.\nTrade receivables \nThe Group adopts the simplified approach to test for the impairment of trade receivables, on the basis of which provisions for \ncredit losses are determined for an amount equal to expected losses throughout the lifetime of the receivable. Such approach is \nimplemented through the following process:\n \nz based on total revenue or the historical credit exposure, all receivables or credit exposures exceeding a certain pre-estab-\nlished credit threshold are assessed analytically. The analytical evaluation of the exposures entails an analysis of the borrower’s \ncredit quality and solvency, as determined on the basis of internal and external supporting evidence;\n \nz for receivables falling below the threshold set, through the preparation of a matrix with the different impairment percentages \nestimated on the basis of historical losses, where they exist, or alternatively on the historical pattern of collections. In con-\nstructing the impairment matrix, receivables are grouped by homogeneous categories, based on their characteristics, to take \ninto account the historical loss experience.\nExposure to credit risk\nWith regard to the financial assets exposed to this risk and to which the accounting rules governing impairment apply, the \nfollowing table shows the Poste Italiane Group’s exposure at 31 December 2022, relating to financial assets measured at amor-\ntised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income, for which a general deterioration model was used.

Risk Management\n717\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group does not hold financial assets secured by guarantees or other risk mitigation instruments for \nwhich no loss provisions have been made (except for the temporary use of liquidity in repurchase agreements). \nThe main types of instrument used to mitigate credit risk are described below.\nFixed income instruments\nDebt instruments held by the Group and secured by guarantees or other risk mitigation instruments are as follows:\n \nz bonds issued by CDP SpA guaranteed by the Italian State and subscribed by BancoPosta RFC, amounting to a nominal \nvalue of €3,000 million at 31 December 2022. These are recognised as financial assets measured at amortised cost and, in \ndetermining the associated expected credit losses, account was taken of the PD of the Italian Republic;\n \nz bonds held by the Poste Vita Group, amounting to a nominal value of €6,158 million at 31 December 2022. In these cases, \nthe guarantee covers 100% of the nominal value of the securities. The guarantees securing these financial instruments are \nas follows:\n\t– corporate bonds backed by personal guarantees provided the Parent Company or another associate, amounting to a \nnominal value of €5,364 million;  \n\t– covered bonds backed by mortgages, primarily property mortgages, amounting to a nominal value of €186 million;\n\t– bonds guaranteed by sovereign states, amounting to a nominal value of €608 million. \nIn the case of instruments backed by personal guarantees provided by a sovereign state or one or more companies, expected \nlosses are calculated on the basis of the credit rating of the guarantor. With regard to covered bonds, the underlying guarantees \nwere considered through the recognition of upgrades according to the type of guarantee.\nDerivative financial instruments and repurchase agreements\nIn order to limit the counterparty risk exposure, Poste Italiane SpA has concluded standard ISDA master agreements (with \nattached CSA) and GMRAs which govern the collateralization of derivative transactions and repurchase agreements, respectively. \nIn addition, in order to mitigate counterparty risk and gain easier access to the market, from December 2017, BancoPosta RFC \nhas entered into repurchase agreements with the Central Counterparty, the Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia. As of 2021, \ncertain derivatives entered into by BancoPosta RFC through bilateral contracts will be routed to a Qualified Central Counterparty \nfor centralised clearing through the services provided by a clearing broker.\nThe calculation of positions in derivatives and repurchase agreements and the related risk mitigation instruments are illustrated \nin the paragraph “Offsetting financial assets and liabilities”. \nTrade receivables \nTo mitigate the risks arising from the extension of credit terms to its customers, the Poste Italiane Group has implemented a \npolicy and suitable guidelines that govern the management of trade receivables, the terms and conditions of payment applicable \nto customers and defines the corporate process aimed at checking the customer’s creditworthiness, as well as the sustainability \nof the business risk inherent in the contract involving extended payment terms. \nDepending on the evaluations, the contracts entered into with customers may require a suitable guarantee. Guarantees are also \nrequested if they are required by rules and regulations and/or implementing rules of specific services. \nThe Poste Italiane Group accepts mainly guarantees issued by primary banks or insurance companies. Alternatively, upon \nrequest of the customer and after a risk analysis, it accepts sureties issued by other institutions or security deposits through the \nopening of a postal escrow account.\nThe Poste Italiane Group, as a rule, exempts the Public Administration from the provision of guarantees to secure trade receiv-\nables arising from transactions with it, save for the cases when such guarantees are mandatory by law or due to implementing \nrules of specific services. \nFor all the exposures evaluated individually, to calculate the provisions for doubtful debts, guarantees reduce the amount of the \nexposure at risk. \nSection\nSummary"

The potential risk derives from a mismatch between the maturities of investments in \nsecurities and those of liabilities, represented by current accounts where the funds are available on demand, thus compromising \nthe ability to meet its obligations to current account holders. This potential mismatch between assets and liabilities is monitored \n231. \u0007Since 1 October 2018, prepaid cards are the responsibility of PostePay SpA. The liquidity raised through these cards is transferred to BancoPosta, which invests the funds \nraised in euro area government bonds or bonds guaranteed by the Italian State.

This practice is normally adopted by BancoPosta. \nPrice risk\nThis is the risk that the value of a financial instrument fluctuates as a result of market price movements, deriving from factors \nspecific to the individual instrument or the issuer, and factors that influence all instruments traded on the market.\nPrice risk relates to financial assets classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) or \nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), and certain derivative financial instruments where changes in value are \nrecognised in profit or loss. \nThe sensitivity analysis at 31 December 2022 took into account positions potentially exposed to fluctuations in value. Financial \nstatement balances have been subjected to a stress test, based on actual volatility during the year, considered to be representa-\ntive of potential market movements. The results of the sensitivity analysis carried out at 31 December 2022 for the Poste Italiane \nGroup are shown in the following table.\nSummary\nSection"

      "text": "Annual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n742\nOther risks\nThe other principal risks to which the Poste Italiane Group is exposed at 31 December 2022 are described below. \nOperational risk\nOperational risk refers to the risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from \nexternal events. This category of risk includes losses resulting from fraud, human error, business disruption, systems failures, \nbreach of contracts and natural disasters. Operational risk includes legal risk.\nTo protect against this form of risk, BancoPosta RFC has formalised a methodological and organisational framework to identify, \nmeasure and manage the operational risk related to its products/processes.\nThe framework, which is based on an integrated (qualitative and quantitative) measurement model, makes it possible to monitor \nand manage risk on an increasingly informed basis.\nIn 2022, activities continued to refine the operational risk management framework, with the aim of making the process of record-\ning operational losses, monitoring and reporting more efficient and mitigating such risks by cross-functional working groups. \nSupport has also been provided to the specialist units and the owner of the process of analysing and assessing IT risk, in keeping \nwith the approach adopted in 2021, and the monitoring of IT risk recovery plans was reinforced.\nThe activities carried out in 2022 also included assessments of the risk profile related to the assignment and outsourcing of BP \nRFC, the definition of the model for monitoring outsourcing risk, and ex-ante assessments of the risk profile related to the inno-\nvation of BP’s offering and/or specific project initiatives.\nAt 31 December 2022, the risk map prepared in accordance with the aforementioned framework shows the type of operational \nrisks BancoPosta RFC’s products are exposed to. In particular:\nEvent type\nNumber of types\nInternal fraud\n29\nExternal fraud\n40\nEmployee practices and workplace safety\n7\nCustomers, products and business practices\n36\nDamage caused by external events\n4\nBusiness disruption and system failure\n8\nExecution, delivery and process management\n98\nTotal at 31 December 2022\n222\nFor each type of mapped risk, the related sources of risk (internal losses, external losses, scenario analysis and risk indicators) \nhave been recorded and classified in order to construct complete inputs for the integrated measurement model. Systematic \nmeasurement of the mapped risks has enabled the prioritization of mitigation initiatives and the attribution of responsibilities in \norder to contain any future impact.\nPoste Vita SpA and Poste Assicura SpA have also drawn up and finalised their own framework for identifying, assessing and \nmanaging operational risks. The adopted approach reflects the specific nature of the processes and operational risk events \ntypical of an insurance company. The process of assessing operational risk exposure is carried out in keeping with the related \nsolvency requirements, and involves both qualitative and quantitative analysis, conducted through a structured process for iden-\ntifying internal losses and assessing potential risks in terms of frequency, impact and mitigation. The exposure to risks is, on the \nwhole, in line with the previous year, and the main types of operating losses are related to customer litigation expenses.\nSummary\nSection"

Risk Management\n743\nOther operational risks\nIn the exercise of its new energy business, PostePay is exposed to various risks, which are appropriately mitigated through \nphysical purchases of commodities at a fixed price or through physical purchases at a spot price with the addition of derivative \nfinancial instruments (Commodity Swaps/Futures) and through forecasting activities of sales volumes and pricing of these risks.\nInsurance risks\nInsurance risks derive from the stipulation of insurance contracts and the terms and conditions contained therein (technical \nbases adopted, premium calculation, terms and conditions of cash surrender, etc.). Mortality, longevity and redemption risks are \nrelevant here.\nIn technical terms, mortality is one of the main risk factors for Poste Vita SpA, i.e. any risk associated with the uncertainty of \na policyholder’s life expectancy. Particular attention is paid in selling pure life insurance policies, an area where procedures set \nunderwriting limits to the capital and the age of the policyholder. In terms of “pure life” insured amounts the Group’s insurance \ncompanies transfer their risks to reinsurers in keeping with the nature of the products sold and conservation levels adequate to \nthe companies’ capital structure. \nFor products with the capital sum subject to positive risk, such as term life insurance, this risk has negative consequences if the \nactual frequency of death exceeds the death probabilities realistically calculated (second order technical bases). \nFor products with the capital sum subject to negative risk, such as annuities, there are negative consequences when actual death \nfrequencies are lower than the death probabilities realistically calculated (longevity risk). \nNevertheless, at 31 December 2022, the mortality risk is limited for the Group, considering the features of the products offered. \nThe only area where this risk is somewhat significant is term life insurance. With reference to these products, a comparison is \nperiodically made between actual deaths and those predicted by the demographic bases adopted for pricing. Moreover, mor-\ntality risk is mitigated through reinsurance and by setting limits on both the capital and the age of the policyholder when policies \nare sold.\nLongevity risk is also low. In fact, for most life insurance products the probability of annuitisation is very close to zero, as historical \nexperience shows that policyholders never use the option to annuitise. Pension products, in particular, still account for a limited \nshare of insurance liabilities. In addition, for these products, the Group may, if certain conditions materialise, change the demo-\ngraphic base and the composition by sex used to calculate the annuity rates.\nPricing risk is the risk of incurring losses due to inadequate premiums charged for the insurance products sold. It may arise due to: \n \nz inappropriate selection of the technical basis; \n \nz incorrect assessment of the options embedded in the product;\n \nz incorrect evaluation of the factors used to calculate the expense loads.\nAs Poste Vita’s mixed and whole-life policies have mostly cash value build-up features, accumulating in accordance with a \ntechnical rate of zero, the technical basis adopted does not affect premium calculation (and/or the insured capital). In fact, there \nis nearly no pricing risk associated with the choice between technical bases in Poste Vita’s portfolio, except for the term life \ninsurance products discussed above. \nThe options embedded in the policies held in the portfolio include:\n \nz Surrender option;\n \nz Guaranteed minimum return option;\n \nz Annuity conversion option.\nFor nearly all the products in the portfolio there are no surrender penalties: the surrender risk only becomes significant, however, \nin the event of mass surrenders which, on the basis of historical evidence, have a low probability of occurrence (a surrender rate \nof approximately 3.1% in 2022). \nSection\nSummary"

This risk can \nbe divided into the following categories:\n\t– Pricing risk: the risk linked to the company’s pricing of its policies which depends on the assumptions used in order to \ncalculate premiums. If prices are based on inadequate assumptions, the insurer may be exposed to the risk of being \nunable to meet its contractual obligations to policyholders. These risks include those related to disability-morbidity, or \nthe risk associated with the payment of benefits or claims for illness and/or injury. Also included in this category is the \nrisk that the loadings applied to premiums are insufficient to support the actual expenses incurred in managing the \ncontract.\n\t– Provisioning risk: referring to the risk that technical provisions are not sufficient to meet obligations to policyholders. \nThis insufficiency may be due to incorrect estimates by the company and/or changes in the general environment.\n \nz Catastrophe risk: represents the risk of loss resulting from extreme or exceptional events, including major epidemics covered \nby insurance.\n \nz Early termination risks: risk linked to the possibility of the policyholder’s early termination of the contract with the consequent \nrequest for reimbursement of the premium.\nAs regards Poste Assicura SpA’s insurance business, the expected growth of the portfolio and the different degrees of risk asso-\nciated with the products distributed has required the company to adopt a highly prudent approach to reinsurance.\nThe reinsurance strategy, based mainly on a non-proportional approach, makes it possible to:\n \nz mitigate unfavourable technical trends and risks arising from peak exposures;\n \nz optimise reinsurance structures with a view to risk transfer and, if possible, also improve overall costs in economic and capital \nallocation terms;\n \nz make reinsurance structures more efficient from a management point of view;\n \nz mitigate risks, stabilising the variability of insurance business results.\nIn particular, reinsurance treaties with market operators of primary standing were entered into with non-proportional coverage in \nthe form of “excess loss” (per risk and per event), separately for the various classes, to cover all Poste Assicura’s risks (Retail and \nEmployee Benefits) such as: risks included in the accident, health, fire, general liability and other property damage classes, and \n“catastrophic risks” such as earthquake or pandemic. The treaties signed in the start-up phase of the company on a proportional \nbasis, on a risk attaching basis, for certain risks such as income protection insurance and credit protection remain in place in run-\noff. In addition, legal expenses risks are managed under a quota share treaty. Lastly, for all risks that do not meet the qualitative \nand quantitative criteria provided for in existing reinsurance treaties, but which however fall within Poste Assicura underwriting \nphilosophy, use is made of optional reinsurance. \nPoste Assicura defines, on a case-by-case basis, the share of risk and the reinsurance structure deemed most appropriate in \nrelation to the characteristics of the risk in question.\nWith reference to P&C risks, the Group performs specific analyses including, among other things, stress tests to determine the \nCompany’s solvency also under adverse market conditions. \nReputational risk\nThe main element of reputational risk to which the Group is, by its nature, exposed is linked to market performance and primarily \nassociated with the placement of postal savings products and investment products issued by third-party entities (bonds, certif-\nicates and real estate funds) or by Group companies (insurance policies issued by the subsidiary, Poste Vita SpA, and mutual \nfunds managed by BancoPosta Fondi SpA SGR). \nSummary\nSection"

Fair value of financial instruments\n7.1 Fair value measurement techniques \nThe Poste Italiane Group has adopted a fair value policy, setting out the general principles and rules to be applied in determining \nfair value for the purposes of preparing the financial statements, conducting risk management assessments and supporting the \nmarket transactions carried out by the Finance departments of the various Group entities. The general principles for measuring \nfinancial instruments at fair value have not changed since 31 December 2021, except for appropriate additions to include models \nto support the fair value measurement of loans acquired with reference to Law no. 77/2020 described below. These general \nprinciples have been identified in compliance with the indications from the reference accounting standards and from the various \nRegulators (banking and insurance), ensuring uniformity in the valuation techniques adopted within the Group. The methods \nused have been revised, where necessary, to take into account developments in operational procedures and in market practices \nduring the year. \nIn compliance with IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement, the following section provides information regarding the techniques used \nto measure the fair value of financial instruments within the Poste Italiane Group.\nThe assets and liabilities concerned (specifically assets and liabilities measured at fair value and measured at cost or amortised \ncost, for which fair value is required to be disclosed in the notes) are classified with reference to a hierarchy that reflects the \nmateriality of the sources used for their valuation. \nThe hierarchy consists of 3 levels.\nLevel 1: this level is comprised of fair values determined with reference to unadjusted prices quoted in active markets for identical \nassets or liabilities to which the entity has access on the measurement date. For the Poste Italiane Group the following categories \nof financial instrument apply: \nBonds quoted on active markets:\n \nz Bonds issued by EU government bodies or Italian or foreign corporate bonds: measurement is based on bid prices, \naccording to a hierarchy of sources where the MTS (the wholesale electronic market for government securities) ranks first, \nMILA (Milan Stock Exchange) second, for bonds intended for retail customers, and the CBBT (Composite Bloomberg Bond \nTrader) third;\n \nz Financial liabilities: measurement is based on the ask prices quoted by CBBT (Composite Bloomberg Bond Trader).\nEquity securities and ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) listed on active markets: the valuation is made considering the price result-\ning from the last contract traded on the day on the relevant stock exchange.\nQuoted open-end investment funds: measurement is based on the daily closing market price as provided by Bloomberg or \nthe fund manager. Level 1 bond price quotations incorporate a credit risk component. Exchange rates published by the European \nCentral Bank are used in determining the value of financial instruments denominated in currencies other than the euro.\nLevel 2: this level is comprised of fair values based on inputs other than Level 1 quoted market prices that are either directly or \nindirectly observable for the asset or liability233. For the Poste Italiane Group the following categories of financial instrument apply:\nBonds either quoted on inactive markets or not at all:\n \nz Straight Italian and international government and non-government bonds: valuation is based on discounted cash flow \ntechniques involving the computation of the present value of future cash flows, inputting rates from yield curves incorporating \n233. \u0007Given the nature of Poste Italiane Group’s operations, the observable data used as input to determine the fair value of the various instruments include, for example, quoted \nprices provided by third parties (pricing or brokerage services), yield and inflation curves, exchange rates provided by the European Central Bank, ranges of rate volatility, \ninflation option premiums, interest rate swap spreads or credit default spreads which represent the creditworthiness of specific counterparties and any liquidity adjustments \nquoted by primary market counterparties.\t\nSection\nSummary"

Yield curves may be slightly adjusted to \nreflect liquidity risk relating to the absence of an active market.\n \nz Structured bonds: valuation is based on a building block approach, entailing decomposition of a structured position into \nits basic components: the bond and option components. The bond component is measured by discounting cash flows to \npresent value in line with the approach applicable to straight bonds, as defined above. The option component - which con-\nsidering the features of the bonds included in the portfolio of the Poste Italiane Group relates to interest rate risk - is measured \nin accordance with a standard closed form expression as with classical option valuation models with underlyings exposed to \nsuch risks. \nUnquoted equities: this category may be included here provided it is possible to use the price of quoted equities of the same \nissuer as a benchmark. The price inferred in this manner would be adjusted through the application of the discount implicit in the \nprocess to align the value of the unquoted shares to the quoted ones.\nUnquoted open-end investment funds: measurement is based on the latest available NAV (Net Asset Value) as provided by \nBloomberg or as determined by the fund manager.\nDerivative financial instruments:\n \nz Interest Rate Swaps:\nPlain vanilla interest rate swaps: valued using discounted cash flow techniques, involving the computation of the present \nvalue of future differentials between the receiver and payer legs of the swap. The construction of yield curves to estimate future \ncash flows indexed to market parameters (money market rates and/or inflation) and computation of the present value of future \ndifferentials are carried out using techniques commonly used in capital markets. \nInterest rate swaps with an embedded option: valuation is based on a building block approach, entailing decomposition \nof a structured position into its basic components: the linear and option components. The linear component is measured \nusing the discounted cash flow techniques described for plain vanilla interest rate swaps above. Using the derivatives held in \nPoste Italiane’s portfolio as an example, the option component is derived from interest rate or inflation rate risks and is valued \nusing a closed form expression, as with classical option valuation models with underlyings exposed to such risks.\n \nz Bond forwards: valuation is based on the present value of the differential between the forward price of the underlying instru-\nment as of the measurement date and the settlement price.\n \nz Warrants: considering the features of the securities held, measurement is based on the equity local volatility model. In par-\nticular, considering that buyback agreements have been entered into with the counterparties that structured these warrants, \nand that such counterparties use valuation models consistent with those used by the Group, these instruments are measured \non the basis of the bid price quoted by the counterparties. \n \nz Currency forwards: valuation is based on the differential between the reciprocal currency registered at the measurement \ndate and the reciprocal currency fixed at the trade date.\nThe derivatives held in Poste Italiane’s portfolio may be pledged as collateral and the fair value, consequently, need not be adjust-\ned for counterparty risk. The yield curve used to compute present value is selected to be consistent with the manner in which \ncash collateral is remunerated. This approach is also followed for security in the form of pledged debt securities, given the limited \nlevel of credit risk inherent in the securities held as collateral by the Poste Italiane Group. \nIn the rare instances where collateral agreements do not substantially reduce counterparty risk, measurement takes place by \ndiscounting to present value the cash flows generated by the securities held as collateral, using as the input a yield curve that \nreflects the spread applicable to the issuer’s credit risk. Alternatively, use is made of fair value to calculate the CVA/DVA (Credit \nValuation Adjustment/Debit Valuation Adjustment), in relation to the main technical and financial characteristics of the agreements \nand the counterparty’s probability of default.\nReverse Repos: are valued using discounted cash flow techniques involving the computation of future contractual cash \nflows. These instruments may also be used for collateral and in such cases fair value need not be adjusted for the counter-\nparty’s credit risk.\nFixed-rate and variable-rate instruments: measurement is based on discounted cash flow. The counterparty’s credit spread \nis considered through:\n \nz use of the Italian government yield curve or the credit default swap (CDS) of the Italian Republic, in the case of Italian govern-\nment agencies;\n \nz use of quoted CDS yield curves or, if not available, the adoption of “synthetic” CDS yield curves represented by the counter-\nparty’s rating, as constructed starting from the input data observable on the market;\nSummary\nSection"

For the Poste Italiane Group the following categories of financial instrument apply:\nFixed-rate and variable-rate loans: the measurement is carried out using discounted cash flow techniques. The counterpar-\nty’s credit spread is set according to best practices, by using the probability of default and transition matrices created by external \ninformation providers and loss given default parameters determined by prudential regulations for banks or in accordance with \nmarket standards.\nClosed-end unquoted funds: these include funds that invest mainly in unquoted instruments. Their fair value is determined \nby considering the latest NAV (Net Asset Value), available at least every six months, reported by the fund manager. This NAV is \nadjusted according to the capital calls and reimbursements announced by the managers which occurred between the latest NAV \ndate and the valuation date.\nInvestment property (excluding former service accommodation) and inventories of properties held for sale: The fair \nvalue of both investment property and inventories has been determined mainly by discounting to present value the cash flows \nexpected to be generated by the rental agreements and/or proceeds from sales, net of related costs. The process uses a dis-\ncount rate that considers analytically the risks typical of the property. \nInvestment property (former service accommodation): The value of this investment property is determined on the basis \nof the applicable law (Law 560 of 24 December 1993), which sets the selling price in case of sale to the tenant or the minimum \nselling price if the property is sold through a public auction.\n \nz Unquoted equity instruments: this category includes shares for which no price is observable directly or indirectly in the market. \nFor these types of instruments, fair value is determined by considering the implicit valuation at the time of acquisition, adjust-\ned by value adjustments to take account of any changes in price resulting from significant transactions234 observable on the \nmarket in the 12 months prior to the reporting date. Alternatively, and in the absence of significant transactions, the fair value \nof the share is determined using alternative methods (verification of financial data that can be inferred from the company’s \nBusiness Plans if available and analysis of the company’s performance, multiple market use, etc.). \n \nz Tax credits Law no. 77/2020: this category includes credits acquired with reference to the “Decreto Rilancio” no. 34/2020 \n(later converted into Law no. 77 of 17 July 2020) for which no directly or indirectly observable market prices are available. For \nthis type of instrument, the method of determining fair value involves the application of the discounted cash flow valuation \ntechnique, which consists of discounting cash flows to maturity using the yield curve constructed by adding to the risk-free \nrate curve the extra yield calculated starting from the price at the date of purchase of the receivables. The spread remains \nfixed for the life of the instrument.\n234. \u0007A significant transaction in this context is defined as a minimum investment of €10 million or at least 5% of the share capital of the investee entity over the last twelve months \nfrom the reporting date.\nSection\nSummary"

Hedging transactions\nBelow is a description of the hedging transactions entered into by the Poste Italiane Group, as distinguished between fair value \nhedges and cash flow hedges, which are accounted for as per IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. \nThe fair value hedges and cash flow hedges described below refer mainly to fixed income securities or inflation-linked securities \nin relation to BancoPosta operations.\nHedging transactions  – Fair value hedges\nHedging transactions on fixed-income and inflation-linked \ngovernment bonds\nThe Poste Italiane Group has a government bond portfolio235 – made up of fixed-rate BTPs and inflation-linked BTPs – subject to \nmovements in fair value due to changes in interest rates and in the inflation rate.\nTo limit the effects of interest rates on fair value, BancoPosta RFC enters into Over the Counter (OTC) interest rate swaps to \nhedge the fair value of the bonds held in the portfolio. The objective of these transactions is to have instruments that can offset \nchanges in fair value of the portfolio due to interest rate fluctuations and the rate of inflation. The credit risk of the Italian Republic \nis not hedged and is set for the duration of the swap. \nFull hedges and partial hedges are implemented, with the start date equal to the date of purchase of the instrument (swap spot \nstart) and after the purchase of the instrument (swap forward start), respectively.\nThe Group evaluates the effectiveness of every hedging relationship in offsetting movements in fair value through a retrospective \neffectiveness test and a prospective effectiveness test236, using the approaches illustrated in the following notes.\nThe retrospective effectiveness test is run by utilising the “dollar offset approach through the hypothetical derivative237”. With this \napproach, consideration is given to the hedge ratio of the change in fair value of the actual derivative to the change in fair value of \nthe hypothetical derivative occurred between inception and the valuation date. The hedge is considered effective if the hedge ratio \nfalls in the interval between 80% and 125%. The hypothetical derivative and the actual hedging instrument have a settlement date \nconsistent with the hedge inception (spot or forward start) and differ solely in their spread which is considered, as already indicated, \nthe main source of ineffectiveness238. The partial ineffectiveness of the hedge, equal to the difference between the changes in value \nof the two derivatives (hypothetical and actual) represents the net effect of the hedge recognised separately in profit or loss. \n235. As of the last quarter of 2022, BancoPosta also holds German and French government bonds in its portfolio that are not currently hedged.\n236. \u0007IAS 39 requires two effectiveness tests:\n•\t prospective effectiveness test: attests that the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in future periods;\n•\t retrospective effectiveness test: attests that the hedging relationship has been effective from inception to the reporting date.\nFor a hedge to be effective, the prospective effectiveness test must show that the hedge is highly effective in offsetting fair value or cash flow movements attributable to the \nhedged instrument during the designation period, while the result of the retrospective test must show offset ratios ranging from 80% to 125%. \nA hedge can be ineffective when the hedging instrument and the hedged item: are in different currencies; have different maturities; use different underlying interest rates; are \nexposed to different counterparty risks; and when the derivative is not equal to zero at inception. \n237. \u0007The dollar offset approach is a quantitative method that involves a comparison between movements in the fair value or cash flow of the hedging instrument and the \nmovements in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged instrument attributable to the risk hedged. Depending on the policy selected, this approach can be used:\n•\t on a cumulative basis, by observing the performance of the hedge since inception;\n•\t on a periodic basis, by comparing the hedge performance with that of the last test. \nThe dollar offset approach can be implemented through a hypothetical derivative, that is by constructing a theoretical derivative to compare the relevant theoretical movements \nin far value or cash flow with those of the hedged instrument (actual derivative).\n238. \u0007For the hypothetical derivative use is made of the mid-market spread, which makes the present value at the settlement date equal to 0, and for the actual derivative the \ninterest rate agreed upon with the counterparty.\nSummary\nSection"

      "text": "Poste Italiane’s Financial Statements at 31 December 2022\n8. Hedging transactions\n753\nFor the purposes of the prospective effectiveness test, different approaches have been adopted, depending on the characteris-\ntics of the hedging instrument. Specifically:\n \nz the “Critical terms239” approach for swap spot start, for which it has been determined at inception that the characteristics of \nthe fixed leg make it possible to replicate exactly the fixed cash flows generated by the hedged item;\n \nz the “Dollar offset through the hypothetical derivative” approach for forward start swaps and forward sales of the subsidiary \nPoste Vita, for which the prospective effectiveness test is performed by calculating the hedge ratio between the change in fair \nvalue of the hypothetical derivative and the change in fair value of the actual derivative240. The hedge is considered effective if \nthe hedge ratio falls in the interval between 80% and 125%.\nWith respect to the Poste Vita Group, forward sales expired in 2021 and were entered into in order to preserve, following unex-\npected changes in interest rates and/or credit risk, unrealised gains on government bonds of the Separately Managed Account \nPosta ValorePiù. The maturity of these positions was set to take into account the mismatch of cash flows between the portfolio \nof financial assets and liabilities.\nHedging on repurchase agreements\nThe Poste Italiane Group carries out transactions in repurchase agreements, on euro-government securities or with the guar-\nantee of the Italian state for various purposes, including to invest in government bonds, to meet liquidity needs arising from the \ndynamics of funding on current accounts, to actively manage the treasury position and to manage deposits as collateral for \ncollateralisation transactions. These transactions are mainly fixed-rate transactions and are therefore exposed to changes in fair \nvalue due to fluctuations in interest rates.\nTo limit the effects of interest rates on fair value, the Group enters into Over the Counter (OTC) interest rate swaps (fair value \nhedges) designated as specific hedges of repurchase agreements in the portfolio. \nThe Group evaluates the effectiveness of every hedging relationship in offsetting movements in fair value through a retrospective \neffectiveness test and a prospective effectiveness test, using the approaches illustrated in the following notes.\nThe retrospective effectiveness test is run by utilising the “dollar offset approach through the hypothetical derivative”. With this \napproach, consideration is given to the hedge ratio of the change in fair value of the actual derivative to the change in fair value \nof the hypothetical derivative occurred between inception and the valuation date. The hedge is considered effective if the hedge \nratio falls in the interval between 80% and 125%. The hypothetical derivative and the actual derivative have a settlement date \nconsistent with the hedge inception and differ solely in their fixed rate component which is considered the main source of ineffec-\ntiveness241. The partial ineffectiveness of the hedge, equal to the difference between the changes in value of the two derivatives \n(hypothetical and actual) represents the net effect of the hedge recognised separately in profit or loss. \nFor the purposes of the prospective effectiveness test, the Group adopts the “dollar offset approach through the hypothetical \nderivative”, performed by calculating the hedge ratio between the change in fair value of the hypothetical derivative and the \nchange in fair value of the actual derivative242. The hedge is considered effective if the hedge ratio falls in the interval between \n80% and 125%.\n239. \u0007The critical terms approach involves a comparison between the critical terms of the hedging instrument with those of the hedged item. The hedging relationship is highly \neffective when all the critical terms of the two instruments match perfectly and there are no features or options that might invalidate the hedge. Critical terms include, for \nexample: notional amount of the derivative and principal of the underlying, credit risk, timing, currency of the cash flows. \n240. Calculated by assuming a parallel shift of +/- 100 bps of the yield curves.\n241. \u0007Hedging is performed by defining the variable-rate component simply linked to the Euribor and the fixed-rate component incorporating market conditions. The hypothetical \nderivative uses the fixed rate at the market mid which makes the present value at the settlement date equal to 0, while the actual derivative uses the rate agreed upon with \nthe counterparty.\n242.

In addition, to pursue the stabilisation of returns, forward sales \nare entered into. These derivatives qualify as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions.  \nIn addition, the Group has a portfolio of inflation-linked BTPs subject to cash flow variability in relation to inflation.\nTo limit the effects of interest rates on cash flows, the Group enters into OTC interest rate swaps or inflation swaps to hedge the \ncash flows of the bonds held in portfolio. The objective of these transactions is to stabilise until maturity the return of the instru-\nment, regardless of movements of the variable parameter. \nThe Group evaluates the effectiveness of the designated derivative in every hedging relationship through a retrospective effec-\ntiveness test and a prospective effectiveness test.\nWith regards to the hedges of forecast transactions, the retrospective effectiveness test involves the calculation of a hedge ratio \ndefined as the ratio of the difference between the fair value of the forward transaction entered into with the counterparty on the \ntest and inception date and the present value of the difference between the theoretical forward price of the BTP calculated as \nof the test and inception date. Assuming a perfect match between the forward prices of the counterparties and the theoretical \nforward prices, the hedge ratio is always equal to 100%. As such, there are no sources of ineffectiveness.\nFor the purposes of the prospective effectiveness test, the critical terms approach is applied, considering at inception the con-\nsistency between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the basis of the qualitative characteristics of the contracts243.\nWith respect to inflation-linked bonds, the retrospective effectiveness test considers the hedge ratio between the change in fair \nvalue of the actual derivative to the change in fair value of the hypothetical derivative occurred between the date of inception and \nthe valuation date. The hedge is considered effective if the hedge ratio falls in the interval between 80% and 125%. \nThe hypothetical derivative and the actual derivative have the settlement date that matches the inception of the hedge and differ \nin terms of their fixed income component244. Moreover, for the derivatives used to hedge inflation-linked BTP, the fair value at the \nsettlement date reflects also the interest accrued of the instrument accrued from the latest interest payment date to the date of \nsettlement of the derivative. As such, both are considered the main sources of ineffectiveness.\nThe change in fair value of the actual derivative is recognised through equity, for the effective portion of the hedge, while the \nchange in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognised through profit or loss.\nFor the purposes of the prospective effectiveness test, different approaches have been applied, depending on the characteristics \nof the hedging swap. Specifically:\n \nz the “Critical terms” approach for derivatives for which it has been determined at inception that the characteristics of the \nindexed leg of the swap make it possible to replicate exactly the variable cash flows generated by the hedged item;\n \nz the “Dollar offset through the hypothetical derivative” approach for derivative contracts with a fixed rate applicable to a \nnominal amount growing constantly at six-month intervals until the derivative expires. For these contracts the prospective \neffectiveness test is performed by calculating the hedge ratio between the change in fair value of the hypothetical derivative \nand the change in fair value of the actual derivative245. The hedge is considered effective if the hedge ratio falls in the interval \nbetween 80% and 125%.\n243. \u0007The notional amount of the forward contract must be set, at the settlement date, as equal to the nominal amount of the instrument in case of purchase, and equal or lower \nthan the nominal amount of the instrument in case of sale. The underlying of the forward contract must coincide with the instrument that must be purchased or sold (in this \ncase it must be an instrument in the portfolio) at the settlement date. The settlement date must be the same as the date on which the cash flow to be hedged is expected, \nin case of forward purchase, or must be related to the year in which the total return must be stabilised, in case of forward sale.\n244. \u0007The hypothetical derivative uses the fixed rate, which makes the present value at the settlement date equal to 0, while the actual derivative uses the interest rate agreed \nupon with the counterparty.\n245.

Proceedings pending and principal \nrelations with the Authorities\n \nThe following information is provided in accordance with accounting standard IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and \nContingent Assets.\nTax disputes \nWith reference to Postel, an audit regarding income tax and withholding tax came to an end on 8 October 2015, with delivery of \na tax audit report, contesting the right to deduct VAT and the deductibility of IRAP, in relation to the alleged failure to pay social \nsecurity contributions for employees and/or contractors used by a supplier between 2010 and 2014. In relation to the notices \nof assessment for the 2010 and 2011 periods, Postel has decided to avail itself of the facilitated definition pursuant to article 11 \nof the Law Decree no. 50 of 24 April 2017, while with regard to the other assessment periods, the tax authorities have notified:\n \nz with regard to the 2012 tax year, on 25 November 2016, additional IRES, IRAP, VAT and withholding tax of €0.1 million, plus \npenalties and interest. The Lazio Regional Tax Tribunal rejected the appeal by the Agenzia delle Entrate, ordering it to pay \ncosts in favour of the Company, which were settled in February 2022.  The Company is awaiting the repayment of the sums \nprovisionally advanced;\n \nz with regard to the 2014 tax year, on 19 April 2019, the tax authorities requested the payment of additional VAT, IRES, IRAP \nand withholdings amounting to a total of approximately €0.25 million, plus penalties and interest.  With a judgment dated 22 \nOctober 2020, the Regional Tax Tribunal of Rome fully accepted the appeal filed in the interest of the Company and annulled \nthe notice of assessment issued in relation to the 2014 tax period. The Company is awaiting the repayment of the sums pro-\nvisionally advanced.\nOn 19 April 2018, the Tax Authorities in Rome (Guardia di Finanza – Nucleo di Polizia economico-finanziaria) entered the offices of \nSDA Express Courier. The purpose of the inspection was to verify the company’s compliance with the requirements regarding \nVAT, income tax, IRAP and withholding tax for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016, pursuant to and for the purposes of articles 52 \nand 63 of Presidential Decree no. 633/72, art. 33 of Presidential Decree no. 600/73, art. 2 of Legislative Decree no. 68/2001 and \nLaw no. 4/1929. On 29 November 2018, the audit was formally declared at an end. The main finding in final notice of assessment \nfor about €1 million regards the deduction of VAT relating to the adjustment entries issued by the company in connection with \ndiscounts granted to customers following an increase in the number of shipments. Subsequently, on 5 December 2019, a notice \nof assessment for the year 2014 alone was notified with a total claim of €0.4 million, which, referring to the Report on Findings \n(PVC), mainly contests the VAT deducted. On 3 February 2020, the Company appealed against this notice and provided for the \nprovisional payment of the fine imposed. On 20 July, the hearing to discuss the 2014 VAT appeal was held and the PTC, accept-\ning the company’s requests, postponed the discussion ‘to a new role’ (i.e., without setting a precise date for the next hearing) in \norder to allow time to complete negotiations with the Lazio Regional Tax Office (DRE). The purview with adjournment has not yet \nbeen notified by the commission.\nIn addition, on 27 May 2021, the DRE served a further notice of assessment for the tax year 2015 similar to the one already \nfiled for the year 2014 in which the VAT deducted was contested. This deed has not been challenged and a procedure has \nbeen initiated with the Lazio DRE for an overall re-examination of the dispute relating to the credit notes with reference to all the \nperiods covered by the PVC (from 2014 to 2017) in an attempt to reach an out-of-court settlement. This procedure is currently \nin progress.\nIn the course of 2022, an out-of-court settlement was reached with the Lazio Regional Tax Office for Large Taxpayers, which in fact \nresulted in the partial cancellation of the VAT findings resulting from the Guardia di Finanza’s Report on Findings of 29 November \n2018 for all the years concerned, with the total amounts due being redetermined at approximately €0.185 million in total. \nIn November 2018, Consorzio Postemotori received notice of an order issued by the Criminal Court in Rome and of a precaution-\nary seizure regarding the consortium, amounting to €4.6 million. On 13 May 2019, the G.U.P.

The Consortium \nmandated an external criminal lawyer to file an application for release of the criminal seizure ordered against the Consortium. On \n20 December 2021, a petition for release from seizure was filed and on 24 December 2021, the Court of Rome issued an order \nfor the restitution of the sum of €0.3 million credited back to the Consortium’s current account on 7 February 2022.\nSocial security disputes\nSince 2012, and up until 31 December 2022, the Istituto Nazionale per la Previdenza Sociale (INPS, the National Institute of \nSocial Security) office at Genoa Ponente and Roma Eur has issued Postel with some payment orders, for a total amount payable \nof €27.02 million. According to INPS, this amount represents social security contributions funding income support, extraordinary \nincome support, unemployment benefit and family benefits not covered by the contributions paid to IPOST. Appeals against \nthese requests were brought before the Court of Genoa. In support of the arguments of Postel in a memo issued on 20 October \n2016, the Ministry of Labour stated that the social security contributions system applicable to Poste Italiane also applies to all \nthe other Group companies, with the sole exception of those that provide air transport, banking and express delivery services.\nSome of the judgements have already been decided by the Court of Genoa and, on their outcome, against debit notices totalling \n€13.2 million, the Company was ordered to pay only the CUAF contributions of 0.68%, less the family allowances paid by Postel \nto employees, amounting to €0.3 million, while nothing was deemed to be due under the CIG, CIGS and mobility being at the \ntime Postel wholly owned by the State through Poste Italiane and therefore included among the industrial enterprises of the State \nfor which the law excludes the obligation to pay redundancy and mobility. INPS filed an appeal for the first tranche of requests \nmade (€9.16 million), contesting the merits of the judgement at first instance and the sum arrived at. In the view of INPS, the rate \napplicable for contributions for family benefits, in line with recent guidance issued by INPS, should have been 4.40% in place of \nthe 0.68% applied in the payment notices involved in the court action. In two judgements dated 28 December 2018, the Court \nof Appeal in Genoa confirmed in full the judgements at the first instance, rejecting INPS’ appeals, who filed appeals in Cassation \nnotified on 28 June 2019 to Postel, which appeared before the court.\nBelow are the further judgments already decided:\n \nz With the judgment of 19 September 2019, the Court of Genoa confirmed the position, ordering Postel to pay INPS, by way \nof CUAF contributions relating to the period from May 2011 to November 2012, the sum of €0.08 million, deeming the higher \nsums claimed in the debit notices (amounting in total to approximately €4 million) not due. By judgment of 21 May 2021, the \nCourt of Appeal of Genoa dismissed the main appeal and the cross-appeal. INPS appealed in cassation and Postel joined \nthe proceedings. On 26 January 2023, the Court of Cassation ordered the case to be remitted to the register for processing \ntogether with other appeals. The parties are awaiting the setting of a new hearing.\n \nz In a judgment of 1 February 2021, the Court of Genoa cancelled the debit notice (totalling approximately €0.64 million) for the \nperiod from December 2012 to April 2015 (excluding July 2014) and ordered INPS to pay Postel the sum of €0.06 million, plus \ninterest. By judgment of 2 February 2022, the Court of Appeal of Genoa dismissed the appeal brought by the Institute. INPS \nappealed in cassation and Postel joined the proceedings.\n \nz By means of the judgments of 26 May 2021, the Court of Genoa cancelled the debit notices (for a total of approximately \n€3.1 million) for certain periods between February 2011 and January 2017 and ordered the payment of the lower amounts \nrestated for a total of €0.17 million. In its judgments of 18 May 2022 and 6 June 2022, the Court of Appeal of Genoa rejected \nthe Company’s appeals, as well as the cross-appeals filed by the Institute. Postel and INPS brought an appeal in cassation \nagainst the judgment of 18 May 2022. As things stand, only Postel has lodged an appeal in cassation against the judgment \nof 6 June 2022.\n \nz With a judgment published on 20 September 2022, the Court of Appeal of Genoa, partially reforming the first instance judg-\nment of 29 December 2020, ordered the Company to pay the amount indicated in the Debit Notice in the amount of approx-\nimately €0.009 million. At present, the deadlines for filing a possible appeal to the Supreme Court are pending.\nAdditional administrative proceedings are still pending relating to the appeals against the notices of adjustment for the periods \nfrom May 2009 to November 2022. \nIn addition, on 8 October 2019, INPS requested to regularise contributions from September 2014 to September 2019 at the \nnon-harmonised CUAF rate of 4.40% of taxable income for social security purposes.

On 21 December 2015, the AGCM notified Poste Italiane of its final \nruling in which it deemed the Company’s conduct unfair and imposed a fine of €0.54 million, limited to a tenth of the maximum \napplicable amount taking into account the mitigating circumstance that Poste Italiane had adopted initiatives aimed at allow-\ning customers to benefit from the bonus rate. Poste Italiane lodged an appeal against this measure before the Lazio Regional \nAdministrative Court, which was not upheld and the relevant judgment was challenged before the Council of State. The setting \nof the hearing is now pending.\nOn 3 October 2018, Poste Italiane proceeded to pay the fine of €23 million plus interest imposed by the Autorità Garante della \nConcorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM - the Antitrust Authority) following its ruling, in January 2018, that Poste Italiane had abused \nits dominant market position in the period from 2014 to 2017, as per art. 102 of the TFEU. This did not constitute acceptance or \nadmission of liability in relation to the alleged misconduct and does not affect the Company’s right to defend its position through \nthe appropriate channels. Poste Italiane challenged this measure before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court and the hearing \non the merits has been set for 19 April 2023.\nOn 19 November 2019, the AGCM initiated proceedings PS11563 against Poste Italiane in order to ascertain allegedly unfair \ncommercial practice in the delivery of mail and, in particular, registered mail, in possible violation of articles 20, 21 and 22 of the \nConsumer Code. In particular, according to some customers: i) the advertised features of the “registered mail delivery” service \nare not reflected in the service actually provided; ii) the advertising for the “digital registered mail collection” service does not \nmake it clear that the service may no longer be free of charge in the near future and that, in any case, there are restrictions \non its use, since it can only be accessed if the sender has authorised it. In January 2020, a number of consumer associations \nwere admitted to the proceedings. At the conclusion of the proceedings, by way of a measure notified on 15 September 2020, \nthe Authority imposed an administrative fine of €5 million, payment of which was made on 5 January 2021. Poste Italiane has \nappealed this decision to the Lazio Regional Administrative Court, and the hearing was held on 26 May 2021. The Lazio Regional \nAdministrative Court’s judgment, which did not uphold the Poste Italiane appeal, was appealed before the Council of State, and \nthe company is waiting for a hearing to be set. In any event, in May, the AGCM acknowledged that Poste had correctly complied \nwith its requirements.\nOn 6 April 2020, pursuant to art. 9, paragraph 3-bis of Law 192/98 and art. 14 of Law 287/90, the AGCM initiated proceedings \nA539 against Poste Italiane, following a complaint by a third-party supplier that Poste Italiane had presumably imposed unjus-\nSummary\nSection"

In particular, following the termination of contractual relations in mid-2017, the supplier \nwas not, in fact, able to otherwise offer the services it was providing on the market because of the obligation to comply with \nrules and organisational parameters considered such as to make the company structure excessively rigid, making it unsuitable \nto operate with parties other than Poste Italiane. A hearing was held on 8 June 2020 at which Poste Italiane stated its position \nand, subsequently, the Authority requested the delivery of documentation. The final hearing was held on 3 May 2021, during \nwhich Poste Italiane set out its position and presented its defence. At the conclusion of the proceedings, by way of a measure \nnotified on 6 August 2021, the Authority imposed an administrative fine of more than €11 million for abuse of economic depend-\nence, payment of which was made on 6 September 2021. Poste Italiane has appealed this measure to the Lazio Regional \nAdministrative Court, and the hearing was set for 19 April 2023.\nOn 14 October 2021, the Italian Antitrust Authority (AGCM) initiated proceedings against PostePay pursuant to Article 27, para-\ngraph 3, of Legislative Decree no. 206 of 6 September 2005, as amended (Consumer Code), as well as pursuant to Article 6 of \nthe Regulation on investigative proceedings into misleading and comparative advertising, unfair commercial practices, infringe-\nment of consumers’ rights in contracts, breach of the prohibition on discrimination and unfair terms (Regulation), adopted by the \nAuthority with a resolution dated 1 April 2015 and a simultaneous request for information pursuant to Article 12, paragraph 1 of \nthe Regulation.\nIn summary, the AGCM, on the basis of a number of reports received from users of PosteMobile services, contested the unsolic-\nited activation of an alleged service of continuation of outgoing traffic (voice, SMS and data) in the event that the user’s recharge-\nable SIM card ran out of credit or had insufficient credit at the time of renewal of the periodic offer. PostePay responded to the \nAGCM notice by clarifying that no continuity service is provided as part of PosteMobile offers. \nAt the end of the investigative phase of the proceedings, having obtained the opinion of the Italian Communications Authority \n(AGCOM, which did not find, let alone challenge, any regulatory complaints against the Company), on 9 August the AGCM \nnotified PostePay of its final measure no. 30286, in which it found that PostePay had committed an infringement by claiming \nthat, in the case of mobile telephone offers subscribed to with a flat fee, in the event credit is used up, the company charged a \nconsumption-based fee – more expensive than the ordinary one – without adequate information. In the measure, the Company \nis therefore ordered to pay an administrative fine of €1.8 million, calculated on the basis of the turnover relating to the provision \nof electronic communication networks and services, and then reduced to €1.5 million, in consideration of the mitigating circum-\nstance “relating to certain measures taken by the professional to remove the conduct”. \nThe Company deemed it appropriate to lodge an appeal against the Measure before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court, \nfiling the appeal on 28 October 2022. Therefore, the payment of the fine imposed was made by PostePay with express reserva-\ntion of appeal and, in the event, of repayment of the amount paid in the event of annulment (total or partial) of the Measure by the \nLazio Regional Administrative Court and/or the Council of State.\nOn 7 November 2022, PostePay sent the required compliance report to the AGCM, which illustrated the measures adopted by \nPostePay to overcome - albeit having refuted the grounds thereof - the objections of the AGCM, which, on 2 December 2022, \ninformed PostePay that it had acknowledged compliance with the measure.\nOn 24 March 2022, the Italian Antitrust Authority (AGCM) initiated proceeding PS/11287 against Poste Italiane for alleged \nunfair commercial practices in relation to the information on the expiry and prescription dates of paper Interest-bearing Postal \nCertificates, as (i) during the placement of the postal certificates, Poste allegedly omitted to indicate the maturity and/or prescrip-\ntion date, as well as to provide information regarding the legal consequences arising from the expiry of the aforementioned terms \nand/or provided such information with a confusing and deceptive wording; (ii) in the management of the postal certificates that \nhad expired over the last five years, Poste allegedly omitted to inform the holders of postal certificates close to the expiry of the \nprescription period, of the expiry of that period and the legal consequences arising in the event of failure to request the redemp-\ntion of the postal certificate within that period. On 13 April 2022, the Company sent the AGCM a statement of defence in which, in \naddition to replying to the request for information contained in the writ of initiation, it highlighted its role as mere placement agent, \nthe nature of the postal certificates and the inapplicability of the consumer discipline to the case at hand. On 30 August 2022, \nthe AGCM notified Poste of the Notice of Investigative Findings, substantially confirming the objections of the opening proceed-\nings. On 19 September 2022, Poste filed its final statement of defence, accompanied by the steps it had taken, on a voluntary \nbasis, to eliminate the Authority’s concerns, without complying with the objections raised in the proceedings. On 4 November \n2022, the Authority notified Poste of its final decision imposing an administrative penalty of €1.4 million. This amount was thus \nquantified taking into account the actions implemented by the Company on a voluntary basis, which were deemed appropriate \nto improve the information provided to consumers; in fact, the Authority granted Poste Italiane a 60% reduction in the amount of \nthe fine. The Authority’s Resolution was appealed before the Regional Administrative Court by the Company, which set a hearing \non the merits for 7 June 2023. In line with the provisions of the final measure, on 3 February 2023, the Company sent its Report \nof Compliance with the AGCM’s warning. \nSection\nSummary"

In this regard:\ni.\t On 24 February 2023, AGCom Resolution 28/23/CONS was published, initiating the procedure to verify the net cost of the \nuniversal postal service incurred by Poste Italiane for the years 2020 and 2021.\nii.\t On 1 July 2021, AGCom Resolution 199/21/CONS was published, concluding the procedure to verify the net cost of the \nuniversal postal service incurred by Poste Italiane for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. In particular, the burden of the universal \npostal service for these years has been quantified at €354.5, €334.5 and €175 million respectively. For the 2019 financial year, \nalthough the quantified charge (€175 million) is lower than the authorised offsets (€262 million), the charge for the provision \nof the universal postal service over the entire period (i.e., the previous 2016-2019 Service Contract) is in any case higher than \nthe offsets authorised by the European Commission. The Authority also established that the universal service charge for the \nyears 2017, 2018 and 2019 is inequitable and that, for the same years, in continuity with what was established in previous \nyears, the Compensation Fund referred to in article 10 of Legislative Decree no. 261/1999 is not established. Poste Italiane \nhas appealed this measure to the Lazio Regional Administrative Court (still pending).\niii.\tAGCom Resolution 214/19/CONS regarding “Assessment of the net cost of the universal postal service for 2015 and 2016” \nwas published on 2 July 2019. In addition to acknowledging that the cost is unfair, the Resolution quantified the cost of pro-\nviding the Universal Postal Service in 2015 and 2016, respectively, as €389 million and €356 million, compared with compen-\nsation of €329 million and €262 million provided for in the Contratto di Programma. AGCom did not establish a Compensation \nFund for 2015 and 2016, so it has not been possible to recover the difference between compensation provided by the state \nand the costs quantified by AGCom. On 2 October 2019, Poste Italiane challenged this resolution by filing an appeal before \nthe Lazio Regional Administrative Court (TAR), still pending.\niv.\tAGCom Resolution 298/17/CONS regarding “Assessment of the net cost of the universal postal service for 2013 and 2014” \nwas published on 6 September 2017. In addition to acknowledging that the cost is unfair, the Resolution quantified the cost of \nproviding the Universal Postal Service in 2013 and 2014, respectively, as €393 million and €409 million, compared with com-\npensation of €343 million and €336 million provided for in the Contratto di Programma. Again, no Compensation Fund was \nestablished for 2013 and 2014 and, on 6 November 2017, Poste Italiane had filed a legal challenge before the Lazio Regional \nAdministrative Court against the above resolution (the case is still pending).\nv.\t AGCom Resolution 412/14/CONS regarding “Assessment of the net cost of the universal postal service for 2011 and 2012” \nwas published on 31 July 2014. In addition to acknowledging that the cost is unfair, the Resolution quantified the cost of pro-\nviding the Universal Postal Service in 2011 and 2012, respectively, as €381 million and €327 million for fees originally recog-\nnised by Poste Italiane for €357 and €350 million respectively. The Authority has also established that no compensation fund \nwas established for 2012 and on 13 November 2014, Poste Italiane filed an appeal before the Lazio Regional Administrative \nCourt against the above resolution. The Regional Administrative Court, with judgment no. 11416, published on 5 September \n2022, partially upheld the appeal on the verification of the burden for the years 2011-2012, recognising the non-activation \nof the compensation fund for the year 2011. Poste and AGCom appealed the Regional Aministrative Court judgment to the \nCouncil of State and the hearing on the merits has been set for 18 May 2023.\nWith Resolution 313/21/CONS, notified on 21 October 2021, the AGCom closed the sanctioning proceedings, initiated with \nnotice of objection 6/21/DSP, by imposing a fine of €0.9 million for breach of universal service continuity obligations (art. 3, \nparagraph 1, 5 lett. b) and 8 lett. d) of Legislative Decree no. 261/1999) and of information obligations, in relation to the closures \nof 239 Post Offices over the Christmas period (on Saturday 28 December 2019 and Saturday 4 January 2020) even though \nthey had been communicated of it in advance. The Authority accepted the request, on a subordinate basis, for the application \nof cumulation, imposing a penalty in a reduced amount compared to the one that had been indicated for the reduced payment \n(€3.28 million). Payment of the penalty was made on 10 November 2021. The Authority’s Resolution was appealed by the \nCompany to the Regional Administrative Court. \nWith Resolution no. 104/22/CONS of 7 April 2022, the AGCom dismissed the sanctioning proceedings, initiated with Notice \nof Objection no. 13/21/DSP, for the failure to comply with five quality objectives on certain products included in the Universal \nService for 2020, accepting the arguments expressed by Poste Italiane and recognising the qualification, in relation to the year \n2020, of the SARS-Covid pandemic as a cause of force majeure. In the same Resolution, the Authority stated that, for the years \n246. \u0007This method defines the cost incurred as the difference between the net operating cost incurred by a designated universal service provider when subject to universal service \nobligations and the net operating cost without such obligations.\nSummary\nSection"

Poste Italiane, by the established deadline and \nafter discussion at the Board of Directors’ meeting of 25 January 2023, notified the Bank of Italy of its considerations and planned \nimprovements; for the only finding in respect of which a sanctioning procedure was initiated, the Company sent counter-claims \nin support of the correctness of its actions.\nOn 20 July 2022, the Authority sent a notice to Poste Italiane SpA - BancoPosta RFC and PostePay concerning the manner in \nwhich the funds received by PostePay in respect of the issuance of electronic money should be managed. It should be noted \nthat the Supervisory Provisions for EMIs provide that such funding may be deposited with a bank authorised to operate in Italy, \ninvested in qualified debt securities or particular units of harmonised mutual funds. Since the creation of PostePay, these sums \nare deposited in a postal current account (protection account) and contribute to the funds from private customers of BancoPosta \nRFC, which are invested in euro area government bonds. In this regard, the Authority initiated discussions with BancoPosta and \nPostePay in 2021, in view of the fact that BancoPosta was not deemed to be an entity that could be assimilated to the concept \nof “credit institution” under the relevant European legislation. In the face of a proposed alternative approach, aimed at equating \nthe deposit with BancoPosta of the sums collected by PostePay with a direct investment in qualified debt securities, in the \naforementioned communication the Authority asked BancoPosta and PostePay for further observations, aimed at identifying an \noperational solution that would allow full alignment with the relevant regulatory provisions. Upon completion of the further investi-\ngations requested, a transitional solution was identified, also on the basis of the discussions with the Authority. Feedback will be \nprovided by BancoPosta by the second quarter of 2023.\nDuring the last quarter of 2022, the Bank of Italy conducted two inspections of PostePay SpA - EMI RFC, one “of a general \nnature” initiated in September and one concerning “unauthorised payment transactions, frauds and disallowances” initiated in \nNovember. Both inspections were completed in December. On 27 March 2023, the Bank of Italy delivered the results of the \ninspections conducted from 29 September 2022 until 16 December 2022.

In particular, the indicator is calculated by comparing the number of products offered with ESG \ncomponents to the total number of products offered;\n \nz 2022-2024 Performance Share LTIP: equal gender representation in succession plans, an objective linked to strengthening \nthe presence of women in managerial succession plans, to help increase the presence of women in positions of greater \nresponsibility in the Poste Italiane Group. Specifically, the indicator is calculated by comparing the number of succession \napplications occupied by women to the total number of applications.\nVesting of the Rights and the therefore the awarding of the Shares is subject to achievement of the Performance Hurdle, designed \nto ensure sustainability of the Plan at Group level.

The Plan has a total duration of \nfive years and will end with the assignment of all stock options.\nThe cost recognised in the period 2022 was approximately €0.5 million, whilst the specific equity reserve was approximately \n€1.5 million.\nShort-term incentive schemes: MBO\nOn 27 May 2014, the Bank of Italy issued specific Supervisory Provisions for BancoPosta (Part IV, Chapter I, “BancoPosta” \nincluding in Circular 285 of 17 December 2013 “Prudential supervisory standards for banks”) which, in taking into account \nBancoPosta’s and Poste Italiane’s specific organisational and operational aspects, has extended application of the prudential \nstandards for banks to include BancoPosta. This includes the standards relating to remuneration and incentive policies (Part I, \nTitle IV, Chapter 2 “Remuneration and incentive policies and practices” in the above Circular 285). These standards, applicable \nonly to the Parent Company Poste Italiane SpA, provide that a part of the bonuses paid to BancoPosta RFC’s Risk Takers may \nbe awarded in the form of financial instruments over a multi-year timeframe. \nWith regard to the management incentive schemes adopted for BancoPosta RFC MBO for 2017 and 2018, where the incentive \nwas above a certain materiality threshold, the MBO management incentive scheme envisages the award of 50% of the incen-\ntive in the form of phantom stocks, representing the value of Poste Italiane’s shares, and application of the following deferral \nmechanisms:\n \nz 60% of the award to be deferred for a 5-year period on a pro-rata basis, in the case of Material Risk Takers who are benefi-\nciaries of both the short-term incentive scheme and long-term incentive scheme, “Phantom Stock LTIP”;\n \nz 40% of the award to be deferred for a 3-year period on a pro-rata basis for the remaining Material Risk Takers. \nThe most recent short-term management incentive schemes (MBO 2019, MBO 2020, MBO 2021 and MBO 2022), provide, \nwhere the incentive exceeds a materiality threshold, for the payment of a portion of the bonus accrued in the form of Poste \nItaliane SpA’s Shares and the application of deferral mechanisms:\n \nz 60% of the incentive over 5 years pro-rata, for the General Manager and the head of the BancoPosta function;\n \nz 40% over 5 years pro-rata for the Senior Management Beneficiaries;\n \nz 40% over 3 years pro-rata250 for the Other Beneficiaries. \nThe allocation of Phantom Stocks (MBO 2017 and 2018) and Rights to receive Shares (MBO 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022) is \nsubject to the existence of a Hurdle Condition (Group Profitability: EBIT) and Qualifying Conditions as follows:\n \nz Capital adequacy: CET 1, risk tolerance level approved in the Risk Appetite Framework (RAF);\n \nz Short-term liquidity: LCR, risk tolerance level approved in the Risk Appetite Framework (RAF).\nThe General Manager is also expected to apply an additional Qualifying Condition, in addition to those set out above, linked to \nthe Solvency Ratio of the Poste Vita Insurance Group.\nShares allocated in the form of Phantom Stock or Shares are subject to a Retention Period for both up-front and deferred shares.\nPayment of the deferred portion will take place each year, provided that BancoPosta RFC’s minimum regulatory capital and \nliquidity requirements have been met.

The term IFRS includes all the International Financial Reporting \nStandards, International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting \nInterpretations Committee (“IFRIC”), previously known as the Standing Interpretations Committee (“SIC”), adopted by the \nEuropean Union and contained in the EU Regulations in force at 31 December 2022, regarding which no derogations were \nmade.\nAccounting standards and interpretations applicable from 1 January 2022 \nand those soon to be effective\nThe relevant information is provided in note 2.5 – New Accounting standards and interpretations and those soon to be effective \n– in the section – Financial statements of Poste Italiane – of this Annual Report.  \nSection 2 – Basis of preparation\nThe Separate Report is prepared in accordance with the provisions of the seventh252 update of the Bank of Italy Circular no. \n262 of 22 December 2005 “Bank Financial Statements: presentation formats and rules for preparation”, as well as the Bank of \nItaly Communication of 21 December 2021 “Update of the additions to the provisions of Circular no. 262 concerning the impact \nof COVID-19 and measures to support the economy”, where applicable, and is prepared pursuant to the provisions of Article \n2447-septies, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. On 27 May 2014, the Bank of Italy issued specific Supervisory Standards for \nBancoPosta RFC (Circular 285/2013, Part Four, Section 1) which, in taking into account the entity’s specific organisational and \noperational aspects, has established prudential requirements that are substantially in line with those applicable to banks. The \nStandards also govern the requirements regarding capital adequacy and risk containment. The Separate Report relates to the \nyear ended 31 December 2022, has been prepared in euros without decimal figures and consists of the statement of financial \nposition, the statement of profit or loss, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity, the state-\nment of cash flows and the explanatory notes.

      "text": "Poste Italiane’s Financial Statements at 31 December 2022\nNotes\n803\nThis Regulation, in execution of the provisions set out in the Regulations for ring-fenced capital, govern and formalise the pro-\ncess of awarding BancoPosta’s Corporate Functions to Poste Italiane in accordance with the relevant regulations, identifying \nthe operational phases, roles and responsibilities of the Bodies and Corporate Functions involved in various ways. The general \npolicies and instructions contained in the Regulation in relation to transfer pricing are detailed in specific Operating Guidelines, \njointly developed by BancoPosta and other Poste Italiane SpA functions. The Operating Guidelines establish, among other \nthings, the applicable levels of service and transfer prices and are effective following an authorisation process involving the rele-\nvant Functions, the Chief Executive Officer and, where required, the Company’s Board of Directors. When BancoPosta intends \nto contract out a major process or a control procedure, whether in its entirety or in part, to Poste Italiane SpA in accordance with \nspecific Operating Guidelines, it must give prior notice to the Bank of Italy. In accordance with Bank of Italy Circular 285 issued \non 17 December 2013, Part Four, the Board of Statutory Auditors is required to verify, at least every six months, that the policies \nadopted are fit for purpose and are in compliance with the related statutory requirements and supervisory standards.  \nIn line with 2021, the services are charged for in the form of transfer prices. The transfer prices paid, inclusive of commissions \nand any other form of remuneration due, are determined on the basis of market prices and tariffs for the same or similar services, \nidentified, where possible, following a benchmarking process. When the specifics and/or the particular nature of a service pro-\nvided by a Poste Italiane function do not allow the use of a comparable market price, a cost-based method is used, again with \nthe support of benchmarking to ensure that the price charged is adequate for the service provided. In such a case, an adequate \nmark-up, defined on the basis of appropriate analyses of comparable subjects, shall be applied. The prices set in each Operating \nGuidelines can be reduced in the presence of operating losses of the activities outsourced or in case of penalties due to the \nfailure to achieve pre-established service levels, as measured by specific performance indicators. The Guidelines, which expired \non 31 December 2022 and are being renewed for the three-year period 2023-2025, were notified to the Bank of Italy pursuant \nto the Supervisory Provisions, 60 days before the actual start. The Supervisory Authority gave a positive opinion to proceed. The \ntransfer prices, defined in the Guidelines, may be revised every year in connection with the planning and budget process. \nFor the purposes of oversight of the unbundled accounts, in 2022 the Board of Statutory Auditors conducted the relevant audit \nactivities during 2 meetings, reporting its conclusions in its annual report to shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n4.2 Proceedings pending and principal relations with the Authorities\nRelations with the Authorities\nAutorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM - The Italian Antitrust Authority)\nOn 9 March 2015, the Authority notified Poste Italiane of an investigation of BancoPosta RFC for alleged violation of articles 20, \n21 and 22 of the Consumer Code, regarding the “Libretto Smart” product. On 21 December 2015, the AGCM notified Poste \nItaliane of its final ruling in which it deemed the Poste Italiane’s conduct unfair and imposed a fine of €0.54 million, limited to a \ntenth of the maximum applicable amount taking into account the mitigating circumstance that Poste Italiane had adopted initi-\natives aimed at allowing customers to benefit from the bonus rate. Poste Italiane lodged an appeal against this measure before \nthe Lazio Regional Administrative Court, which was not upheld and the relevant judgment was challenged before the Council of \nState. The setting of the hearing is now pending.\nOn 24 March 2022, the Italian Antitrust Authority (AGCM) initiated proceeding PS/11287 against Poste Italiane, with reference \nto BancoPosta RFC, for alleged unfair commercial practices in relation to the information on the expiry and prescription dates \nof paper Interest-bearing Postal Certificates, as (i) during the placement of the postal certificates, Poste allegedly omitted to \nindicate the maturity and/or prescription date, as well as to provide information regarding the legal consequences arising from \nthe expiry of the aforementioned terms and/or provided such information with a confusing and deceptive wording; (ii) in the \nmanagement of the postal certificates that had expired over the last five years, Poste allegedly omitted to inform the holders of \npostal certificates close to the expiry of the prescription period, of the expiry of that period and the legal consequences arising in \nthe event of failure to request the redemption of the postal certificate within that period. On 13 April 2022, Poste sent the AGCM \na statement of defence in which, in addition to replying to the request for information contained in the writ of initiation, it high-\nlighted its role as mere placement agent, the nature of the postal certificates and the inapplicability of the consumer discipline to \nthe case at hand. On 30 August 2022, the AGCM notified Poste of the Notice of Investigative Findings, substantially confirming \nthe objections of the opening proceedings. On 19 September 2022, Poste filed its final statement of defence, accompanied by \nthe steps it had taken, on a voluntary basis, to eliminate the Authority’s concerns, without complying with the objections raised \nin the proceedings. On 4 November 2022, the Authority notified Poste of its final decision imposing an administrative penalty of \n€1.4 million. This amount was thus quantified taking into account the actions implemented by Poste Italiane on a voluntary basis, \nwhich were deemed appropriate to improve the information provided to consumers; in fact, the Authority granted Poste Italiane \na 60% reduction in the amount of the fine. The Authority’s Resolution was appealed before the Regional Administrative Court by \nthe Company, which set a hearing on the merits for 7 June 2023. In line with the provisions of the final measure, on 3 February \n2023, the Company sent its Report of Compliance with the AGCM’s warning.\nSection\nSummary"

      "text": "Annual Report 2022\nPoste Italiane Group\n804\nBank of Italy\nThe Bank of Italy, from 14 March 2022 to 15 July 2022, conducted an inspection at Poste Italiane, with reference to the \nBancoPosta RFC, on profitability and the business model, governance and control systems, interest rate risk management \nmethods including related internal modelling, new tax credit business and associated risks. On 30 November 2022, the report \ncontaining a number of findings and a “partially unfavourable” assessment was delivered to Poste Italiane. Poste Italiane, by the \nestablished deadline and after discussion at the Board of Directors’ meeting of 25 January 2023, notified the Bank of Italy of its \nconsiderations and planned improvements; for the only finding in respect of which a sanctioning procedure was initiated, Poste \nItaliane sent counter-claims in support of the correctness of its actions.\nOn 20 July 2022, the Authority sent a notice to Poste Italiane SpA, with reference to BancoPosta RFC, and to PostePay con-\ncerning the manner in which the funds received by PostePay in respect of the issuance of electronic money should be managed. \nIt should be noted that the Supervisory Provisions for EMIs provide that such funding may be deposited with a bank authorised \nto operate in Italy, invested in qualified debt securities or particular units of harmonised mutual funds. Since the creation of \nPostePay, these sums are deposited in a postal current account (“conto di tutela”) and contribute to the funds from private cus-\ntomers of BancoPosta RFC, which are invested in euro area government bonds. In this regard, the Authority initiated discussions \nwith BancoPosta and PostePay in 2021, in view of the fact that BancoPosta was not deemed to be an entity that could be assim-\nilated to the concept of “credit institution” under the relevant European legislation. In the face of a proposed alternative approach, \naimed at equating the deposit with BancoPosta of the sums collected by PostePay with a direct investment in qualified debt \nsecurities, in the aforementioned communication the Authority asked BancoPosta and PostePay for further observations, aimed \nat identifying an operational solution that would allow full alignment with the relevant regulatory provisions. Upon completion of \nthe further investigations requested, a transitional solution was identified, also on the basis of the discussions with the Authority. \nFeedback will be provided by BancoPosta by the second quarter of 2023. \nIVASS - Istituto per la Vigilanza sulle Assicurazioni (the insurance regulator)\nWith regard to the audit aimed at verifying compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, jointly, at Poste Vita and Poste \nItaliane, with reference to the BancoPosta RFC, which was completed on 18 June 2021 and the results of which were notified to \nPoste Vita SpA at the Board of Directors’ meeting of 30 September 2021, it is reported that at 31 December 2022, all the actions \nidentified had been completed within the planned time-frame.\nOther proceedings\nFederconsumatori, with a writ of summons dated 14 May 2021, initiated a class action against Poste Italiane, with reference to \nBancoPosta RFC pursuant to article 140-bis of the Consumer Code, before the Court of Rome. The value of the dispute to date \nis approximately €8.5 thousand. \nBy the summons in question, Federconsumatori contests that the capitalisation of interest on 30-year interest-bearing postal \ncertificates (marked with the “Q” series, issued by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti from 1986 to 1995, pursuant to Ministerial Decree 13 \nJune 1986 by the Minister of Treasury, which were subsequently transferred to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, pursuant to \nthe MEF Decree of 5 December 2003) is carried out annually net of withholding tax (now substitute tax), rather than gross, with \nthe effect of recognising to savers a lower return than that allegedly due. \nOn 27 July 2021, Poste Italiane appeared before the court, objecting, on a preliminary basis, to the inadmissibility of the class \naction, on a number of preliminary grounds, as well as to the fact that the plaintiffs’ and potential members’ claims were time-\nbarred, and contested the merits of the proposed claim.\nThe Court of Rome, in an order dated 11 January 2022, held that the request submitted by Federconsumatori was manifestly \nunfounded, recognising, inter alia, the lack of passive legitimacy of Poste Italiane. Federconsumatori appealed the order of the \nCourt of Rome, and the Court of Appeal set the hearing for closing arguments for 12 July 2023.\nSummary\nSection"

There are two types of hedge:\n \nz fair value hedges: hedge of the exposure to a change in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or of an unrecognised firm \ncommitment attributable to a particular risk, and that could have an impact on profit or loss;\n \nz cash flow hedges: a hedge of the exposure to the variability of cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a \nrecognised asset or liability or with a highly probable forecast transaction, and that could have an impact on profit or loss.\nDerivative contracts that constitute effective hedging relationships are presented as assets or liabilities depending on whether the \nfair value is positive or negative.\nb) measurement and recognition of gains and losses\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is executed. If derivative financial instruments \nqualify for hedge accounting, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value after initial recognition are accounted for in \naccordance with the specific policies described below. The relationship between each hedging instrument and the hedged item \nis documented, as well as the risk management objective, the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction and the methods \nused to assess effectiveness. Assessment of whether the hedging derivative is effective takes place both at designation of each \nderivative instrument as hedging instrument, and during its life.\nFair value hedges\nWhen the hedge is related to recognised assets or liabilities, or an unrecognised firm commitment, the changes in fair value of \nboth the hedging instrument and the hedged item are recognised in profit or loss. Any difference represents the ineffective portion \nof the hedge and is accounted for as a loss or gain, recognised separately in line “Item 90 - Profits/(Losses) on hedging”.\nCash flow hedges\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges after initial \nrecognition is recognised in a specific equity reserve (the Cash flow hedge reserve, within line “Item 110 – Valuation reserve”). A \nhedging transaction is generally considered highly effective if, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, changes in \nthe expected future cash flows of the hedged item are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument. \nIf the hedging transaction is not fully effective, the gain or loss arising from a change in fair value relating to the ineffective portion \nis recognised in line “Item 90 - Profits/(Losses) on hedging”.\nAmounts accumulated in equity are recycled to profit or loss in the period in which the hedged item affect profit or loss. In \nparticular, in the case of hedges associated with a highly probable forecast transaction (such as the forward purchase of debt \nsecurities), the reserve is reclassified to profit or loss in the period or in the periods in which the asset or liability, subsequently \naccounted for and connected to the aforementioned transaction, will affect profit or loss (for example, an adjustment to the return \non the security).\nSummary\nSection"

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, \nthe related gains and losses accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve at that time remain in equity and are recognised in profit \nor loss at the same time as the original underlying.\n9 – Current and deferred taxation\nCurrent income tax expense (IRES and IRAP) is based on the best estimate of taxable profit for the period and the related regu-\nlations, applying the rates in force. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on all temporary differences arising between \nthe tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related \ndeferred tax assets are realised or the deferred tax liabilities are settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is \nprobable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. \nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised in profit or loss, with the exception of taxes charged or credited directly to equity, in \nwhich case the tax effect is recognised directly in equity.\nBancoPosta RFC is not a separate legal person and is not either directly or indirectly assessable to taxes. BancoPosta’s share of \ntaxes on Poste Italiane SpA’s overall income is charged to BancoPosta RFC based on the profit or loss presented in this Separate \nReport adjusted for deferred taxation. In the case of both IRES and IRAP, the computation takes all permanent and temporary \nchanges in BancoPosta’s operations into account. Any items not directly relating to BancoPosta are included in the Poste Italiane \ncomputation.\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities form part of intersegment relations and are presented in the Separate Report in “Other assets” \nand “Other liabilities”, as they are settled with the segment of Poste Italiane SpA outside the ring-fence, within the scope of inter-\nnal relations with Poste Italiane SpA, which continues to be the sole taxable entity.\n10 – Provisions for risks and charges \nProvisions for risks and charges are recorded to cover losses that are either probable or certain to be incurred, for which, howev-\ner, there is an uncertainty as to the amount or as to the date on which they will occur. Provisions for risks and charges are made \nwhen the entity has a present (legal or constructive) obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of \nresources will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured on the basis of management’s best estimate of the \nuse of resources required to settle the obligation. The value of the liability is discounted, where the time effect of money is rele-\nvant, at a rate that reflects current market values and takes into account the risks specific to the liability. Provisions are reviewed \nat each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the expected charge to meet existing obligations at the \nreporting date. Any effect of the passage of time and the effect of changes in interest rates are shown in the statement of profit \nor loss under net allocations in the year. With regard to the risks for which the occurrence of a liability is only possible, specific \ninformation is provided without making any provision. Under the option granted by the relevant accounting standards, limited \ndisclosure is provided when, in rare cases, disclosure of some or all of the information regarding the risks in question could seri-\nously prejudice BancoPosta RFC’s position in a dispute or in ongoing negotiations with third parties.\n11 – Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost \na) recognition and classification criteria\nBancoPosta RFC has no outstanding debt securities and has not issued any such securities since its establishment. The sub-\nitems Due to banks and Due to customers consist of funding provided by customers and obtained from the interbank market. \nThese financial liabilities are recognised at fair value on the date of receipt of the funds. Fair value is normally the amount received.\nSection\nSummary"

Performance obligations can be fulfilled:\n\t– “at a point in time”: in the case of obligations fulfilled at a point in time, revenue is recognised only as control over the \ngood or service is passed to the customer. In that respect, consideration is given not only to the significant exposure \nto the risks and benefits related to the good or service but also physical possession, customer’s acceptance, the \nexistence of legal rights, etc.;\n\t– “over time”: in the case of obligations fulfilled over time, the measurement and recognition of revenue reflect, virtually, \nthe progress of the customer’s satisfaction. An appropriate approach is defined to measure progress of the perfor-\nmance obligation (the output method).\nEvery single supplier obligation with the customer is considered, measured and recognised separately. This approach involves a \npreliminary accurate analysis of the contract to identify every “single product/service” or every “single component” of a product/\nservice that the supplier promises to provide, attributing to each the relevant consideration, and to monitor each such obligation \nduring the life of the contract (in terms both of manner and timing of fulfilment and the customer’s level of satisfaction).\nFor revenue recognition purposes, so-called variable components of the consideration (discounts, rebates, price concessions, \nincentives, penalties and other similar) are included to supplement or adjust the transaction price. Among the variable components \nof the consideration, of particular importance are the penalties (other than those provided for compensation for damages), which \nIFRS 15 provides to be recorded as a direct decrease in revenue, instead of allocating them to a provision for risks and charges. \nIn the presence of multiple performance obligations, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation to the \nextent of the consideration that the entity is entitled to receive for the transfer of the relevant goods and services to the customer. \nThe transaction price will be allocated on the basis of the standalone selling price of the goods and services associated with the \nperformance obligation. The standalone selling price is the price at which an entity would sell the goods and services separately \nto the customer, under similar circumstances and to similar customers. If the standalone selling price is not observable, the \nCompany would need to estimate it considering all the information available (market conditions, information on the customer or \nthe class of customers) and the estimation methods used in similar circumstances.\nRevenue from activities carried out in favour of or on behalf of the state is recognised on the basis of the amount effectively \naccrued, with reference to the laws and agreements in force, taking account, in any event, of the provisions contained in legis-\nlation regarding the public finances. Returns on the portion of current account deposits deposited with the MEF are determined \non an accruals basis, using the effective interest rate method, and classified in “Item 10 – Interest and similar income”. The same \nclassification is applied to income from Euro zone government bonds, in which deposits paid into accounts by private customers \nand tax credits Law no. 77/2020 are invested. \nMoreover, dividends are recognised in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established, which generally corre-\nsponds with approval of the distribution by the shareholders of the investee company.\nSection\nSummary"

The method utilised is the “General deterioration model”, whereby:\n \nz if on the reporting date the credit risk of a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a \n12-month ECL is recognised (stage 1). Interest on the instrument is calculated on the gross carrying amount (amortised cost \ninclusive of the ECL); \n \nz if on the reporting date the credit risk of the financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, a lifetime \nECL is recognised (stage 2). Interest on the instrument is calculated on the gross carrying amount (amortised cost inclusive \nof the ECL); \n \nz if the financial instrument is impaired, or shows objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date, impairment will con-\ntinue to be recognised over the lifetime of the financial instrument (stage 3). Interest is recognised on amortised cost, that is \nexposure value - determined using the effective interest rate - adjusted for expected losses.\nIn determining whether credit risk has increased significantly, it is necessary to compare the risk of default of the financial instru-\nment as at the reporting date with the risk of default of the financial instrument on initial recognition.\nHowever, there is a rebuttable default presumption if the financial instrument is more than 90 days past due, unless there is rea-\nsonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a default criterion with greater lag is more appropriate.\nOn the other hand, a simplified approach to measure the loss provisions is applied to trade receivables that do not contain a \nsignificant financing component pursuant to IFRS 15. The simplified approach is based on a matrix of observed historical losses. \nFor a detailed description of the approaches, reference is made to Part E – Section 1 – Credit risk.\nTax credits Law no. 77/2020 \nThe tax credits were acquired by Poste Italiane SpA and allocated to BancoPosta against free capital resources as well as resourc-\nes subject256 and not subject to the restriction of use in accordance with the provisions of the “Decreto Rilancio” (Law Decree \nno. 34/2020 converted with amendments by Law no. 77/2020) by which tax breaks were introduced to support Citizens and \nBusinesses to encourage economic recovery following the Covid-19 health emergency. The main features of these tax credits are: \n(i) the possibility of use in offsetting; (ii) transferability to third-party purchasers; and (iii) non-refundability by the tax Authorities.\nThe tax credits are allocated to BancoPosta at acquisition cost and upon maturity of the individual units are transferred to Poste \nItaliane SpA at their nominal value for the relevant offsetting, as the BancoPosta RFC do not have legal personality and are not \nautonomously subject to direct or indirect taxation.\nFor said receivables, since it is not possible to identify an accounting framework directly applicable to this case, in compliance with \nthe provisions of IAS 8, an accounting policy was defined, suitable for providing relevant and reliable information aimed at ensuring \na faithful representation of the financial position, income and cash flows and which reflects the economic substance and not merely \nthe form of the transaction. On the basis of the analyses performed and the documents published by the main Italian supervisory \nbodies257, although the definition of financial assets in IAS 32 is not directly applicable to this case, it is considered that an accounting \nmodel based on IFRS 9 represents the most appropriate accounting policy since:\na.\t at inception, an asset as defined by the Conceptual Framework arises in the transferee’s financial statements;\nb.\tthey may be used to offset a payable that is usually settled in cash (tax payables), and exchanged for other financial assets on \nterms that may be potentially favourable to the entity;\nc.\t a business model can be identified (Hold to Collect, Hold to Collect and Sell or other business models). \nConsequently, these receivables are recorded at the date of purchase at their fair value (coinciding with the price paid) and subse-\nquently measured:\n256. \u0007With the conversion into Law no. 106 of 23 July 2021 of Law Decree no. 73 of 25 May 2021, BancoPosta RFC is allowed, as part of the 50% of its funding from private \ncustomers that can be invested in securities guaranteed by the Italian State, to use up to 30% of this portion to purchase tax credits.\n257. \u0007On 5 January 2021, the Bank of Italy, Consob and IVASS published Document no. 9 of the Coordination Round-Table Group on the application of IAS/IFRS “Accounting \ntreatment of tax credits associated with the “Cura Italia” and “Rilancio” Law Decrees acquired as a result of disposal by direct beneficiaries or previous purchasers”.\nSummary\nSection"

When the financial asset is derecognised, the related cumulative gains and losses recognised in OCI \nare reclassified to profit or loss in “Item 100 – Profits/(Losses) on disposal or repurchase”.\nAs specified by the joint document of the Authorities, taking into account that purchased tax credits do not represent tax assets, \ngovernment grants, intangible assets or financial assets under international accounting standards, the most appropriate classifi-\ncation for the purposes of presentation in the financial statements is the residual classification in “Item 120 - Other Assets” in the \nStatement of financial position. The related remuneration is recognised to the Statement of profit or loss under “Item 10 - Interest \nand similar income”.\nRepurchase agreements\nAny securities received as part of a transaction entailing subsequent re-sale and the delivery of securities as part of a transaction \nentailing their subsequent repurchase are not either recognised or derecognised. Consequently, in the case of securities pur-\nchased under a resale agreement, the amount paid is recognised as an amount due from customers or banks under Financial \nassets measured at amortised cost; in the case of securities sold under a repurchase agreement, the liability is recognised as an \namount due to banks or customers under Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. The transactions described are subject \nto offsetting if, and only if, they are carried out with the same counterparty, have the same maturity and offsetting is provided for \nin the contract.\nRelated parties\nRelated parties within the Poste Italiane Group are Poste Italiane SpA’s functions outside the ring-fence and Poste Italiane SpA’s \ndirect and indirect subsidiaries and associates. \nRelated parties external to the Group include the MEF and its direct and indirect subsidiaries and associates. Related parties \nalso include Poste Italiane SpA’s key management personnel and the funds representing post-employment benefit plans for the \npersonnel of BancoPosta RFC and its related parties. The state and public sector entities other than the MEF are not classified \nas related parties. Related party transactions do not include those deriving from financial assets and liabilities represented by \ninstruments traded on organised markets.\nEmployee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits are those that will be fully paid within twelve months of the end of the year in which the employ-\nee provided his or her services. Such benefits include wages, salaries, social security contributions, holiday pay and sick pay.\nThe undiscounted value of short-term employee benefits, to be paid to employees in consideration of employment services \nprovided over the relevant period, is accrued as personnel expenses.\nPost-employment benefits consist of two types: \n \nz Defined benefit plans\nDefined benefit plans include employee termination benefits payable to employees in accordance with art. 2120 of the Italian \nCivil Code for the part accrued until 31 December 2006. In fact, following the reform of the supplementary pension fund, \nfrom 1 January 2007 vesting employee termination benefits (TFR) must be paid into a supplementary pension fund or into \na Treasury Fund set up by INPS. Accordingly, BancoPosta RFC’s defined benefit liability is applicable only to the provisions \nmade up to 31 December 2006258.\nUnder these plans, given that the amount of the benefit to be paid is only quantifiable following the termination of employment, \nthe related effects on profit or loss or the financial position are recognised on the basis of actuarial calculations in compliance \n258. \u0007Where, following entry into effect of the new legislation, the employee has not exercised any option regarding the investment of vested employee termination benefits, the \nCompany has remained liable to pay the benefits until 30 June 2007, or until the date, between 1 January 2007 and 30 June 2007, on which the employee exercised a \nspecific option.

In particular, the liability to be paid on cessation of employment is calculated using the projected unit credit \nmethod and then discounted to recognise the time value of money prior to the liability being settled. The liability recognised \nin the Separate Report is based on calculations performed by independent actuaries. The calculation takes into account the \nemployee termination benefits accrued for work already performed and is based on actuarial assumptions that mainly con-\ncern: demographic assumptions (e.g. employee turnover and mortality) and financial assumptions (such as rate of inflation \nand a discount rate consistent with that of the liability). As BancoPosta RFC is not liable for employee termination benefits \naccruing after 31 December 2006, the actuarial calculation of employee termination benefits no longer takes account of future \nsalary increases. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity at the end of each reporting period, based on the \ndifference between the carrying amount of the liability and the present value of the BancoPosta RFC’s obligations at the end \nof the period, due to changes in the actuarial assumptions. \n \nz Defined contribution plans\nEmployee termination benefits payable pursuant to art. 2120, Italian Civil Code fall within the scope of defined contribution \nplans provided they vested subsequent to 1 January 2007 and were paid into a Supplementary Pension Fund or a Treasury \nFund at INPS. Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised in profit or loss when incurred, based on their nom-\ninal value.\nTermination benefits payable to employees are recognised as a liability when BancoPosta RFC gives a binding commitment, \nalso on the basis of consolidated relationships and mutual undertakings with union representatives, to terminate the employment \nof an employee, or group of employees, prior to the normal retirement date or, alternatively, an employee or group of employees \naccepts an offer of benefits in consideration of a termination of employment. Termination benefits payable to employees are \nimmediately recognised as personnel expenses. \nOther long-term employee benefits consist of benefits not payable within twelve months of the end of the reporting period \nduring which the employees provided their services. The net change in the value of any of the components of the liability during \nthe reporting period is recognised in full in profit or loss. \nShare-based payments\nShare-based payment transactions may be settled in cash, equity instruments, or other financial instruments. In the event of \nshare-based payment transactions BancoPosta RFC is required to measure the goods or services acquired and the liability \nincurred at fair value.\nIn the case of cash-settled share-based payment transactions:\n \nz a liability is recognised as a matching entry at cost; \n \nz if the fair value of the goods or services received or acquired cannot be reliably determined, this value must be estimated \nindirectly on the basis of the fair value of the liability;\n \nz the fair value of the liability must be remeasured at the end of each reporting period, recognising any changes in fair value in \nprofit or loss, until it is extinguished.\nIn the case of equity-settled share-based payment transactions:\n \nz an increase in shareholders’ equity is recorded as a matching entry at cost;\n \nz if the fair value of the goods or services received or acquired cannot be reliably determined, this value must be estimated \nindirectly on the basis of the fair value of the equity instruments granted at the grant date.\nIn the event of benefits granted to employees, recognition should take place in “Item 160 a) – Personnel expenses” over the \nperiod in which the employees render service and the expense accounted for. \nPerpetual subordinated loan\nThe perpetual subordinated loan is classified as an equity instrument, in view of the fact that BancoPosta RFC has the uncondi-\ntional right to defer repayment of the principal and payment of the coupons until the date of its liquidation. Therefore, the amount \nreceived from Poste Italiane SpA is recognised as an increase in the shareholders’ equity; conversely, repayments of principal \nand payments of coupons due (at the time the related contractual obligation arises) are recognised as a decrease in the share-\nholders’ equity. \nSummary\nSection"

The preparation of these estimates involves the \nuse of available information and the adoption of subjective assessments, also based on historical experience, used for the for-\nmulation of reasonable assumptions for the recognition of operating events. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed \nand the impact of any changes is reflected in the financial statements for the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision \nonly influences the current period, or also in future periods if the revision influences both current and future periods. Due to their \nnature, the estimates and assumptions used may vary from year to year and, therefore, it cannot be excluded that in subsequent \nyears, the values recorded in this Separate Report may also vary significantly as a result of changes in the subjective valuations \nused.\nBelow is a description of the accounting treatments that require greater subjectivity in the preparation of estimates, also taking \ninto account the geopolitical uncertainty arising from the war between the European countries Russia-Ukraine and the particular \nnature of the macroeconomic environment of reference recorded during the year.\nImpairment and stage allocation\nFor the purposes of calculating impairment and determining the stage allocation, the main factors estimated are as follows, relat-\ning to the internal model developed for Sovereign, Banking and Corporate counterparties:\n \nz estimates of ratings by counterparty;\n \nz estimation of the probability of default “PD” for counterparties.\nWith regard to trade receivables, on the other hand, stage allocation is not applied in accordance with the Simplified Approach. \nImpairment, for these items in the financial statements, is based on:\n \nz analytical impairment: when a defined credit threshold is exceeded, the individual credit position is analytically monitored on \nthe basis of internal or external evidence; or\n \nz forfeit impairment: elaboration of a provision matrix for historical losses.\nFor further details see Part E - Credit risk.\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nThe main factors in the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers include elements of variable consideration, par-\nticularly penalties (other than those related to compensation for damages). Elements of variable consideration are identified at \nthe inception of the contract and estimated as of every close of the accounts for the entire contract term, to take into account \nnew circumstances and changes in the circumstances already considered for the previous estimations. Elements of variable \nconsideration include refund liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets is based on the expectation of taxable income in future years. Assessments of expected \ntaxable income depend on factors which may change over time, impacting on the valuation of the deferred tax assets in the \nSeparate Report.\nSection\nSummary"

This policy sets out the general principles and rules to \nbe applied in determining fair value for the purposes of preparing the financial statements, conducting risk management assess-\nments and supporting the market transactions carried out by the Finance departments of the various Group entities. The general \nprinciples for measuring financial instruments at fair value have not changed since 31 December 2021. These principles have \nbeen defined in compliance with indications from the various (banking and insurance) regulators and the relevant accounting \nstandards, ensuring consistent application of the valuation techniques adopted at Group level.

For BancoPosta RFC, the financial instruments \nincluded in this category consist of bonds issued by the Italian government, the German and French governments, the valuation \nof which is based on the bid prices, according to a hierarchy of sources where the MTS (the wholesale electronic market for \ngovernment securities) ranks first, MILA (Milan Stock Exchange) second, for bonds intended for retail customers, and the CBBT \n(Composite Bloomberg Bond Trader) third. Level 1 bond price quotations incorporate a credit risk component.\nLevel 2: this level is comprised of fair values based on inputs other than Level 1 quoted market prices that are either directly or \nindirectly observable for the asset or liability259. For BancoPosta RFC, these include the following types of financial instrument:\n \nz Straight Italian and international government and non-government bonds, quoted on inactive markets or unquoted;\n \nz Unquoted equities;\n \nz Derivative financial instruments;\n \nz Reverse Repos; \n \nz Financial liabilities either quoted on inactive markets or unquoted comprised of funding Repos. \nLevel 3: this category includes the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities using inputs which cannot be observed, in \naddition to Level 2 inputs.

The price inferred in \nthis manner is adjusted through the application of a discount, quoted by primary market counterparties, representing the cost \nimplicit in the process to align the value of the unquoted shares to the quoted ones.\n \nz Derivative financial instruments:\n\t– Plain vanilla interest rate swaps: valued using discounted cash flow techniques, involving the computation of the pres-\nent value of future differentials between the receiver and payer legs of the swap. The construction of yield curves to \nestimate future cash flows indexed to market parameters (money market rates and/or inflation) and computation of the \npresent value of future differentials are carried out using techniques commonly used in capital markets.\n\t– Interest rate swaps with an embedded option: valuation is based on a building block approach, entailing decompo-\nsition of a structured position into its basic components: the linear and option components. The linear component is \nmeasured using the discounted cash flow techniques described for plain vanilla interest rate swaps above. Using the \nderivatives held in BancoPosta RFC’s portfolio as an example, the option component is derived from interest rate or \ninflation rate risks and is valued using a closed form expression, as with classical option valuation models with under-\nlyings exposed to such risks. \n\t– Bond forwards: valuation is based on the present value of the differential between the forward price of the underlying \ninstrument as of the measurement date and the settlement price.\n259. \u0007Given the nature of BancoPosta RFC’s operations, the observable data used as input to determine the fair value of the various instruments include, for example, quoted \nprices provided by third parties (pricing or brokerage services), yield and inflation curves, exchange rates provided by the European Central Bank, ranges of rate volatility, \ninflation option premiums, interest rate swap spreads or credit default spreads which represent the creditworthiness of specific counterparties and any liquidity adjustments \nquoted by primary market counterparties.\n260.

The yield curve used to compute present value is selected to be consistent with the manner in \nwhich cash collateral is remunerated. This approach is also followed for security in the form of pledged debt securities, given the \nlimited level of credit risk inherent in the securities held as collateral by BancoPosta RFC.\n \nz Reverse Repos: are valued using discounted cash flow techniques involving the computation of future contractual cash flows. \nReverse Repos may also be used for collateral and in such cases fair value need not be adjusted for the counterparty’s credit \nrisk.\n \nz Financial liabilities either quoted on inactive markets or not at all, consisting of repurchase agreements used to raise finance \nare valued using discounted cash flow techniques involving the computation of future contractual cash flows. Repos may also \nbe used for collateral and in such cases fair value need not be adjusted for the counterparty’s credit risk.\nLevel 3: the following categories of financial instruments belong to this level:\n \nz Unquoted equities for which no price is observable directly or indirectly in the market.

The spread remains fixed for the life of the instrument.\nA.4.2 Measurement processes and sensitivities\nThe processes used in recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements of instruments classified in Level 3 are described in \nparagraphs A.4.1 and A.4.5, respectively, of Part A. \nSensitivity analysis of recurring fair value measurements classified in Level 3 of the hierarchy is conducted for the Series C Visa \nIncorporated Convertible Participating Preferred Stock. Measurement of these financial instruments is in fact subject to change \nfollowing alterations that may occur in the discount factor applied in determining fair value, in order to take into account the illiquid \nnature of the shares. This discount factor, estimated using an internal valuation technique, is above all influenced by the annual \nvolatility of the underlying shares. Applying the maximum volatility according to the technique used, the potential reduction in fair \nvalue could reach approximately 31.14%.\nA.4.3 Fair value hierarchy\nThe main factors contributing to transfers between fair value levels include changes in the observability of significant inputs and \nmarket conditions (including the liquidity parameter) and refinements in the valuation models used in measuring fair value. \nFor all classes of assets and liabilities, the transfer from one level to another occurs on the date of the event or change in circum-\nstances that led to the transfer. \nInformation on transfers during the period is provided in Part A.4.5 - Fair Value Hierarchy. \nA.4.4 Other information\nThere is no need to provide the additional disclosures required by IFRS 13, paragraphs 51, 93(h) and 96.\nSummary\nSection"

      "text": "Poste Italiane’s Financial Statements at 31 December 2022\nNotes\n865\nPart E – Information on risks and related hedging \npolicies\nIntroduction\nBancoPosta RFC’s operations, conducted in accordance with Presidential Decree 144/2001, consist in the management of \nliquidity generated by postal current account deposits, carried out in the name of BancoPosta but subject to statutory restric-\ntions, and collections and payments on behalf of third parties. \nThe funds deposited by private account holders in postal current accounts are invested in euro zone government securities272, \nwhilst deposits by Public Administration entities are deposited with the MEF. \nIn 2022, BancoPosta RFC’s operations focused on investment of the significantly increased volume of current account deposits, \nthe reinvestment of funds deriving from maturing government securities and in the active management of financial instruments. \nThe 2022 financial year was characterised by an increase in yields on Italian government bonds (the 10-year BTP went from \n1.17% to 4.72%), which brought the BTP-Bund spread to 214 basis points compared to 135 last year. These movements led \nto a reduction in the price of securities.\nBancoPosta’s capital structure, which is subject to the prudential provisions introduced with the third update of Bank of Italy \nCircular 285/2013, is particularly solid due to its CET1 ratio, which stood at 20.3% at 31 December 2022. With reference to the \nLeverage Ratio, the latter had a value, again at year-end, of 2.9%; the evolution of the indicator compared to 31 December 2021 \nwas affected by the loss of the benefits of the sterilisation of deposits in “Cash and deposits with the central bank”, applied until \nthe first quarter of 2022 due to the Covid emergency.\nThe investment profile is based on the constant monitoring of habits of current account holders and the use of a statistical/\neconometric model that forecasts the interest rates and maturities typical of postal current accounts. Accordingly, the portfolio \ncomposition aims to replicate the financial structure of current accounts by private customers. Management of the relationship \nbetween the structure of deposits and investments is handled through an appropriate Asset & Liability Management system. \nThe above-mentioned system is thus the general reference for the investments (the limits of which are determined by specific \nguidelines approved by the Board of Directors) in order to limit exposure to interest rate and liquidity risks. \nFinancial risk management\nBalanced financial management and monitoring of the main risk/return profiles are carried out and ensured by dedicated organ-\nisational structures, both within and without the BancoPosta ring-fence, that operate separately and independently. In addition, \nspecific processes are in place governing the assumption and management of and control over financial risks, including through \nthe progressive implementation of adequate IT tools. In this context, the Internal Control and Risk Management System Guideline \n(SCIGR), approved by the Board of Directors on 16 February 2021, represents the regulatory tool for the integrated regulation of \nthe Internal Control and Risk Management System of BancoPosta RFC. From an organisational viewpoint, the model consists of:\n \nz the Control and Risk Committee, established in 2015 within the Board, has the task of supporting, through an appropriate \ninvestigative, proposal-making and advisory activity, the evaluations and decisions of the Board of Directors on the internal \ncontrol and risk management system and on the approval of the relative periodic financial and non-financial reports;\n \nz the Financial and Insurance Services Committee, established on 19 March 2018 to replace the previous Finance, Savings \nand Investment Committee, with the aim of overseeing the process of developing the products and services distributed by \nBancoPosta, in order to take a uniform, integrated view of the entire offering and to monitor the performance of the financial \ninvestments in which private customer deposits are invested;\n272. \u0007The funds raised by private customers on postal current accounts must be used in euro area government securities and, for a portion not exceeding 50% of the funds raised, \nin other securities backed by the Italian government guarantee (as provided by Law no. 296 of 27 December 2006, and subsequent amendments provided by the 2015 \nStability Law, no. 190 of 23 December 2014). With the conversion into Law no. 106 of 23 July 2021 of Law Decree no. 73 of 25 May 2021, BancoPosta RFC is allowed, \nas part of the 50% of its funding from private customers that can be invested in securities guaranteed by the Italian State, to use up to 30% of this portion to purchase \ntransferable tax credits pursuant to Law Decree no. 34/2020 (the so-called “Decreto Rilancio”) or other transferable tax credits pursuant to current legislation.\t\nSection\nSummary"

It thus represents the risk that the debtor is partially or entirely \nunable to repay the principal and interest due.\nCounterparty risk is the risk that a counterparty could default on obligations of a financial instrument during its term. This risk is \ninherent in certain types of transaction which, for BancoPosta RFC, would be derivatives and repurchase agreements.\nConcentration risk is related to the overexposure to counterparties, groups of related counterparties and counterparties in the \nsame business segment or that engage in the same business or operate in the same geographic region.\nQualitative information\n1. Generalities\nPresidential Decree 144/2001 prohibits BancoPosta RFC from making loans to members of the public. As a result, there are no \ncredit policies.\nThe nature of BancoPosta RFC’s operations, however, results in a considerable concentration of exposure to Republic of Italy \nrisk, as a result of its investments in Government securities and its deposits at the MEF. Credit risk models, explained below, \nshow, however, that for capital requirements this type of investment does not determine capital absorption.\nSummary\nSection"

Credit risk management policies\n2.1 Organisational aspects\nThe role of BancoPosta RFC’s Risk Management function is the management and control of credit, counterparty and concen-\ntration risks. \nMonitoring credit risk is particularly focused on the following exposures:\n \nz euro area government securities or other securities backed by the Italian State for the use of liquidity collected through current \naccounts from private customers; \n \nz deposits at the MEF in which Public Administration and private account deposits are invested;\n \nz any eventual amounts due from the Treasury as a result of depositing funds gathered less payables for advances disbursed; \n \nz items in progress: cheque clearing, use of electronic cards, collections;\n \nz temporarily overdrawn postal current accounts caused by debiting fees: limited to those which were not classified as impaired \nsince the accounts were in funds in early 2023; \n \nz cash collateral for outstanding transactions with banks and customers, in accordance with agreements intended to mitigate \ncounterparty risk (GMRA – Global Master Repurchase Agreements);\n \nz cash collateral provided to the guarantee fund of the Central Counterparty “Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia” for repur-\nchase agreement transactions; \n \nz cash deposits from collateralisation for centrally margined derivatives transactions through clearing brokers;\n \nz trade receivables payable by partners in relation to financial/insurance product placement.\nMonitoring counterparty risk particularly regards hedging derivatives and repurchase agreements.\nBancoPosta RFC’s concentration risk is monitored to limit the instability that could be caused by the default of one customer or \na group of related customers to which BancoPosta has a significant credit and counterparty risk exposure.\n2.2 Management, measurement and control systems\nCredit risk is controlled through the following:\n \nz minimum rating requirements for issuers/counterparties, based on the type of instrument;  \n \nz concentration limits per issuer/counterparty; \n \nz monitoring of changes in the ratings of counterparties.\nThe limits for BancoPosta RFC’s financial transactions contain rating limits that only permit dealings with investment grade coun-\nterparties. The limits referred to above have been established by the “Guidelines on Poste Italiane SpA’s financial management” \nfor BancoPosta RFC. Specifically, as regards rating limits, transactions are allowed solely with investment grade counterparties \nand euro area government issuers with a rating at least equal to that of the Italian Republic.\nWith reference to the monitoring thresholds of concentration risk, the limits set by prudential regulations are applied273. \nThe standardised approach274 as defined by EU Regulation 575/2013, is used by BancoPosta to measure credit and counter-\nparty risks. Application of this method entails the use of Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch and DBRS for the computation of \ncounterparty credit rating classes. \nIn terms of prudential oversight, the following methods are used to estimate the exposure to counterparty risk inherent in each \nof the following types of transaction:\n273. \u0007According to prudential regulations, with reference to the rules on Large Exposures, risk-weighted assets must remain below 25% of own funds. As a rule, exposures are \nrecognised at nominal value, taking into consideration any credit risk mitigation techniques. To take into account the lower risk related to the nature of the borrower, more \nfavourable weighting factors are applied.\n274. \u0007The standardised approach entails risk weightings in accordance with the nature of the exposure and the identity of the counterparty and the counterparty’s external credit \nrating.\nSection\nSummary"

In the development account was taken of specific indexation assumptions for every asset class (fixed income securities, \nvariable-rate securities, inflation-indexed securities, etc.);\n \nz TF: the effective interest rate of each exposure was used as discount factor.\nThe collective impairment of a homogenous group of financial assets defines the expected credit loss (ECL) of the instrument, \neven though it cannot be associated with a specific exposure. Grouping takes place in relation to the type of counterparty on the \nbasis of the estimated PD.\nBancoPosta RFC elected not to adopt the low risk credit exemption and to proceed instead with the staging of the financial \ninstruments concerned.\nBased on the impairment models described above, to allocate properly performing exposures in stage 1 or stage 2, the signifi-\ncant increase in exposures other than trade receivables is determined on the basis of the change in notches between the rating \nat the time of investment and the rating at the reporting date.\nThis change in notches is compared with a threshold that takes into account the following factors:\n \nz the rating of the financial instrument at the time of investment;\n \nz the rating of the financial instrument at the reporting date;\n \nz the seniority of the position within the portfolio (vintage factor);\n275. \u0007According to this methodology, the risk exposure of derivatives is calculated through the sum, increased by 40%, of the following two components: the replacement cost, \nrepresented by the fair value of derivatives considering the effect of collateral provided and received, and the add-on, calculated on the basis of the contractual characteristics \nof the derivatives, including the notional amount, maturity and reference risk driver.\n276. \u0007The full CRM method entails reducing risk exposure by the value of the guarantee. Specific rules are applied to take into account market price volatility of the guaranteed \nasset as well as the collateral received.\nSummary\nSection"

In particular, prospective \nestimates made available by the International Monetary Fund are used to calculate the PD of sovereign counterparties; with \nregard to other counterparties, on the other hand, the internal model adopted allows the input dataset needed to calculate PD \nto be completed from scenario values referring to some of the model variables. The objective of the approach is to estimate the \nunknown variables by using the historical correlation of the available information279.\nAs to the estimation techniques used, it is noted that since the approaches to calculate the PD for Sovereign, Banking and \nCorporate counterparties cannot use default events, as they are not frequent, a shadow rating approach was adopted.\nThis method entails the use of target variables related to the level of external rating produced by the agencies. The target could \nbe directly the rating or, alternatively, the default rate linked to the rating level. A key rating agency was selected to construct the \ntarget, taking into account both the large number of rated counterparties and the availability of historical data over what was \ndeemed to be an adequate period of time.\nThe models have been constructed by extracting and utilising the following types of data for each country in the sample:\n \nz macroeconomic data; \n \nz market data: domestic equity indices, global energy/non-energy indices, Eurostoxx and S&P 500; \n \nz financial statement data.\nFor trade receivables BancoPosta applies the simplified approach, where no significant increase in credit risk is expected. \nHowever, the loss provisions are calculated for an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss.\nSuch approach is implemented through the following process:\n \nz based on total revenue or the historical credit exposure, a credit threshold is identified beyond which the single receivables or \nthe single exposure is evaluated. The analytical evaluation of the exposures entails an analysis of the borrower’s credit quality \nand solvency, as determined on the basis of internal and external supporting evidence;\n \nz for receivables falling below the threshold set, through the preparation of a matrix with the different impairment percentages \nestimated on the basis of historical losses, where they exist, or alternatively on the historical pattern of collections. In con-\nstructing the impairment matrix, receivables are grouped by homogeneous categories, based on their characteristics, to take \ninto account the historical loss experience.\n277. The additive factor is built in view of the rating level at the reporting date, where the better the rating the higher the threshold for the transition to Stage 2.\n278. \u0007The judgemental factor can summarise significant aspects in determining the significant increase of credit risk, considering such elements as: \n•\tan actual or expected significant change of the internal/external credit rating of the financial instrument; \n•\tactual or expected negative changes in economic, financial or business conditions that might cause a significant change in the borrower’s ability to honour its obligations, \nsuch as an actual or expected increase in interest rates or an actual or expected significant increase in the unemployment rate.\n279. In particular, the use of such approach is limited to situations where, actually, the final data are deemed to be no longer representative of the counterparty’s risk.\nSection\nSummary"

Specifically:\n \nz Fixed income instruments\nDebt instruments secured by guarantees or other credit risk mitigation instruments are bonds issued by CDP SpA guaranteed \nby the Italian State and subscribed by BancoPosta RFC, amounting to a nominal value of €3,000 million at 31 December 2022. \nThese are recognised as financial assets measured at amortised cost and, in determining the associated expected credit losses, \naccount was taken of the PD of the Italian Republic.\n \nz Derivative financial instruments and repurchase agreements\nIn order to limit the counterparty risk exposure, BancoPosta RFC has concluded standard ISDA master agreements (with attached \nCSA) and GMRAs which govern the collateralisation, in cash or government securities, of derivative transactions and repurchase \nagreements, respectively. In addition, as of 2021, BancoPosta RFC have started trading in OTC derivatives with Qualified Central \nCounterparty clearing for which specific margins are provided for through clearing brokers. With reference to repo transactions, \nin order to mitigate counterparty risk and gain readier access to the market, from December 2017, BancoPosta RFC has begun \nto enter into repurchase agreements with the Central Counterparty, the “Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia”. \nThe calculation of positions in derivatives and repurchase agreements and the related risk mitigation instruments are illustrated \nin Part B – Other Information, tables 5 and 6, to which reference is made.  \n \nz Trade receivables \nTo mitigate the risks arising from the extension of credit terms to its customers, BancoPosta RFC has implemented a policy and \nsuitable guidelines that govern the management of trade receivables, the terms and conditions of payment applicable to cus-\ntomers and defines the corporate process aimed at checking the customer’s creditworthiness, as well as the sustainability of the \nbusiness risk inherent in the contract involving extended payment terms. \nDepending on the evaluations, the contracts entered into with customers may require a suitable guarantee. Guarantees are also \nrequested if they are required by rules and regulations and/or implementing rules of specific services. \nBancoPosta RFC accepts mainly guarantees issued by primary banks or insurance companies. Alternatively, upon request of \nthe customer and after a risk analysis, it accepts sureties issued by other institutions, security deposits or the opening of postal \nescrow account.\nConsidering the limited risk of insolvency of government customers, BancoPosta RFC as a rule exempts the Public Administration \nfrom the provision of guarantees to secure trade receivables arising from transactions with it, save for the cases when such guar-\nantees are mandatory by law or due to implementing rules of specific services. \nAccordingly, the guarantees held are related mainly to private customers. \nFor all the exposures evaluated individually, to calculate the provisions for doubtful debts, guarantees reduce the amount of the \nexposure at risk. \nAt 31 December 2022, unsecured trade receivables minus the relevant loss provisions amount to €806 million.\nAt 31 December 2022, BancoPosta RFC does not hold financial assets secured by guarantees or other credit risk mitigat-\ning instruments for which no loss provisions have been made (except for the temporary use of liquidity in reverse repurchase \nagreements). \nThere was no impact from the Covid-19 pandemic on guarantees and other credit risk mitigation instruments.\nSummary\nSection"

This transaction \ndoes not meet the “trading intent” requirement, as defined by art. 104 of Regulation (EU) no. 575/2013, for classification in the \n“Regulatory trading book”; this intent is, however, excluded from the “Guidelines on Poste Italiane SpA’s financial management” \nfor BancoPosta RFC. \nInformation on the market risks associated with this transaction is provided in the “Banking Book” section”.\n2.2 Interest rate and price risks - banking book\nQualitative information\nA. Generalities, management policies and interest rate and price risk \nmeasurement methods\nInterest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is inherent in the operations of a financial institution and can affect income (cash flow interest rate risk) and the \nvalue of the firm (fair value interest rate risk). Movements in interest rate can affect the cash flows associated with variable rate \nassets and liabilities and the fair value of fixed rate instruments.\nCash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch – in terms of interest rate, interest rate resets and maturities – of financial \nassets and liabilities until their contractual maturity and/or expected maturity (banking book), with effects in terms of interest \nspreads and an impact on future results. This risk is of particular relevance to variable-rate assets and liabilities or assets and \nliabilities which have been transformed into variable rate by fair value hedges. \nFair value interest rate risk primarily refers to the effects of changes in interest rates on the price of fixed rate financial instruments \nor variable rate financial instruments converted to fixed rate via cash flow hedges and, to a lesser degree, the effects of changes \nin interest rates on the fixed components of variable-rate financial instruments or fixed rate financial instruments converted to \nvariable rate via fair value hedges. The impact of these effects is directly related to the financial instrument’s duration282. \n282. Duration is the indicator used to estimate the percentage change in price in response to a shift in market returns.\nSummary\nSection"

      "text": "Poste Italiane’s Financial Statements at 31 December 2022\nNotes\n885\nInterest rate risk on the banking book is measured internally using the economic value method. This results in a need to develop \nan amortisation schedule for the sight deposits consistent with its nature and to select a time horizon and confidence levels for \nthe estimates. A maximum time horizon (cut-off point) of 20 years is used for retail customer deposits, 10 years for business \ncustomer deposits and Postepay cards283, and 5 years for Public Administration deposits, based on a 99% confidence level. This \napproach entails the computation of an ALM rate risk through the determination of asset/liability.\nThe exposure to interest rate risk, as measured internally, is subject to stress tests of the principal risk factors – such as the \nduration of deposits, the value of assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position – that contribute to determining the \nmeasurement of exposure. In particular, the stress tests assumed include a reduction in the maximum maturity horizon (cut-off) \nfor on-demand funding and the revaluation of assets and liabilities under adverse market scenarios.\nInterest rate risk management and mitigation is based on the conclusions of the measurement of risk exposure and compliance \n- in line with the risk appetite and thresholds and limits established in the RAF - with financial operations guidelines as approved \nfrom time to time by the Board of Directors of Poste Italiane SpA.\nDetails on the risk management model are contained in the note on financial risks in Part E. \nBancoPosta RFC monitors market risk, including fair value interest rate and spread risks, inherent in financial assets measured \nat fair value through other comprehensive income and derivative financial instruments through the computation of Value at Risk \n(VaR) over a time horizon of 1 day at a 99% confidence level.\nSpread risk\nSpread risk regards commitments in euro area government securities or guaranteed by the Italian government and classified as \nfinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. 2022 witnessed an average increase in the yields on \nItalian government bonds compared with the previous year and, at 31 December 2022, the spread between ten-year Italian govern-\nment bonds and German bunds is approximately 214 bps, up on the figure for the previous year (135 bps at 31 December 2021). \nIn the reporting period, the transactions described above resulted in the portfolio of financial assets measured at fair value through \nother comprehensive income (notional of around €37 billion), held by BancoPosta RFC, in an overall net decrease in fair value \nof approximately €10.1 billion: this change was partly recognised in profit or loss for a negative amount of approximately €5.7 \nbillion relating to the change in the fair value of securities hedged against interest rate risk, whilst the negative change in the fair \nvalue of unhedged securities and the spread risk component (not hedged) was reflected in equity for approximately €4.4 billion.\nPrice risk\nPrice risk relates to financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. \nThis sensitivity analysis takes into account the main positions potentially exposed to the greatest risk of price movements. \nBancoPosta RFC monitors the price risk to which its shareholdings are exposed by computing Value at Risk (VaR) over a time \nhorizon of 1 day at a 99% confidence level.\n283. \u0007Since 1 October 2018, prepaid cards are the responsibility of PostePay SpA. The liquidity collected through these cards is transferred to BancoPosta, which invests it in \naccordance with the investment constraints imposed on other deposits from private customers. As such, for the purposes of specific risk analyses, the rationales related to \neach model underlying the different types of deposit inflow continue to apply.\nSection\nSummary"

This is due to the fact that changes in \ncredit spreads are not hedged and regard the entire securities portfolio, meaning both the fixed and variable-rate components. In \nthis latter case, in fact, fair value derivatives, used to convert variable rate instruments, hedge only the risk-free interest rate risk \nand not credit risk. This means that a change in the credit spread has an equal impact on both fixed and variable instruments. \nThe sensitivity to the spread285 has been calculated by applying a shift of +/- 100 bps to the yield curve for Italian government \nbonds.\nFair value spread risk\nAnalysis date\n(€m)\nNotional \nvalue*\nFair value\nChange in value\nNet interest and other \nbanking income\nEquity reserves before \ntaxation\n+100bps\n-100bps\n+100bps\n-100bps\n+100bps\n-100bps\n2022 effects\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through \nother comprehensive income\n   Fixed income securities\n37,489 \n33,161 \n(2,830)\n3,343 \n- \n- \n(2,830)\n3,343 \nAssets - Hedging derivatives\n1,806 \n350 \n78 \n(94)\n- \n- \n78 \n(94)\nLiabilities - Hedging derivatives\n2,793 \n(96)\n(156)\n166 \n- \n- \n(156)\n166 \nVariability at 31 December 2022\n42,088 \n33,415 \n(2,908)\n3,415 \n- \n- \n(2,908)\n3,415 \n2021 effects\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through \nother comprehensive income\n   Fixed income securities\n31,415 \n37,626 \n(4,305)\n5,198 \n- \n- \n(4,305)\n5,198 \nAssets - Hedging derivatives\n2,129 \n77 \n227 \n(264)\n- \n- \n227 \n(264)\nLiabilities - Hedging derivatives\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \nVariability at 31 December 2021\n33,544 \n37,703 \n(4,078)\n4,934 \n- \n- \n(4,078)\n4,934 \n*\t The settlement price of derivatives involving the exchange of principal (securities or other assets) has been indicated, as required by Bank of Italy Circular 262/2005.\nIt is worthy of note that any change in the spread would not entail any accounting effect on financial assets measured at amor-\ntised cost but would affect solely unrealised gains/losses. In other words, fixed income instruments measured at amortised cost, \nwhich at 31 December 2022 amounted to €27,699 million (nominal value of €28,304 million) and have a fair value of €23,651 \nmillion, would be reduced in fair value by approximately €2.45 billion following an increase in the spread of 100 bps, with the \nchange not reflected in the accounts.\nMovements in the spread have no impact on BancoPosta RFC’s ability to meet its capital requirements, as the fair value reserves \nare not included in the computation of own funds for supervisory purposes.\nIn addition to sensitivity analyses, BancoPosta RFC monitors fair value interest rate risk by computing maximum potential loss or \nVaR - Value at Risk. The results of the VaR analysis regarding the variability of spread risk are shown below.\n285. \u0007For sensitivity purposes, the swap rate curve and the BTP curve were used (10-year swap rate of 320 bps and the spread of the BTP compared to the 10-year swap rate \nof 151 bps).\nSection\nSummary"

In relation to this parameter, there is therefore no uncertainty \nresulting from the IBOR reform on 31 December 2022. These instruments are subject to daily collateralisation remunerated to \nEONIA (from 2022 ESTR + 8.5 bps).\nIn particular, BancoPosta RFC hold interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedge that have the “EURIBOR-indexed variable \n“leg” with a notional amount of €31,936 million. With particular reference to almost all of these instruments, the cash flows at \n31 December 2022 are discounted at the EONIA rate defined as ESTR plus 8.5 bps and not at the ESTR rate as defined in the \ncontracts in place with the counterparties.\nQualitative information\nA. Fair value hedges\nBancoPosta RFC has a government bond portfolio – made up of fixed income BTPs and inflation-linked BTPs – subject to move-\nments in fair value due to changes in interest rates and in the inflation rate.\nTo limit the effects of interest rates on fair value, BancoPosta RFC enters into interest rate swaps Over the Counter (OTC) to \nhedge the fair value of the bonds held in portfolio. The objective of these transactions is to have instruments that can offset \nchanges in fair value of the portfolio due to interest rate fluctuations and the rate of inflation. \nIn addition, BancoPosta RFC carry out transactions in repurchase agreements, on euro-government securities or with the guar-\nantee of the Italian state for various purposes, including to invest in government bonds, to meet liquidity needs arising from the \ndynamics of funding on current accounts, and to actively manage the treasury position and guarantee deposits for collateralisa-\ntion transactions. These transactions are mainly fixed-rate transactions and, therefore, are exposed to changes in fair value due \nto fluctuations in interest rates.\nTo limit the effects of interest rates on fair value, BancoPosta RFC enters into interest rate swaps Over the Counter (OTC) to \nhedge the fair value of the repos held in portfolio. \nSection\nSummary"

Cash flow hedges\nBancoPosta RFC enters into:\n \nz forward purchases of government bonds, to limit the exposure to interest rate risk deriving from the need to reinvest the \ncash generated by maturing bonds held in portfolio;\n \nz forward sales of government bonds to pursue the stabilisation of returns.\nThese derivatives qualify as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions.\nIn addition, BancoPosta RFC has a portfolio of inflation-linked BTPs subject to cash flow variability in relation to inflation.\nTo limit the effects of interest rates on cash flows, BancoPosta RFC enters into OTC interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows \nof the bonds held in portfolio. The objective of these transactions is to stabilise until maturity the return of the instrument, regard-\nless of movements of the variable parameter. \nC. Hedges of foreign operations\nBancoPosta RFC does not have a policy for hedges of foreign operations.\nD. Hedging instruments\nRegarding fair value hedge instruments, the main source of ineffectiveness is the use of different spreads/fixed rates287 in \ndetermining the fair value of the hypothetical derivative and the derivative actually entered into. In particular, to evaluate the \neffectiveness of the hedge relationship, for the hypothetical derivative use is made of the mid-market spread/fixed rate, which \nmakes the present value at the settlement date equal to zero, and for the actual derivative the interest rate agreed upon with \nthe counterparty. \nAs to cash flow hedge instruments, the main source of ineffectiveness is the use of the fixed income component used in deter-\nmining the fair value of the hypothetical derivative and the actual derivative. In particular, to evaluate the effectiveness of the \nhedge relationship use is made, for the hypothetical derivative, the fixed rate that makes the present value at the settlement date \nequal to zero while for the actual derivative the calculation is performed with the interest rate agreed upon with the counterparty. \nWith respect to the hedges of forecast transactions, no source of ineffectiveness was identified, as the forward prices of the \ncounterparties were assumed to be perfectly equal to the theoretical forward prices.\nE. Hedged items\nBancoPosta RFC designates as hedged items:\n \nz fixed-rate and index-linked bonds and repos at fixed rate, in connection to the fair value hedge policy;\n \nz inflation-linked bonds and forecast transactions, in connection with cash flow hedge policies.\nIn particular, in fair value hedges of Italian government bonds, the credit risk of the Italian Republic is not hedged and is set for \nthe duration of the swap. In addition, full hedges and partial hedges are implemented, with the start date equal to the date of \npurchase of the instrument (swap spot start) and after the purchase of the instrument (swap forward start), respectively.\nAs regards fair value hedges of repos, total hedges are implemented, with an immediate start date.\nRegarding fair value hedges, BancoPosta RFC evaluates the effectiveness of every hedging relationship in offsetting movements \nin fair value through a retrospective effectiveness test and a prospective effectiveness test288, using the approaches illustrated in \nthe following notes.\n287. For Repos, hedging is performed by defining the variable-rate component simply indexed to EURIBOR and the fixed-rate component incorporating market conditions.\n288. \u0007IAS 39 requires two effectiveness tests:\n•\tprospective effectiveness test: attests that the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in future periods;\n•\tretrospective effectiveness test: attests that the hedging relationship has been effective from inception to the reporting date.\nFor a hedge to be effective, the prospective effectiveness test must show that the hedge is highly effective in offsetting fair value or cash flow movements attributable to the \nhedged instrument during the designation period, while the result of the retrospective test must show offset ratios ranging from 80% to 125%. \nA hedge can be ineffective when the hedging instrument and the hedged item: are in different currencies; have different maturities; use different underlying interest rates; are \nexposed to different counterparty risks; and when the derivative is not equal to zero at inception. \nSummary\nSection"

      "text": "Poste Italiane’s Financial Statements at 31 December 2022\nNotes\n903\nThe retrospective effectiveness test is run by utilising the “dollar offset approach through the hypothetical derivative289”. With this \napproach, consideration is given to the hedge ratio of the change in fair value of the actual derivative to the change in fair value \nof the hypothetical derivative occurred between inception and the valuation date. The hedge is considered effective if the hedge \nratio falls in the interval between 80% and 125%. \nThe hypothetical derivative and the actual derivative have a settlement date consistent with the hedge inception (spot or forward \nstart - solely for government bonds) and differ solely in their spread/fixed rate which is considered, as already indicated, the main \nsource of ineffectiveness. The partial ineffectiveness of the hedge, equal to the difference between the changes in value of the \ntwo derivatives (hypothetical and actual) represents the net effect of the hedge recognised separately in profit or loss. \nFor the purposes of the prospective effectiveness test, different approaches have been applied, depending on the characteristics \nof the hedging swap. Specifically:\n \nz the “Critical terms290” approach for swap spot start, for which it has been determined at inception that the characteristics of \nthe fixed leg make it possible to replicate exactly the fixed cash flows generated by the hedged item;\n \nz the “Dollar offset through the hypothetical derivative” approach for forward start swaps and swaps hedging repurchase agree-\nments, for which the prospective effectiveness test is performed by calculating the hedge ratio between the change in fair \nvalue of the hypothetical derivative and the change in fair value of the actual derivative291. The hedge is considered effective if \nthe hedge ratio falls in the interval between 80% and 125%.\nRegarding cash flow hedges, BancoPosta RFC evaluates the effectiveness of the designated derivative in every hedging relation-\nship through a retrospective effectiveness test and a prospective effectiveness test.\nWith regards to the hedges of forecast transactions, the retrospective effectiveness test involves the calculation of a hedge ratio \ndefined as the ratio of the difference between the fair value of the forward transaction entered into with the counterparty on the \ntest and inception date and the present value of the difference between the theoretical forward price of the BTP calculated as \nof the test and inception date. Assuming a perfect match between the forward prices of the counterparties and the theoretical \nforward prices, the hedge ratio is always equal to 100%. As such, there are no sources of ineffectiveness.\nFor the purposes of the prospective effectiveness test, the critical terms approach is applied, considering at inception the con-\nsistency between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the basis of the qualitative characteristics of the contracts292.\nWith respect to inflation-linked bonds, the retrospective effectiveness test considers the hedge ratio between the change in fair \nvalue of the actual derivative to the change in fair value of the hypothetical derivative occurred between the date of inception and \nthe valuation date. The hedge is considered effective if the hedge ratio falls in the interval between 80% and 125%. \nThe hypothetical derivative and the actual derivative have the settlement date that matches the inception of the hedge and differ \nin terms of their fixed income component. Moreover, for the derivatives used to hedge inflation-linked BTP, the fair value at the \nsettlement date reflects also the interest accrued of the instrument accrued from the latest interest payment date to the date of \nsettlement of the derivative. As such, both are considered the main sources of ineffectiveness.\nThe change in fair value of the actual derivative is recognised through equity, for the effective portion of the hedge, while the \nchange in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognised through profit or loss.\nFor the purposes of the prospective effectiveness test, different approaches have been applied, depending on the characteristics \nof the hedging swap. Specifically:\n \nz the “Critical terms” approach for derivatives for which it has been determined at inception that the characteristics of the \nindexed leg of the swap make it possible to replicate exactly the variable cash flows generated by the hedged item;\n289. \u0007The dollar offset approach is a quantitative method that involves a comparison between movements in the fair value or cash flow of the hedging instrument and the \nmovements in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged instrument attributable to the risk hedged. Depending on the policy selected, this approach can be used:\n•\ton a cumulative basis, by observing the performance of the hedge since inception;\n•\ton a periodic basis, by comparing the hedge performance with that of the last test. \nThe dollar offset approach can be implemented through a hypothetical derivative, that is by constructing a theoretical derivative to compare the relevant theoretical movements \nin far value or cash flow with those of the hedged instrument (actual derivative).\n290. \u0007The critical terms approach involves a comparison between the critical terms of the hedging instrument with those of the hedged item. The hedging relationship is highly \neffective when all the critical terms of the two instruments match perfectly and there are no features or options that might invalidate the hedge. Critical terms include, for \nexample: notional amount of the derivative and principal of the underlying, credit risk, timing, currency of the cash flows. \n291. Calculated by assuming a parallel shift of +/- 100 bps of the yield curves.\n292. \u0007The notional amount of the forward contract must be set, at the settlement date, as equal to the nominal amount of the instrument in case of purchase, and equal or lower \nthan the nominal amount of the instrument in case of sale. The underlying of the forward contract must coincide with the instrument that must be purchased or sold (in this \ncase it must be an instrument in the portfolio) at the settlement date. The settlement date must be the same as the date on which the cash flow to be hedged is expected, \nin case of forward purchase, or must be related to the year in which the total return must be stabilised, in case of forward sale.\nSection\nSummary"

Financial and credit derivatives\nA.1 OTC financial and credit derivatives: net fair value by counterparty\nAt 31 December 2022 Banco Posta RFC had no master netting or similar agreements in place that meet the requirements of IAS \n32, paragraph 42, regarding offsetting financial assets and liabilities. At 31 December 2022, BancoPosta RFC had outstanding \nOTC derivatives transactions with Qualified Central Counterparty clearing through clearing brokers for a notional amount of €1 \nmillion.\nSection 4 – Liquidity risk\nQualitative information\nA. Generalities, management policies and liquidity risk measurement methods\nLiquidity risk is the risk that an entity may have difficulties in raising sufficient funds, at market conditions, to meet its obligations \nderiving from financial instruments. Liquidity risk may derive from the inability to sell financial assets quickly at an amount close \nto fair value or the need to raise funds at off-market rates. \nIt is policy to minimise liquidity risk through:\n \nz diversification of the various forms of short-term and long-term loans and counterparties;\n \nz gradual and consistent distribution of the maturities of medium/long-term loans;\n \nz use of dedicated analytical models to monitor the maturities of assets and liabilities;\n \nz the availability of the interbank markets as a source of repurchase agreement finance, with collateral in the form of securities \nheld in portfolio, due to the fact that such assets consist of financial instruments deemed to be highly liquid assets by current \nstandards.\nIn order to mitigate liquidity and market risk in the event of extreme market scenarios, from 26 June 2020 BancoPosta RFC may \naccess a three-year committed line of funding from Cassa Depositi e Prestiti for repurchase agreements of up to €4.25 billion.\nIn terms of BancoPosta RFC’s operations, liquidity risk regards the deposits in current accounts and prepaid cards294, in euro \nzone government bonds or guarantees by the Italian state or tax credits as well as the margins on derivative transactions. The \npotential risk derives from a mismatch between the maturities of investments in securities and in tax credits and those of liabilities, \nrepresented by current accounts where the funds are available on demand, thus compromising the ability to meet its obliga-\ntions to current account holders. This potential mismatch between assets and liabilities is monitored via comparison of loan and \ndeposit maturities, using the statistical model of the performance of current account deposits, in accordance with the various \nlikely maturity schedules and assuming the progressive total withdrawal of deposits over a period of 20 years for retail customers, \n10 years for business customers and Postepay cards and 5 years for Public Administration customers. BancoPosta RFC closely \nmonitors the behaviour of deposits taken in order to assure the model’s validity. \nIn addition to postal deposits, BancoPosta also funds itself through:\n \nz long-term repos, amounting to an outstanding €7 billion;\n \nz short-term deposits created through repurchase agreements as funding for incremental deposits used as collateral for interest \nrate swaps and Repos (collateral provided, respectively, under CSAs and GMRAs).\nBancoPosta RFC’s maturity mismatch approach entails an analysis of the mismatch between cash in and outflows for each time \n294. \u0007Since 1 October 2018, prepaid cards are the responsibility of PostePay SpA. The liquidity collected through these cards is transferred to BancoPosta, which invests it in \naccordance with the investment constraints imposed on other deposits from private customers. As such, for the purposes of specific risk analyses, the rationales related to \neach model underlying the different types of deposit inflow continue to apply.\nSection\nSummary"

In order to assure flexible \ninvestments in securities consistent with the dynamic nature of current accounts, BancoPosta RFC can also use the MEF buffer \naccount within certain limits and subject to payment of a fee.\nDetails on the risk management model are contained in the note on financial risk at the beginning of this Part E.\nThe liquidity risk resulting from contract terms requiring the provision of additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of Poste \nItaliane SpA is negligible. Such contracts include those for margin lending of derivatives, which require the threshold amount295 \nto be reduced to zero in the event that Poste Italiane SpA’s rating is downgraded to below “BBB-”. The threshold amounts relat-\ning to margin lending contracts included in repurchase agreements are equal to zero, meaning that these transactions are not \nsubject to liquidity risk.\nBancoPosta RFC’s liquidity is assessed, in the form of stress tests, through risk indicators (the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net \nStable Funding Ratio) defined by the Basel 3 prudential regulations. These indicators aim to assess whether or not the entity has \nsufficient high-quality liquid assets to overcome situations of acute stress lasting a month, and to verify that assets and liabili-\nties have sustainable maturity profiles assuming a stress scenario lasting one year. Taking into account the capital structure of \nBancoPosta RFC characterised by the presence of a high amount of EU government securities and deposits mainly made up of \nretail deposits, these indicators are well above the limits imposed by prudential regulations.\nMoreover, liquidity risk is monitored through the development of early warning indicators that, in addition to taking into account \nthe level of deposit withdrawals under conditions of stress, aim to monitor funding outflows in line with the estimated perfor-\nmance of deposits at a 99% confidence level.\nQuantitative information\n1. Distribution of contractual time-to-maturity of financial assets and liabilities\nThe time distribution of assets and liabilities is shown below, as established for banks’ financial statements (Bank of Italy Circular \n262/2005 and subsequent updates), using accounting data reported for the residual contractual term to maturity.\nManagement data, such as the modelling of demand deposits and the reporting of cash and cash equivalents taking account of \ntheir degree of liquidity, has, consequently, not been used.\n295. \u0007The threshold amount is the amount of collateral that is not required to be provided under the contract; it therefore represents the residual counterparty risk to be borne by \na counterparty.\nSummary\nSection"

Generalities, management policies and operational risk measurement methods\nOperational risk refers to the risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from \nexternal events. This category of risk includes losses resulting from fraud, human error, business disruption, systems failures, \nbreach of contracts and natural disasters. Operational risk includes legal risk, but not strategic and reputational risks.\nTo protect against this form of risk, BancoPosta RFC has formalised a methodological and organisational framework to identify, \nmeasure and manage the operational risk related to its products/processes.\nThe framework, which is based on an integrated (qualitative and quantitative) measurement model, makes it possible to monitor \nand manage risk on an increasingly informed basis.\nIn 2022, activities continued to refine the operational risk management framework, with the aim of making the process of record-\ning operational losses, monitoring and reporting more efficient and mitigating such risks by cross-functional working groups. \nSupport has also been provided to the specialist units and the owner of the process of analysing and assessing IT risk, in keeping \nwith the approach adopted in 2021, and the monitoring of IT risk recovery plans continued.\nThe activities carried out in 2022 also included assessments of the risk profile related to the assignment and outsourcing of \nBancoPosta RFC, the definition of the model for monitoring outsourcing risk, and ex-ante assessments of the risk profile related \nto the innovation of BancoPosta’s offering and/or specific project initiatives.\nQuantitative information\nAt 31 December 2022, the risk map prepared in accordance with the aforementioned framework shows the type of operational \nrisks BancoPosta RFC’s products are exposed to. In particular:\nOperational risk\nEvent type\nNumber of types\nInternal fraud\n29\nExternal fraud\n40\nEmployee practices and workplace safety\n7\nCustomers, products and business practices\n36\nDamage to material property\n4\nBusiness disruption and system failure\n8\nExecution, delivery and process management\n98\nTotal at 31 December 2022\n222 \nFor each type of mapped risk, the related sources of risk (internal losses, external losses, scenario analysis and risk indicators) \nhave been recorded and classified in order to construct complete inputs for the integrated measurement model.\nSystematic measurement of the mapped risks has enabled the prioritization of mitigation initiatives and the attribution of respon-\nsibilities in order to contain any future impact.\nSection\nSummary"

Qualitative information\nThe prudential regulations applicable to banks and investment firms from 1 January 2014 are contained in Bank of Italy Circular \n285/2013 and subsequent updates, the purpose of which was to implement EU Regulation 575/2013 (the so-called Capital \nRequirements Regulation, or “CRR”) and Directive 2013/36/EU (the so-called Capital Requirements Directive, or “CRD IV”), con-\ntaining the reforms required in order to introduce the “Basel 3” regulations. In the third revision of the above Circular, the Bank \nof Italy has extended the prudential requirements applicable to banks to BancoPosta, taking into account the specific nature of \nthe entity. As a result, BancoPosta RFC is required to comply with Pillar 1 capital requirements (credit, counterparty, market and \noperational risks) and those regarding Pillar 2 internal capital adequacy (Pillar 1 and interest rate risks), for the purposes of the \nICAAP process. The relevant definition of capital in both cases is provided by the above supervisory standards296. \nIn view of the extension of prudential standards to BancoPosta, BancoPosta RFC is now required to establish a system of internal \ncontrols in line with the provisions of Bank of Italy Circular 285/2013, which, among other things, requires the definition of a Risk \nAppetite Framework (RAF) and the containment of risks within the limits set by the RAF297. Compliance with the objective, thresh-\nold and limit system established by the RAF influences decisions regarding profit distributions as part of capital management.\n296. \u0007Capital for regulatory purposes takes into account the provisions of the:\n-\t\n“Regulation (EU) no. 2017/2395 amending Regulation (EU) no. 575/2013 as regards transitional arrangements to mitigate the impact of the introduction of IFRS 9 on own \nfunds”. BancoPosta RFC elected, under the applicable Regulation, to adopt a phase-in approach for the recognition of the effects of adjustments for expected losses \nover a transitory five-year period, mitigating the impact on CET1 with the application of decreasing percentages over time;\n-\t\n“Regulation (EU) no. 2020/873 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24/06/2020 amending Regulations (EU) no. 575/2013 and (EU) no. 2019/876 as regards \ncertain adjustments in response to the Covid-19 pandemic” (so-called “Quick Fix”). BancoPosta RFC made use of the possibility, recognised by this legislation, to adopt \nthe new percentages for the transitional period from 31 December 2020 to 31 December 2024.\n297.

In particular, the indicator is calculated by comparing the number of products offered with ESG \ncomponents to the total number of products offered;\n \nz 2022-2024 Performance Share LTIP: equal gender representation in succession plans, an objective linked to strengthening \nthe presence of women in managerial succession plans, to help increase the presence of women in positions of greater \nresponsibility in the Poste Italiane Group. Specifically, the indicator is calculated by comparing the number of succession \napplications occupied by women to the total number of applications.\nVesting of the Rights and the therefore the awarding of the Shares is subject to achievement of the Performance Hurdle, designed \nto ensure sustainability of the Plan at Group level. The Performance Hurdle corresponds with achievement of a certain target for \nthe Group’s cumulative EBIT over a three-year period at the end of each Performance Period. In addition, vesting of the phantom \nstocks is also subject to achievement of Qualifying Conditions, designed to ensure the stability of BancoPosta RFC’s capital and \nliquidity position, as follows:\n \nz Indicator of capital adequacy, (CET 1) at the end of the period;\n \nz Indicator of short-term liquidity, (LCR) at the end of the period;\n \nz RORAC risk-adjusted earnings at the end of the period.\nThe Shares will be awarded by the end of the year following the end of the Performance Period as follows:\n \nz 40% up-front;\n \nz the remaining 60% in two portions, with deferral periods of 2 and 4 years, respectively.\nA further Retention Period of one year will be applied to both the up-front and deferred portions.\nFor BP Beneficiaries (including the General Manager) in relation to the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 Performance Share LTIPs, the \nfollowing disbursement method is envisaged: 40% upfront and 60% in five deferred annual instalments over a five-year period \n(the first three equal to 10% of the total rights accrued and the next two equal to 15% of the total rights accrued). A further \nRetention Period of one year will be applied to both the up-front and deferred portions.\nThe allocation of deferred Shares will take place following the verification of the continued existence of BancoPosta RFC’s levels \nof capital adequacy, short-term liquidity and risk-adjusted profitability. \nFor more details on the operating mechanisms of the incentive plans, please refer to the Information Circular and/or the Report \non the Remuneration Policy, in force from time to time, approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting. \nDetermination of fair value and effects on profit or loss\nThe valuations were carried out using an internal pricing tool that adopts simulation models consistent with the requirements of \nthe reference accounting standards and takes into account the specific characteristics of the Plan. The unit fair value of each \nRight at the valuation date is equal to its nominal value at the grant date (determined on the basis of stock market prices), dis-\ncounted by the expected dividend rate and the risk-free interest rate and updated taking into account the best estimate of service \nconditions and performance (non-market based performance conditions).\n301. \u0007The objective linked to the “relative Total Shareholder Return” (rTSR) includes a “negative threshold” provision: if Poste Italiane’s TSR is negative, despite being higher than \nthe TSR registered by the index, the number of vested Rights (linked to rTSR) is reduced to the minimum threshold of 50%.\nSummary\nSection"

At the end of the year, the indicator stood at 2.9%, just below the target \nlevel, and in order to bring it back to 3%, a capital strengthening of € 100 million \nwas proposed, to be realised during 2023 through the subscription of an Additional \nTier 1 instrument by Poste; \n- to the “operational risks”, which are the most significant category in terms of capital \nrequirements and absorption of the “Second Pillar”. Capital absorption remains \nsignificant both in terms of minimum capital requirements, calculated \nproportionally to gross proceeds, and in the assessments made with the internal \nmodel for ICAAP purposes. The latter, however, was found to be decreasing in \n2022. The losses recorded in the statement of profit or loss for the year are down \nfrom the 2021 level, due to the significant amount of releases, and are in line with \nthe risk appetite; \n- to the “interest rate risk”, whose exposure, in terms of economic value, remained \nat levels above the RAF 2022 target threshold set at 28% until April 2022, only to \nfall back in May 2022, following the unwinding of part of the portfolio in Asset \nSwaps, which changed the exposure from liability sensitive to asset sensitive. The \ntarget threshold was exceeded again as of September 2022, only to return in \nDecember 2022, as a result of hedging transactions via long-term bond swaps, \nwhich helped to reduce the asset-sensitive exposure; \n- to the “spread risk”, which is not relevant for capital requirements, but for \nunrealised gains/losses. The year 2022 was characterised by the gradual increase in \nItalian government bond yields and the BTP-Bund spread (from 135 points at the \nend of 2021 to 214 at the end of 2022), and the portfolio measured at fair value \n(HTCS) recorded implied capital losses of approximately € 3.4 billion at the close \nof 2022 (€ -5.2 billion compared to 2021). The sensitivity of the value of the HTCS \nportfolio to this risk factor is also structurally high, although decreasing slightly. In \nthis regard, the Board has indicated, as also indicated above in paragraph 13, the \nneed to monitor this risk also for its effects on accounting equity. \nMedium risks include: \n986\n2022 Annual Report\nPoste Italiane Group\nSummary\nSection"

In this regard, Poste \nItaliane, as from March 2020, in view of the prevailing civil litigation in favour of \nPoste, will proceed with reimbursement only in the event of a possible conviction \nby the judicial authority. In fact, in 2022 there was an upward trend in the number \nof rulings in favour of Poste Italiane, rising from 32% in 2018 to 51% in 2021 and \n79% in 2022. The Court of Cassation also intervened on the issue for the first time \nin 2022, ruling, in particular, on the method of calculating the interest owed to \nsavers and essentially recognising the correctness of the procedural position taken \nby Poste Italiane. Moreover, in January 2023, four more Supreme Court orders \nwere filed in which, in addition to rejecting the appeals and confirming the correct \nposition of Poste Italiane, the Supreme Court ordered the counterparties to pay the \ncosts of the proceedings.

In particular, the recoverable amount was determined by \nestimating the \"value in use\" of the CGU, representative of the future cash \nflows expected from the use of the assets included in the CGU, including, in \nparticular, the properties used as post offices and mechanization and sorting \ncenters, as part of the ordinary company production process and taking into \naccount the obligation to fulfill the Universal Postal Service and the economic \nconditions envisaged for the services rendered to BancoPosta’s ring-fenced \ncapital. These flows were discounted at an appropriate rate. \n \nThe impairment test carried out by the Company confirmed the recoverability \nof the value of the assets attributed to the CGU. \n \nIn the Appendix to Chapter 8 \"Proposed shareholder resolutions and other \ninformation\" of the Report on Operations and in Notes 2.3 \" Summary of \nsignificant accounting policies and measurement criteria - Impairment of \nassets\", 2.4 \"Use of estimates\", paragraphs \"Impairment tests of goodwill, cash \ngenerating units and equity investments\" and \"Mail, Parcels and Distribution \nCGU\", 4.4 \"Operating Segments\" and in Note A3 “Total Assets - Intangible \nAssets” of the separate financial statements, disclosure on the aspects \ndescribed above is provided. \n \nConsidering the relevance of the amount of the carrying amount of the \nCompany’s assets allocated to the CGU \"Mail, Parcels and Distribution\", the \nsubjectivity of the estimates related to the determination of the cash flows \nexpected of the CGU, taking into account also the uncertainties related to the \ncurrent macroeconomic environment, and the key variables of the impairment \nmodel, we considered the determination of the recoverable amount of the \nbusiness segment \"Mail, Parcels and Distribution\", a key audit matter of the \nfinancial statements as at December 31, 2022. \n \n \n1025\nReports and Attestations\nSection\nSummary"

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. \n \nAs part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n \n Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to \nfraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting \na material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol. \n \n Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit. in order to design audit procedures \nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \neffectiveness of the Company's internal control. \n \n Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by the Directors. \n \n Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If \nwe conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s \nreport to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue \nas a going concern. \n \n Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the \ndisclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in \na manner that achieves fair presentation. \n1027\nReports and Attestations\nSection\nSummary"
