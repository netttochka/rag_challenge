      "text": "2 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \n \n \n \n2022 was unquestionably a year that we will all remember. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a historic turning point and \nmarks the start of a new era. There are no indications whatsoever as to where it will lead us in the long term. The \nimmediate effects, however, are serious. The geopolitical balance has been disturbed. Russia is largely isolated. There \nis growing tension between the USA and China, the remaining global powers, while the EU and the USA have forged \ncloser ties again. From an economic perspective, the recovery that was expected after the coronavirus pandemic \nabated did not materialise, with the economy really slowing down. The upheaval triggered by the war – energy \nshortages and disruption to supply chains – has further fuelled inflation and driven it to heights not seen for a long time. \nThe huge rise in energy prices in particular has placed considerable burdens on individuals and companies alike, \nwhich the state is trying to cushion. \nAlthough there are initial signs of a slight easing in the upward price trend, with the emerging recession set to be \nmilder than expected, the situation is more uncertain than it has been for a long time. That is true for the markets, for \nmany of our customers and of course for our employees. Under these circumstances, it is extraordinary that we are \nable to look back on a good year overall for Commerzbank. We continued to make significant progress in the second \nyear of implementing our “Strategy 2024” programme adopted at the beginning of 2021. At the halfway point, we are \nfully on course to create a sustainably successful Commerzbank, a Commerzbank that has every chance of remaining \nan independent force for our customers in the German banking market of the future.  \nMajor parts of the restructuring, which had a profound impact on the entire organisation and characterised large \nperiods of the first two years of the implementation process, have now been largely completed. For example, we have \nalready finalised most of the planned gross reduction of 10,000 full-time positions. The reduction of almost 9,000 \npositions was contracted by the end of 2022, the majority of them in Germany. A large part of the remaining reduction \nwill come from the optimisation or closure of foreign locations, which can be achieved without major implementation \nrisks. At the same time, we have rationalised our domestic branch network more quickly than we had planned two \nyears ago. Of the original 1,000 branches, 450 remained by mid-2022, meaning that we achieved the reduction \noriginally announced as part of our strategy ahead of schedule. We will reach our new target of 400 branches during \nthe current year. As a result, we feel we occupy a good position in the highly competitive German market. In addition \nto these highly visible measures, we also removed complexity from many areas of the Bank. It is clear, however, that \nwe still have further to go in this regard. Reducing complexity and increasing efficiency remain permanent tasks.  \nAlongside the restructuring of the Bank, we also worked intensively on our business model: in the Private and \nSmall-Business Customers segment, all 12 of our advisory centre locations are now in operation – in the evenings and \nalso on weekends. The start-up phase is essentially complete, including with regard to staff. This new sales channel – \nLetter from the Chairman of the \nBoard of Managing Directors \nFrankfurt/Main, March 2023"

This is now also fully functional. As at the end of the year, we were \nalready servicing around 6,000 customers through this channel. We also further consolidated our market position as \nGermany’s leading trade finance bank and are in the process of adapting our global location network in line with the \nchanging geopolitical environment and trade flows.  \nAnother key strategic development for us in 2022 was that sustainability became a definitive mainstay of our \nbusiness model, with the associated business volume already amounting to €247bn as at the reporting date. We are \ntherefore well on the way towards achieving the intended volume of €300bn by 2025. Of course, the adjustments to our \nbusiness model also entail changes for many of our customers. We are receiving a lot of positive feedback and support \nregarding the course we have chosen, but we also take the associated concerns of our customers very seriously. We \nwill certainly not be able to persuade all customers that our new path is the right one. To date, however, the number \nleaving us and the resulting loss of income are significantly lower than we have budgeted for. This reinforces our belief \nthat we are on the right track. \nOverall, we can state that Commerzbank is in a much better position today than it was two years ago. We have \naccomplished what we set out to do. The turnaround has been achieved, Commerzbank is back on the road to success! \nAnd it is back in the DAX, the leading German index. This is recognition for us all of what we have accomplished to \ndate, and at the same time an incentive to continue purposefully along our path.  \nThe progress that we have already made is demonstrated in particularly impressive fashion in the results for the \n2022 financial year. We posted double-digit income growth last year despite massive politically induced charges at our \nPolish subsidiary mBank. This exceptionally strong income momentum was driven by robust customer business in both \nsegments and, of course, the boost provided by the European Central Bank’s interest rate hikes. Since we also \ncontinued to display strong cost discipline and met our cost targets despite the increasing inflationary pressures, we \nachieved a significantly lower cost/income ratio of 69% for the year as a whole. The medium-term target of 60% is \ntherefore within reach. With an NPE ratio of 1.1%, the quality of our loan book remains high. Influenced by the rising \neconomic uncertainty and the economic impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the risk result increased year on year \nbut remains at a manageable level.  \nThe Group’s operating profit increased by 77.5% to around €2.1bn in the financial year. Net profit more than \ntripled to €1.435bn, our best result for more than a decade. We significantly exceeded the billion we had forecast. The \ngood result further strengthened our already very solid capital base and thus also created the necessary scope for the \nannounced payout ratio of 30% of consolidated profit. In line with this and as communicated previously, we will \npropose a dividend of €0.20 per share to the Annual General Meeting on 31 May 2023. We have also requested a share \nbuyback with a volume of €122m, subject to approval by the European Central Bank and the Finance Agency. Being \nable to pay dividends again is an important milestone for us. It is an expression of our regained financial strength and a \nsign of our fundamental confidence in Commerzbank’s future path. \nDear shareholders, we have worked hard to achieve this confidence, and we will do everything we can to ensure \nthat it continues to spread throughout the Bank and among our employees and managers. None of what has been \nachieved so far would have been possible without their immense commitment to Commerzbank. On behalf of the entire \nBoard of Managing Directors, I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at the Bank, who have \nshown courage, drive and discipline to help us turn the situation around. We will need more of these qualities in the \nfuture. Because as we are all aware, the implementation of our strategy is only at the halfway stage – we still have a \nlong way to go. In both this year and the next – and in what is still a very difficult economic environment – we must \nprove that our adapted business model is sustainable. The aim is to convince more and more customers that we are \ntheir partner of choice as the digital advisory bank for Germany. We also have to ensure that we as a bank achieve the \nsustainable profitability that our investors expect and that we require for investment. \nAfter we inevitably had to devote a huge amount of attention to restructuring issues and thus focus on ourselves \nduring the first half of the implementation phase, the priority in the second half of our transformation will be on \ncustomer business."

      "text": "4 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nIn the Private and Small-Business Customers segment, we will introduce some eight million branch customers to \nthe services offered in the new advisory centres. Customers will have access to our full product range in the advisory \ncentres. The advisory centres fill the gap between our branches and online/mobile banking services, offering extended \nservice hours and enabling customers to obtain advice from the comfort of their own homes. We are convinced that \nthis is the right approach for retail banking going forward.  \nWe will also leverage the advantages of our two-brand strategy even more effectively in retail banking with \ncomdirect, the bank for digitally savvy customers who only occasionally require advice. We will continue to invest in \ncomdirect to consolidate its strong position in the market. Commerzbank’s personal advisory service offering will in \nfuture be tailored more strongly to the needs of wealthy customers and those with more complex advisory needs. We \nstill see great potential for the Bank in this market segment.  \nIn the Corporate Clients segment, we will continue to expand our direct bank in 2023 and also open it up to new \ncustomers. German SMEs are still our main focus in this segment. We will strengthen our leading position as their \nreliable banking partner, especially when it comes to overcoming the uncertainties of the future. Foreign business in \nparticular, including the procurement of raw materials and intermediate products on the global markets, has become a \nreal challenge in some cases due to the geopolitical turbulence. We want to support our customers wherever they do \nbusiness. With this in mind, in view of the changing trade corridors we are opening new offices in selected foreign \nlocations so that we have a local presence for our customers. \nHowever, our focus on customer business does not mean that we are relaxing our efforts to make the Bank more \nefficient. Strict cost discipline and the profitable use of our capital remain a priority. The current year will also be \nshaped by a continuing high level of risk awareness in what is still a challenging economic environment. Although we \nare not anticipating a wave of insolvencies, not all of our corporate customers will make it through this difficult period \nunscathed, which will have a corresponding impact on us as well. With top-level adjustments of almost €500m still \navailable, the Bank is well equipped to deal with the ongoing economic challenges. \nThis is all reflected in our published forecasts for the current year. We expect Commerzbank to maintain its positive \nperformance, but prefer to remain on the cautious side given the tense overall situation. With income continuing to rise, \nongoing inflation-related cost pressure and risk provisioning impacted by the tense economic situation, we expect to \npost a further significant increase in our profit after tax in the current year. We are also planning to increase the payout \nratio to 50% after deduction of the AT1 coupon payments. However, this outlook is based on the assumptions that – as \nwidely expected – there will be only a mild recession and that there will be no more substantial special charges at \nmBank. \nWe remain confident beyond the current year, too, as was also reflected in the slightly adjusted medium-term \nfinancial targets we presented last autumn. With markedly higher income expectations and costs also set to be higher \nas a result of inflation, we are still targeting a cost/income ratio of 60% for 2024 and believe that a return on equity of \nmore than 7.3% is realistic. Beyond 2024, our primary goal is and will remain to earn the Bank’s cost of capital. \nI am very confident that we will achieve this. We have defined our strategic priorities. Commerzbank is now also \nstrong on implementation, as we have demonstrated over the past two years. We want and will continue to deliver what \nwe have promised – for the benefit of our customers, employees and investors. We would be delighted if you would \ncontinue to place your trust in us as we do so. \n \n \nDr. Manfred Knof \nChairman of the Board of Managing Directors"

This is a major achievement for the Bank given the \nmajor political disruptions in 2022, most notably Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the geopolitical, energy-\nrelated and economic dislocations associated with it.  \nAmid the multifaceted challenges of the 2022 financial year, the Supervisory Board advised the Board of \nManaging Directors on its conduct of Commerzbank’s affairs and supervised and monitored the way it was \nmanaged. The Board of Managing Directors reported to the Supervisory Board promptly, extensively and at \nregular intervals on the major developments at the Bank, including in the periods between meetings. The \nSupervisory Board received frequent and regular information on the Bank’s business position, economic \nsituation and risk position, particularly against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, and on considerations \nrelating to the Bank’s strategic alignment, its corporate planning, the sustainability strategy, the performance \nof the share price, compliance issues, loan loss provisions and the Bank’s risk strategy, and advised the Board \nof Managing Directors on these topics. The Supervisory Board and its committees held a total of 37 meetings \nin the past financial year. Between meetings, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board was also continually in \ntouch with the Chairman and other members of the Board of Managing Directors according to a set timetable \nand kept up to date with the current business progress, strategic considerations, the risk situation, risk \nmanagement, compliance issues and major business transactions within both the Bank and the Group.  \nThe Supervisory Board was involved in decisions of major importance for the Bank, giving its approval \nafter extensive consultation and examination wherever required. \n \n \nReport of the Supervisory Board \nFrankfurt/Main, March 2023"

In preparation for these \nmeetings, the shareholder representatives and employee representatives regularly held separate preparatory \nmeetings. A particular focal point of the Supervisory Board’s work was to assist in the ongoing development \nof strategy and monitor its implementation. The Supervisory Board was kept fully informed by the Board of \nManaging Directors about the ongoing development of the strategy and was involved in an advisory capacity. \nThe Supervisory Board subsequently received reports on the status of strategy implementation and the Bank’s \nstrategic transformation on an ongoing basis. The Supervisory Board and the Board of Managing Directors \nexamined the Bank’s strategic direction in depth in one strategy meeting in 2022; the shareholder \nrepresentatives and employee representatives held additional preparatory meetings with the Board of \nManaging Directors for the same purpose.  \nAnother focus in 2022 was monitoring the impact of the war in Ukraine on the Bank. The Supervisory \nBoard monitored the Bank’s financial and business performance and risk situation more closely. It also \ncontinued to consider the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic for the Bank. \nThe Supervisory Board dealt intensively with personnel issues, in particular the appointment of two new \nmembers of the Board of Managing Directors. It also addressed the appointment of a successor to the \nChairman of the Supervisory Board and the future composition of the Supervisory Board on the shareholder \nrepresentative side. \nThe Supervisory Board also dealt closely with matters at mBank in 2022, in particular the risks for \nCommerzbank arising from mBank’s Swiss franc loan portfolio and the initiatives of the Polish government to \nsupport borrowers.  \nFinally, the Supervisory Board resolved in 2022 to turn the Social Welfare Committee into the \nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Committee (ESG Committee). It also revised the remuneration system \nfor the Board of Managing Directors and submitted this to the Annual General Meeting for approval. \nThe focus of all ordinary meetings was the Bank’s current business position, which the Supervisory Board \ndiscussed in detail with the Board of Managing Directors. The Supervisory Board considered in depth the \nfinancial and business performance of the Bank and its business segments, the risk situation, the strategy and \nits implementation status along with the strategic transformation referred to above, planning, compliance and \ntax issues, regulatory audits, the risk management system and the internal control system. The Supervisory \nBoard regularly discussed a range of issues where the Board of Managing Directors was not present.  \nIt subjected the reports of the Board of Managing Directors to analysis, in some cases requesting \nsupplementary information, which was always provided. The Supervisory Board also received information on \ninternal and official investigations into the Bank and asked questions regarding these prior to formulating an \nopinion.  \nAs far as was possible given the pandemic-related restrictions, the Supervisory Board meetings were held \nas face-to-face meetings. Due to the pandemic, some meetings took place in hybrid form. \nWhere resolutions were required between meetings or it helped to ensure efficient organisation of the \nSupervisory Board’s work, the Supervisory Board adopted resolutions by way of circulars. \nWhere the Supervisory Board deemed it necessary, it brought in consultants to assist it in its activities. \n \nThe following specific topics were discussed at the Supervisory Board meetings: \n \nAt the meeting on 16 February 2022, the Board of Managing Directors reported in detail on the current \nbusiness situation, the preliminary results for the 2021 financial year and compliance issues, and discussed \nwith the Supervisory Board the directive on dividend payments and possible share buybacks, which the \nSupervisory Board approved.

In so doing, the Supervisory Board bound the actions of the \nmembers of the Board of Managing Directors more firmly to Commerzbank’s business performance over the \nlong term and created a high degree of concurrence with shareholders’ interests. Besides the introduction of \nthe share ownership directive, the share-based component of the short-term incentive and long-term \nincentive elements was also increased from 50% to 60%. In addition, in its February meeting the Supervisory \nBoard dealt with the 2022 sub-risk strategies for credit, market, liquidity and operational risks. It dealt with \nadjustments to the remuneration system for members of the Supervisory Board and with the rules governing \nfuture terms of office for Supervisory Board members. The Supervisory Board also resolved to turn the Social \nWelfare Committee into the Environmental, Social and Governance Committee (ESG Committee) and make \nthe associated amendment to the Supervisory Board’s rules of procedure, and elected further committee \nmembers. In addition, the Supervisory Board addressed the Supervisory Board report and the declaration on \ncorporate governance. Finally, the results of the evaluation of the Board of Managing Directors and \nSupervisory Board and of the self-assessment of the Supervisory Board for the 2021 financial year, which \nwere carried out internally within the Bank, were presented, discussed and resulting measures resolved. \n \nAt the accounts review meeting on 23 March 2022, the Supervisory Board reviewed the 2021 financial \nstatements for the parent company and the Group, adopted the parent company financial statements and \napproved the Group financial statements on the Audit Committee’s recommendation.

The Board of Managing Directors reported to the Supervisory Board on the current business situation, \nin particular the impact of the war in Ukraine on the Bank and the status of strategy implementation. The \nSupervisory Board also addressed the digital strategy and the cyber and information security strategy, and \nadopted the proposed resolutions for the agenda of the 2022 Annual General Meeting. The Supervisory Board \nalso examined the assertion of management liability claims relating to the termination of the project to \noutsource the securities settlement business (the Sirius project). In addition, the Supervisory Board reviewed \nthe performance evaluation of a former member of the Board of Managing Directors with regard to the long-\nterm incentive component of variable remuneration for a past performance year by means of a retrospective \nassessment.  \n \nAt the meeting on 6 July 2022, the Board of Managing Directors reported on the current business \nsituation, the status of strategy implementation and the progress of the transformation, Commerzbank’s ESG \nframework and the impact of the war in Ukraine on the Bank and the economy.

In addition, Dr. Marcus \nChromik informed the Supervisory Board that he did not wish to extend his contract, which is due to expire at \nthe end of 2023, for personal reasons. The Supervisory Board dealt closely with matters at mBank, in \nparticular the risks for Commerzbank arising from mBank’s Swiss franc loan portfolio and the initiatives of the \nPolish government to support borrowers.

      "text": "20 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nOur share \nDevelopment of equity markets and \nperformance indices \nThe international stock markets were affected by persistently high \nuncertainty in the period to late autumn 2022. First and foremost, \nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine dominated geopolitics, and hence \ninternational trade relations with Russia as well. This led to \nmassive repercussions for energy policy and soaring prices for \nfossil fuels in particular, which then also fed through to higher \nfood prices. Western sanctions against Russia, the restriction of \nRussian gas supplies and a realignment of energy policy increased \neconomic uncertainty, particularly among companies in energy-\nrelated sectors. The result was a significant rise in prices, with \ninflation in Germany peaking at 10.4% in the period under review, \nplacing additional pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) in \nthe pursuit of its monetary policy objectives. Last but not least, \ngrowing inflationary and economic concerns coupled with ongoing \ninterruptions to existing supply chains dragged down broad stock \nmarket indices worldwide through until the autumn. Russia \nshutting off gas supplies, and the reliance of German industry in \nparticular on these supplies, added to the ongoing negative \nsentiment. On the currency markets, the euro depreciated \nsignificantly against the US dollar in the period under review, as \nwas made plain by the two currencies reaching parity. The \nsignificant rise in bond yields in the first six months of 2022, \nincluding those on ten-year German Bunds (up from –19 basis \npoints at the start of the year to 134 at year-end), reflects a \nconsiderably higher level of market interest rates, which is \nfundamentally beneficial for banks. However, the ongoing \ncoronavirus pandemic is damaging international supply chains, \nwhich are also being affected by the Russia–Ukraine conflict. One \nconsequence of this is higher loan loss provisions at European \nbanks. \nTowards the end of 2022, the international stock markets were \nable to break away from their lows and, fuelled by euro \nappreciation and the expectation that the feared recession might \nnot be so bad after all, made significant gains. \nThe leading German share index, the DAX, fell by 12.4% in \n2022, while the MDAX was even down 28.5%. The leading \nEuropean index, the EuroStoxx 50, lost 11.7%. \n \n \nThe Commerzbank share \nAt the start of 2022, the European banking sector was looking \nahead with confidence, particularly given that the coronavirus \npandemic had so far had only a moderate impact on institutions’ \nbusiness models. The economic outlook was significantly more \npositive, suggesting a further increase in demand for credit from \nthe corporate sector, and consumer sentiment had also \nbrightened. In light of rising expectations of interest rate hikes and \nconsequently higher earnings contributions, profit estimates were \nslowly raised. Amid this environment Commerzbank shares \nreached their high for the year of €9.51 on 21 February. However, \nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine then led to an immediate revision \nof macroeconomic expectations and earnings estimates for \nEuropean banks. In response, share prices fell sharply and the \nCommerzbank share reached its low for the year (€5.17) as quickly \nas 7 March. \nIn mid-2022, there was a debate in particular about the \npossible consequences of a total halt in supplies of Russian gas or \nof gas rationing on the German economy, which took the \nEuroStoxx Banks sector index to its low for the year in July. As \ninflation had risen considerably, the European Central Bank \nresponded by hiking its deposit facility rate by a first 0.5% \nincrement in late July 2022, marking a departure from the negative \ninterest rate environment that had prevailed until then. In \nsubsequent months, this interest rate was increased by 0.75% on \n14 September 2022, by 0.75% on 2 November 2022, and finally \nby 0.5% on 15 December 2022. This took the rate to 2.5% at \nyear-end, having been at 0% since March 2016. These interest \nrate increases also enabled European bank share prices to rally \nstrongly during the second half of 2022 compared with their lows \nfor the year. Consequently, the European sector index EuroStoxx \nBanks ended the year under review down only slightly (–4.6%). \nWith a gain of 32.1%, the Commerzbank share price far \noutperformed the sector as a whole in 2022. Commerzbank is still \nin the process of a comprehensive cost and restructuring \nprogramme, which underpins market expectations of an improved \nearnings outlook. In addition, the Bank is benefiting from \nexpectations of further interest rate rises, as have already been \nannounced by the European Central Bank. A Core Tier 1 ratio of \n14.1% shows that solvency and stability remain high. In \nconnection with this, the buffer for the maximum distributable \namount of capital improved to around 470 basis points, benefiting"

In the year under review, \nCerberus disposed of a significant portion of its Commerzbank \nshares, The reporting threshold of 3% has not been exceeded \nsince then. In mid-April 2022, Capital Group Companies, Inc. \nofficially informed us that it had sold its stake of around 5.3% in \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. Consequently, as at end-2022 \naround 62% of all Commerzbank shares were held by institutional \ninvestors, including in particular BlackRock with just under 10% \nand the Norwegian state, which holds a stake of around 3% via \nNorges Bank. The free float stood at around 84%. \n \n \n \nSome 26 analysts provided regular coverage of Commerzbank \nduring 2022. At the end of 2022, the proportion of buy \nrecommendations was 56%, compared with 31% in the previous \nyear. A further 44% of analysts recommended a hold, while no \nanalysts recommended selling our shares, compared with 15% in \nthe previous year. The analysts’ average price target at the end of \nthe year was €10.43, compared with €7.24 at the end of the \nprevious year. \nCommerzbank’s ratings \nThe rating agencies assess Commerzbank as a bank with a strong \ncustomer franchise and a solid market position in German \ncorporate customer business. Its credit exposure is mainly \noriented towards stable German and European economies and its \ncredit portfolio is considered to be low-risk. The Bank’s \ncapitalisation is judged to be solid, and its liquidity situation \nstable. Its capital buffer helps with the current transformation \nprocess and provides loss absorbency to protect senior creditors. \nIts refinancing options via deposits, Pfandbriefe and the capital \nmarkets are still considered good. \nThe rating agencies consider that the Bank has improved its \nstructural profitability under Strategy 2024 and is showing \nmeasurable progress towards transformation and achieving its \n2024 financial targets. However, they still make reference to the \nexisting economic and geopolitical risks. \nRating events in 2022 \nMoody’s Investors Service   Issuer rating = “A2” \nThe long-term issuer rating, known as the preferred senior \nunsecured debt rating, was downgraded by one notch to “A2” at \nthe end of June 2022, with the outlook upgraded from negative to \nstable. From the agency’s perspective, this reflects the relative \nreduction in bail-in-eligible instruments as a percentage of total \nassets, which feeds into Moody’s proprietary loss-given-failure \n(LGF) model. As a result, the uplift from additional support within \nthe rating fell to two notches (previously three notches). This was \na technical adjustment not based on the fundamental assessment \nof the Bank. It had no impact on the standalone rating (“baa2”), \nthe ratings for non-preferred senior, Tier 2 and AT1 instruments, \nor the counterparty and deposit ratings (“A1”). The ratings for the \nmortgage \nPfandbriefe \nand \npublic-sector \nPfandbriefe \nwere \nunchanged at “AAA”. \n \nS&P Global Ratings   Issuer rating = “BBB+” \nThe outlook for Commerzbank’s long-term issuer rating or \npreferred senior unsecured debt rating was upgraded from \nnegative to stable in May 2022, while the rating itself remained \nunchanged at “BBB+”. The outlook reflects the assessment that \nCommerzbank’s multi-year restructuring will succeed and that the \nBank will largely achieve its financial targets for 2024. Achieving \nthe financial targets would in turn create the conditions for a \nsignificant improvement in structural profitability. The Bank’s \nstand-alone rating was “bbb”. The issue ratings for unsecured \nissues linked to the standalone rating were “BBB–” for non-\npreferred senior unsecured debt, “BB+” for subordinated debt and \n“BB–” for Additional Tier 1 debt. The resolution counterparty \nrating was “A–”. \n \nInstitutional investors\n~ 50%\nShareholder structure\nAs at 31 December 2022\nBlackRock > 5%\nGerman federal\nstate > 15%\nPrivate investors ~ 22%\nNorges Bank > 3%"

This follows from Principle 23 of the German \nCorporate Governance Code in the version of 28 April 2022, \npublished in the Federal Gazette [Bundesanzeiger] on 27 June 2022, \non which this declaration is based.  \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft attaches great importance to \nresponsible and transparent corporate governance aimed at \nsustainable value creation. That is why the Board of Managing \nDirectors and the Supervisory Board expressly support the goals \nand objectives set out in the German Corporate Governance Code. \nRecommendations of the German Corporate \nGovernance Code \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and its subsidiaries that are required \nby law to do so declare every year whether the recommendations made \nby the Commission have been and are being complied with and explain \nwhy individual recommendations are not being implemented. These \ndeclarations of compliance by the Board of Managing Directors and \nSupervisory Board are published on the websites of the individual \ncompanies. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s declarations can be \nfound at https://www.commerzbank.de/de/hauptnavigation/aktionaere/ \ngovernance_/corporate_governace_1.html. There is also an archive of \nall the declarations of compliance made since 2002. The declaration \nvalid as at 31 December 2022 was made in December 2022. \n \nAs can be seen from the wording of the declaration below, \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft complies with virtually all of the \nrecommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code; it \ndeviates from them in only a few points: \n \n(1) From the time when the last declaration of compliance was made \nin November 2021 up to 27 June 2022, the recommendations of the \nGovernment Commission on the German Corporate Governance \nCode in the version of 16 December 2019 – published in the Federal \nGazette on 20 March 2020 – were complied with except for the \nfollowing:  \n \n• According to recommendation B.3 of the Code, the first-time \nappointment of members of the Board of Managing Directors \nshould be made for a maximum of three years. Commerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft deviated from this in the appointment of the \nmember of the Board of Managing Directors responsible for \nPrivate and Small-Business Customers at the end of 2021, who \nwas appointed for five years. Given his many years of service on \nthe board of managing directors of a bank in Vienna, a longer \nappointment than the recommended three years was necessary \nin order to persuade him to join the Bank. \n \n• According to recommendation G.10 sentence 1 of the Code, the \nvariable remuneration amounts granted to a member of the Board \nof Managing Directors should be predominantly invested in the \ncompany’s shares or granted as share-based remuneration, with \ndue regard to the respective tax burdens. Until the end of 2022, \nCommerzbank’s remuneration system provided for half of variable \nremuneration to be paid as share-based remuneration. With the \nintroduction of the new remuneration system for the Board of \nManaging Directors on 1 January 2023, 60% of the variable \nremuneration will be paid as share-based remuneration, meaning \nthat recommendation G.10 will be complied with from this date. \n \n(2) Since 27 June 2022, the recommendations of the Government \nCommission on the German Corporate Governance Code in the \nversion of 28 April 2022 – published in the Federal Gazette on 27 \nJune 2022 – have been and are being complied with except for the \nfollowing: \n \n• According to recommendation G.10 sentence 1 of the Code, the \nvariable remuneration amounts granted to a member of the Board \nof Managing Directors should be predominantly invested in the \ncompany’s shares or granted as share-based remuneration, with \ndue regard to the respective tax burdens.

According to the \nprevailing view, a general exclusion of employee representatives on \nthe Supervisory Board from membership of a committee is only \npermissible if there is an objective reason for doing so. Such an \nobjective reason could exist if a committee were to deal exclusively \nwith matters relating only to the shareholder representatives on the \nSupervisory Board, for example if the sole task of the Nomination \nCommittee were to prepare proposals for the election of \nshareholder representatives to be put to the Annual General \nMeeting. Under Article 25d (11) of the German Banking Act, \nhowever, the nomination committee of a bank is also assigned other \ntasks, including tasks for which the involvement of employee \nrepresentatives is customary and necessary. For example, the \nnomination committee is tasked with assisting the respective \ncompany’s supervisory board in identifying candidates to fill \nmanagement positions, and in the regular assessment of the \nmanagement board and the supervisory board. The involvement of \nemployee representatives in these tasks is established practice at \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft.

They shape \nboth the way employees interact with each other and their \nbehaviour towards customers, business partners and other \nstakeholders. These values take high priority at Commerzbank and \nshow that Commerzbank is aware of its corporate responsibility.  \nBased on its corporate values, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft \nhas set out codes of conduct for acting with integrity, which provide \nall Commerzbank Group employees with a binding framework for \nlawful and ethically appropriate conduct in the day-to-day working \nenvironment. \nBoth the corporate values and the codes of conduct are reviewed \nas necessary and revised if required; they were most recently \nrevised in the 2022 financial year.  \nIn its environmental, social and governance (ESG) framework, \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft sets out all the key components \nof its sustainability strategy and makes sustainability a central \nmanagement parameter. In this way, the Bank provides its \nstakeholders with the greatest possible transparency regarding its \nunderstanding of sustainability. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft \nhas thereby created a Bank-wide standard that enables stringent \nmanagement of all relevant products, processes and activities and \nensures the sustainable transformation of Commerzbank. \nThe ESG framework also defines positions and policies on \nenvironmental and social issues. These are applied to the evaluation \nof transactions and business relationships and thus act as important \npoints of reference. The basis for their preparation and regular \nreview is the ongoing monitoring of media and non-governmental \norganisations (NGOs) on controversial environmental or social \nissues and regular discussion with NGOs.

In addition, in \naccordance with recommendation C.3, the term of Supervisory \nBoard membership is to be stated.  \nThe Supervisory Board of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft has \napproved the following concrete objectives: \nThe composition of the Supervisory Board should be such that, \noverall, its members have the necessary skills, expertise, \nexperience and knowledge to be able to perform its duties properly. \nIn particular, the Supervisory Board should have all the expertise \nand experience deemed essential for the activities of the \nCommerzbank Group. In addition, the legal requirements with \nregard to special expertise and professional experience of \nindividual members of the Supervisory Board in specific areas must \nbe met (for example, expertise in the areas of accounting and \nauditing, including sustainability reporting and auditing thereof, as \nwell as in the areas of risk management and risk controlling), and \nat least one member of the Supervisory Board should have special \nexpertise with respect to ESG issues. The members of the \nSupervisory Board must be able to challenge and monitor the \ndecisions made by the Board of Managing Directors. The members \nof the Supervisory Board should also be able to devote sufficient \ntime to the performance of their duties. Members should be reliable, \nand consideration should be given to their commitment, personality, \nprofessionalism, integrity and independence. The target is that the \nSupervisory Board should always have at least eight members \nelected by the Annual General Meeting who are independent as \ndefined in recommendation C.6 of the Code. The length of service \nof the Supervisory Board members elected by the Annual General \nMeeting should generally not exceed a period of 12 years.  \nThe Supervisory Board has resolved a detailed profile of skills \nand expertise for its composition, which may be consulted on \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s website.  \nAs can be seen from the following qualification matrix based on \na self-assessment by members of the Supervisory Board, all \nobjectives set by the Supervisory Board with regard to its \ncomposition, as well as its profile of skills, had been implemented \nas at 31 December 2022:"

      "text": "32 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nWith Burkhard Keese as Chairman of the Audit Committee and \nRobin J. Stalker, who is also a member of the Audit Committee, the \nSupervisory Board has two members with special expertise in the \nareas of both accounting and auditing. Other members of the Audit \nCommittee also have special expertise in the fields of accounting \nand auditing. Robin J. Stalker and other members of the Supervisory \nBoard also have special expertise in the field of ESG. In order to \nremain \naligned \nwith \ndevelopments \nwithin \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft in matters of sustainability and also to ensure \nthat the growing requirements and responsibilities of the \nSupervisory Board in this area are properly complied with, at the \nbeginning of 2022 the Supervisory Board added environmental and \ngovernance matters to the work of the Social Welfare Committee, \nrenamed it the Environmental, Social and Governance Committee \naccordingly and increased the number of members.  \nFor further information on the individual members of the \nSupervisory Board, please also refer to their curricula vitae, which \nare available on the Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft website.  \nIn accordance with recommendation C.1 of the Code, the \ndeclaration on corporate governance should also provide information \non what, in the view of the shareholder representatives, is the \nappropriate number of independent shareholder representatives \nserving on the Supervisory Board and the names of these members. \nAccording to recommendation C.6 of the Code, a Supervisory Board \nmember is considered as independent if he or she is independent of \nthe Bank and its Board of Managing Directors and independent of any \ncontrolling shareholder. A Supervisory Board member is independent \nof the Bank and its Board of Managing Directors if he or she has no \npersonal or business relationship with the Bank or its Board of \nManaging Directors that may lead to a significant, non-transient \nconflict of interest. When assessing the independence of their \nmembers according to recommendation C.7 of the Code, the \nshareholder representatives should in particular take into account \nwhether the Supervisory Board member him or herself or a close \nrelative of the Supervisory Board member was a member of the \nBank’s Board of Managing Directors in the two years before his or her \nappointment; currently has or had in the year leading up to his or her \nappointment a material business relationship with the Bank or one of \nits dependent companies, either directly or as a shareholder or in a \nresponsible function of a non-Group company; is a close relative of a \nmember of the Board of Managing Directors; or has been a member \nof the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years. In addition, in \naccordance with recommendation C.11 of the Code, the Supervisory \nBoard should not include more than two former members of the \nBoard of Managing Directors of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. \nBased on the above criteria, all ten shareholder representatives \ncan be classified as “independent” within the meaning of the \nGerman Corporate Governance Code, namely Helmut Gottschalk, \nDr. Frank Czichowski, Sabine U. Dietrich, Dr. Jutta A. Dönges, \nBurkhard Keese, Daniela Mattheus, Caroline Seifert, Robin J. \nStalker, Dr. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell and Frank Westhoff. Dr. Jutta \nA. Dönges and Dr. Frank Czichowski were proposed for election to \nthe Supervisory Board of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft at the \nsuggestion of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund, represented \nby the Federal Republic of Germany – Finanzagentur GmbH. The \nFinancial Market Stabilisation Fund holds around 15.6% of the \nshare capital of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and is therefore \nnot a controlling shareholder within the meaning of the Code. Nor \ndoes the Federal Republic of Germany – Finance Agency have a \nmaterial \nbusiness \nrelationship \nwith \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft. In addition, there is no former member of the \nBoard of Managing Directors of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft \non the Supervisory Board. \nAs a result, the target of always having at least eight independent \nSupervisory Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting \nhas been achieved. The Supervisory Board’s own assessment that it \ncontains an appropriate number of independent members is \ntherefore well-founded.  \nIn the 2022 financial year the Supervisory Board and its \ncommittees dealt with the results of the review of the effectiveness \nof their work carried out in the 2021 financial year in accordance \nwith recommendation D.12 of the German Corporate Governance \nCode, combined with the assessment of the Board of Managing \nDirectors and Supervisory Board to be carried out in accordance \nwith Art. 25d (11) nos. 3 and 4 of the German Banking Act (KWG). \nBoth the Supervisory Board and the individual committees drew up \na catalogue of measures based on the results and implemented \nthese measures; in the case of the Supervisory Board, these related \nto matters including qualification and ongoing training of \nSupervisory Board members, anchoring of ESG matters in the \nSupervisory Board, and efficient communication between the Board \nof Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board. At the end of the \n2022 financial year, the Supervisory Board then reviewed the \neffectiveness of its work in the 2022 financial year and carried out \nthe assessment required pursuant to Art. 25d (11) nos. 3 and 4 of \nthe German Banking Act (KWG). For this purpose all members of \nthe Supervisory Board completed various questionnaires, which \nwere then analysed. The resulting analyses were presented to the \nSupervisory Board for discussion at the start of 2023. On the basis \nof these discussions, catalogues of measures were drawn up both \nby the Supervisory Board and in the committees, and these are \nbeing worked through in a timely manner. The members of the \nSupervisory Board believe that the board and its committees work \neffectively and to a high standard overall.  \nIn accordance with recommendation E.2 of the Code and Art. 3 \n(6) of the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board, each member \nof the Supervisory Board must disclose any conflicts of interest. No \nmember of the Supervisory Board declared such a conflict of \ninterest during the year under review. \nIn accordance with recommendation B.2 of the German \nCorporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board works with the \nBoard of Managing Directors to ensure long-term succession"

The \nPresiding \nand \nNomination \nCommittee \nof \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft’s Supervisory Board is responsible for succession \nplanning. It assists the Supervisory Board in selecting applicants for \npositions on the Board of Managing Directors. Therefore, it takes \naccount of the balance and range of knowledge, skills and \nexperience of all the board members and draws up a job description \nwith an applicant profile. In drawing up the job description, it takes \naccount of the skills profile and suitability matrix for the Board of \nManaging Directors as well as other targets for its composition (such \nas diversity). In accordance with Art. 25 (11) no. 5 of the German \nBanking Act, the Presiding and Nomination Committee also reviews \nthe principles of the Board of Managing Directors for the selection \nand appointment of persons at top management level. It also \ndetermines whether there are suitable succession candidates at this \nlevel for appointment to the Board of Managing Directors.  \nThe system for the remuneration of Supervisory Board members \nadopted by the Annual General Meeting on 13 May 2020 and \napplicable \nsince \n1 January \n2020, \nwhich \nis \ngoverned \nby \nCommerzbank’s Articles of Association, was amended by the \nAnnual General Meeting in 2022 with regard to remuneration for \nmembership of committees and was therefore adopted again in \naccordance with Art. 113 (3) of the German Stock Corporation Act \n(AktG). The resolution was published on the Commerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft website. The remuneration of the members of \nthe Supervisory Board is also presented in detail in the \nremuneration report, which is published on Commerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft’s website. \nDiversity \nBoth Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and the Group companies \ntake diversity into account in the composition of the Board of \nManaging \nDirectors, \nappointments \nto \nmanagement \nand \nrecommendations for the election of Supervisory Board members \n(recommendations A.2, B.1 and C.1 of the German Corporate \nGovernance Code). The aim is to reduce the risk of prejudice and \n“groupthink”. In addition, diversity contributes to a broader range \nof experience and a greater spectrum of knowledge, capabilities \nand expertise. \nDiversity policy and information on the minimum \nproportions of women and men on the Supervisory \nBoard \nThe Supervisory Board of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft \nconsists of 20 members. As already mentioned in the description of \nthe targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board, the \nSupervisory Board is supposed to always have at least eight \nmembers elected by the Annual General Meeting who are \nindependent \n(shareholder \nrepresentatives) \nas \ndefined \nin \nrecommendations C.6, C.7 and C.8 of the Code. In accordance with \nrecommendation C.2 of the Code, the Supervisory Board has also \ndefined an age limit for Supervisory Board members by setting a \nstandard limit of 72 years of age. The Supervisory Board aims to \nhave a broad range of ages represented on the board. The \nSupervisory Board also wants its members to have a suitable range \nof educational and professional backgrounds and for the board to \nhave at least one international member at all times. The Supervisory \nBoard also considers appropriate female and male representation \nwhen proposing candidates to the Annual General Meeting for \nelection. The Supervisory Board is committed to exceeding the \nstatutory minimum requirement for female and male representation \nof at least 30% each. Thereby it has to be considered that the only \nway the Supervisory Board is able to influence its composition is by \nthe candidates it proposes to the Annual General Meeting for \nelection. The employee representatives on the Supervisory Board \nare also striving to exceed female and male representation of at \nleast 30% each among employee representatives in future. \nThe Supervisory Board achieved all the stated goals in the 2022 \nfinancial year. As at 31 December 2022, with Dr. Gertrude Tumpel-\nGugerell and Robin J. Stalker, the Supervisory Board of \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft \nincluded \ntwo \ninternational \nmembers and nine women, five of whom were shareholder \nrepresentatives. The percentage of women on the Supervisory Board \nis therefore 45% at present, while the proportion of men is 55%. \nWhere required by law, the Group companies have also set their \nown targets for the proportion of women on their supervisory \nboards.  \nThe members of the Supervisory Board of Commerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft are between 49 and 71 years old; the average age \nis 57.4. The educational and professional backgrounds of the \nSupervisory Board members are varied: there are members of the \nSupervisory Board with banking training, lawyers, members with \nbusiness degrees, and engineers. Many members of the \nSupervisory Board have significant banking experience. \nDiversity policy and minimum proportions on the Board \nof Managing Directors \nIn making appointments to the Board of Managing Directors, the \nSupervisory Board aims to increase diversity, particularly with \nregard to age, origin, education and professional background, and \nto give appropriate consideration to women. As a rule, the members \nof the Board of Managing Directors should not be over 65 years of \nage. In addition, the Supervisory Board ensures that the members \nof the Board of Managing Directors have a suitable range of \neducational and professional backgrounds. \nThe Supervisory Board had set a target of at least one female \nmember by 31 December 2021.

The \nproportion of women on the Board of Managing Directors was 28.6% \nas at 31 December 2022. \nWhere required by law, the Group companies have also set their \nown targets for the proportion of women on their management \nboards.  \nTargets for the first and second levels of management \nArt. 76 (4) of the German Stock Corporation Act requires the Board \nof Managing Directors of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft to set a \ntarget for female representation at the two management levels \nbelow the Board of Managing Directors and a deadline for achieving \nthis target.  \nThe Board of Managing Directors last set new targets for female \nrepresentation at the first and second levels of Commerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft’s management (in Germany) in December 2021. \nThe target is 25% for the first management level and likewise 25% \nfor the second level. The deadline set for achieving the targets is 31 \nDecember 2026. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft has thus given \nitself ambitious targets. It is an important objective for the Bank and \nthe Group as a whole to further increase the number of women in \nmanagement positions. \nAs at 31 December 2022, the first management level below the \nBoard of Managing Directors at Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft \nconsisted of 39 managers, of whom 33 were male and 6 female. The \npercentage of women in the first level of management below the \nBoard of Managing Directors was therefore 15.4%. \nThe second management level below the Board of Managing \nDirectors consisted of 320 people, of whom 247 were male and \n73 female. The percentage of women in the second level of \nmanagement below the Board of Managing Directors was thus \n22.8%. \nThe Board of Managing Directors chose not to set targets for the \nfirst and second levels of management at Group level. Instead, the \nindividual Group companies have set their own targets within the \nstatutory framework. \nIn the Group, the first management level below the Board of \nManaging Directors consisted of 41 people, of whom 35 were male \nand 6 female. The percentage of women at the first management \nlevel below the Board of Managing Directors as at the reporting date \nwas therefore 14.6%. \nThe second management level below the Board of Managing \nDirectors consisted of 363 people, of whom 287 were male and 76 \nfemale. The percentage of women in the second level of \nmanagement below the Board of Managing Directors was therefore \n20.9%. \nAccounting \nAccounting at the Commerzbank Group and Commerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft gives a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, \nfinancial position and financial performance of the Group in \ncompliance with the respective accounting standards.

The internal control system and the risk \nmanagement system at Commerzbank are linked with each other, \nboth with a view to financial reporting. Below, we shall therefore \nuse the term ICS (internal control system). Details of the risk \nmanagement system can be found in the risk report on pages 109 \nand 110. \nThe objective of proper and reliable financial reporting is \nendangered if material information in the financial reporting is \nerroneous. It is irrelevant whether this is due to one single matter \nor a combination of several. Risks to financial reporting may arise \nfrom errors in the accounting processes. Fraudulent behaviour can \nalso result in the misstatement of information. The Bank therefore \nhas to ensure it minimises the risks of incorrect statement, \nmeasurement or presentation of material information in the \nfinancial reporting. The Commerzbank ICS is designed to provide \nreasonable assurance that the relevant legal requirements are \ncomplied with, that business is conducted in a proper and cost-\neffective manner and that financial reporting is complete and \naccurate. \nLegal basis and guidelines \nArt. 315 (4) of the German Commercial Code requires capital \nmarket-oriented companies to describe the material features of \ntheir ICS in the management report. Commerzbank follows the \nprinciples for bank-specific organisation of the internal control \nsystem set out in the Minimum Requirements for Risk \nManagement (MaRisk).  \nThe Bank’s internal control system is structured in line with the \ninternationally recognised framework developed by the Committee \nof Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \nCommerzbank derives the following objectives from this: \n \n• that business processes be effective and efficient, \n• that applicable laws and regulations be observed and \n• that financial reporting be reliable. \n \nAs regards the risk assessment of the reporting process \nrequired by COSO in respect of the reliability of financial reporting \n(for example, ensuring that all transactions are fully and correctly \nrecognised in the financial statements), the Bank follows the \nrecommendations of the International Standard on Auditing  \n(ISA) 315. \nOrganisation \nThe written rules of procedure form a sound basis for good \ncorporate governance that provides strategic direction for the \nGroup as a whole while taking account of risk elements. These \nrules are defined as the transparent description, to be updated on \nan ongoing basis, of the organisational structure and processes of \na company, including powers. The binding standard required by \nregulation for the organisational structure is set down in the policy \non the written rules of procedure and the process framework. \nThese form the framework for descriptions and documentation of \ninstructions, including processes. Documenting and updating the \norganisational structure is seen as part of the written rules of \nprocedure and sets consistent and binding minimum requirements \nas a governance framework for all corporate units. The primary \nfeature is the principle of clear allocation of responsibility, starting \nwith the schedule of business responsibilities for the Board of \nManaging Directors and ending with administrative cost approval \nauthorities at the lower management levels. The scope and \nstructure of the governance framework follow both the legal and \nregulatory requirements and also the “Commerzbank corporate \nconstitution” approved by the Board of Managing Directors. The \ngovernance framework translates the main guiding principles of \nthe corporate constitution into practical rules and comprises the \nfollowing elements: \n \n• schedule of business responsibilities for the Board of Managing \nDirectors, \n• business remits of the units, \n• rules of procedure, \n• organisational charts and \n• approval authorities for administrative costs. \n \nThe organisational control and monitoring units that ensure a \nfunctioning and efficient control structure are aligned in three \nsuccessive levels at Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. The three \nlines of defence model is a central element in Commerzbank’s \ncorporate constitution. In addition, where tasks in the Bank by \ntheir nature cannot be combined, they are organised into different \nareas applying the principle of separation of functions. Strict \nchecks are also carried out using the dual-control principle to \nminimise risks in financial reporting. \nIn accordance with MaRisk, responsibility for implementing, \nexecuting, applying, refining and reviewing the Bank-wide ICS lies \nwith the Board of Managing Directors. The Board of Managing \nDirectors is responsible for designing the Group-wide ICS and \ndemonstrating that it is appropriate, while the CFO is responsible \nfor designing the ICS over financial reporting and ensuring its \noperating effectiveness for this purpose.

In performing its duties, it has a full \nand unrestricted right to information. GM-A performs its functions \nautonomously and independently. Particularly with regard to \nreporting and the assessment of audit results, GM-A is not subject \nto any directives. GM-A’s activities complement the work of the \nsubsidiaries’ internal audit departments within the framework of \nGroup risk management. It may involve these departments in its \nauditing activities.  \nGM-A promptly prepares a written report on each audit; \nrecipients include the responsible members of the Board of \nManaging Directors. On the basis of internal and external audit \nreports, GM-A oversees and documents the steps taken to remedy \nany reported deficiencies within the period of time specified for \nthis. If the required action is not taken in time, an escalation \nprocess comes into effect. Besides its quarterly summary reports, \nGM-A also prepares an annual report on the audits that it has \ncarried out during the course of the financial year, adherence to \nthe audit plan, significant deficiencies according to MaRisk and \nthe corrective measures taken, and presents this report to the \nBoard of Managing Directors. \nThe financial reporting process \nThe financial reporting processes at Commerzbank are supported \nby IT systems integrated into each process. The annual financial \nstatements of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft in Germany are \nproduced using a financial architecture consisting of a financial \ndata warehouse that provides a consistent repository of basic \ninformation, and standard SAP software for the financial function. \nThe parent company in Germany therefore has a single solution \nusing consistent financial data for the financial statements under \nboth IFRS and the German Commercial Code. \nAs part of the input process for financial reporting, all \ninformation relevant for drawing up the financial statements of \nCommerzbank \nGroup \nunder \nIFRS \nand \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft under the German Commercial Code is \nsubmitted to GM-F by the reporting units. Data is transmitted via \nan online data entry functionality directly into SAP ECCS \nconsolidation software, which has been adapted to the Bank’s \nrequirements. Subsidiaries submit IFRS data; German and foreign \nbranches also submit data under the German Commercial Code. \nData is automatically checked for consistency before transmission \nto GM-F. Once the plausibility checks have been successfully \ncompleted, the individual reports can be finalised. Further \nplausibility checks are carried out using this data in GM-F. After \nthese checks have been successfully completed, the Commerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft annual financial statements are drawn up and \nall the necessary steps are taken to produce the Group financial \nstatements. Drawing up the Group financial statements involves \nindividual consolidation steps (e.g. consolidating equity, liabilities,"

This includes, for example, checking this non-financial \nreport. To reflect the growing importance of sustainability for the \nBank, the Supervisory Board resolved to turn the Social Welfare \nCommittee into the Environmental, Social and Governance \nCommittee. It normally meets four times per year. In particular, it \nassists the Supervisory Board, in addition to the Audit Committee, \nin \nassessing \nwhether \nthe \nmanagement \nis \nensuring \nthe \neconomically viable and sustainable performance of the Bank while \nalso observing the principles of responsible corporate governance, \nfulfilling the Bank’s social responsibility and at the same time \nconserving natural environmental resources. The ESG Committee \nalso advises the Board of Managing Directors on ESG issues.  \nAs part of the optimisation of the remuneration system for the \nBoard of Managing Directors, the Supervisory Board has now also \nlinked Commerzbank’s sustainability strategy to the variable \nremuneration of members of the Board of Managing Directors in a \nbinding manner by adding an explicit ESG sub-target within the \nGroup target, accounting for 20% of Group target achievement. \nThe Group target itself accounts for the majority (60%) of variable \nremuneration for members of the Board of Managing Directors. \nThis means that from the 2023 financial year, ESG targets will also \nbe explicitly embedded in the variable remuneration system for all \nmembers of the Board of Managing Directors via the Group target. \nThey complement any other ESG targets within the department \nand individual targets that may have already been in place in \nprevious years. Alongside other ESG criteria, the Bank’s \nsustainability targets are also embedded in our employee \nremuneration system as target criteria. They account for 25% of \nthe qualitative targets, which together with target achievement in \nthe quantitative element determine the level of variable \nremuneration in the remuneration model for non-pay-scale \nemployees. \nThe Board of Managing Directors develops the Commerzbank \nGroup’s strategy, discusses it with the Supervisory Board and \nensures it is implemented. Sustainability issues are included in the \nannual strategy process for the overall bank strategy and are \ndiscussed as required in meetings of the Board of Managing \nDirectors. Each member of the Board of Managing Directors is \nresponsible for implementing sustainability measures within their \nown divisional remit. The central sustainability management \nfunction reports to the Chairman of the Board of Managing \nDirectors and regularly informs him about progress \non \nsustainability issues and activities. \nA cross-divisional decision-making and escalation body for \nsustainability, including matters relating to climate and other \nenvironmental risks, enables the sustainable orientation of the \nbusiness model to be managed holistically. With this Group \nSustainability Board, we have firmly embedded the wide-ranging \nissue of sustainability within the Bank’s organisation. The Group \nSustainability Board sets the Bank’s strategic sustainability targets \nand monitors the measures for their implementation and \nmanagement. In addition, the divisions and segments report \nregularly on the progress of their sustainability activities and the \nimplementation of regulatory sustainability requirements. The \nGroup Sustainability Board is chaired by the Chairman of the Board \nof Managing Directors. The Board also includes other members of \nthe Board of Managing Directors and heads of divisions. \n \n \n \nBy making Group Sustainability Management the overarching \nsustainability area within the strategy unit, Commerzbank is \nunderlining the strategic priority of this topic. It is responsible for \nthe ongoing development of the sustainability strategy and \ncomprehensive \ngovernance. \nAt \nthe \nsame \ntime, \nGroup \nSustainability Management manages the “Sustainability 360°” \nGroup-wide programme and thereby coordinates the sustainability \nwork of Commerzbank in an overarching way. It also ensures the \nimplementation of strategic sustainability initiatives such as the \nPrinciples for Responsible Banking of the United Nations \nEnvironment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI).  \nThe three lines of defence concept for ESG risks was refined \nduring 2022.

Sustainability is anchored in the \nReal Estate Asset Management and Sustainability division, which \nhas additional access to further relevant resources from other \ndivisions, such as Legal and Compliance. The divisional head \nreports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Managing \nDirectors on sustainability issues. \nAt mBank, the Sustainable Development Committee, chaired by \nthe Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for managing sustainability. It \ncoordinates sustainability activities and proposes them to the \nBoard of Managing Directors. The committee also monitors the \nimplementation of the ESG strategy and the progress of ESG \ninitiatives, and approves related measures. The Board of Managing \nDirectors also maintains regular dialogue with the Supervisory \nBoard on sustainability issues, while the Risk Committee of the \nSupervisory Board addresses sustainability matters on a quarterly \nbasis. In addition, the evaluation of mBank’s top 100 managers is \npartly (10%) linked to ESG targets.  \nExternal Advisory Board appointed \nTo ensure constructive critical dialogue with our stakeholders, in \n2022 we established an external Sustainability Advisory Board led \nby the Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors. This body is \nmade up of six experts from the fields of politics, academia, \nsociety and SMEs.

The \nSustainability Advisory Board provides impetus for the further \ndevelopment of our sustainability strategy. \n \n \n \nKeeping an eye on regulatory developments \nIncreasing regulatory requirements at national, international and \nEU level require constant monitoring. Group Sustainability \nManagement keeps an eye on regulatory developments relating to \nsustainability issues and coordinates implementation with the \nrelevant units of the Bank. The aim is to further integrate \nsustainability and ESG risks into the Bank’s strategy, governance \nand risk management, and to create suitable conditions for \nmobilising capital.  \nThe current focus of regulatory requirements is on considering \nhow climate change will affect business operations and what risks \nmay arise for the Bank from different climate pathways.  \nCorporate responsibility also means seeking regular dialogue \nwith external and internal stakeholders. Commerzbank maintains \ncontact with numerous organisations and groups that have a \nrelationship with the Bank. In addition to employees, these include \nabove all customers, the capital market, suppliers and service \nproviders, the media, non-governmental organisations, politicians, \ncivil society and academics. We also engage in regular dialogue \nwith national and international regulatory and supervisory \nauthorities. \nCommerzbank pursues an active and transparent dialogue with \na view to satisfying the expectations and needs of its stakeholders, \ntaking account of them in its corporate strategy and setting out its \nown perspective. For example, we regularly discuss the potential \nimpact of our business activities on human beings and the \nenvironment with non-governmental organisations. The second \npublic Sustainability Dialogue took place in July 2022. The Bank \nused this online event, which featured the Chairman of the Board \nof Managing Directors as a speaker, to inform interested parties \nabout its sustainability activities.  \nKey issues analysed \nAt the beginning of 2022, we identified the sustainability issues \nmost relevant to us via a new materiality analysis. This analysis \nshows us which topics we need to pursue strategically as a matter \nof priority. A list of potential sustainability topics was analysed in \ncollaboration with external partners, applying two materiality \nperspectives. An exposure analysis was conducted to measure the \n“impact perspective”. This analysis built on the Bank’s internal \nfinancial and risk data and proven sustainability indicators to \ndetermine “sustainability hotspots”. These are in countries and \nsectors where Commerzbank is particularly active, both directly \nand indirectly, for example through financing, and where \nsustainability indicators in the defined areas are significantly \nbelow average. The “business perspective” – i.e. the question of \nhow high the opportunities and risks of these sustainability issues \nare for business success – was established in a management \nworkshop.  \nNine topics have consequently been identified as material. \nThey relate to all three sustainability dimensions – environmental, \nsocial and governance – and will form the future focus of our \nsustainability management activities. Climate change continues to \nhave the highest relevance for the Bank.  \n \n \nThe Sustainability Advisory Board\nprovides incentives for the further\ndevelopment of our sustainability strategy"

The strategy to achieve this \nvision rests on two pillars: we support our customers in their \nsustainable transformations and set a good example ourselves. We \nare pursuing this by means of three ambitious targets: \n \n \n \n• By 2050 we are aiming for net zero CO2 emissions from our \nentire lending and investment portfolio. To measure progress \nreliably, we use CO2 reduction targets from the Science Based \nTargets initiative (SBTi). Using this method, we plan to manage \nour portfolios also in line with the Paris Climate Agreement \nfrom 2025 at the latest (see “Reducing financed emissions”). \n• By 2025, we will mobilise €300bn for sustainable financial \nproducts. These products represent our sustainable business \nvolume, with €100bn attributable to the Private and Small-\nBusiness Customers segment and €200bn to the Corporate \nClients segment. They include lending products such as green \nmortgage loans and financing for renewable energy, along with \ninvestment and capital market products such as sustainable \nsecurities and ESG-linked loans. In the ESG framework, we \ndisclose the criteria we use to classify financial products as \nsustainable and transparently describe the composition of the \nsustainable business volume. In view of the evolving EU \nTaxonomy Regulation and the new requirements under the \nCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) that will \napply from the reporting year 2024 onwards, we will realign the \nsustainable business volume target accordingly. We will also \nfurther expand the range of sustainable products offered in our \nbusiness divisions (see “Taking climate into account in \nlending” and “Sustainable investments and capital products”). \nKey \nfigure: \nBy \nthe \nend \nof \n2022, \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft had mobilised €246.5bn for sustainable \nfinancial products, out of a target of €300bn by the end of \n2025. There was a strong increase in 2022 for ESG-/ \nSustainability-linked loans and promissory note loans in \nparticular to €107.9bn. This also includes syndicated loans \namounting \nto \n€103.8bn \n(Loan \ncommitments \nfrom \nCommerzbank around 7%). A detailed overview of all products \ncontributing to this goal can be found on page 71 (table \n“Composition of the €300bn target”). \n \n \n \n• We plan to reduce the CO2 emissions of our own banking \noperations to net zero as early as 2040. By 2025, greenhouse \ngas emissions at Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft are to be \nreduced by a further 30% compared with 2018. We expect our \nsuppliers to be climate-neutral by 2040.

The status of the programme is regularly reported to the \nBoard of Managing Directors. \nOrganisational chart for the 360-degree strategic \ninitiative \n \n \n \nCommerz \nReal \nhas \nbeen \npursuing \nits \nSustainable4Life \nsustainability strategy since 2020 and has embedded it within the \ncompany’s business strategy, in the four impact areas of Portfolio \n& Investments, Directives & Processes, Team & Stakeholders and \nInnovation & Digitalisation. \nAt mBank, too, the ESG agenda is a key component of the \nbusiness strategy for 2021 to 2025. It is guided by the United \nNations Sustainable Development Goals that are relevant for it, \nand by the UNEP FI Principles for Responsible Banking. Its \nstrategy covers matters such as responsibility for climate change, \nfor the financial situation of its customers, for society, for investors \nand for alignment with ESG values.  \nmBank also announced long-term targets for its carbon \nneutrality strategy in 2022. It is committed to achieving carbon \nneutrality in its direct emissions (Scope 1) and those of the energy \nit purchases (Scope 2) by 2030. mBank plans to become \ncompletely carbon neutral – including its loan portfolio – by 2050. \nTo this end, it became the first Polish bank to join the Partnership \nfor Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) in April 2022. This \nalliance enables the carbon footprint of the loan portfolio to be \ndetermined in accordance with recognised standards. In October \n2022, mBank joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to \nensure that it implements its decarbonisation targets in line with \nthe Paris Climate Agreement. As part of its strategy, mBank has \nalso undertaken to introduce at least one new ESG-compliant \nproduct per year in both the retail and corporate customer \nsegments. For example, in 2022 it began offering an “EcoLoan” to \nretail banking customers for financing environmentally friendly \ninvestments. This product is in line with the objectives of the EU \nTaxonomy Regulation. mBank has already granted more than 500 \nof these loans for energy-efficient homes, with a total volume of \nalmost €67m (about PLN 314m). \n3. Responsible management \n \nOne of the three objectives agreed under the 2015 Paris \nAgreement was to bring global financial flows into line with \nclimate targets. Funding for new projects and technologies is \nintended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support climate \nchange adaptation measures. The aim is a gradual decarbonisation \nof industry with the aid of financial instruments. This can be done, \nfor example, by promoting renewable forms of energy (See \n“Supporting the customer transformation”) or forgoing certain \ntransactions such as financing new coal mines or coal-fired power \nstations.

The focus of the ESG framework is on our core \nbusiness. The ESG framework provides an overview of our \nsustainability directives and exclusion criteria. The Bank has \nadopted a clear stance on controversial issues such as arms, palm \noil, deforestation and fossil fuels. To this end, we have formulated \nsector-specific requirements, for example for mining, energy and \nfossil fuels, including oil and gas. Cross-sector requirements relate \nto human rights and indigenous peoples. \n \n \n \nExclusion criteria have been defined for particularly critical \nproducts, transactions or business relationships. This includes, for \nexample, new financing for oil and gas production projects \n(conventional and unconventional production methods), as well as \nthe Group-wide decision not to finance new construction or \nexpansion for coal mines, coal infrastructure or coal-fired power \nplants. Financing of such projects is excluded under our Fossil \nFuels Policy. In this way, we ensure that even existing customers \nare not supported by any business that is prohibited under the \nFossil Fuels Policy. For years now, environmental and biodiversity \naspects have been integrated into the core business by means of \nminimum environmental standards and corresponding exclusion \ncriteria, and compliance with these standards has been monitored. \nEvaluating environmental and social risks \nSustainability \nin \nthe \ncore \nbusiness is assessed by the \nReputational Risk Management \ndepartment at Commerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft. We do not \nlimit ourselves to what is legally required; instead, we consider the \nlegitimacy of all transactions.  \nIn view of the special risks associated with fossil fuels and \narms, the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft has passed its own binding directives on these \nmatters that define many of the relevant transactions and business \nrelationships in these areas as being subject to assessment, and \nencompass exclusion criteria. The Fossil Fuels Policy was revised \nat \nthe \nbeginning \nof \n2022 \nand \nincludes \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft’s requirements for customers in the coal, oil \nand gas sectors.  \nAdjustments were also made in relation to arms during the year \nunder review. What has not changed is that we recognise the basic \nright of states to defend themselves and do not question the need \nfor the German armed forces to exist or to be adequately \nequipped. We therefore continue to finance arms manufacturers \nwho produce weapons and armament systems for the Federal \nRepublic of Germany and its allies. Nevertheless, we have \ntightened and expanded the requirements and criteria for the arms \nindustry applying to Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, which have \nbeen in place since 2008. The Board of Managing Directors \napproved the new Arms and Surveillance Technology Policy in \nJanuary 2023. It preserves the fundamental parameters of the old \npolicy, which means that Commerzbank will not fund arms \nbusiness in conflict zones or areas of tension, or business relating \nto what are termed “controversial weapons”. In addition, the new \npolicy now also governs the approach in relation to autonomous \nweapons and surveillance technology. \n \n \n \nCommerzbank is committed to respecting human rights and \nwants to help promote and uphold these within its scope \ninfluence, for example in its dealings with employees, suppliers \nand customers. The Bank’s Position on Human Rights describes in \ndetail how we address this matter. In the Reputational Risk \nManagement department, business transactions and relationships \nin sectors such as mining, raw materials extraction and cotton \nproduction, where human rights are a significant consideration, \nare intensively researched, analysed and assessed in detail. During \nthe year under review, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft also \nworked intensively on implementing the German Act on Corporate \nDue Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG), which entered \ninto force on 1 January 2023 (see “Managing compliance risks”). \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft’s \nReputational \nRisk \nManagement department thus defines the criteria for and limits of \nbusiness operations and assesses transactions, products and \ncustomer relationships after careful analysis.  \n \n \nThe bank has a clear stance on\ncontroversial issues such as arms, palm oil,\ndeforestation or fossil energies\nWe are committed to respecting \nhuman rights and are contributing \nto their promotion and protection"

The assessment uses a five-\npoint scale and can result in a rejection of the product, the \ntransaction or the business relationship. According to the risk \ninventory, reputational risk is one of the main non-quantifiable risk \ntypes in the Commerzbank Group and is therefore managed as \npart of the overall risk strategy. All sensitive issues, positions and \ndirectives are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary.  \nmBank in Poland operates its own Reputational Risk \nManagement department based on its commitment to the United \nNations Global Compact. mBank’s risk management strategy is \nbased on three pillars: supporting sustainable growth, striving for \nprudent and stable risk management, and strengthening its skills \nin managing ESG and cyber risks. mBank has formulated its own \nexclusion criteria for various sectors based on the EU’s climate \nand energy policies. These include the mining and energy sectors, \namong others: for example, financing for the construction or \nexpansion of hard coal and lignite mines is excluded. mBank’s \nreputational risk strategy is reviewed annually and coordinated \nwith the parent company. \nRecognising impacts on biodiversity \nGlobal economic output is \ndependent \non \nproperly \nfunctioning \necosystems, \nwhich makes conserving \nbiodiversity imperative.

Using the SBTi method “Sectoral \nDecarbonisation Approach” (SDA), we have set specific sector-\nspecific goals with a view to reducing the CO2 emissions \nassociated with our loan and investment portfolio (known as \n“financed emissions”) and ultimately meeting our net zero target. \nWe aim to manage all portfolios highlighted as requiring \nattention in the SBTi method, with a particular focus on emissions-\nintensive sectors. These include power generation, fossil fuels, \nautomotive manufacturing, and the production of cement, iron and \nsteel. We will also consider the private residential mortgage loan \nportfolio, which is deemed optional in the SBTi analysis.

The financial system can make a crucial contribution to \ntransforming the economy by directing capital flows towards \nsustainable investments. As a uniform classification system, the \nEU Taxonomy Regulation is intended to support financial market \nparticipants in recognising sustainable economic activities by \napplying comparable criteria. \nIt thus provides key guidance for the development of new \ngreen products and services and helps us assess the sustainability \nof businesses, partners and customers. Commerz Real’s impact \nfund, klimaVest, is aligned with the EU taxonomy criteria. With full \nimplementation of the Regulation from 2023, more extensive \ninformation will become available, which will significantly increase \ntransparency with regard to the sustainability of business partners \nand their activities. On this basis, the sustainable transformation \ncan, for example, be supported to an even greater extent through \ndifferentiated pricing models.  \nThe EU has identified 104 economic activities across 13 sectors \nin the Taxonomy Regulation. The activities included may be \nparticularly relevant in terms of their impact on the climate and \nenvironment – both positive and negative. In March 2022, a \nseparate delegated act expanded the economic activities to \ninclude nuclear and gas activities, which are considered \ntransitional activities for a certain period of time.  \nOnce the full requirements enter into force in the 2023 \nreporting year, the affected transactions must be checked for their \ntaxonomy compliance. Only then can a statement be made as to \nwhether the business can be described as sustainable within the \nmeaning of the EU taxonomy. It is on this basis that we will \ncalculate the Bank-specific “green asset ratio” metric going \nforward. Economic activities in the nuclear and gas sectors must \nbe included in the green asset ratio, but must also be reported \nseparately."

The EU taxonomy only covers certain parts of the \nportfolio; for example, assets outside the European Economic Area \nare not captured (see also KPIs 3–7). The proportion of the defined \neconomic activities and sectors that must be subjected to a \ntaxonomy compliance check (taxonomy-eligible; see KPI 1) is \ndisclosed. As such, the portfolio is initially broken down based on \nwhat proportion requires a taxonomy check; the actual results of \nthe checks (taxonomy compliance) will be reported with full \nimplementation from 2023. The following figure illustrates this: \n \n \n \n \n \n   The chart does not provide any information on the volume of the taxonomy-compliant business.

KPIs 3, 4, 6 and 7 indicated in the table illustrate a \ndimension about the disclosed amounts.  \nExposures to companies that are not required to issue a non-\nfinancial report are also classed as not taxonomy-relevant. We do \nnot currently have a complete data source available that would \nenable us to identify which companies are required to publish a \nnon-financial report and must therefore satisfy the requirements of \nthe EU taxonomy. We derived this using data from an external \ndata provider on companies required to publish a non-financial \nreport, which we combined with our portfolio information. \nIrrespective of this, we also classified any corporate customer that \nemploys more than 500 people and is headquartered in the EEA as \nbeing required to publish a non-financial report.  \nIn the next step, we examined the volume identified as \ntaxonomy-relevant for its taxonomy eligibility and assigned it to \nKPI 1 or KPI 2. The taxonomy eligibility can be derived in \nparticular from the specific intended use. Loans with a purpose \nnot related to economic activities covered by the EU taxonomy are \nnot considered taxonomy-eligible and fall under KPI 2. To \ndetermine the taxonomy eligibility of the securities portfolio and \ngeneral-purpose loans, we used the taxonomy ratios published by \nthe respective counterparties and borrowers, where available. The \ndata relate to the 2021 financial year and were also obtained from \nan external party. The transactions were weighted by the \ncompanies’ sales-based and capex-based KPIs and included in the \nnumerator. The two KPIs are to be considered independently of \neach other. \nWhere there is no information on assets, Commerzbank has \ndecided to classify these conservatively as non-taxonomy-eligible \nand assign them to KPI 2. Any possible exaggeration or \nunderstatement of the taxonomy-relevant volume (KPIs 1 and 2) \nthat could result from application of the non-financial report \nrequirement therefore has only a small impact on the volume \nclassed as taxonomy-eligible (KPI 1). This relates predominantly to \nreal estate loans, which are not relevant for this distinction. \nIn spring 2022, the European Commission expanded the EU \ntaxonomy to include economic activities in the nuclear and gas \nsectors. Commerzbank’s own understanding of sustainability in \nthese activities is described in greater detail in the ESG \nframework. We have a principle of not financing any new nuclear \npower plants. The same is true for uranium mines. We assess \nfossil fuels very critically and tightened our requirements for such \ntransactions at the beginning of 2022.  \nAt the same time, we see the need for gas as a transition \ntechnology over the coming years to ensure continued stability of \nsupply. We therefore critically scrutinise financing for the \nconstruction of gas-fired power plants on a case-by-case basis. We \nexpect our customers in the energy supply sector, whose power \ngeneration portfolios may include nuclear power and/or gas-fired \npower \nplants, \nto \ntake \nclear \nsteps \ntowards \nsustainable \ntransformation. \nThe extension of the EU taxonomy to include nuclear and gas \ndid not come into force until 1 January 2023, so the corresponding \ncompany data will be published for the first time in the course of \n2023. At present, it is only possible to estimate the proportion of \nthe portfolio that relates to these economic activities. Based on the \navailable internal and external data, only a small proportion of the \ntaxonomy-relevant portfolio is expected to relate to nuclear and \ngas business, meaning that KPI 1 is estimated to increase by less \nthan 0.2 percentage points. \n \n \n \nManaging climate and biodiversity risks  \nAt Commerzbank, we do not consider climate risks as a separate \ntype of risk, but as a horizontal risk. This can materialise across \nthe different known types of risk. In 2022, we again carried out \na comprehensive materiality analysis for climate risks across all \nrisk types for the Commerzbank Group, in particular with regard to \nthe expectations set out in the ECB’s guidance on climate and \nenvironmental risks. In this process, all risk types assessed as \nmaterial in the risk inventory are evaluated in terms of their \nmateriality in relation to climate risks, and both transition and \nphysical risks are taken into consideration. Transition risks arise \nfor companies, for example, as a result of regulatory or legal \nchanges in energy policy, changes in market sentiment and \npreferences, or technological innovations. Physical risks, on the \nother hand, develop as a result of changing climatic conditions \nand the associated more extreme and more frequent acute \nweather events, such as floods, or chronic effects, such as rising \nsea levels.  \nDepending on the risk type, the assessment was made on a \nqualitative and/or quantitative basis. As a result of the analysis, the \ninfluence of climate and environmental risks for the risk types \ncredit risk, market risk, operational risk (including compliance and \ncyber risk), reputational risk and business risk was confirmed as \nmaterial.  \nWe do not finance \nany new nuclear power plants"

      "text": "54 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nThe findings of the materiality analysis feed into the creation of \nthe business strategy, the overall risk strategy and the sub-risk \nstrategies as well as into other core elements of the Bank’s \ninternal process to ensure an adequate capital position, such as \nthe internal stress test framework and the risk-bearing capacity \nconcept. \nWith regard to credit risk, relevant parameters of various \nclimate scenarios were holistically translated into economic \neffects. For transition risks, changes in regulations, prices and \nsupply or demand, and the effects of technological changes are \nconsidered, among other things; to assess physical risks, climate \nscenarios involving acute flooding and heat events are used and \nanalysed. This is followed by a statement on the impact of climate \nrisks in the short, medium and long term up to 2050. \n \n \n \nTransition risks are industry-specific and can sometimes vary \nsignificantly between different sub-sectors of an industry \n(e.g. mechanical engineering). We look at the impact on an \nindustry from both a macroeconomic and an internal Bank \nperspective. Potential impacts of physical climate risks vary, in \nsome \ncases \nsignificantly, \nby \ngeographic \nlocation \nand \ncircumstances, and must be considered when taking a portfolio \nperspective.  \nAs a major financier of the German economy, we are also active \nin sectors that are particularly exposed to climate-related physical \nor transition risks. However, we have little exposure to some of the \nhardest-hit sectors (agriculture, for example). Sectors that could \npotentially be more heavily affected by climate risks and that have \na sufficiently large exposure are, for example, the energy sector, \nthe automotive sector and mechanical engineering. Owing to the \ngeographical focus of our portfolio in Germany and Europe, we are \nless affected by physical climate risks, such as hurricanes and \nrising sea levels, than other regions in the world. Overall, both \nclimate-related transition and physical risks are considered \nmaterial to credit risk over a long-term time horizon. \nTaking climate into account in lending  \nIn order to proactively manage the effects of climate risks in \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s lending business, we are \nsystematically optimising our processes and methods. Lending \ndecisions for companies and institutional customers therefore take \ninto account not only an individual risk assessment but also – \nwhere relevant – the extent to which they involve climate risks and \nthe level of resilience to them. \nIn this, we are progressively combining the specific findings \nfrom the scenario analyses with the individual risk analysis at \ncustomer level. We take a portfolio-specific approach and thus \ntake appropriate account of the differences in terms of \naffectedness and the risk drivers. In the particularly relevant \nportfolios, such as large, international companies, special \nfinancing \nand \ncommercial \nreal \nestate \nfinance, \nwe \nhave \nsupplemented the qualitative risk analysis in the individual loan \ndecisions with specific aspects for the analysis of climate risks. \n \n \n \nThe results of the analyses are aggregated into a structured \nassessment that is incorporated into the decision-making \nprocesses. We take this score into account in individual lending \ndecisions, but we also use it as part of portfolio analysis and \nmanagement. We will progressively extend this approach to other \nrelevant portfolios and include smaller companies, for example. In \nour target state, we want to integrate climate risks – as far as \npossible – into the quantitative credit risk analysis and thus fully \nreflect them across the process chain, including in pricing and \nreporting. \nClimate risks also play a major role in Commerz Real’s asset \nmanagement, both physical and transition risks. The Bank uses \nfuture scenarios based on the representative CO2 concentration \npathways set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange to accurately determine the exposure of assets and the \nportfolio. In its risk assessment, including scenario analyses, \nCommerz Real relies on tools such as the Carbon Risk Real Estate \nMonitor (CRREM) and the PwC Climate Excellence Tool. The \nCRREM tool shows climate pathways using asset class and \ncountry-specific CO2 and final energy target values for a 1.5° and a \n2.0° scenario. The Climate Excellence Tool, on the other hand, \nallows for a site-specific evaluation of physical climate risks for \ndifferent scenarios. In this way, Commerz Real tries to perform a \nrisk analysis that is as accurate as possible for the location on the \nbasis of existing data and to derive specific measures to prevent \ndamage at an early stage.

In 2022 the \nmateriality analysis examined for the first time the extent to which \nbiodiversity is material as a risk driver for the Commerzbank \nGroup. As with climate risks, biodiversity risks can be divided into \nphysical and transition risks. While physical biodiversity risks arise \nfrom a loss or degradation of things provided by the ecosystem on \nwhich the economic system depends (e.g. pollination or genetic \ndiversity), transition risks in this context refer to risks that arise \nfrom the transformation process towards a more sustainable and \nenvironmentally friendly economy.  \n \n \n \nThe physical risk analysis focused on an assessment of the \ndependence on the ecosystem of sectors in which Commerzbank \nis represented through credit exposures. To do this, we used \nexternal data that classify the degree of dependence of sectors on \nthe ecosystem, and we considered these data in conjunction with \nthe volume of business in each sector.  \nIn the case of transition biodiversity risks for credit risk, the \nnegative impact of business activities on the environment and the \nconsequences due to anticipated future regulatory changes to \nprotect biodiversity were included.  \nAs a result, we currently assess physical biodiversity risks as \nnot material, but consider transition risks to be material risk \ndrivers for credit risk in the medium and long term. It can be \nassumed that biodiversity risks will tend to increase with time. In \nthe future, a more in-depth analysis is planned, supported by \ncorresponding scenarios – where available – and more advanced \nevaluation methods in this context. \n4. Supporting the customer \ntransformation \n \nGlobal efforts to combat climate change require not only \nfavourable political conditions and new technical solutions, but \nabove all adequate financial resources. This poses numerous \nopportunities for us as a bank: the energy revolution and reduction \nin CO2 emissions are creating a need for new technologies and \nproducts requiring large investments. At the same time, our \ncustomers are facing new types of non-financial challenges: from \ncollecting data and managing their own carbon footprints to \nmaking decisions on their technological direction in the context of \nthe energy transition. In addition, interest in sustainable \ninvestment opportunities is growing, which is why we are \ndeveloping products and services that take account of these \nchanges while offering an environmental or social benefit.  \nWe provide our customers with expert advice on transforming \ntheir business models. We align our offering with their interests, \nevaluate our business success in part based on their satisfaction, \nand incorporate sustainability into our dialogue formats.

As a result, we have \nidentified sectors that offer us new sustainable business \nopportunities and at the same time allow us to provide advisory \nservices and financing products to support our customers in their \nown transformations. The sales and lending departments work \nclosely together to address the specifics of ESG issues. mBank also \nbegan reviewing and evaluating new products in terms of their \nimpact on the environment and society (including customers) in \n2022. This encompasses sustainability aspects such as greenhouse \ngas emissions and climate change, waste and the circular \neconomy, and equal access to financial services. \nPromoting renewable energy  \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft \nhas long, wide-ranging experience \nwith renewable energy. Corporate \nand project financing along the \nvalue chain have been part of our \nportfolio since the 1980s and will \ncontinue to be a growth area for us \nin the future. The core business of \nthe Competence Center Energy \n(CoC Energy) with its sites in Hamburg and New York is the global \nprovision of finance to wind and solar parks as well as related \ntechnology. The plants that are financed are operated in particular \nby independent power producers, project developers, institutional \ninvestors and utilities. \n \n \n \nToday we are one of the largest financiers of renewable energy \nin Europe and we have further expanded our international \nportfolio share in the past year. In 2022, in addition to financing \nfor wind farms and solar parks in Germany, we also successfully \nadded new projects and refinancing transactions in France, the \nUK, the Netherlands, Spain and the USA. Noteworthy projects in \nthis category include support for the Bank’s first standalone \nfinancing of a battery storage system in the USA and the portfolio \nfinancing of solar parks in Germany with an output of 315 \nmegawatts. CoC Energy’s total financing commitment in 2022 was \naround €8bn.  \n \n \n \nAs part of its 2021–2025 business strategy, mBank has committed \nto mobilising approximately €2.1bn (PLN 10bn) to finance green \ninvestments, particularly in renewable energy sources. At the end \nof 2022, mBank’s total renewable energy portfolio had a value of \n€705.9m (PLN 3.4bn). In 2022 alone, mBank provided around \n€132.9m (PLN 636.5m) for seven photovoltaic projects and four \nwind farm projects. In addition to financing large-scale projects, \nmBank offers financial support for smaller renewable energy \nprojects with a rated output of up to 5 megawatts.  \nCommerz Real contributes directly to shaping the energy \ntransition by investing in renewable energy. It also sourced \nelectricity from renewable sources for the properties held by its \nfunds and special funds, where local markets permitted. \nDemonstrating sustainable solutions \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft \nalso \nincorporates \nsustainability \nconsiderations into \nthe development of traditional financing solutions. We advise \nbusinesses about the advantages of public promotional loans such \nas KfW’s energy efficiency programmes or its climate protection \ninitiative for small and medium-sized enterprises. We keep an eye \non new products and product evolutions from the public funding \nbodies and offer these to our customers.  \nWithin corporate customer lending, since the beginning of \n2022 we have also been offering sustainable bilateral credit \nproducts used to fund sustainability-related projects (green loans). \nCorporate financing can also take the form of KPI-linked loans and \nESG rating-linked loans, where the margins are based on the \nextent of the company’s transformation efforts.  \n \n \nThe total funding commitments of the \nCenter of Competence „Energy“ \namounted to around €8bn in 2022\nPhotovoltaics\n20.7%\nWind Offshore 17.1%\nWind Onshore 41.7%\nCorporate Clients\n20.2%\nRenewable energy portfolio\n(€bn | financing commitments as at 31 December 2022)\nOther 0.3%\n€8bn"

The \nBank is also working on expanding other financing products to \ninclude sustainability components. \nIn the Private and Small-Business Customers segment, we offer \nfinancing for energy-efficient buildings. The green mortgage loans \nscheme, for example, offers preferential financing conditions for \nthe construction, modernisation or acquisition of buildings – for \nown or third-party use – whose final energy demand is less than \n50kWh per square metre of usable floor space.  \nThe green CBU, an individual loan for self-employed people \nand small businesses, also finances sustainable commercial \ninvestments. Examples of these include heat or electricity \ngeneration from sustainable, renewable sources and investments \nin electric and hydrogen mobility, which are subsidised by means \nof a reduced interest rate. The intended uses of these projects \nmeet the definition of sustainable products under the ESG \nframework, meaning that the financing goes towards climate \nprotection or climate adaptation activities. \n \n \n \nResponsibility in lending business goes even further for the \nPrivate Customers segment, however: responsible lending is a \nholistic advisory approach that also takes account of potential \nchanges in a customer’s economic situation. In line with this \napproach, the Bank’s Risk division has special units dedicated to \nearly risk detection. Their tasks include identifying customers with \nsigns of financial problems early on – and thus before the \nemergence of problems threatening their existence, if possible – \nand suggesting measures to be taken which will, ideally, lead to an \norderly repayment process. \nSustainable investments  \nand capital market products \nIn the investment business, too, we want to contribute to \nsustainable development and take advantage of the associated \nbusiness opportunities, for example by offering sustainable funds, \nintegrating sustainability matters into asset management and \nusing sustainable capital market instruments. \nSince 2022, we have also taken our customers’ sustainability \npreferences \ninto \nconsideration \nas \nstandard \nwhen \ngiving \ninvestment advice. \nDeveloping sustainable bonds and loans  \nIn \n2007, \nwe \nwere involved in \nissuing \nthe \nworld’s \nfirst \ngreen \nbond. \nSince then, we have supported a large number of companies in \npreparing and issuing sustainable bonds. In the year under review \nalone, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft acted as lead manager for \nthe issue of 59 sustainable bonds with a total volume of €46.6bn \n(2021: €62.3bn). This volume is included in the sustainable \nbusiness volume in accordance with the criteria set out in the ESG \nframework. \n \n \n \nThese included a number of innovative transactions, such as \nthe first sustainability-linked bond in the Swiss franc market in \nJanuary 2022 and the largest green bond transaction by a \ncorporate issuer to date in May 2022. We continue to be active in \nvarious industry associations and similar interest groups, thus \nhelping to actively develop the market for sustainable bonds. In \ntotal, the Bank has already assisted in the issue of more than 200 \nsustainable bonds.  \nIn \naddition, \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft \narranges, \nstructures and places sustainable promissory note loans and \nsyndicated loans, particularly in the form of ESG-linked loans, for \ncorporate customers of varying sizes across a wide range of \nsectors. In these transactions, we regularly act as sustainability \ncoordinator in order to develop ambitious ESG structures, working \non behalf of the banking consortium in close consultation with the \ncompanies. ESG-linked loans are a comparatively new but very \nfast-growing product category, and now represent the most \ncommon form of sustainable syndicated loans. The terms of the \nloans are linked to sustainability criteria, predominantly in the \nform of sustainability-related KPIs, or to an ESG rating of the \nborrower. If the borrower meets the predefined targets for these \nKPIs or the underlying rating, the interest rate is lower – with \nhigher interest rates applying if they are not met. Sustainable \npromissory note loans operate in essentially the same way. Since \n2017, we have been participating in working groups of the Loan \nMarket Association to actively shape the implementation of \nsustainability in the syndicated loan market.  \nWith our “Green Mortgage” the financing conditions for the \nconstruction, modernization or acquisition of buildings for \npersonal or third-party use are discounted\nIn 2022, Commerzbank was lead manager \nin the issuance of 59 sustainable bonds \nwith a total volume of €46.6bn"

It was also \ninvolved as the arranger in eight sustainable promissory note \nloans with a total transaction volume of €3.24bn, of which €800m \nwas attributable to the largest sustainable promissory note \ntransaction anywhere in the world to date. \n \n \n \nSustainability aspects are also playing an increasingly \nimportant role in the Bank’s own investments. As part of its \nliquidity management activities, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft \nis increasingly investing in sustainable bonds and building up its \nown ESG portfolio. To this end, the Bank plans to invest an \nincreasing proportion of its own assets in green, social and \nsustainability bonds. By the end of 2022, their volume within the \nliquidity portfolio had reached €2.2bn. Commerzbank takes \nsustainability aspects into consideration in its company pension \nscheme in Germany, with asset managers only selected for the \npension plan if they have signed up to the UN Principles for \nResponsible Investment (UN PRI). \nInvesting customers’ money sustainably \nAs \na \nsignatory to \nthe UN PRI, \nthe \nAsset \nManagement \nunit at Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is committed to making \nresponsible investment decisions. Asset Management therefore \noffers wealthy individuals and corporate customers various \nsolutions that take environmental and social factors into \nconsideration. In particular, customers can agree on individual \nsustainable asset management in which the security selection not \nonly takes exclusion criteria and sustainability ratings into \naccount, but also aims to invest in companies with sustainable \nbusiness activities. Overall, the proportion of sustainable \ninvestments, which under the ESG framework feed into the \nsustainable business volume, has increased significantly in recent \nyears and as at the end of 2022 accounted for 10.7% of \nCommerzbank Asset Management’s AuM.  \nThe motif investing product offered by Commerzbank’s \ncomdirect brand enables customers to make targeted investments \nin megatrends without the need to obtain advice. The funds, ETFs \nand equities are sorted into themes such as robotics, health, \ntechnology and sustainability, which customers can then use to \ncompile their portfolio.  \nThese products are also available to select for other investment \nformats such as savings plans. comdirect is also responding to \ncustomer demand for green investment opportunities via its digital \nasset management service, cominvest green. \nmBank is also active in this segment, having launched a new \nESG investment strategy in September 2019. Private customers \ncan now invest in ETF-based equity and bond portfolios that have \na positive impact on the environment and society. The value of \nassets invested in ESG asset management strategies for private \ncustomers shrank by 20% year on year to €32m (PLN 153m) as at \nthe end of 2022, but at the same time these strategies’ share of the \ntotal volume rose year on year from 29% to 32%. \nCommerz Real combines sustainable investment opportunities \nwith a direct contribution to shaping the energy revolution: the \nfirst investments were made in solar energy via funds back in \n2005, and numerous investments have followed. The portfolio was \nalso expanded to include onshore and offshore wind turbines. \nWith a total annual output of around 1,623 megawatts from 57 \nground-mounted solar power plants and 43 onshore/offshore wind \nfarms, the Commerz Real Group is now one of the biggest German \nasset managers in this segment. The total transaction volume in \nrenewable energy stood at around €4.2bn at the end of 2022.  \n \n \n \nIn 2020, Commerz Real launched klimaVest, the first open-\nended real asset fund in the renewable energy sector aimed at \nprivate investors, with redemption rights in the form of an ELTIF \n(European Long-Term Investment Fund). Since 2021, the fund has \nmet the transparency requirements to qualify as a sustainable \nfinancial product under Article 9 of the EU Disclosure Regulation. \nklimaVest invests mainly in facilities for the generation of \nrenewable energy and in the infrastructure of the energy \nrevolution. The fund’s investment objective is to generate \nattractive risk-adjusted returns for investors while making a \npositive contribution to the achievement of environmentally \nsustainable objectives within the meaning of the EU taxonomy. \nklimaVest’s volume stood at around €992.3m at end-2022. This \nfigure is expected to grow to €4.5bn by 2025, with a target of \naround €2.2bn in equity. \nCommerz Real also sets great store by sustainability in \nmanaging its real estate assets, such as with hausInvest.

In most cases, the complaint was that \ndata had been put to unauthorised use or had become known to \nthird parties. \n \n \n \nUsing big data responsibly \nThe use of big data and advanced analytics (BDAA) is of central \nstrategic importance for Commerzbank. Efficient and holistic data \nprocessing offers great opportunities for all segments and Group \ndivisions: as a basis for decision-making in the management of \noperational processes, for more detailed and faster analysis, and \nfor improved service and cross-selling. In addition, BDAA provides \nmethods for efficiently designing Group-wide models to calculate \ncredit and operational risk as well as capital requirements, and to \nperform stress testing. This helps to ensure regulatory compliance \nand improve capital efficiency. To comply with the high data \nprotection standards, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft works with \npseudonymisation, anonymisation and micro-segmentation.  \nMaintaining dialogue \nFor us, product transparency and fairness towards our customers \nmean providing holistic and comprehensible advice on financial \nproducts, their risks and possible alternatives in accordance with \nlong-term needs. This also includes documenting the advisory \nprocess in transparent fashion. In recent years, we have \nintroduced new products and services with particular customer \nbenefits. These include a green ecosystem, green mortgage loans \nand the new “money mate” investment solution.  \nAll units of the Group get their customers actively involved. \nExperts communicate with customers through various channels to \nensure that their ideas and suggestions are taken into account \nwhen developing products and services.

The 2022 study was on the topic of cyber \nsecurity. The results show that the companies surveyed consider \nthis to be a very important issue. Around two in five companies in \nGermany have already been the victim of a cyber attack, with \nnearly one in five affected companies suffering losses as a result of \nthe attack. Nevertheless, the vast majority of companies feel they \nare well-positioned when it comes to cyber security. \nImproving advisory services \nWith the amendment of the MiFID II Directive as part of the EU \nAction Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth, it became \nmandatory in August 2022 to ask about sustainability preferences \nwhen providing investment advisory and financial portfolio \nmanagement services. Our investment advisory teams received \nintensive training on this topic. As part of the fact-finding stage, \nwe educate customers about the three sustainability standards \ndefined in the guideline and ask about their sustainability \npreferences. Where they have a sustainability preference, \ncustomers subsequently decide on the share of their investments \nto be put into sustainable assets. The advisory universe in the \nPrivate and Small-Business Customers segment comprises some \n500 financial instruments that meet at least one of the \nsustainability standards defined by MiFID II. \n \n \n \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is building up a green \necosystem for sustainability-related issues that lie outside our core \ncompetencies. The Bank’s expert cooperation partners provide \nsupport in the form of consulting services, for example \ndetermining a company’s carbon footprint, developing a specific \nsustainability strategy, or identifying and managing climate risks. \nIn this way, we have already been able to help many customers \nsince the programme was launched at the start of 2022. \nTo make Commerzbank’s products and services available to all \ninterested parties, we also go to great lengths to ensure that our \nbranches and online offering are fully accessible. Around two-\nthirds of our branches are accessible at ground level. We strive to \nensure accessibility for all user groups where possible whenever \nwe renovate a branch or install an ATM. For dispensing cash, all of \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s ATMs have a read-aloud \nfunction for visually impaired people. Further information on our \nefforts to be inclusive, including towards our employees, can be \nfound under “Driving inclusion”. \nPrivate customers can use a CO2 calculator in the banking app \nto work out their personal carbon footprint based on a \nquestionnaire about their mobility and consumption habits and \nliving situation. This application is supplemented by information \non sustainable lifestyles and sustainable product offerings from \nCommerzbank. \nThe involvement of our customers is \na guiding principle for our actions\nSome 500 financial instruments in the Private and Corporate \nClients segment meet at least one of the sustainability \nstandards defined by MiFID-2"

      "text": "62 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \n5. Leading by example \n \nAs a company, we have a responsibility towards the environment \nand society. That is why we not only want to support our \ncustomers in their transformations, but also to set a good example \nourselves. We will achieve this, among other ways, by \ncontinuously reducing our environmental footprint. At the same \ntime we want to be a reliable partner for our stakeholders, and our \nactions are guided by ethical values such as integrity and fairness. \nIn addition, we take our responsibility as an employer seriously \nand promote diversity and equal opportunities in practice. Lastly, \nwe positively influence our environment through our voluntary \ncommitment to charitable causes and our foundations. \nReducing operational emissions \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesell-\nschaft has had \nan ISO 14001-\ncertified \nenvironmental management system in place ever since 2009. In \n2015, we added an energy management system certified to ISO \n50001, establishing an integrated environmental and energy \nmanagement system (iUEMS).  \nThis defines the responsibilities, behaviour, processes and \nspecifications \nfor \nthe \nimplementation \nof \nthe \noperational \nenvironmental and energy policy and documents them in a \nstructured manner. The focus is on optimising resource \nconsumption, particularly where we can have a direct impact on \nthe environment, such as in building management and business \ntrips. \n \n \n \nFirst and foremost, the iUEMS serves to continuously improve \nour own environmental and energy performance. At the same \ntime, it helps minimise risk: by regularly observing and checking \nthe current situation, any need for action can be identified at an \nearly stage and preventive measures can be taken. This integrated \nmanagement system forms an ideal basis for ensuring the \nbusiness has a sustainable orientation. \nWe can achieve savings in our operational emissions through \nefficient and sustainable building management in particular, and \nwe are taking various measures to achieve this. These include \ngradually replacing conventional light sources with LEDs since \n2017, making a significant contribution to energy saving.  \nWe continuously review the energy efficiency of our buildings \nusing defined energy performance indicators. We have succeeded \nin reducing the electricity consumption measure for the space we \nlease in the Lateral Towers from 104kWh/m2 in 2018 to 72kWh/m2 \nin 2022. Following this positive experience, we have also put such \nsoftware into operation at other sites and are continuously \nexamining implementation in further buildings. \nIn addition, special attention is paid to making travel activities \nas environmentally friendly as possible and thus preventing CO2 \nemissions. The business travel policy therefore envisages rail as \nthe preferred means of transport. This also means avoiding air \ntravel wherever possible. The Bank subsidises electric vehicles in \nits car leasing schemes. In addition, Commerzbank pays its \nemployees in Germany a monthly mobility allowance of €20 for \ncommuting by public transport and provides support for another \nclimate-friendly alternative via cycling initiatives. \nKey \nfigure: \nIn \n2022, \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft \ngenerated 78,402 tonnes of CO2-equivalent total emissions.  \n \n \n \nThis is slightly higher than in 2021, which was heavily impacted \nby coronavirus measures, but well below the emissions of previous \nyears. The reasons for this include technical adaptations for \nenergy efficiency in building management and changes in \noccupational mobility, as well as site closures and job reductions \nover the past two years. These measures will continue to have an \neffect even after the coronavirus restrictions have come to an end. \nWe had set ourselves the goal of reducing our greenhouse gas \nemissions by 30% by 2025 (relative to the base year 2018). We in \nfact achieved this goal in 2022, with our CO2-equivalent emissions \nof 78,402 tonnes equating to a decrease of 34.9%.  \nAchieving our 2025 climate target early motivates us to define \na new, medium-term climate target as the next step towards our \ncommitment of net zero by 2040.  \n \n \nThe focus is on optimizing resource consumption,\nespecially where our actions can have a \ndirect impact on the environment\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n2020\n2021\n2022\nTotal CO2 equivalent emissions\n1,000 tons\n84.0\n71.2\n78.4"

It also attaches great importance to the ongoing training \nof its employees. Virtual formats such as the Sustainability Session \nand \nDigi \nSessions \nare \na platform \nfor \ncross-disciplinary \npresentation and discussion of topics such as sustainability and \ndigitalisation in the real estate and renewable energy sectors and \nin equipment leasing. The “Lernzeit+” (Learning Time+) model \nwas added in 2022 and allows all employees to devote up to 12 \nhours of their working time per quarter to continuing education or \ntraining opportunities of their choice. \n \n \n \nMaintaining health \nHealth is the basis for a properly functioning \norganisation and workforce alike. That makes \nstrategic \nhealth \nmanagement \nanother \nkey \nelement in Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s HR \nactivities. 2022 was once again affected by the \ncoronavirus pandemic, and Commerzbank was not alone in facing \nthe major challenge of reconciling employee health protection \nwith operational requirements. A hygiene and social distancing \nconcept was established and kept regularly updated, and \nopportunities for remote working were extended.  \nHowever, demands in the world of work are also changing \nindependently of coronavirus. We want to empower employees \nand managers to deal with this change under their own \nresponsibility and in a way that promotes health. To this end, we \noffer them a wide range of preventive measures such as \nprofessional advisory and information services, for instance on \nhow to deal with stress. The employee offering includes a wide \narray of flexible formats, such as webinars, audio formats and \nvideo consultations with company doctors and with Employee \nAssistance Programme advisors.  \nEmployees of Commerzbank and participating (domestic) \nsubsidiaries can also use the self-service facility to book \nappointments for consultations and advisory sessions. As part of \nthe Sustainability Report in accordance with the Global Reporting \nInitiative (GRI Report), we provide detailed information on \npersonnel-related topics. \nThe same applies to Commerz Real. As part of its commitment \nto its employees’ health and satisfaction, the company both \ndevelops its own concepts and implements measures in \ncooperation with the parent company. In 2022, Commerz Real \nbegan rolling out the new “Com.Work” office concept across the \nboard. Employees can get involved in redesigning the office space. \nIn addition to offices that can be booked flexibly, spaces are also \nbeing created for intensive video calls, interaction or relaxation, \nfor example. \nmBank employees are also receiving support during the \ncoronavirus pandemic. A hybrid model combining home and on-\nsite working was put in place in May 2022. Hybrid working is \nimplemented according to the specific circumstances in sales and \ncontracts units, in operations and in IT. It combines the \nadvantages of office work and working from home and allows the \nbest workplace to be chosen based on the specific tasks to be \ndone. mBank has also launched the “Energised for Health” advice \nprogramme. This includes courses and training to help employees \ncope with stress and pressure.  \nPromoting diversity and equal opportunities \nA working environment that is free \nfrom prejudice, typified by mutual \nrespect and acceptance is essential \nfor an atmosphere where everyone \nis able to thrive. We do not tolerate \ndiscrimination at Commerzbank. Any form of unfavourable \ntreatment of people based on their gender, nationality, ethnic \norigin, religion or beliefs, disability, age, sexual orientation or \ngender identity constitutes a violation of human dignity and \ninfringement of personal rights. \n \n \n \nHealth is the foundation for the \nPerformance of an organization\nand its workforce alike"

      "text": "66 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nAlthough a small majority of Commerzbank staff are female \n(around 51%), women are not yet represented at management \nlevel to the same extent. For this reason, in recent years the \nmeasures designed to promote a good work-life balance have been \nfurther improved to open up fresh career opportunities for women \nin particular. These include company childcare, innovative part-\ntime models – including for managers – and structured return-to-\nwork options to prevent careers from stalling. \nThese measures have enabled Commerzbank to increase the \nproportion of women in leadership positions to more than 30% \nGroup-wide over the past few years. Our Board of Managing \nDirectors has set a new goal of 40% across all management levels \n(management levels 1–4 and level-5 project managers) by the end \nof 2030. All divisions of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft are \nexplicitly tasked with actively approaching suitable female \nemployees during the recruitment process. The Bank therefore \nlaunched dedicated projects in 2022, putting diversity and \ninclusion on the strategic issues agenda. For example, one Risk \nManagement initiative focused on equality, mental health and \ninternationalism under the banner “Colourful Group Risk \nManagement”. Group Services also celebrated the lived diversity \nof its workforce through the “COO.bunt” (COO.colourful) \ncampaign. The aim is to further increase the proportion of female \ncandidates for management positions when filling new positions. \nThat is why the task of identifying, retaining and developing talent \nand high performers has been written into the HR strategy \nguidelines. In addition, all areas within the Board of Managing \nDirectors have set their own equality targets, which together add \nup to a target of 40% of management positions held by women by \n2030.  \nKey figure: At the end of 2022, 35.0% of management \npositions across the Group were held by women. \n \n \nDriving inclusion \nThe inclusion of people with disabilities is another part of our \ndiversity strategy. Barrier-free access to the workplace and to \nworking tools is just as high a priority as the implementation of \naccessibility in our digital offerings for customers. Commerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft has consistently exceeded the statutory \nrequirement of 5% employees with disabilities in recent years. We \nmet this quota again in 2022 (5.9%).  \nWe are now devoting more attention to the next generation: in \n2022 we advertised for the first time on myAbility, a job platform \nfor people with disabilities that aims to further promote diversity \nand inclusion. \nTreating each other with respect \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is \ncommitted to an open approach in \nrespect of the sexual orientation \nand gender identity of its staff, \ncustomers and business contacts. \nThis is achieved through education and various formats for \ndialogue, such as digital events and communication about queer \npeople. Formats covering the topics of coming out, subconscious \nreservations and overarching diversity issues such as families and \ncross-cultural \nunderstanding \nare \nparticularly \npopular \nwith \nemployees. These are also regularly attended by members of the \nBoard of Managing Directors and executives.  \nWe want to embrace diversity in our language as well, so we \ndecided in April 2022 to launch a one-year pilot with a \nrecommendation on inclusive language. We are initially gathering \nexperience with this recommendation in internal publications, \nwith the aim of communicating in a more accessible, value-neutral \nand gender-sensitive manner. \nThrough publication of the “Prout Performer” lists, the \nProut@Work Foundation recognises individuals from business and \npublic life who stand up for the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntrans, inter and queer people and become role models.

In order to \nhelp people on the ground quickly and unbureaucratically, \nCommerzbank undertook a major fundraising campaign. The \nBoard of Managing Directors of Commerzbank decided to provide \n€200,000 of emergency aid, which went to Caritas International \nand an aid campaign run by the city of Leipzig, which is twinned \nwith Kyiv. Customers and employees also made substantial \ndonations to these campaigns.  \nOne example of our social and environmental engagement is \nthe Commerzbank environmental internship launched with the \nGerman national parks back in 1990. Each year, it provides up to \n75 \nstudents \nwith \npractical \nexperience \nin \nthe \nareas \nof \nenvironmental education and public relations in the natural \nlandscapes of the country’s national parks. Commerzbank \norganises and finances the environmental internship programme, \nwhile the national parks provide the subject matter expertise. \nSince the programme began, more than 1,900 students have \nparticipated and subsequently applied their experience to \nbusiness, politics, society or environmental protection. \nWith our Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, we are \nactively combating bribery, the acceptance of benefits and \nother forms of corruption"

The initiative was set up in early 2018 by \na group of female comdirect employees with the aim of making \na positive contribution to society. To help women become better \nacquainted with the topic of finance and make independent \nfinancial decisions, the financial heroines convey their knowledge \nthrough a variety of formats including an online magazine, \npodcasts, afterwork events and an Instagram channel, as well as \nthe bestselling “Manager Magazin” book “Der Finanzplaner für \nFrauen” (“Financial planner for women”).  \nAs a corporate citizen, Commerz Real wants to make an active \ncontribution to society in the communities in which it operates. \nThe Little Home project is an example of how the company’s core \nbusiness can be combined with its social responsibility: at the \nannual Social Day in September 2022, some 200 employees \nworked with the Little Home association to build ten temporary \nhouses for people with no fixed abode. These small wooden \ncontainer-style homes are equipped with basic necessities and are \nprovided to homeless people by the association as a first step back \ninto society.

Among other \nactions, mBank joined the Polish Centre for International Aid \n(PCPM) fundraising campaign in March 2022, enabling customers \nto donate money to help people fleeing the war. mBank’s \ncustomers gave almost €3m (PLN 13.8m) via the campaign in \n2022.

The former \noffice now offers dance classes, sports courses, art classes and \nbook reading sessions for children. Children can also receive \npsychological and speech therapy there, while psychological \nsupport and careers counselling are also available for their \nmothers. Alongside the school, parts of the office building were \nconverted into temporary accommodation for about 60 refugees \nbetween March and December 2022. \nIn April 2022, mBank introduced a personal account for \nUkrainian citizens with an expedited account opening procedure. \nThere is no charge for the account or the associated card.

The \nBank offers a comprehensive portfolio of financial services in two \nbusiness segments – Private and Small-Business Customers and \nCorporate Clients.  \nIn its corporate client business, Commerzbank focuses on \nGerman SMEs, large companies and institutional customers. In \ninternational business, the Bank supports customers who have \nbusiness links with Germany and companies in selected future-\noriented sectors. In the Private and Small-Business Customers \nsegment, the Bank serves its customers through the Commerzbank \nand comdirect brands: via online and mobile channels, in the \nadvisory centre and in person at a local level. The Polish \nsubsidiary mBank is an innovative digital bank. It serves around \n5.7 million private and small-business customers, mainly in Poland \nbut also in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.  \nThe two segments Private and Small-Business Customers and \nCorporate Clients are each managed by a member of the Board of \nManaging Directors. All staff and management functions are \ncontained in Group Management: Group Audit, Group Big \nData & Advanced \nAnalytics, \nGroup \nCommunications, \nGroup \nCompliance, Group Finance, Group Human Resources, Group \nInvestor Relations, Group Legal, Group Research, Group Strategy, \nTransformation & Sustainability, Group Tax, Group Treasury and \nthe central risk functions. The support functions are provided by \nGroup Services. These include Group client.data, Corporate \nClients & Treasury Platforms, Group Operations, Group Business \nPlatforms, Group Digital Transformation, Group Credit, Group \nTechnology Foundations, Group Organisation & Security, and \nGroup Securities & Brokerage. The staff, management and support \nfunctions are combined in the Others and Consolidation division \nfor external reporting purposes. \nOn the domestic market, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is \nheadquartered in Frankfurt am Main, from where it manages its \nbranch network and its advisory centre serving all customer \ngroups. Following the merger with comdirect Bank AG, which will \ncontinue as a brand of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, \nCommerz Real AG is the most significant domestic subsidiary. \nOutside of Germany, following the sale of Commerzbank Zrt., \nBudapest, as at the reporting date Commerzbank had 4 material \nsubsidiaries, \n16 \noperational \nforeign \nbranches \nand \n26 \nrepresentative offices in just under 40 countries and was \nrepresented in all major financial centres, such as London, New \nYork, Tokyo and Singapore.  \nHowever, the focus of the Bank’s international activities is on \nEurope. \nCommerzbank prepares Group financial statements which, in \naddition to Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft as operating lead \ncompany, incorporate all material subsidiaries over which the \nBank exercises control. The financial year is the calendar year. \nObjectives and strategy \n \nThrough our “Strategy 2024” programme we are securing the \nfuture of Commerzbank – and becoming the digital advisory bank \nfor Germany. In so doing, we are combining our greatest strengths \nto create a unique business model: Commerzbank’s advisory \nexcellence, which is based on in-depth knowledge of customer \nneeds, and comdirect’s digital capabilities. \nWith this business model, we are focusing even more than \nbefore on the customer – as a reliable partner, as a source of \ninspiration: we seek to enthuse customers who have set ambitious \ngoals for themselves whether in their personal lives or their \nbusinesses. Customers who need an effective partner at their side \noffering tailored advice on complex issues and straightforward \ndigital solutions and access in all other matters. We are directing \nour focus towards discerning customers, and in the Corporate \nClients segment in particular towards German SMEs, for whom we \nare and remain the first port of call.  \nWe are using digitalisation to ensure we are just a click away \nfrom our customers at times when they do not wish to visit a \nbranch. To become more digital, we are taking our organisation to \nthe next level of development: streamlining our structures and \nstandardising our processes. At the same time, we are using \ndigitalisation to optimise our business model and tap into new \nsources of revenue.  \nIn this way, we are helping to bring about a significant increase \nin profitability – an important prerequisite for providing the \nreturns expected by our shareholders and securing our investment \nstrength for the future.  \nHowever, it is not only profitability and capital strength that are \ncrucial for securing Commerzbank’s future, but also the \ncontribution the Bank makes to meeting the challenges facing \nsociety, above all to combating climate change. Commerzbank \ntakes this responsibility seriously and is seeking to become a net \nzero bank.

      "text": "76 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nIn the 2022 financial year, the Bank reached further important \ntransformation milestones in the restructuring and reorganisation \nof its business model. For example, we have already finalised most \nof the planned gross reduction of 10,000 full-time positions. The \nreduction of almost 9,000 positions was contracted by the end of \n2022, the majority of them in Germany. A large part of the \nremaining reduction will come from the optimisation or closure of \nforeign locations. \n \n \n \nAll 12 locations of the advisory centre for the German retail \nbanking business have started operating. The original target for \nrationalising the branch network was also achieved ahead of \nschedule.  \n“Mittelstandsbank Direkt” was successfully established in the \nCorporate Clients segment. By the end of 2022, we had already \nprovided services to 6,000 clients via the German market’s first \ndirect bank offering for SMEs. \nThe Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy has \nalso been firmly anchored within the Group. For example, the \nvolume of sustainable business reached €247bn in the year under \nreview. We are thus well on the way towards achieving the \nintended volume of €300bn by 2025. \n \nFor the next phase of the implementation of the “Strategy \n2024” programme, the Bank has defined new priorities to continue \ndeveloping earnings potential while continuing to focus on further \nefficiency increases in both customer segments. The successful \nlaunch of “Mittelstandsbank Direkt” in the Corporate Clients \nsegment will be opened up for new customers in the coming year. \nFurthermore, the international network will be optimised in line \nwith the changing trade corridors. As a result, Commerzbank will \ncontinue to be represented in all locations where its customers \nrequire it. The Bank is thus consolidating its position as the \nleading trade finance bank for Germany. \nThe retail strategy is centred around the Bank’s positioning as \na digital advisory bank with a needs-based product portfolio and \nfull exploitation of the growth potential offered by the two-brand \nmodel. comdirect is the bank for digitally savvy customers who do \nnot require advice. Commerzbank stands for personal customer \nrelationships and advisory services, both at branches and digitally. \nA large proportion of customer requirements will be addressed via \nits new advisory centre as well as via digital channels. \nCommerzbank’s personal advisory service offering will in future be \ntailored more strongly to the needs of wealthy customers and \nthose with more complex advisory needs.  \nWe reaffirmed the key financial targets of the “Strategy 2024” \nprogramme at the end of 2022. The Bank is targeting a net return \non tangible equity of more than 7.3% and a cost-income ratio of \n60%. Based on the positive development of the customer business \nand supported by higher interest rates, the revenue forecast for \nthe year 2024 has been raised to €10bn; the previous target was \n€9.1bn. The Bank is implementing the cost-cutting programme as \nplanned. Due to the ongoing inflation, total expenses for 2024 are \nexpected to be €6.0bn. Overall, Commerzbank now anticipates an \noperating result of around €3.2bn for 2024, against the previous \nforecast of €3.0bn. \n \nDetailed information on the “Strategy 2024” programme can be \nfound both in the Annual Report 2020 and on the Commerzbank \nwebsite at https://www.commerzbank.com. \nCorporate management \n \nCorporate management in the Commerzbank Group is based on a \nvalue-oriented steering concept. This concept is focused on \nensuring that the risks entered into by the business units are in \nline with the external and internal guidelines on risk-bearing \ncapacity and on striving to achieve an appropriate return over the \nlong term on the capital employed. In this respect, the Bank \nregularly monitors the allocation of scarce resources to business \nunits and actively adapts its business strategy to changing market \ncircumstances in order to boost the enterprise value over the long \nterm.  \nThe annual planning process is a key corporate management \ntool. In this process, the Board of Managing Directors sets targets \nfor the business units based on the business strategy. Existing \nresources such as capital and risk limits are allocated to the \nsegments in a way that reflects the targets and risk profiles. The \nsegments operationalise the targets based on the business \nstrategy and the results of the planning process. The Board of \nManaging Directors carries out regular checks to ensure that \nbusiness planning is being followed. This ensures that any \ndeviations are identified at an early stage through monthly \nmanagement reporting, and corrective measures are taken.  \nIn order to manage the Group and its segments, the Bank uses \nthe standard controlling indicators described below, which cover \nall the essential dimensions of Group management. Their \ndevelopment is monitored as part of regular management \nreporting. \n \n \nImportant milestones in restructuring \nand organizational restructuring \nhave been achieved"

To ensure internal risk-bearing \ncapacity at all times, planning includes allocating economic capital \nto the segments according to type of risk. The average capital \nemployed in the segments is calculated based on the average \nsegmented risk-weighted assets. At Group level, Common Equity \nTier 1 (CET1) capital is shown. The reconciliation of average \ncapital employed in the segments to the Group’s CET1 capital is \ncarried out in Others and Consolidation. The Common Equity Tier \n1 ratio is a key indicator for the Bank in capital management.  \nThe key figures used for measuring success in the corporate \nmanagement process are operating profit/loss and group \nprofit/loss after tax and non-controlling interests, along with the \ncost/income and return on equity ratios and the economic value \nadded calculated from these ratios. The cost/income ratio is used \nto assess cost efficiency and is defined as the ratio of operating \nexpenses (excluding impairments of goodwill and restructuring \nexpenses) to income before the risk result. The cost/income ratio \nis calculated in two variants: with and without the inclusion of \ncompulsory contributions in the item “expenses”. Segment return \non equity is calculated as the ratio of operating profit/loss or pre-\ntax profit/loss to the average amount of regulatory capital \nemployed. It shows the return on the equity invested in a given \nbusiness segment. As is standard for value-based management \nconcepts, the target minimum return on capital employed is \nderived from the expected return on the capital market. Here the \nfocus at Group level is on the return on tangible equity. \nEconomic value added is the indicator used for determining the \nperformance of the Group. It is defined as the difference between \nthe Group’s return on equity and the capital cost rate, multiplied \nby the Group’s equity.

Changes for the \ncurrent financial year 2023 were also announced at both Board of \nManaging Directors and Supervisory Board level. With the \nestablishment of a Sustainability Advisory Board, Commerzbank \nhas further anchored this particularly important topic in its \nsustainability strategy. In the summer of 2022, the Bank provided \ninformation on the progress it has made with the sustainability \nstrategy through its second Sustainability Dialogue event. To give \nour investors the opportunity to participate in the transformation \nof the real economy towards greater sustainability, the Bank \nissued its third green bond in the middle of the year. In order to \nremain focused on market developments and trends with respect \nto the key issue of sustainability, the Main Incubator has been \nrealigned. The bank-specific capital requirements set by the \nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) for 2023 as part of the Supervisory \nReview and Evaluation Process (SREP) clearly confirm once again \nthat Commerzbank is well positioned in terms of its capitalisation. \nThe Bank also further strengthened its compliance function in the \n2022 financial year. \nChanges in the Board of Managing Directors of \nCommerzbank \nAt its meeting on 6 July 2022, the Supervisory Board of \nCommerzbank appointed Sabine Mlnarsky to the Bank’s Board of \nManaging Directors with effect from 1 January 2023. She has \nassumed responsibility for the Group Human Resources division. \nAs Chief Human Resources Officer and Labour Relations Director \nshe succeeded Sabine Schmittroth, who in line with her personal \nlife planning left Commerzbank when her contract expired at the \nend of 2022. Sabine Mlnarsky has more than two decades of \nexperience in human resources management. She comes to \nCommerzbank from the Austrian Erste Group Bank AG. She is a \nlawyer and had been Head of Human Resources at the central \ninstitution of the Austrian savings bank sector since 2016. \nAt the same meeting, Chief Risk Officer Marcus Chromik also \ninformed the Supervisory Board that he intends to fulfil his \nmanagement contract, which runs until the end of 2023, but in line \nwith his personal life planning will not accept a possible offer of an \nextension to his contract. Informing the Supervisory Board at this \nearly stage created clarity and planning security for an orderly \ntransition in this important function. \nChange in the chairmanship of the Supervisory \nBoard of Commerzbank initiated \nHelmut Gottschalk has decided that, given his age, he will not \nmake himself available for a new term of office as a member of the \nSupervisory Board and Chairman of the Supervisory Board after \nthe next Annual General Meeting. He has therefore initiated an \norderly succession process at an early stage. \nIn mid-November 2022, Helmut Gottschalk informed the \nshareholder representatives on the Presiding and Nomination \nCommittee and subsequently the entire Supervisory Board of his \ndecision. He also proposed Dr. Jens Weidmann (54) as a new \nmember of the Supervisory Board who, if elected, will also be \navailable to take on the role of Chairman of the Supervisory Board. \nThe shareholder representatives on the Presiding and Nomination \nCommittee and on the Supervisory Board responded positively to \nthe proposal. In its meeting on 15 February 2023 the Supervisory \nBoard unanimously declared that it intends to appoint Dr. Jens \nWeidmann as its Chairman if Dr. Weidmann is elected to the \nSupervisory Board by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting \non 31 May 2023 as planned. Helmut Gottschalk has chaired the \nSupervisory Board of Commerzbank since April 2021. During his \ntenure to date, the Bank has successfully implemented a \ncomprehensive \nrestructuring \nunder \nits \n“Strategy \n2024” \nprogramme, adapted its business model in line with altered \nconditions and significantly improved profitability in its core \nbusiness, such that a renewed distribution from profits for the \n2022 financial year can be put to the 2023 Annual General \nMeeting. Under his leadership, he also drove forward the \nrealignment of the Board of Managing Directors with the \nappointment of four new members and established a new, \nperformance-based remuneration system and a share ownership \ndirective for the Board of Managing Directors. \nDr. Jens Weidmann was President of the Deutsche Bundesbank \nfrom 2011 to 2021. In this capacity, he was also a member of the \nGoverning Council of the ECB. Previously, he was head of the \neconomic and financial policy department in Germany’s Federal \nChancellery. He also served as Chairman of the Board of Directors \nof the Bank for International Settlements from 2015 to 2021. \nCommerzbank establishes Sustainability \nAdvisory Board and continues Sustainability \nDialogue  \nIn May 2022, Commerzbank set up a Sustainability Advisory Board \nmade up of external experts. This makes it one of the first major \nbanks in Germany to have such a body. The new advisory board \nwill help advance sustainability topics at Commerzbank and \ndeliver outside impetus for the sustainable alignment of the Bank’s \nactivities. The new body includes representatives from business,"

It met for the first time in Frankfurt \nam Main on 23 May 2022. Going forward, the Sustainability \nAdvisory Board is due to meet twice a year.  \nOn 4 July 2022, Commerzbank held a second public \nSustainability Dialogue event to provide information on the \nprogress it has made with its sustainability strategy. Commerzbank \nhas defined concrete CO2 reduction targets for half of the loans it \nhas granted. These are to be achieved by 2030. The Bank’s efforts \nto manage climate risk are initially focused on CO2-intensive \nsectors. For example, we are seeking to achieve reduction targets \nof at least 73% by 2030 for the power generation sector, and at \nleast 57% for the significantly larger retail mortgage financing \nportfolio. Achieving these targets is a key intermediate step for the \nBank in its drive to reduce the CO2 emissions of its entire lending \nand investment portfolio to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Further \ninformation can be found in the combined separate non-financial \nreport on page 42 ff. \nCommerzbank issues its third own green bond  \nCommerzbank successfully issued a green bond with an issuance \nvolume of €500m at the beginning of June 2022. Commerzbank \nwill use the proceeds to finance renewable energy projects. \nThanks to the progress made with renewable energy projects, a \nthird own green bond has now been issued to follow those from \n2018 and 2020. We have therefore responded to the still growing \ndemand for sustainable investments and are giving our investors \nthe opportunity to participate in the transformation of the real \neconomy towards greater sustainability. \nCommerzbank allocated the non-preferred senior bond to loans \nfor onshore and offshore wind projects and solar projects. The \nbond has a term of 5.25 years with a call date in September 2026 \nand a coupon of 3% per annum.  \nCommerzbank is an established player in the market for \nsustainable and green bonds. For years, the bank has been \nsupporting its customers in preparing sustainable bond issues and \nplacing them in the international capital market. \nRealignment of the Main Incubator  \nCommerzbank realigned its Main Incubator at the end of April \n2022: the early-stage investor will in future focus not only on \nfintechs but also on start-ups specialising in sustainability, known \nas greentechs. To accompany the shift in strategy, the new brand \n“neosfer” was created.  \nThere has been no change to the unit’s business principles: it \nwill continue to monitor trends, invest venture capital and make \nnew applications work for the Bank. \nSREP capital requirements for Commerzbank \nunchanged for 2023  \nThe ECB has left the bank-specific capital requirements for 2023 \ndefined for the Commerzbank Group as part of the Supervisory \nReview and Evaluation Process (SREP) unchanged compared with \n2022. The additional capital adequacy requirement under Pillar 2 \n(P2R) remains at 2% of total capital, of which at least 1.125% \nmust be covered by Common Equity Tier 1 capital. The SREP \ndecision replaces the previous SREP decision with effect from \n1 January 2023. \nThe \nCommon \nEquity \nTier \n1 \ncapital \nrequirement \nfor \nCommerzbank at Group level remained unchanged at 9.44% of \nrisk-weighted assets (MDA threshold) as at 30 September 2022, \ntaking into account the requirements of the current SREP decision. \nIt comprises the CET1 minimum of 4.5%, the P2R requirement of \n1.125%, the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the DSIB capital \nbuffer for other systemically important banks, which is unchanged \nat 1.25%, the countercyclical capital buffer, currently 0.04%, and \nan AT1 shortfall of 0.03%. \nCommerzbank expects the MDA threshold to rise to around \n10.1% in the first quarter of 2023 due to the industry-wide \nincrease in countercyclical capital buffers and the activation of the \nsectoral systemic risk buffer in Germany. \nA requirement to hold additional own funds for the risk of \nexcessive leverage (Pillar 2 requirement for the risk of excessive \nleverage – P2RLR) has not been set for the Commerzbank Group. \nWith a CET1 ratio of 14.1% as at 31 December 2022, we are a \ncomfortable distance from the MDA threshold and thus have \nsufficient scope for the planned distribution of 30% of \nconsolidated profit after deduction of AT1 coupon payments. \nFurther strengthening of the compliance \nfunction  \nIn 2022 the Bank continued its activities to further strengthen the \ncompliance function. In addition to the structural changes, these \nalso related to staff training and the successful recruitment of \nqualified compliance experts to work at head office and in foreign \nlocations.  \nTo further improve the management of compliance risks, the \ncompliance function implemented various long-term measures in \nareas such as global financial crime and global markets \ncompliance, further strengthening compliance both in Germany \nand abroad."

      "text": "80 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nIn the year under review, the Bank rigorously pressed ahead \nwith the further development of the global compliance system \nlandscape in line with the latest market standards. Significant \nsteps were taken in the technical renewal of transaction-based \nsanctions screening. At the same time, the much more stringent \nsanctions requirements were implemented successfully while \nmaintaining a consistently high level of quality. With the focus on \nthe second line of defence tasks for compliance as a risk \nmanagement and control function, the responsibilities and \nresources for the “Actimize Customer Due Diligence” (know-your-\ncustomer scoring) and “Watch List Filtering” (name screening) \nsystems were transferred to the “client.data” unit, in which all \nprocesses and systems across the Bank relating to client master \ndata, know-your-customer activities and document management \nare bundled. \nIn 2022, Global Markets Compliance completed the Global \nSurveillance Implementation Programme (GSIP) launched in 2018. \nThe programme was aimed at expanding global surveillance of \ntrade and communications. With the associated introduction of the \nSCILA trade monitoring software, monitoring was standardised \nacross asset classes for all Commerzbank trading locations and a \nglobal minimum standard for trade monitoring established in line \nwith regulatory requirements. \nAt the same time, Commerzbank further developed existing \ngovernance \nstructures \nand \nfurther \nexpanded \nthe \nglobal \ncompliance processes in the business units. This included \nupdating and further developing the compliance sub-risk strategy \nas part of Commerzbank’s overall risk strategy, which in particular \ndefines the strategic fields of action and the risk appetite for \ncompliance risks. We also further strengthened the governance \nprocesses for managing and monitoring compliance controls. \nWith regard to the German Corporate Due Diligence in Supply \nChains Act that entered into force on 1 January 2023, Group \nCompliance fulfils the role of the second line of defence in its \ncapacity as the global functional lead, and thus defines Group-\nwide minimum standards for the Bank in order to identify and \nprevent \nbreaches \nof \ncertain \nhuman \nrights \nand \ncertain \nenvironmental obligations at (in)direct suppliers and in the Bank’s \nown area of business. To ensure that the requirements are met, we \nhave established a comprehensive compliance programme that \nhas already been initialised and will be systematically extended in \n2023. In 2022, a Human Rights Officer was appointed to assume \nthe responsibilities arising from the German Corporate Due \nDiligence in Supply Chains Act. The Chief Compliance Officer \nperforms this important and responsible role, in which capacity \nthey report directly to the Chief Risk Officer. The Board of \nManaging Directors is also assisted by other units with a view to \ncovering human rights standards as holistically as possible within \nCommerzbank. \nFor more information on compliance risks and on integrity and \ncompliance at Commerzbank, please see page 142 f. of the Group \nRisk Report and page 67 f. of the combined separate non-financial \nreport."

Fears of \nan energy crisis drove up energy prices worldwide. In addition, \nmany companies continued to complain about a lack of upstream \nproducts. \nIn China, the government stuck to its zero-Covid policy for \nalmost the whole of 2022. Time and again, entire cities with \nmillions of inhabitants were locked down at the slightest outbreak \nof coronavirus. This, together with the problems in the real estate \nsector, meant that economic growth more than halved in 2022 \ncompared with 2021. \nIn the USA, the economy contracted slightly in the first half of \n2022 following the expiry of the coronavirus-related assistance \nprogrammes. Nevertheless, unemployment fell back to the very \nlow level seen before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, \nwhich is why wages rose more sharply. Together with the \nsubstantial rise in energy prices, this droves inflation to historic \nhighs. \n \n \n \nIn the eurozone, the economy was affected not only by the \nweaker foreign trade environment but also the fear of gas \nrationing following the widespread cessation of Russian gas \nsupplies. Prices for gas and electricity therefore increased \nconsiderably, placing a huge burden on both households and \nbusinesses. In the course of the year, higher production costs due \nto energy prices also caused prices of non-energy goods to rise \never more sharply. In addition, the production of some goods \nbecame unprofitable because manufacturers were only able to \npass on higher energy costs to their customers to a limited extent. \nAs a result, the eurozone economy lost significant momentum in \nthe second half of the year. \nIn Germany, too, economic growth weakened noticeably in the \ncourse of the year. Weaker demand from abroad impacted on the \nexport-oriented industry in particular.  \nAt the same time, a lack of intermediate products prevented \ncompanies from working quickly through their large order \nbacklogs. The boom in the construction industry also ended in the \nspring. Over the rest of the year, production in this sector followed \na downward trend. By contrast, the services sector still benefited \nfrom the lifting of coronavirus restrictions, although this positive \neffect steadily weakened as the year progressed. The fall-off in \neconomic activity was also reflected in the labour market. \nEmployment growth stalled, and the number of unemployed has \nrisen slightly since the summer.  \nTrends on the financial markets in 2022 were dominated by the \nchange of course in monetary policy. Against a backdrop of high \ninflation, the US Federal Reserve heralded the turnaround in \ninterest rates in March. By the beginning of February 2023, it had \nincreased its policy rates by a total of 450 basis points. The ECB \nbegan its own cycle of interest rate increases at the end of July. \nSince then, it has raised its policy rates by a total of 300 basis \npoints. The bond market reacted with a significant rise in yields. \nAt times, ten-year US government bonds had yields of over 4%, \nhaving been below 2% at the beginning of the year. The yield on \nten-year German government bonds rose from 0% to around 2%. \nShare prices fell substantially in 2022. The euro regained ground \nagainst the US dollar at the end of the year but was still around \n10% below the level at the end of 2021. \nSector environment \nThe difficult economic situation – primarily in connection with the \nenergy crisis, the sharp rise in inflation and the Russia-Ukraine \nwar – meant that 2022 was another particularly challenging year \nfor the banking sector. Although extensive government assistance \nprogrammes have so far prevented a more severe economic \nslump, the negative consequences for the economy and society are \ngradually beginning to show. In particular, the risks for the \nbanking environment’s short-term prospects are still considered to \nbe very high. Nervousness has returned to the international capital \nmarkets with the geopolitical uncertainties. All over the world, the \nindustrial sector is suffering from supply chain problems. These \nare primarily attributable to China’s very strict zero-Covid strategy, \nwhich was applied for a long while, and to the sanctions imposed \nin response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. China is now only able \nto fulfil its role as the engine of the global economy to a limited \nextent: its economic growth has slowed markedly due to high \nlevels of corporate debt, a weaker labour market and turbulence \non the real estate market.  \n \n \nGeneral economic conditions \nwere difficult even in 2022\nEconomic report"

      "text": "82 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nAccording to the Ifo Business Climate Index, business \nexpectations have recently improved in Germany, but remain at a \nlow level. Energy and raw material prices as well as the cost of \nmaterials have tended to rise sharply, fuelling inflation worldwide. \nHigh inflation reduces purchasing power and thus acts as a drag \non private consumption. At the same time, the gas supply issue is \ncausing considerable uncertainty among companies and putting a \ndamper on investment.  \nThe impact on the lending business of European banks has \nbeen significantly mitigated to date, mainly through support \nmeasures implemented by governments and central banks. \nIncome losses were limited for both companies and households; \nemployment conditions were protected and the supply of credit to \nthe economy was guaranteed. The financial markets are also still \nproving robust in the face of the challenging conditions, with price \nlosses so far significantly lower than during the Lehman crisis and \nat the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, \nEuropean banks have so far been spared any major defaults \ndespite uncertainty about their provisioning requirements and \nvolatility in their trading income. However, receivables from \nconsumer loans and from loans to companies and self-employed \npersons with energy-intensive production are subject to high risk. \nThere are also fears of loan defaults on commercial property \nfinancing if recent changes to working and shopping habits are \nmaintained over the long term and there is a further rise in debit \ninterest rates.  \nThe boom in the residential real estate market abated \nsignificantly in the course of 2022. While house prices still rose by \nmore than 10% on average last year, price momentum has slowed \nsignificantly over the course of this year. The sharp rise in \nmortgage rates – from around 1.3% at the start of the year to \naround 3.4% at the end of 2022, while house prices are still rising \non average – has significantly reduced the affordability of a \nproperty purchase for households. Many prospective buyers are \nunlikely to be able to afford initial financing at current prices, \nespecially as the current high level of inflation continues to put a \nstrain on the budgets of many households. However, a lot of \nhouseholds still have a certain financial buffer as a result of their \nincreased propensity to save during the first phase of the \ncoronavirus pandemic. Long fixed-interest periods on existing \nproperties instead of variable-rate mortgage loans, as well as the \npreferred choice of annuity loans instead of bullet mortgage loans, \nalso have the effect of reducing risk. As a result, when fixed-\ninterest periods expire, follow-up financing costs are at present \ngenerally not much higher than in the previous period. More \nextensive defaults on existing mortgages are therefore not to be \nexpected in Germany in the foreseeable future.  \nAny considerable fall in house prices is also rather improbable \non a nationwide average. That is because the continuing shortage \nof affordable housing, the relatively low ownership rate compared \nwith other countries, and the reallocation of assets against a \nbackdrop of a high level of economic uncertainty and sharply \nincreased inflation rates are bolstering the market for residential \nreal estate.  \nAccording to official insolvency statistics for Germany, defaults \nin the servicing of loans have so far remained within limits. For \nexample, the number of consumer insolvencies nationwide fell \nnoticeably last year, although this is likely to be partly an after-\neffect of the law introduced in 2020 to gradually shorten residual \ndebt discharge proceedings from six to three years. In contrast to \nthe number of cases, the total amount of outstanding receivables \nincreased more than fourfold. In corporate insolvencies, however, \nfewer major cases meant a reduction in expected creditor claims \nto less than a quarter. In terms of figures, corporate insolvencies \ndeclined only slightly as the SME construction sector in particular \nrecorded increases. The change in the number of business \nclosures was less favourable than for corporate insolvencies. For \nexample, the number of companies discontinuing operations \ncompletely rose by 7% in the period from January to October \n2022 compared with the corresponding prior-year period. \nAs a neighbour of Ukraine, Poland has been affected directly by \nthe war, with the adverse economic effects also having a negative \nimpact on its banking sector. Polish GDP has lost considerable \nmomentum in recent quarters. Despite these unfavourable \nconditions, the Polish banking sector has so far proved robust in \nthe assessment of financial stability. Risks come primarily from \nunsecured consumer loans and mortgage loans. There are \ncurrently numerous pending lawsuits from private customers \nrelating to Swiss franc real estate loans with indexing clauses. \n“Credit holidays” under which payments can be temporarily \nsuspended also have a negative impact on income in the Polish \nbanking sector. All in all, its return on capital is currently only just \nin positive territory. \nFinancial performance, assets, \nliabilities and financial position \n \nCommerzbank achieved its best result in more than a decade in \nthe 2022 financial year. Double-digit income growth was recorded \nin 2022 despite substantial charges at our Polish subsidiary \nmBank. This exceptionally strong income momentum was driven \nby robust customer business in both segments and the boost \nprovided by interest rate increases on the part of both the ECB and \nthe Polish central bank."

Common Equity Tier 1 capital was €23.9bn and the \ncorresponding Common Equity Tier 1 ratio 14.1%.  \nExplanations regarding changes or amendments to the \naccounting and measurement methods can be found in Notes 2 \nand 4 to the Group financial statements. \nIncome statement of the Commerzbank Group \nThe individual items in the income statement were as follows in \n2022:  \nNet interest income was €6,459m in the period under review, \ncompared with €4,849m in the previous year. The significant \nincrease of 33.2% was attributable to a considerable rise in \nincome \nfrom \ninterest-bearing \nbusiness \nin \nboth \ncustomer \nsegments. mBank was largely responsible for the increase in net \ninterest income in the Private and Small-Business Customers \nsegment. The significant rise in key interest rates in Poland since \nautumn 2021 had a particularly positive impact. As a result, the \ndeposit business made a significant contribution to mBank’s net \ninterest income, which more than doubled. Rising lending and \ndeposit volumes also led to corresponding income growth. \nInterest-bearing business in Germany also recorded a positive \nperformance. Firstly, the further increase in total lending in the \ndomestic market resulted in income growth, including in \nconnection with retail mortgage financing and individual loans. \nSecondly, the turnaround in interest rates generated additional \ndeposit income. In addition, the year-on-year increase in interest \nrates in the Private and Small-Business Customers segment was \nnoticeably impacted by the income generated in the first half of \nthe year in connection with special repayments of mortgage loans. \nNet interest income in the Corporate Clients segment was also \nhigher than in the prior-year period, with the increase attributable \nin particular to a positive performance in SME business. The \nsignificant decrease in net interest income in the Others and \nConsolidation segment was attributable in particular to the fall in \nadditional income from the fulfilment of the credit volume \nrequirements in connection with targeted longer-term refinancing \noperations \n(TLTROs) \nwith \nthe \nECB \ncompared \nwith \nthe \ncorresponding prior-year period. This fall was due in part to the \nfact that the previous year also included amounts relating to 2020, \nsince the fulfilment of the credit volume requirement was not \nestablished \nuntil \n2021, \nand \nalso \nto \ninternal \nfair \nvalue \ncompensation payments for special repayments of mortgage loans \nto the Private and Small-Business Customers segment due to the \nrise in interest rates. \nNet commission income was slightly lower than the prior-year \nfigure at €3,519m. In the Private and Small-Business Customers \nsegment, domestic securities volumes declined, mainly due to \nweak market developments in the period under review, which was \nreflected in declining commission income. By contrast, income \nfrom payment transactions increased. Higher commission income \nat mBank was due in particular to an increase in income from \npayment transactions. Net commission income in the Corporate \nClients segment was higher than in the prior-year period, mainly \ndue to an increase in foreign currency business and trade finance. \nThe net income from financial assets and liabilities measured at \nfair value through profit or loss was €451m in the period under \nreview, after €980m in the prior-year period. The decline of \n54.0% was primarily attributable to considerably higher positive \nremeasurement effects in the comparable prior-year period, for \nexample in relation to investments. \n \n \nRobust customer business\nin fiscal year 2022"

This includes charges against income of \n€278m relating to interest and repayment deferrals for private real \nestate financing at mBank. \nOther net income of €–606m chiefly reflects provisions of \n€650m in connection with mortgage loans issued in Swiss francs \nat mBank, which were offset only to a small extent by reversals of \nprovisions and write-ups on equity holdings.  \nThe risk result of €–876m was significantly higher than the \nprior-year figure of €–570m, with the increase primarily \nattributable to effects in connection with the Russia-Ukraine war. \nThe loan loss provisions required in the Private and Small-\nBusiness Customers segment for the period under review \nincreased – particularly in Germany – by €73m compared with the \nprior-year period, while the risk result in the Corporate Clients \nsegment rose sharply by €296m due in particular to the Russia-\nUkraine war. The top-level adjustment (TLA) booked during the \nyear in connection with the Russia-Ukraine war was no longer in \nplace as at the end of the year, as the risk provisioning \nrequirements remaining after the exposure reduction are now \nreflected in individual transactions. The direct effects of the \ncoronavirus pandemic have abated to the point where no further \ncharge is expected from it. The coronavirus TLA of €–523m was \ntherefore fully reversed in the second quarter of 2022. As at \n31 December 2022 the total for the TLA for secondary effects \nstood at €–482m. Further information on the TLA can be found on \npage 123 ff. of the Group risk report. \nOperating expenses were reduced by 6.2% compared with the \nprior-year period to €5,844m. Personnel expenses were down by \n1.4% on the prior-year level at €3,415m, with the elimination of \nfull-time positions more than offsetting cost-generating effects \nincluding \nhigher \nvariable \nremuneration \nconnected \nwith \nprofitability. Administrative expenses, including depreciation on \nfixed assets and amortisation of other intangible assets, were \nreduced by 12.2% to €2,429m. The decrease was primarily \nattributable to a fall in IT expenses and lower costs in connection \nwith the streamlining of the branch network. In addition, the \ncorresponding prior-year figure included a charge arising from the \nderecognition of an intangible asset in connection with the \ntermination of the project to outsource securities settlement to \nHSBC Transaction Services GmbH, resulting in a significant \ndecline in amortisation expense. \nCompulsory contributions, which are reported separately, rose \nsharply by €175m compared with the prior-year period to €642m. \nThe significant increase of 37.4% resulted in particular from a \nnew mBank levy for an enhancement to Poland’s deposit \ninsurance scheme and the rise in the European banking levy due \nto higher contributions to the Single Resolution Fund of the \nBanking Union. In the period under review, Commerzbank made \nuse of the opportunity to meet part of its annual contribution to \nthe European banking levy in the form of irrevocable payment \ncommitments."

Bonds and notes issued fell \nby €1.4bn compared with the end of the previous year. \nFinancial liabilities under the fair value option amounted to \n€25.0bn on the reporting date and were thus up €5.3bn compared \nwith the end of 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to a \nseasonal expansion of securities repurchase agreements. \nFinancial liabilities held for trading were €24.8bn, down \n€2.6bn compared with the end of 2021. The decrease was due to \nthe negative fair values of derivative financial instruments, \nespecially interest-rate-related derivative transactions, which fell \nby €6.2bn. By contrast, negative fair values of currency-related \nderivative transactions increased by €5.0bn. \nProvisions fell by €0.2bn compared with the end of the \nprevious year to €3.5bn. The decline was mostly due to lower \nrestructuring provisions under the “Strategy 2024” programme. \nThe elimination of the full €0.7bn of liabilities from disposal \ngroups resulted in particular from the sale of Commerzbank Zrt. to \nErste Bank Hungary Zrt. \nEquity \nThe equity capital attributable to Commerzbank shareholders \nreported in the balance sheet on 31 December 2022 was €26.9bn, \nup 4.5% compared with year-end 2021. Further information on \nthe change in equity can be found on page 159 ff. of the Group \nfinancial statements. \nRisk-weighted assets were €168.7bn as at 31 December 2022 \nand thus €6.5bn lower than at year-end 2021. This change was \nattributable to a decrease in risk-weighted assets from credit and \nmarket risks. The decrease in credit risks mainly resulted from \ndeclines in securities positions and two new securitisation \ntransactions at mBank. This was partly offset by increases from the \nanticipation of initial effects from model adjustments under the \n“IRB Repair” programme set up by the banking supervisory \nauthorities. The decrease in risk-weighted assets from market \nrisks was caused by improved regulatory requirements due to a \nreduction in the regulatory multiplier and by position changes. \nThe inclusion of the increased income for 2022 due to the annual \nupdate of the three-year time series (standardised approach) led to \nan increase in risk-weighted assets from operational risks and thus \nhad a slightly offsetting effect. The switch from the internal model \nto the standardised approach was made in the fourth quarter of \n2021. \nAs at the reporting date, Common Equity Tier 1 capital was \n€23.9bn, compared with €23.8bn as at 31 December 2021. The \npositive impact of the net profit, actuarial gains and improved \nforeign currency reserve on Common Equity Tier 1 capital was \npartly offset by a negative development of the revaluation reserve \nand higher regulatory capital deductions. The Common Equity \nTier 1 ratio was 14.1%, compared with 13.6% in the previous \nyear. This increase in the ratio was mainly due to the decrease in \nrisk-weighted assets. The Tier 1 ratio was 16.0% as at the \nreporting date, compared with 15.5% as at the end of 2021."

Major parts of the \nrestructuring, which had a profound impact on the entire \norganisation and characterised large periods of the first two years \nof the implementation process, have now been largely completed. \nFor example, we have already finalised most of the planned gross \nreduction of 10,000 full-time positions. The reduction of almost \n9,000 positions was contracted by the end of 2022, the majority of \nthem in Germany. A large part of the remaining reduction will \ncome from the optimisation or closure of foreign locations, which \ncan be achieved without major implementation risks. At the same \ntime, we have rationalised our domestic branch network more \nquickly than we had planned two years ago. Of the original 1,000 \nbranches, 450 remained by mid-2022, meaning that we achieved \nthe reduction originally announced as part of our strategy ahead of \nschedule.  \n \n \n \nThe progress that we have made is demonstrated in impressive \nfashion in the results for the 2022 financial year. The income \nperformance in the first six months of the year under review was \nsignificantly better than planned and enabled us to adjust our \nexpectations for operating income in 2022 as set out in the Annual \nReport \n2021 \nto \nreflect \nthe \nsteadily \nsuccessful \nbusiness \nperformance – despite the difficult underlying conditions and \nconsiderable policy-induced charges at our Polish subsidiary \nmBank. Whereas at the beginning of the year we were still \nanticipating that the total operating income achievable for the year \nunder review would be roughly at the same level as the previous \nyear, we raised our expectations with the publication of the 2022 \nhalf-year report. Our income grew at a double-digit rate in the \n2022 financial year. This exceptionally strong income momentum \nwas driven by robust customer business in both segments, while \nthe ECB’s interest rate increases obviously also gave us a boost. \nAgainst the backdrop of continuing difficult conditions, the risk \nresult was almost 54% higher than in the previous year at  \n€–876m, but still in line with our expectations communicated \nduring the second half of the year of around €–0.7bn – assuming \nthe utilisation of TLAs.  \nWe regularly reviewed existing TLAs during the year. As a \nresult, we had a TLA balance of €–482m available as at \n31 December 2022, compared with €–523m as at 31 December \n2021, to cushion expected further crisis effects. \nDespite growing inflationary pressures and further increases in \ncompulsory contributions, especially at mBank, we maintained a \nhigh level of cost discipline in the year under review. We were \nable to reduce our operating expenses in the previous financial \nyear despite continued high capital expenditure. Overall, operating \nexpenses including compulsory contributions decreased by 3.2% \nin 2022. At just under €6.5bn, costs were only slightly above the \ntarget figure of €6.4bn. This also reflects the higher variable \nremuneration due to the very positive growth in operating profit. \nExcluding this effect and the higher compulsory contributions, we \nreduced the Bank’s operating cost base by almost 10% overall last \nyear. \nOverall, despite exceptional charges at our Polish subsidiary \nmBank, we generated an operating profit of €2.1bn, significantly \nabove the forecasts made at the beginning of 2022. The success of \nthe past year was based on a sharp increase in income and the \ncontinuation of highly disciplined cost management. This enabled \nus to significantly exceed the consolidated profit forecast of more \nthan €1bn for 2022. \nIn the Private and Small-Business Customers segment, the \nfocus in the 2022 financial year was on implementing the central \ninitiatives under the “Strategy 2024” programme. The main focal \npoints were the expansion of the online and mobile banking \nchannels, the digitalisation of processes and procedures, and the \nlaunch of the “advisory centre” distribution channel. The advisory \ncentre has been progressively and successfully launched at all 12 \nlocations since mid-September 2022. Skilled advisors are available \nto customers by telephone, e-mail or video, including in the \nevenings and at weekends, to discuss all financial matters such as \naccounts, cards, securities investments and real estate financing. \nOn the income side, supported by the turnaround in interest rates \nwe were again able to achieve tangible growth in the Private and \nSmall-Business Customers segment in the past financial year. This \nwas reflected in a significant increase in net interest income. As \nexpected, net commission income failed to match the previous \nyear’s level. The decrease compared with 2021 reflects a €30bn \ndrop in the volume of securities to €189bn as a result of the \nweaker stock markets. By contrast, the volume of loans further \nincreased by around €3bn to €124bn. The volume of retail \nmortgage financing increased to €95bn, although new business \ncooled noticeably in the course of the year under review. The \nvolume of deposits expanded by around €7bn to €155bn.  \n \n \nSuccessful fiscal year 2022"

      "text": "90 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nOverall, the Private and Small-Business Customers segment \nsignificantly increased its operating income compared with the \nprevious year, in line with our expectations. It was also able to \nmore than offset the high charges from the provisions for foreign \ncurrency loans at mBank. Against the backdrop of the difficult \nmacroeconomic \nenvironment, \nthe \nrisk \nresult \nincreased \nsignificantly compared with the previous year. This was also in line \nwith our expectations. Costs in Germany fell slightly as expected, \nbut this was not fully reflected in total operating expenses for the \nsegment as a whole due to an increase in costs at mBank. We were \nnevertheless able to keep operating expenses slightly below the \nprior-year level; given the significantly higher operating income \nrecorded, this led to a tangible improvement in the cost/income \nratio. Overall, the segment’s operating profit increased as \nexpected, while the operating return on equity also showed a \npleasing year-on-year improvement, as anticipated. \nThe Corporate Clients segment focused on implementing \nstrategy measures in the 2022 reporting year. The establishment \nof a business model offering differentiated and efficient \nrelationship \nmanagement, \nthe \ncreation \nof \nthe \ntechnical \ninfrastructure and further digitalisation projects were the focal \npoints of capital expenditure in the Corporate Clients business. \nWith our “Mittelstandsbank Direkt”, we established the first \ngenuine direct banking offering for companies in the German \nmarket. As at the end of the year, we were already servicing \naround 6,000 customers through this channel. Earnings in the \nindividual areas showed a positive trend compared with the prior-\nyear period. \nThe Mittelstand division \nbenefited in cash \nmanagement from higher income in deposit business and higher \npayment transactions income. The division also generated higher \nincome from currency and commodity trading in the capital \nmarket business, while the lending business posted a stable \nperformance. In the International Corporates division, higher \nincome from transaction banking and the capital markets business \nin particular contributed to higher profit. The Institutionals \ndivision also posted an extremely positive performance. Higher \nincome – particularly from cash management – contrasted with \nsomewhat lower income from bond issues. The Others division, \nwhich includes hedging and remeasurement effects, recorded \na significant year-on-year rise in income that was primarily \nattributable \nto \nremeasurement \neffects. \nContrary \nto \nour \nexpectations, the segment recorded a pleasing increase in income \noverall compared with the previous year. As expected, the risk \nresult was significantly higher than the previous year’s figure, \nmainly due to individual cases connected with Russia. Also as \nexpected, operating expenses fell year on year thanks to \nsuccessful cost management.

      "text": "92 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nreported in the period under review was primarily attributable to \nthree factors: a considerable increase in provisions for legal risks \nin connection with mortgage financing in Swiss francs at mBank, \ncharges against earnings due to deferrals of interest and \nrepayment of private real estate financing at mBank, and lower fair \nvalue results. \nThe risk result was €–392m in the 2022 reporting period, \ncompared with €–319m a year earlier. The increase was largely \ndue to the posting of the secondary effects TLA. The secondary \neffects TLA is still necessary in view of the crisis-related economic \nuncertainty – increased energy costs, for example – and will \ntherefore remain in place for 2023. Further information on the TLA \ncan be found on page 126 of the Group risk report. \nOperating expenses were slightly reduced by just under 2% in \nthe period under review to €3,417m. Cost reductions of almost \n3.1% in Germany, reflecting the progress made with the \ntransformation process, were offset by significantly higher \noperating expenses at mBank, which resulted in particular from a \nrise in the number of employees and salary increases. The \nincrease of €141m in compulsory contributions to €460m was \nlargely due to a new mBank levy for an enhancement to Poland’s \ndeposit insurance scheme. \nOverall, the Private and Small-Business Customers segment \nposted a pre-tax profit of €1,000m in the period under review, \ncompared with €574m in the previous year. \nCorporate Clients \n \nThe Corporate Clients segment comprises four reporting areas. \nThe Mittelstand, International Corporates and Institutionals \ndivisions are responsible for business with our core customers: the \nMittelstand division covers Mittelstand (SME) customers and \ndomestic large corporates with the relevant products they require. \nThe International Corporates division looks after corporate clients \nheadquartered abroad and large German multinational companies. \nThe \nInstitutionals \ndivision \nis \nresponsible \nfor \nmanaging \nrelationships with banks in Germany and abroad, as well as those \nwith central banks and selected non-bank financial institutions \n(NBFIs) such as insurance companies and pension funds.  \nThe segment offers customers the complete range of products \nof an international full-service bank, from traditional credit \nproducts and individually tailored financing solutions to cash \nmanagement and trade finance, investment and hedging products \nand customised capital market solutions. The Others division \nhandles all business that either has a cross-segment risk \nmanagement function or falls outside the strategic focus of the \nCorporate Clients segment.

At €2,076m, net \ninterest income was a full €388m higher than the prior-year level, \nwhile net commission income of €1,321m exceeded the prior-year \nlevel by €72m, mainly due to an increase in foreign currency \nbusiness and trade finance.

Further information \non the TLA can be found on page 127 of the Group risk report. \nOperating expenses were reduced by €107m compared with \nthe prior-year period to €2,160m. The decline resulted from lower \npersonnel and administrative expenses achieved through strict \ncost management. The reported compulsory contributions of \n€120m relate primarily to the European banking levy.

Consolidation reconciles the \nfigures shown in segment reporting with the Group financial \nstatements in accordance with International Financial Reporting \nStandards (IFRS). Others and Consolidation also covers the costs \nof staff, management and support functions, which are then \ncharged to the segments. In addition, restructuring expenses for \nthe Group are reported centrally in this segment. \nThe Others and Consolidation segment reported an operating \nprofit of €33m for 2022, compared with an operating loss of  \n€–47m in the prior-year period. The positive change was primarily \nattributable to the elimination of the negative impact on earnings \nin the previous year resulting from the termination of the project \nto outsource securities settlement to HSBC Transaction Services \nGmbH, a net positive effect from the recognition and reversal of \nprovisions, a lower negative impact on earnings from the residual \nportfolio of the dissolved Asset & Capital Recovery segment – \nmainly on account of lower net loan loss provisions – and higher \nincome from real estate sales. These were offset by lower positive \nnet remeasurement effects and by a reduction of €24m to €149m \nin additional income from the fulfilment of the conditions in \nconnection with targeted longer-term refinancing operations \n(TLTROs) with the ECB (in part because the previous year also \nincluded amounts relating to 2020, since the fulfilment of the \ncredit volume requirement was not established until 2021) and a \nlower positive Group Treasury result. The fall in the Group \nTreasury result was primarily attributable to internal fair value \ncompensation payments to the Private and Small-Business \nCustomers segment for special repayments of mortgage loans due \nto the rise in interest rates and was partially offset by higher \nincome from the measurement of interest rate hedges in the \ncommercial banking book compared with the previous year. \nOthers and Consolidation recorded a pre-tax loss of €–61m for \nthe 2022 financial year.

      "text": "94 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nFuture economic situation \n \nThe global tightening of monetary policy will markedly slow \ngrowth in the world economy. China is the only economy likely to \nexperience stronger growth in 2023. Although the current wave of \ncoronavirus infections is likely to still weigh on growth at the \nbeginning of this year, the cancellation of the strict zero-Covid \nstrategy means that economic activity should pick up again from \nthe spring. This will also be helped by the fact that the government \nis to again place greater emphasis on promoting growth in its \n2023 economic policy. For example, it has implemented far-\nreaching measures to support the ailing real estate sector. \nIn the USA, the Federal Reserve is likely to increase its policy \nrate corridor by a further 75 basis points to between 5.25% and \n5.50% by the summer. That is because the labour market is still \nvery tight and wage pressure is correspondingly high. The marked \ntightening of monetary policy suggests there may be a recession \nin the US economy in 2023. Higher financing costs have already \nput a significant damper on the real estate market.  \nA recession in the USA will weigh on the eurozone economy, as \nwill high inflation and tighter monetary policy at the ECB. By the \nsummer, the ECB is likely to have raised its deposit rate by a \nfurther 100 basis points to 3.50%. For a number of reasons, \nhowever, the economy is not expected to collapse in the way that \nit did during the financial crisis of 2008–2009 or after the outbreak \nof coronavirus. Firstly, gas rationing has become unlikely. \nSecondly, many governments have decided to provide assistance \nto their citizens and businesses. Thirdly, supply chain issues have \nnow peaked. Many companies will now find it easier to work \nthrough their order backlogs, which are still at a very high level. \nThe suspension of the Stability and Growth Pact will continue \ninto 2023, meaning that member states will still be allowed to have \nbudget deficits that exceed 3% of GDP. EU member states will \nalso continue to receive money from the EU Recovery and \nResilience Facility in 2023. We are expecting the eurozone \neconomy to stagnate on average over the year in 2023. We predict \nthat the German economy will contract by 0.5%.  \nWe are anticipating some easing on the financial markets in \n2023. Though yields are likely to rise somewhat in the first few \nmonths of the new year, if the US Federal Reserve and the ECB \nrespond to the decline in inflation by ending the cycle of interest \nrate increases in the summer, bond yields are likely to fall. That is \nparticularly true for corporate bonds. \nThe euro has slipped below parity against the US dollar at \ntimes owing to fears of an energy crisis, which would have mainly \naffected the eurozone and less so the US with its own supplies. As \nthe risk of gas rationing has now decreased, the euro/US dollar \nexchange rate has recovered. The alignment of ECB and US \nFederal Reserve monetary policy suggests that the euro/US dollar \nexchange rate will remain largely unchanged in 2023.  \nShares rallied significantly in the autumn, due mainly to the \nprospect of falling inflation rates. Nevertheless, equity markets are \nlikely to remain volatile in the first half of the year. This is mainly \ndue to disappointing corporate earnings, which are likely to be \nimpacted by rising interest rates, high input costs and the \nrecession. \n  \n \n \nExchange rates \n31.12.2022 \n31.12.20231 \nEuro/US dollar \n1.07 \n1.08 \nEuro/Sterling \n0.89 \n0.91 \nEuro/Zloty \n4.68 \n4.65 \n \n \n \n1 The figures for 2023 are Commerzbank forecasts. \n \nFuture situation in the banking \nsector \n \nOur views regarding the expected development of the banking \nsector structurally and over the short and medium term are \nbasically unchanged from the statements we published in recent \nreports. In the short term especially, the risks are still to be \nregarded as very challenging. Against the backdrop of the higher \ncost of debt and enormous increases in the cost of living, more \ncorporate and personal insolvencies must be expected in the \ncoming months.  \nThe net debt of many borrowers has risen sharply in recent \nyears due to very favourable financing conditions. The resulting \nneed for value adjustments will affect both retail and corporate \nbanking business.  \nRussia’s war in Ukraine and the suspension of its gas supplies \nhave exacerbated the economic situation, particularly in Europe, \nto such an extent that both industry and households are suffering \nas a result. Although the negative effects on the economy and \nsociety are being mitigated by the support packages that have \nbeen agreed, this means having to accept a significant increase in \npublic debt everywhere in Europe.  \n \n \nOutlook and opportunities report"

Because many companies have so far \npassed on only part of their additional costs to consumers, the \ncore rate of inflation in particular is likely to remain high.  \nAdded to this are ongoing risks associated with the coronavirus \npandemic. Further waves of infection and the associated adverse \neffects on the economy – especially in China – are thus \nconceivable. German banks’ net interest and commission income \nwould be negatively affected by the feared weakness of the export \nindustry, which is so important for the country’s economy. \nHeightened volatilities on financial markets are also contributing \nto the noticeable burden in the form of increased loan loss \nprovisions and financial requirements for banks. Business with \ncorporate and small-business customers is therefore under \nconsiderable pressure. Business with retail customers is also being \naffected, as the sharp rise in inflation is having a negative impact \non private consumption. The financial buffers built up during the \ncoronavirus restrictions due to the increased propensity to save \nare now likely to be running out for many households. Demand for \nresidential mortgages, which has so far been very robust owing to \nthe lack of affordable housing, is also beginning to weaken \nmarkedly as mortgage interest rates continue to rise.  \nIn the case of residential real estate, the first indications of \na noticeable slowdown in the price momentum seen for many \nyears are becoming increasingly apparent in Germany. The partly \nweak and uncertain prospects for income, coupled with the \nsignificant increase in interest rates since the beginning of 2022, \nare increasingly slowing the previous upswing in the residential \nreal estate market. The sharp rise in interest rates has led to a \nmarked decline in new mortgage business, both in Germany and \nin many other eurozone countries, even though mortgage volumes \nas a whole have continued to grow. Noticeable declines were \nrecorded above all for loans with long fixed-interest periods of at \nleast ten years. This is likely to lead to declining earnings. At the \nsame time, however, margins on deposits are improving as a result \nof the general rise in interest rates, which may well more than \noffset the negative effect mentioned above. In this respect, the \nrisks for the banking sector are more likely to result from a decline \nin the quality of the assets held. That is because long-term loans \nincrease exposure to interest rate risks, payment delays and \ndefaults. They also harbour the risk of losses in the value of \nproperty pledged as loan collateral.  \nAccording to the Deutsche Bundesbank’s Financial Stability \nReport from the end of November 2022, this issue presents \nconsiderable downside risks for the banking sector in Germany. \nAbove all, a further worsening of the energy crisis accompanied by \na sharp economic slump represents a risk scenario for the German \nfinancial system. Vulnerabilities to adverse macroeconomic trends \nhave increased over the years owing to the prolonged low interest \nrate environment and associated very cheap credit, along with \nconsiderable asset price growth. That applies both to the \ncorporate sector – despite a significant increase in core capital \nratios since the financial crisis – and to households. The \nsustainability of household debt still appears robust at present, but \nit is being undermined by the sharp decline in real income. The \nrisk of contagion effects between the countries of the eurozone, \nwhich are closely interconnected in economic, political and \nfinancial terms, should also not be underestimated. \n \n \n \nTo enhance the resilience of the German financial system, the \nGerman Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) issued \ngeneral rulings in 2022 to activate the countercyclical capital \nbuffer of 0.75% and introduce a sectoral systemic risk buffer of \n2% for residential real estate financing. Both buffers must be held \nsince the beginning of February 2023. In addition, regulators are \nrequiring lenders to be mindful of prudent lending standards for \nresidential mortgages. At the European level, the European Union \nis carrying out a review of the macroprudential framework. In view \nof the high risks to financial stability, the European Systemic Risk \nBoard advocates further enhancing resilience in the European \nfinancial system through higher capital buffers, or at least \nmaintaining the existing capital buffers. To expand the scope for \nmacroprudential \npolicy \naction, \nadditional \nincome-related \ninstruments are also being called for. There are concerns, \nhowever, that a constant expansion of regulatory requirements \nmay well have a counterproductive effect in view of the financing \nefforts that banks need to make in connection with the digital and \nabove all sustainable transformation of the economy. \nThe outlook with regard to banks’ interest margins has \nbrightened. For a long time, persistently low interest rates were \nconsidered one of the key challenges.  \n \n \nIn 2023, the banking industry \ncontinues to face major challenges"

      "text": "96 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nCentral banks reacted to the far-reaching economic impact of \nthe pandemic with bond purchase programmes, extensive liquidity \nprovision and a zero interest rate policy. Government lending \nprogrammes also had a negative impact on banks’ interest \nmargins and profitability. Achievable net interest margins were \ntherefore very low throughout Europe, but particularly in the \nGerman banking market. At the same time, refinancing costs rose \ndue to the growth in customer deposits. The picture has now \nchanged. In response to the rapid pace of inflation, central banks \naround the world have significantly tightened their monetary \npolicy. A marked increase in credit interest rates, including in \nGermany, is enabling banks to improve their interest margins and \nthus also boosting the income trend across the entire financial \nsector. It remains to be seen, however, whether central banks, \nsuch as the Fed or the ECB in particular, will decide to change \ncourse in favour of an interest rate reduction policy given the \nheightened danger of a recession in their economic areas. In \naddition, the fierce national competition among German banks \nmeans that earnings potential in retail banking remains limited \neven with improved interest margins, especially as deposit rates \nare also likely to rise further over time.  \nAs in the dominant interest-bearing business, the prospects in \ntrading business can currently be regarded as positive as a result \nof the volatile market environment. However, many institutions \nhave partially or even completely withdrawn from direct trading in \nthe past. But the banking sector can also benefit indirectly: \ntogether with increasing trading volumes, higher market volatility \nmeans higher commission income in securities business. It is \nhighly likely that the number of private shareholders in Germany \nwill continue to increase over the next few years despite the \ngrowth in investment alternatives as interest rates continue to rise. \nAs a consequence, and with the growing popularity of digital and \nmobile products, there will be greater demand for individual \nfinancial advice among bank customers who are less comfortable \nwith technology and hugely unsettled by the economic turbulence. \nGiven the existing demand for advice on complex banking \ntransactions such as retail mortgage financing, branch business \nwill therefore remain part of the basic service provided by banks, \nalbeit in a pared back form. \nIn view of the income problems and ongoing competitive \npressure, cost reduction remains the key issue both for German \nbanks and for their European competitors. As a result, \ndigitalisation of business processes and the utilisation of the data \ngenerated will advance rapidly. The pandemic has already \nmassively accelerated the trend towards digital banking services. \nThe trends in customer behaviour that were pushed forward \nduring the crisis – more online banking and new payment habits – \nare set to continue. This calls for highly automated IT processes \nand comprehensive data analytics methods that permit rapid \nadjustments in response to changing market conditions. This is \nencouraging the increasing shift away from branch-based retail \nbanking, resulting in efficiency gains and a reduction in the range \nof products and services but also making it more difficult to \ngenerate commission income. \n \n \n \nThe new digital business models, with their ever shorter \ninnovation cycles and the need for faster product delivery, require \nthe use of forward-looking technologies such as the cloud and \nartificial intelligence. A cloud-first strategy with corresponding \nmigration of the IT systems also offers the advantage of driving \nforward the modernisation of the existing core systems. At the \nsame time, despite the pressure to innovate and reduce costs \nmany traditional banks are faced with the central challenge of \nensuring the quality and stability of their IT systems, protecting \nthemselves against the growing threat of cyber attacks and \nmaintaining the integrity of their data. \nAgainst the background of the technological transformation \nreferred to, the German banking market in particular is on the \nbrink of a major upheaval. Over the longer term there will be a \ndrastic reduction in the number of institutions and even more \nintense competition. More and more global technology groups, \nfintech companies, foreign banks and market infrastructure \nproviders such as stock exchanges, clearing houses and \ninformation service providers will start offering a selection of \ntraditional banking products. It seems unlikely that competitors \nfrom the tech segment will provide a full range of banking \nservices, however. A significantly stricter regulatory framework for \nfinancial market players outside of the traditional banking sector, \nas recently advocated by the Bank for International Settlements \n(BIS), is also likely to limit the current competitive advantages of \nyoung fintech companies in the foreseeable future. Overall, \nestablished banks must invest continuously in their digital \ncompetitiveness in order not to lose their direct customer access \nand the associated data advantage. Adequately positive returns \ncan only be achieved through additional cost reductions and \nfurther expansion of commission-based business areas. \n \n \nConsistent cost management \ncontinues to be a focus"

The aim of the European \nCommission’s digital finance strategy is to establish a financial \nmarket that applies uniform EU-wide rules and thus ensures \ntechnology neutrality and sustainability as well as identical \nframework conditions for all providers. Many banking markets in \nEurope are still dominated by national legislation, with at times \nsignificant divergence in terms of regulations and customer \nrequirements. There is also overcapacity almost everywhere, \nwhich reduces profitability. Although the market consolidation \nprocess is continuing, with the number of banks falling steadily \nboth in Germany and in Europe over the past few years, this has \nmainly involved smaller banks being taken over or merged with \none another. Greater consolidation is being prevented above all by \nthe marked rise in the risks associated with takeovers and \nmergers, which is due to the increasing importance of technology \nfor sales channels. \nThe European banking union is still a work in progress, leaving \na great deal of leeway for individual member states in terms of \nbanking regulation. Progress has been made, however, with the \ncompletion of the Basel 3 capital rules. Most recently, agreement \nwas also reached on revising the rules for banks that get into \ndifficulties. However, the lack of an acceptable EU-wide deposit \ninsurance system (EDIS) in particular has thus far prevented \nfurther market integration. The EDIS is the third element in the \nEuropean banking union, alongside the already active Single \nSupervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the existing Single Resolution \nMechanism (SRM). \nIn addition to the planned introduction of a digital euro, \nanother intended step towards greater harmonisation across \nEurope is the creation of a common payment system (EPI) that is \nset to become the new standard for payments by consumers and \nmerchants. The EPI could provide European banks with greater \nlending volumes, as it would give them an entry into the business \nof payment card companies based outside the EU. In addition to \nthe way in which we will use money in the future, and the role of \ncentral bank money in this, banking regulation is focusing \nincreasingly on the management of ESG (environmental, social \nand governance) risks. According to the World Economic Forum \n(WEF), the three greatest challenges of our time in the coming \nyears will be climate change, extreme weather events and the loss \nof biodiversity. With this in mind, the EBA intends to embed \nclimate and environmental risks more firmly in banks’ risk \nmanagement processes, including mandatory disclosure of climate \nrisks. For example, an initial climate stress test was carried out \nlast year.  \nClimate risks are also set to be a focus of future ECB stress \ntests, enabling banks to better assess their consequences for their \nbusiness environment.  \nAccording to the Bundesbank, the German financial system is \nwell equipped to overcome the risks arising from higher taxes on \nfossil fuels. However, the financing requirements of the European \nCommission’s planned green deal could lead to green quantitative \neasing. This is new, and moreover not uncontroversial, because to \ndate none of the world’s central banks have pursued a monetary \npolicy that is explicitly oriented towards climate protection goals. \nClimate-friendly project financing is entering a new phase. \nInitiatives targeted include increased electrification, expansion of \nenergy transmission and distribution infrastructure including grid-\nscale storage, emissions reductions in energy-intensive industries \nsuch as steel and cement, and solutions for preserving natural \nbiodiversity. The signs of this new era are already visible. In \naddition to continued investment in power generation, they \ninclude increased support for new technologies such as hydrogen \ngeneration and grid storage, as well as product innovations to \nfinance CO2 reduction.  \nIn Poland, the increasingly restrictive monetary policy pursued \nby the central bank NBP since October 2021 following the \nprevious coronavirus-related cuts in the policy rate has ensured \nthat interest margins for the Polish banking sector have tended to \nimprove. It remains to be seen, however, whether a decline in the \nquality of the loan portfolio will lead to significantly higher risk \ncosts and increased loan defaults. The economic environment is \nstill extremely fragile, the effects of the Ukraine war are directly \ntangible, and sharp rises in consumer prices are impacting the real \ndisposable income of private households. In addition, following \nthe last rate move by the NBP in September 2022, policy rates are \nunlikely to be raised further in the foreseeable future due to a \nnoticeable decline in Polish GDP growth. Inflation is likely to \nremain very high, with the increase in the minimum wage at the \nbeginning of 2023 also contributing to this. The strained relations \nwith the EU are also weighing on the economic outlook. Bank \nearnings are therefore likely to remain under pressure, while the \ntrend towards consolidation in the Polish banking market is set to \ncontinue. Furthermore, legal developments and their potential \nimpact on major market participants such as mBank regarding \ntheir portfolio of loans issued in Swiss francs and other foreign \ncurrencies must continue to be closely monitored. The “credit \nholidays” instrument introduced in this context will also weigh on \nthe earnings of Polish banks. As a result, mBank has initiated a \nnew settlement programme with a view to reaching individual \nagreements with customers in its Swiss franc loan portfolio."

Commerzbank has access to the capital \nmarket through a broad range of products. In addition to \nunsecured funding instruments (preferred and non-preferred \nsenior bonds, Tier 2 subordinated debt and Additional Tier 1 \ncapital), when refinancing Commerzbank can also issue secured \nfunding instruments, in particular mortgage Pfandbriefe and \npublic-sector Pfandbriefe. As such, Pfandbriefe are a key element \nof Commerzbank’s funding mix. These give Commerzbank stable \naccess to long-term funding with cost advantages compared with \nunsecured sources of funding. Issuance formats range from large-\nvolume benchmark bonds to private placements. \n \n \n \nBy regularly reviewing and adjusting the assumptions used for \nliquidity management and the long-term funding requirement, \nCommerzbank will continue to respond actively to changes in the \nmarket environment and business performance in order to secure \na comfortable liquidity cushion and an appropriate funding \nstructure. \nPlanned investments \nFor the 2023 financial year, we have budgeted for €0.5bn in direct \ncosts for IT investments. Around one-third of this investment will \ncontinue to be devoted to the restructuring of the business model \nand the digitalisation of retail banking business. We will invest the \nremaining funds in the further digitalisation of processes in \ncorporate client business and in IT infrastructure/operations. \nRegulatory measures are included in the above areas. \nPrivate and Small-Business Customers \nThe main investment targets in 2023 remain the central initiatives \nrelating to the “Strategy 2024” programme.  \nIn the Private and Small-Business Customers segment, \nCommerzbank is building on the milestones reached in 2022 to \nfurther develop the digital and personal business model. The main \nfocus is on further developing the digital advisory bank – complete \nwith comprehensive mobile offerings – and achieving greater \npenetration of the Wealth Management, Private Banking and \npremium \nSmall-Business \nCustomers \nsegments \nthrough \nsupplementary services and personal advice. \nIn digital banking, the focus of investments in 2023 will be on \nthe continual expansion of online services. Building on the \nprogress made last year, further steps in the onboarding process \nwhen opening accounts for small-business customers will be \ndigitalised. Important foundations are also being laid for the \nfurther expansion of online banking. In addition to the ongoing \nimprovement of operational stability, the focus here is on the \nestablishment of daily banking services with transaction and \nfinancial overviews developed from scratch in both technical and \nfunctional terms, along with further modernisation of online \npayment services. Customers will also be provided with a new \nhome page that they are able to personalise.

Work will continue on optimising securities \nsettlement systems and order functions. In addition, the \nfunctionalities of the money mate securities investment system will \nbe further expanded. \nIn retail mortgage financing, most of the investment will be \ndevoted to the further digitalisation of our new omnichannel \nlending platform in order to optimise customer service in loan \napplications and the loan decision process for customers. \nFollowing the successful launch of the retail mortgage financing \napplication process stage, a modern and digital lending decision \nprocess stage will be developed next year, thus taking another \nimportant step towards enhancing quality and efficiency while \nconsistently \nfocusing \non \ncustomer-specific \nrequirements. \nCommerzbank is also planning further investments to digitalise \nmanual processing steps in the process for existing loans. \nIn \ninstalment \nloans \nbusiness, \nthe \nfinal \nstep \ntowards \nomnichannel capability is planned with the digital advisory \nprocess for the advisory centre and advisory branches. To this end, \nimportant functional enhancements will be made and the degree \nof automation of instalment loan processing will be significantly \nincreased.  \nWith regard to account products, one particular focus in 2023 \nwill be on expanding the digital processes for concluding \ncontracts with the various types of new customers. There will also \nbe further digitalisation and automation of the necessary approval \nprocesses as required following the ruling by the German Federal \nCourt of Justice on price adjustments for retail customers. To give \ndue consideration to sustainability as a cornerstone of the Bank’s \nstrategy, investments will also be made in the development of a \ngreen deposit product. \nAnother focal point of investment is the expansion of the \ndigitalised inbox system to improve process efficiency. \nIn the 2023 financial year, further investments will also be \nmade in an efficient and modern set-up of the branch business. \nAround 50 more branches will be closed. At the same time, more \nthan 100 branches will be modernised and digital contact points \nfor customers expanded within them. Additional options for \ndispensing cash are being developed, for example through the use \nof third-party locations or collaborative arrangements.  \nFor the advisory centre, the focus will be on further developing \nthe range of services and driving forward process digitalisation in \norder to optimise the customer experience. In this context, the \nplatform and technology are being built up on an ongoing basis. \nIn terms of regulation, alongside the implementation of the \nfully automated online KYC review process for natural persons, the \nfocus in 2023 will be on working out the detail of the questions on \nPAIs (Principle Adverse Impact Indicators) in the investment \nadvisory process as required by the guidelines of the European \nSecurities and Markets Authority. The target market check for \nadvisory orders will also be expanded to include additional details \non sustainability preferences. Another focus of investment is on \nensuring that the system complies with the requirements arising \nfrom the new provisions in the German Defence against Tax \nHavens Act for the opening of financial accounts. \nCorporate Clients  \nInvestments in the Corporate Clients segment in 2023 will \ncontinue to focus on the implementation of Commerzbank’s \nstrategic objectives. This takes account of the significant changes \nin customer expectations through digitalisation. The use of digital \nchannels is increasing at all relevant customer interfaces. \nFurthermore, the integration of sustainability aspects must be \ntaken into account in the context of investments. \nCommerzbank continues to focus on German SMEs, large \ncompanies and institutional customers. Investments will be \ncentred in particular on expanding digital services and on \nadministrative matters to further improve the customer experience \nfor our corporate clients. We also offer our international customers \na global platform via which they can use applications such as real-\ntime foreign exchange trading (FX Live Trader/Live Confirm), \npayment transactions (Global Payment Plus), self-service features \n(trade finance, master data management) and external digital \nservices. \nThe global rollout of a uniform and efficient KYC workflow tool \nwill also be completed worldwide, thereby providing technical \nsupport for and simplifying the process of ensuring compliance \nwith legal requirements. In addition, the focus will be on further \nplatform consolidation with a view to reducing costs over the long \nterm.  \nIn transaction banking, we will continue to invest in the \nrenewal of payment transaction systems and take account of \nfurther customer requirements. The worldwide shift in payment \ntransactions requires further investment in system adaptation both \nin Germany and abroad. \nIn order to further digitalise the trade finance product offering, \ninvestments are being made in products and collaborations based \non distributed ledger technology (DLT). \nIn particular, further investment will be required to comply with \nregulatory requirements in the areas of payment transactions and \ncapital markets.

      "text": "100 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nFurther improvements in communication between IT systems \nwill enable us to work even more closely with our customers and \npartners. \nIT & Operations \nCommerzbank will continue the ongoing optimisation of its IT \nstructure in 2023, with further significant investments in the \nexpansion of cloud technology and the digitalisation of the \nworkplace environment.  \nCommerzbank \ntherefore \nremains \non \ntrack \nwith \nthe \ndigitalisation and streamlining of its business. On the IT side, the \nBank will also focus on modernising the IT architecture and \nputting the technological base on a more professional footing. The \ndigitalisation of the product range will also continue. In addition to \ndigital account management and the expansion of functions in the \nonline portals, the focus is on account access via APIs (application \nprogramming interfaces), virtual accounts and expanded SWIFT \nservices. In the current financial year, we are also anticipating a \ngrowing \nneed \nfor \ninvestments \nin \nconnection \nwith \nthe \nimplementation of regulatory requirements.  \nIn addition, investments will be made to further optimise costs \nand automate and enhance IT and operational stability, \nparticularly with regard to cyber security. \nAnticipated liquidity trends \nThe short-term repo market in high-quality securities (high-quality \nliquid assets or HQLA) such as government bonds, agency \nsecurities (issued by quasi-governmental US issuers) and \nPfandbriefe continues to play an important role in servicing the \nbond markets and financing portfolios.  \nThe Eurosystem and its securities lending programme for \nholdings under the asset purchase programme (APP) and \npandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) are still \nimportant methods for meeting collateral requirements in trading \nactivities, particularly with respect to German government bonds. \nUnder these programmes, maturing securities continue to be \nreinvested in order to ensure that there is ample liquidity in the \nmarkets while also preventing any negative impact on the \nappropriate monetary policy stance. Taking into account the \noutstanding TLTRO volume as well as the large ECB securities \nholdings under the APP and the PEPP, central bank collateral \nremains highly sought after. We expect that repos in HQLA will \ncontinue to trade under the deposit facility for the foreseeable \nfuture, as this will continue to generate high demand.  \nThis will also be supported by the reinvestment of maturing \nsecurities from the ECB’s programmes. Investors are generally \nless willing to make their collateral available over the medium \nterm (longer than three months), meaning that the market for term \nrepos still offers only limited liquidity, especially across important \nreporting dates. \nThe situation on the bond markets is being influenced by high \ninflation, the ECB’s increasingly restrictive monetary policy in this \ncontext, supply bottlenecks and high energy costs as well as \nweaker economic data and expectations. Therefore, even despite \nthe generally rising level of government debt, we expect German \ngovernment bond yields to remain relatively low – by historical \nstandards – even in the long-term segment, including as a result of \ncontinuing reinvestments by the ECB. Demand for secure \ninvestments among financial investors will also continue to be very \nstrong, causing credit spreads to be relatively stable. Overall, \nhowever, we do not anticipate any liquidity shortfalls in connection \nwith the Russia-Ukraine war. \nManaging opportunities at  \nCommerzbank \n \nThe demands placed on modern, sustainable banking business \nand the overall framework conditions have changed markedly in \nthe past few years. Whereas personal customer relationship \nmanagement was formerly a key element, these days customers \nexpect multi-channel advisory services, digital financial offerings \nand individual, tailor-made products that are available at any time. \nWe have responded to this by continuously adapting our strategic \ndirection over the past few years. We are undertaking a far-\nreaching restructuring under our “Strategy 2024” programme. \nThe aim of the restructuring is to combine the benefits of a fully \ndigitalised bank with personal advisory services, an unwavering \ncustomer focus and sustainability. Our goal is to be the digital \nadvisory bank for Germany. With our new positioning, we want to \nbecome more efficient and create sustainable prospects for our \nworkforce, customers and shareholders. Further information on \nour “Strategy 2024” programme can be found on page 75 f. \nAs part of its comprehensive digitalisation, the Bank is \nsignificantly streamlining its branch network and expanding its \nrange of digital services. In our branches that remain in the target \nportfolio, we will offer advice on all aspects of accounts, cards and \ninstalment \nloans \nand, \nat \nselected \nlocations, \nadditional \ncomprehensive support on all matters relating to assets and \nfinancing."

This is being offered through our advisory centre, \nwhich will become the most important contact channel for \npersonal service and for advising our customers. With the advisory \ncentre we are creating something completely new, drawing on the \nexpertise and experience of Commerz Direktservice, the comdirect \nbrand and the branches. Whereas personal advice was previously \nonly available in our branches, in future our customers will also be \nable to obtain advice through the new advisory centre. Advisory \nservices can be obtained at home or while out and about, wholly in \nline with customer needs. This can be done by telephone, video or \nchat – including in the evening and at weekends. Going forward, \ntherefore, we will be offering our customers three access routes: \nthe advisory centre, our branches and the digital channel. Through \nthis approach, we can offer them the appropriate services at a time \nthat suits them and via their preferred access route. All 12 \nadvisory centre locations are already up and running. Staffing and \ncustomer migration had been completed by the end of November. \nIn addition to an already successful relaunch of the online \ncustomer portal, we have now also started the pilot project for \nsmall-business customers. \nWe will continue to automate our business processes \nconsistently and across the board. Within the lending process for \nprivate customers, this includes, for example, standardised \nproducts such as instalment loans or increases in credit card \nlimits. We are also taking advantage of the high growth potential \nin the German premium market to restructure our service model \nfor high-net-worth private and small-business customers. In this \nway, we aim to become the bank for entrepreneurial wealth \nmanagement. In the future, both generalists and specialists \ncovering a diverse range of customer requirements will be \nrepresented in premium branches at a number of locations. By \nworking closely with each other and with colleagues in the \nCorporate Clients segment, they will help the Bank ensure \nseamless customer service in both the private and the business \nsphere. \nWe intend to further enhance our strong positioning in serving \nGerman SMEs. As the leading trade finance bank in Germany, we \nensure a presence along altered trade corridors. To this end, we \nare steadily simplifying the trading platform. In the Corporate \nClients segment, we are focusing on clients with a clear \nconnection to Germany. As such, we closed several international \nsites in the course of 2022. We are gradually introducing an \ninnovative direct banking offering – Mittelstandsbank Direkt – for \ncorporate clients that require standardised products and advisory \nservices.  \nCorporate customers with complex advisory requirements will \ncontinue to benefit from personalised relationship management. \nAdvice is being combined with innovative services such as the \ndigital bank for companies and forward-looking, sustainable \nproducts.  \nData-based solutions and sales analytics support sales and \nenable efficient relationship management. The employee migration \nin the Corporate Clients segment took place in mid-November \n2022. This was the starting signal for the new target structure and \nthe new service model. The full migration of 6,000 clients to \nMittelstandsbank Direkt was completed by the end of 2022.  \nWe will transform the Bank across all segments. This \ntransformation affects our strategy, technology, skills and culture, \nwhile also taking into account the particular risk in the form of \ncyber attacks. Customer trust built up over years facilitates the use \nof smart data and is thus a competitive advantage in the digital \nage. When introducing new applications, the focus is on the \ncustomer perspective. For some time now, we have been \nsupported in this by our subsidiaries CommerzVentures (venture \ncapital fund for participation in fintechs, insurtechs and climate \nfintechs) and neosfer (formerly Main Incubator). As a research and \ndevelopment unit for future technologies, neosfer enables \ninnovations and early-stage investments by Commerzbank. This is \ndone by investing in early-stage start-ups (neosfer.invest), \ndeveloping business models or ventures internally (neosfer.build), \nand building ecosystems around the sustainable and digital future \nof our society (neosfer.connect). With this realignment, neosfer is \nnow consciously linking up its future-oriented skills in the area of \ndigitalisation with those it possesses in the area of sustainability. \nCommerzbank is driving its cultural change with the aim of \nstrengthening a performance culture geared to success. We want \nto strengthen entrepreneurial thinking, as befits the start-up \nmentality, including among our own employees, applying modern \nforms of cooperation and agile methods to develop innovative \nproducts. To this end, we introduced the Delivery Organisation \n(DO) at head office back in 2019. Its overarching purpose is to \nmodernise the IT architecture while maintaining operational \nstability, expand capabilities and capacities, and develop new \nprofessional functionalities for our customers. An innovative \ncollaboration model was also launched within the DO to reduce \ncomplexity and create clear responsibilities. For this purpose, we \nhave assigned clusters to different layers in order to simplify \ncomplex processes. In mid-2022, we entered the implementation \nphase of the structure set up as a project; the organisational target \nstructure is to be put in place in the course of 2023."

      "text": "102 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nOur transformation offers both potential cost savings and \ngrowth opportunities in future markets such as digital ecosystems, \nembedded finance, digital assets and sustainability. Our activities \nin the area of sustainability, one of the four cornerstones of our \n“Strategy 2024” programme, are based on ESG (environmental, \nsocial and governance) criteria. Given the clear evidence of the \nimpact of climate change, we are currently focusing more heavily \non climate protection. Further information on our sustainability \nstrategy and on our sustainability goals and activities can be found \nin the combined separate non-financial report on page 42 ff. \nOverall, we are convinced that rigorous implementation of the \nmeasures already initiated and those recently adopted will enable \nus to create added value for our customers, employees, investors \nand shareholders, and for society as a whole. We have a clear goal \nin mind: to create a strong Commerzbank that is fit for the future. \nAnticipated performance of the \nCommerzbank Group \n \nCommerzbank has successfully completed the first half of its four-\nyear transformation programme “Strategy 2024”. While the focus \nin the past two years was on restructuring with the associated \nreduction in personnel, the emphasis is now on expanding \nprofitable customer business. \nThe framework conditions for the Bank’s financial ambitions in \n2024 have changed. While higher interest rates open up additional \nearnings potential, Commerzbank will not be able to fully escape \nthe pressure on costs due to high inflation. With a slightly weaker \nforecast for the risk result, these factors mean that the Bank is \ntargeting an operating profit of €3.2bn in 2024. We had previously \nbeen expecting an operating profit of €3.0bn for 2024. As a result, \na higher net return on tangible equity of more than 7.3% is \nexpected, while the target cost/income ratio is unchanged at an \nambitious 60%.  \nThe strategic priorities for 2023 are shaped in particular by the \nsuccessful establishment of the new business model for both \nprivate and small-business customers and corporate clients. With \na clear focus on profitable customer business, the speed of \ntransformation is to be maintained unabated. Huge importance \nwill be placed on continued strict cost discipline, with a focus on \nthe cost/income ratio. At the same time, Commerzbank plans to \nmake further progress in the area of ESG and sustainability. \nFinally, a high priority for Commerzbank is to increase its \nattractiveness as an employer so that it can successfully manage \ndemographic change. \nCommerzbank expects the environment for banking to remain \nchallenging in 2023. A mild recession with continued high \ninflation and associated higher interest rates has a material impact \non the expected financial results for 2023. Commerzbank bases its \nexpectations on consensus macroeconomic data, which are \ncollected at regular intervals by Consensus Economics. Germany’s \ngross domestic product is expected to experience a mild \nrecession, reflected in negative growth of –0.5%. At the end of \n2022 inflation of 7.0% was anticipated for Germany. The \nconsensus for the ECB’s deposit rate based on the December \nsurvey is an average of 2.25% for 2023; this has been factored \naccordingly into Commerzbank’s planning. Furthermore, short-\nterm interest rates for mBank’s business in the Polish market are \nexpected to remain above 6%. \nAnticipated performance of individual  \nearnings components \nHigher interest rates already had a positive impact on net interest \nincome in 2022. For 2023, we expect a further slight increase in \nnet interest income to over €6.5bn. In the event that the higher \nforward interest rates from January 2023 are realised on the \nmarket and the interest pass-through on deposit balances remains \nfive percentage points below the expected 30%, net interest \nincome is expected to total €7.1bn. The driver for this increase is \nwider margins in customer deposits. In particular, non-interest-\nbearing demand deposits from customers can be invested at \nhigher interest rates than in the past. In 2023, this will more than \noffset the loss of €189m in extraordinary income received in 2022 \nfrom longer-term refinancing operations with the ECB (TLTRO). \nThe slowdown in new retail mortgage business will not yet have a \nsignificant impact on net interest income in 2023. Instead, \nCommerzbank expects volumes and margins to remain largely \nstable across the entire loan book. mBank in Poland contributed in \nparticular to the increase in net interest income for the Group last \nyear. However, the Bank expects the trend to be largely flat in \n2023, reflecting an increased pass-through of interest rates to \nmBank customers. \nNet commission income for the current year is expected to be \nat the same level as in the previous year. Slightly weaker \ncommission income in securities business with retail customers is \nlikely to be offset by higher income in corporate client business, as \nare effects in private customer business from customer attrition \ndue to branch closures."

      "text": "To our Shareholders \nCorporate Responsibility \nManagement Report \nRisk Report \nFinancial Statements \nFurther Information \n103 \n \n \n 75 Basis of the Commerzbank Group \n 81 Economic report \n 91 Segment performance \n 94 Outlook and opportunities report \n \n \n \nNet income from financial assets and liabilities measured at fair \nvalue through profit or loss is generally subject to increased \nvolatility, which can be influenced only to a limited extent. This is \ndue \nin \npart \nto \nthe \nfundamental \nuncertainty \nregarding \ndevelopments on the global capital markets. Accounting rules are \na factor too. Sometimes they may require similar items to be \npresented as fair value measurements in the fair value result in \none time period, whereas the interest component dominates in \nanother. Year-on-year shifts between the income items net interest \nincome and fair value result – and vice versa – are therefore \npossible. A portion of this income component is therefore directly \nrelated to net interest income. With its risk-oriented and customer-\nfocused approach, Commerzbank, like mBank, seeks to achieve \nincome that is as high and stable as possible. After the fair value \nresult made a clearly positive contribution of €451m to Group \nearnings in the 2022 financial year, a lower or even negative \ncontribution cannot be ruled out for the current year. \n \n \n \nExperience has shown that the other income items, including \nrealised profit or losses on financial instruments and other net \nincome, are often affected to a large extent by one-off income and \nmeasurement effects that are usually impossible to predict. A \nlargely break-even result is forecast for the 2023 financial year. \nFurther charges cannot be ruled out in respect of the provisions \nfor legal risks in connection with mortgage loans issued in foreign \ncurrencies at mBank, whose effects are reflected under other net \nincome. After large provisions were recognised in 2022, however, \nno material expense is expected for the current year. \nFollowing a figure of €–876m last year, Commerzbank also \nexpects a charge from the risk result of less than €–900m for \n2023. This expectation takes into account at least partial utilisation \nof the top-level adjustment (TLA) of €482m as at the end of 2022. \nThis TLA reflects expected secondary effects in the loan book due \nto factors including global supply chain bottlenecks and the \nconsequences of the war in Ukraine. \nOperating expenses, including compulsory contributions, are to \nbe further reduced to €6.3bn in the current year despite high \ninflation. However, the cost/income ratio is used as the core \nperformance indicator for the Bank. This means that operating \nexpenses reflect any deviations from budgeted income and, for \nexample, determine whether funds for investment are released or \nwithheld. The expenses for variable remuneration are also affected \nby deviations from budgeted income.  \nOverall, in addition to operating profit the consolidated profit \nattributable to Commerzbank shareholders and investors in \nadditional equity components is also expected to increase \nsignificantly in 2023. This should be accompanied by an increase \nin the distribution ratio for shareholders from 30% to 50% for the \n2023 financial year.  \nAnticipated segment performance \nPrivate and Small-Business Customers \nIn the Private and Small-Business Customers (PSBC) segment, the \nfocus in the current year will be on effectively adapting customer \nbusiness to the new business model. With the branch network in \nGermany reduced to around 450 branches last year and expected \nto reach the target size of 400 branches this year, around 8 million \nbranch customers will be served from the advisory centre with its \n12 locations. The aim is to ensure that earnings potential is \nleveraged in line with the altered customer service situation and \nthat potential customer attrition is effectively limited. At the same \ntime, further investments will be made in digital applications and \nprocesses. This is intended to further strengthen comdirect’s very \ngood market position. In the current year, particular attention will \nbe paid to personal service and business potential with high-net-\nworth private customers.  \nNet interest income should increase due to the rise in interest \nrates in the current year, when the prior-year figure is adjusted for \nthe \nGroup-neutral \nextraordinary \nincome \nfrom \nfair \nvalue \nadjustments of around €90m in the second quarter of 2022. A \nsimilar position is excluded for 2023 as the underlying offsetting \nprocedure in the Group has been adjusted. \nCommerzbank is expecting a slight decline in net commission \nincome for the PSBC segment. The reason for this forecast is the \nexpectation of largely unchanged equity indices, particularly in \nGermany. As a result, both portfolio-related and transaction-\nrelated income from securities is likely to be lower than in the \nprevious year, when stronger markets – particularly in the first \nquarter of 2022 – boosted income. \nWith regard to both net interest income and net commission \nincome in the PSBC segment, mBank is expected to contribute at \nthe same level as in the previous year. \nOverall, we expect net income in the PSBC segment to be \nsignificantly higher than in the previous year, on the assumption \nthat the high one-time charges at mBank in Poland resulting from \nthe credit holidays and from provisions for legal risks in \nconnection with mortgage loans issued in foreign currencies will \nnot recur in the current year. \n \n \nTarget 2023: Significant growth in both the \noperating result\nand the consolidated result"

      "text": "104 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nOperating expenses in the PSBC segment, including mandatory \nlevies, are expected to be at the same level in 2023 as in 2022. \nWhile lower costs are expected for Germany owing to the \nadvanced progress of the headcount reductions, the planning for \nmBank foresees higher costs in the current year because of \ninflation. \nDespite expecting a higher charge for the risk result in the \nPSBC segment than in the previous year, we expect operating \nprofit to increase year on year due to rising income. As such, the \noperating return on equity should increase significantly and the \ncost-income ratio in the PSBC segment should fall. \nCorporate Clients \nIn the Corporate Clients (CC) segment, too, the focus in the \ncurrent year will be on intensifying customer business. The \noverriding priority is to generate further earnings potential by \nproviding effective support for German SMEs in their business \nactivities. In so doing, Commerzbank is responding to altered \nglobal trade flows and will ensure that it supports its customers \nalong \nthe \nrelevant \ntrade \ncorridors. \nFor \nsmaller \nSMEs, \nCommerzbank has established “Mittelstandsbank Direkt”, which is \nalready providing high-quality direct banking services for 6,000 \ncustomers nationwide from its Hamburg location. This model will \nbe further expanded in the current year and is set to be opened up \nto new external customers in the second half of the year. \nCommerzbank will continue its efforts to improve the return on \ncapital employed in the CC segment in 2023. \nCommerzbank is expecting a further significant increase in net \ninterest income in the CC segment due to higher market interest \nrates, which allow corporate client deposits to be reinvested at \nhigher margins than in the past. \nNet commission income is also expected to be slightly higher \nthan in the previous year. In addition to hedging transactions, such \nas those carried out in connection with foreign currency \ntransactions, cash management is also a driver of this increase. \nAs the quality of forecasting for all other income items in the \nCorporate Clients segment is subject to a high degree of \nuncertainty, the possibility that other income will not reach the \n2022 level cannot be ruled out. Overall, therefore, the possibility \nthat total income in the segment will be lower than in the previous \nyear cannot be ruled out either. \nIn terms of operating expenses, Commerzbank expects costs in \nthe Corporate Clients segment to be lower than in 2022. This will \nbe driven by the advanced progress of the headcount reductions in \nthe segment and in the back office units, which will then have a \npositive impact on the segment through lower cost allocations.  \nWe are expecting slightly lower charges for the risk result in \nthe Corporate Clients segment compared with the previous year. \nThis is based on the assumption that the economic slowdown will \nonly lead to a mild recession in Germany and that the expected \nnegative effects have already been partially anticipated through \nthe TLA in place at the end of 2022. \nIn summary, without the additional potential from higher \nforward interest rates materialising, we are expecting a slightly \nhigher operating profit for the Corporate Clients segment in 2023. \nThe operating return on equity should therefore remain stable with \nslightly higher risk-weighted assets, while there is likely to be a \nslight improvement in the cost-income ratio. \nGeneral statement on the outlook for the Group \nFor the 2023 financial year, Commerzbank expects to significantly \nexceed both the operating profit of the previous year and the \nconsolidated profit attributable to Commerzbank shareholders and \ninvestors in additional equity components. The main reasons for \nthe expected increase are higher net interest income, the \nelimination of high one-time charges at mBank in Poland and \nlower \noperating \nexpenses \nin \nthe \nGroup. \nAccordingly, \nCommerzbank is expecting a further increase in the net return on \ntangible equity towards the target of more than 7.3% in 2024.  \nCommerzbank’s target for its Common Equity Tier 1 capital \nratio is based in part on the capital requirements resulting from \nthe Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). This \nminimum requirement culminates in the MDA threshold, which is \napproximately 10.1% for the first quarter of 2023. This compares \nwith a CET1 ratio of 14.1% at year-end 2022. Commerzbank thus \nhas a significant capital buffer above the regulatory minimum \nrequirements. Commerzbank is still expecting a CET1 ratio of \naround 14% for 2023. This target already takes into account a \nplanned distribution of 50% of net income after deduction of fully \ndiscretionary AT1 coupons for the 2023 financial year.  \nThere are numerous risk factors that could nonetheless affect \nthe 2023 profit forecast to a considerable, though not reliably \nquantifiable extent, should events take an unfavourable turn. \nThese still include high global economic risks. \nGeopolitical risks such as the Russia-Ukraine war, which could \nsignificantly accelerate existing inflationary trends through the \nmassive increase in raw material prices, also have the potential to \nweaken the expected economic recovery and thus have an impact \non our business performance. Moreover, trade disputes triggered \nby political tensions between the economic blocs of Europe, North \nAmerica and Asia remain possible."

The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is responsible for developing \nand implementing the Group’s risk policy guidelines for \nquantifiable risks, laid down by the Board of Managing Directors, \nas well as for measuring these risks. The CRO regularly reports to \nthe Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board’s Risk \nCommittee on the overall risk situation within the Group. \nThe risk management organisation comprises Group Credit Risk \nManagement, Group Risk Control, Group Cyber Risk & Information \nSecurity as well as Group Big Data & Advanced Analytics.  \nThe CRO also has responsibility for Group Compliance.

The Board of Managing Directors \nhas delegated operative risk management to committees. Under the \nrelevant rules of procedure, these are: the Group Credit Committee, \nthe Group Market Risk Committee, the Group OpRisk Committee, \nthe Group Cyber Risk & Information Security Committee and the \nGroup Strategic Risk Committee, which decides on risk issues of an \noverarching nature. The CRO chairs all these committees and has \nthe right of veto. The CRO is also a member of the Group Asset \nLiability Committee. Here the CRO also has a right of veto on certain \ntopics (e.g. liquidity risk issues). \nThe tasks and competencies of the respective committees are \ndescribed below: \nThe Supervisory Board’s Risk Committee is the Bank’s highest \nrisk committee. It comprises at least five Supervisory Board \nmembers. The Risk Committee’s tasks include monitoring the risk \nmanagement system and dealing with risks such as market, credit \nand operational risk, reputational risk and cyber risks (including \ninformation security at the Bank). The Risk Committee determines \nthe type, scope, format and frequency of the information that must \nbe presented to the Board of Managing Directors about strategy and \nrisk. \nThe Group Credit Committee is the decision-making committee \nfor \noperative \ncredit \nrisk \nmanagement, \ncomprising \ntwo \nrepresentatives each from the back office and front office. The \nGroup Credit Committee takes decisions in line with the \ncompetencies delegated to it by the Board of Managing Directors \nand is responsible for managing all credit risks.

In this respect, it acts as the highest \ndecision-making and escalation committee below the Board of \nManaging Directors. The CRISCo addresses all regulatory aspects \nrelevant to cyber and information security issues and ensures \nappropriate risk management in this regard in accordance with \ninternationally recognised standards. \nThe Group Strategic Risk Committee acts as the discussion and \ndecision-making committee for all types of risk, and its main \nobjective is to monitor and manage risks at portfolio level. This \ncovers risk measurement, risk transparency and risk management.  \nThe Group Asset Liability Committee (Group ALCO) is the \nCommerzbank Group committee responsible for the Group-wide \nand integrated management of financial resources, namely capital, \nliquidity and balance sheet structure as well as net interest income, \nin accordance with the regulatory framework. The Group ALCO \nmonitors in particular the Group’s risk-bearing capacity and as such \nplays an important part in the Internal Capital Adequacy \nAssessment Process (ICAAP). The Group ALCO resolves the \nrecovery plan. Resolutions of the Group ALCO are presented to the \nBoard of Managing Directors for confirmation.

It also ensures \nthat the Group risk strategy and the resolutions of the Board of \nManaging Directors are implemented in the risk function.  \nCompliance topics are dealt with in the Global Compliance \nBoard (GCB). The GCB has been established as a forum to share \nupdates on major compliance topics and supervisory actions \nregarding compliance in the Bank. Furthermore, the GCB serves as \ninformation platform for segments and functions about compliance \nculture, changes in compliance regulations, updates of compliance-\nrelated policies and their implications. \nRisk strategy and risk management \n \nThe overall risk strategy, in line with the business strategy, governs \nthe strategic risk focus of the Commerzbank Group. It sets the risk \nappetite as the maximum risk that the Bank is prepared and able to \naccept while following its business objectives without exposing \nitself to existential threats over and above the risks inherent in the \nbusiness. The guiding idea is to ensure that the Group holds \nsufficient liquidity and capital. That also includes ensuring that the \nbusiness strategy can be implemented through a risk profile that is \ncommensurate with the leeway in the Group’s capitalisation as \ndetermined by regulatory and capital market factors. Based on \nthese requirements, suitable limits are defined for the risk resources \nof capital and liquidity available to the Group. The overarching \nlimits of the overall risk strategy are consistent with the indicator \nthresholds of the recovery plan. \nThe core functions of banks as transformers of liquidity and risk \ngive rise to inevitable threats that can in extreme cases endanger \nthe continued existence of the institution. These depend on the \nbank’s particular business model and are accepted in the pursuit of \nbusiness objectives. The basis for Commerzbank’s strategic \nalignment is its business strategy. In the event of a sustained change \nin the assessment of the inherent and existential threats to \nCommerzbank, the Board of Managing Directors may have to adjust \nthe business model and thus the business and risk strategy in the \nmedium and long term. A distinction can be made between the \ntypes of risk accepted on the basis of two fundamental threat \nscenarios. The occurrence of an inherent, existential threat \njeopardises the continued existence of Commerzbank. In this case, \nrescuing Commerzbank would hardly be feasible without state \nmeasures or significant regulatory support measures (e.g. \nprotective guarantees, tolerance of significant deviations from \nregulatory capital requirements, rescue merger) or activation of the \nSingle Resolution Mechanism (SRM).  \nHowever, mitigation strategies are developed to counter these \ninherent existential threats in order as far as possible to reduce the \nprobability of damage or the extent thereof. On the other hand, if a \nthreat materialises that is inherent in the business model but not \nexistential, there is always the possibility of mitigation through, \namong other things, capital measures available on the market or the \nuse of appropriate capital buffers. It is therefore not necessary to \nactivate the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) in this threat \nscenario. For Commerzbank, the existential threats inherent in its \nbusiness model include, for example, the default of Germany, a \ntactical nuclear attack on Frankfurt/Main as Germany’s financial \nnerve centre and Commerzbank’s head office location, the \ndisintegration of the eurozone and a default of one or more of the \nother major European countries or a default of the United States, a \ncollapse of the financial markets in connection with the loss of the \nECB’s basic functionalities or a bank run, a collapse or a massive \nmalfunction in global clearing houses, as well as extreme cyber"

The observable \neffects on value chains and commodity prices show, however, that \nthe effects are also still ongoing and remain difficult to assess. In \ngeneral, the geopolitical risk profile needs to be taken into account \nwhen defining the risk appetite in the sense of a forward-looking \ndetermination of the (country) risk disposition for possible \ngeopolitical crises (e.g. with regard to China). As the digitalisation \nof the business \nenvironment continues to increase and \nCommerzbank undertakes its own digital transformation, cyber risk \nis an inherent threat that must be accepted. Depending on the \nseverity and impact of a cyber attack, cyber risk can also be \nconsidered an existential threat, which is why Commerzbank is \ncontinuously working to improve its cyber resilience. The further \nevolution and possible consequences of mBank’s situation in \nconnection with the Swiss franc residential mortgage loan portfolio \nand with the additional credit holidays granted by the national \nregulator in combination with a default by Poland pose political \nrisks. These may significantly threaten Commerzbank and could \nrequire special mitigating capital market measures.  \nClimate change – also associated with a rapid decline in \nbiodiversity – may pose another inherent threat. Climate change \nmay be reflected in physical and transition risks for Commerzbank. \nThe transition aspects in particular harbour risks (as well as \nopportunities) in the short term that are difficult to assess. \nIdentifying and mitigating this threat to Commerzbank is one of the \nobjectives of risk strategy. Accordingly, Commerzbank has \ndetermined for each type of risk whether environmental risks are a \nkey driver. All risk types that are material in relation to \nenvironmental risks were reflected in risk strategy and management \nin the context of current industry-wide standards, the degree of \nmaturity of the methodology and the availability of data. \nCommerzbank has made substantial progress in this area in recent \nyears. Nevertheless, environmental risk management remains a \nfield of development, which is being expanded by the bank with a \nhigh risk strategic priority. \nWhen pursuing its business targets, the Bank accepts these \nthreats inherent in its business model. It may be necessary to adjust \nthe business model and hence the business and risk strategies in \nthe medium and long term if the Board of Managing Directors’ \nassessment of these threats to Commerzbank changes substantially. \nTo the extent that it is able to do so, Commerzbank makes early \npreparations in anticipation of forthcoming changes in regulatory \nrequirements and accounting standards. Such changes and their \n(retrospective) interpretation may have lasting implications for – \nand even threaten the survival of – Commerzbank’s business model. \nCommerzbank accepts these regulatory risks because there are \nmany cases where there is no option to mitigate or manage them. \nThe overall risk strategy covers all material risks to which \nCommerzbank is exposed. It is updated annually or on an ad hoc \nbasis as required and set out in further detail in the form of sub-risk \nstrategies for the risk types which are material. These are then \nspecified and made operational through policies, regulations and \ninstructions/guidelines. By means of the upstream risk inventory \nprocess, Commerzbank ensures that all risk types of relevance to \nthe Group are identified and their materiality assessed. The \nassessment of the materiality of a risk is based on whether its \noccurrence could have a major direct or indirect impact on the \nBank’s risk-bearing capacity. \nAs part of the planning process, the Board of Managing Directors \ndecides how much of the risk coverage potential of the Group \nshould be utilised. On that basis, individual types of quantifiable risk \ncontributing to the capital requirements are limited in a second \nstage. A capital framework is allocated to the management-relevant \nunits through the planning process. Compliance with limits and \nguidelines is monitored during the year, and management measures \nare put in place where required. In addition, further qualitative and \nquantitative early warning indicators are established in the overall \nrisk strategy. Potential negative developments can be identified at \nan early stage with the help of these indicators. \nOne of the primary tasks of risk management is the avoidance of \nrisk concentrations. These can arise from the synchronous \nmovement of risk positions both within a single risk type (intra-risk \nconcentrations) and across different risk types (inter-risk \nconcentrations). The latter result from common risk drivers or from \ninteractions between different risk drivers of different risk types. \nBy establishing risk management and controlling processes, \nCommerzbank \nprovides \nfor \nthe \nidentification, \nassessment, \nmanagement, monitoring and communication of material risks and \nrelated risk concentrations. This ensures that all Commerzbank-\nspecific risk concentrations are taken into account in its risk \nmanagement.

Management is regularly informed \nabout the results of the analyses so that the potential risk of losses \ncan be avoided in good time. \nThe Group Risk & Capital Monitor is the monthly risk report, \ndesigned for management purposes, on capital, credit risk, market \nrisk, liquidity risk and OpRisk topics within Commerzbank risk \nmanagement. It shows all the above risk types, including economic \nand regulatory risk-bearing capacity, for the Commerzbank Group. \nThe report’s aims include providing the Board of Managing \nDirectors and the Supervisory Board’s Risk Committee with \ntransparent and comprehensive information, highlighting important \ndevelopments from a risk perspective and setting management \nmeasures. The report is also used in particular to monitor limits and \nguidelines within the overall risk strategy. Responsibility for \napproving the overall risk strategy and the Group Risk & Capital \nMonitor lies with the Board of Managing Directors. \nCommerzbank has adopted a code of conduct that defines \nbinding minimum standards for Commerzbank’s corporate \nresponsibility, its dealings with customers, business partners and \ncolleagues, and its day-to-day business. It goes without saying that \nthe Bank complies with relevant laws, regulatory requirements, \nindustry standards and internal rules, and this therefore forms a \nparticularly important part of its risk culture. It actively requires \nemployees to behave appropriately, courageously, with integrity \nand in compliance with rules, and any failure to comply with rules \nis penalised. Expanded procedures ensure that misconduct is \nevaluated in a uniform and fair manner, strengthening consequence \nmanagement on a long-term basis. \nThe main pillar of the Bank’s overall risk management and \nculture is the concept of three lines of defence, which is a core \nelement of the Corporate Charter. Under the three lines of defence \nprinciple, protecting against undesirable risks is an activity that is \nnot restricted to the risk function. Each unit (segment or function) \nforms the first line of defence within its area of operational \nresponsibility and is directly responsible for identifying and \nmanaging risks within it while complying with the prescribed risk \nstandards and policies. For example, the front office forms the first \nline of defence in all business decisions and has to take risk aspects \ninto account in reaching them. The second line of defence for each \ntype of risk lays down standards for appropriate management of \nrisks of that type, monitors this and ensures the application of such \nstandards, and analyses and evaluates the risks. The risk function \nforms the second line of defence against credit and market risks \nassociated with business decisions. Particularly for credit risk, this \nincludes involvement in the credit decision process by means of a \nsecond vote. Units outside the risk function (e.g. Group Finance) \nalso operate as the second line of defence for certain risk types. The \nthird line of defence is Internal Audit. \nRisk ratios \n \nCommerzbank uses a comprehensive system of ratios and \nprocedures for measuring, managing and limiting various types of \nrisk. The most important of these are listed below:  \nEconomically required capital is the amount, corresponding to \na high confidence level (currently 99.90% at Commerzbank), that \nwill cover unexpected losses arising from risk positions.  \nThe risk-bearing capacity ratio (RBC ratio) indicates the excess \ncoverage of the economically required capital by the risk coverage \npotential. Risk-bearing capacity is deemed to be assured as long as \nthe RBC ratio is higher than 100%. \nExposure at default (EaD) is the expected exposure amount \ntaking into account a potential (partial) drawing of open lines and \ncontingent liabilities that will adversely affect risk-bearing capacity \nin the event of default. EaD is hereinafter also referred to as \n“exposure”. \nExpected loss (EL) measures the potential loss on a loan \nportfolio that can be expected within one year on the basis of \nhistorical loss data. \nRisk density is the ratio of expected loss to exposure at default \nand thus represents the relative risk content of an exposure or a \nportfolio.  \nValue at risk (VaR) is a methodology for quantifying risk. It \ninvolves setting a holding period (such as one day) and a confidence \nlevel (such as 97.5%). The VaR value then denotes the relevant loss \nthreshold that will not be exceeded within the holding period with \na probability in line with the confidence level. \nCredit value at risk (CVaR) is the economic capital requirement \nfor credit risk with a confidence level of 99.90%. The term results \nfrom the application of the value at risk concept to credit risk \nmeasurement. Credit VaR is an estimate of the amount by which \nlosses from credit risks could potentially exceed the expected loss \nwithin a single year, i.e. unexpected loss. The idea behind this \napproach is that expected loss simply represents the long-term \naverage of lending losses, but this may vary (positively or negatively) \nfrom actual credit losses for the current financial year."

The purpose is to ensure \nthat sufficient capital is held at all times. The risk-bearing capacity \nconcept is reviewed and optimised annually. \nWhen determining the economically required capital, allowance \nis made for potential unexpected fluctuations in value. Where such \nfluctuations exceed forecasts, they must be covered by the available \neconomic capital to absorb unexpected losses (risk coverage \npotential). Only the economic value of equity components that \nabsorb losses in the going concern approach is taken into account \nin determining the economic risk coverage potential. \nThe capital requirement for the risks taken is quantified using \nthe internal economic capital model. All risk types of the \nCommerzbank Group classified as significant and quantifiable \nwithin the annual risk inventory are taken into account when \ndetermining the economically required capital. The economic risk \napproach therefore also comprises risk types that are not included \nin the regulatory requirements for banks’ capital adequacy. The \nmodel also reflects diversification effects incorporating all types of \nrisk. The confidence level for the calculation of economically \nrequired capital is 99.90% and is harmonised with the going \nconcern approach. The quantifiable significant risks in the \neconomic capital model are divided into default risk, market risk, \noperational risk and (not separately disclosed in the following table) \nbusiness risk and property value change risk. Furthermore, reserve \nrisk is included in the risk-bearing capacity calculation by means of \na corresponding risk buffer. Business risk is the risk of a potential \nloss resulting from deviations in actual income and expense from \nthe respective budgeted figures. Business risk is used to \nsubstantiate a higher-level management buffer that ensures the \nresponsiveness of capital management. Physical asset risk is the \nrisk of an unexpected fall in the value of owned property which is \neither already recognised as an asset in the Group’s balance sheet \nor which can be recognised during the next 12 months under \ncontractually assured obligations with option character (especially \nreal estate). Climate and environmental risks are defined as \nhorizontal risks within Commerzbank that are manifested in \nexisting risk categories, with both transition and physical risks \nbeing considered. The annual materiality assessment of climate and \nenvironmental risks provides a holistic overview of the impact on \nexisting material risk types identified in the risk inventory. Climate \nand environmental risks are reflected in Commerzbank’s risk-\nbearing capacity analysis through a risk buffer for default and \nmarket risks that are materially influenced by climate and \nenvironmental \nrisks. \nFurther \ninformation \non \nclimate \nand \nenvironmental risks can be found in the “Environmental, social and \ngovernance (ESG) risks” section on page 144 ff. \nThe results of the risk-bearing capacity analysis are shown using \nthe risk-bearing capacity ratio (RBC ratio), indicating the excess of \nthe risk coverage potential in relation to the economically required \ncapital. Risk-bearing capacity is monitored and managed monthly \nat Group level. Risk-bearing capacity is deemed to be assured as \nlong as the RBC ratio is higher than 100%. In 2022, the RBC ratio \nwas consistently above 100% and stood at 160% as at 31 Decem-\nber 2022. The increase in economically required capital compared \nto December 2021 is mainly due to higher market and operational \nrisks. The increase in market risk reflects the heightened market \nvolatility resulting from the war between Russia and Ukraine. The \nmain drivers for the sharp increase in operational risk are changes \nin the Swiss franc complex, the inclusion of further risks in \nconnection with the issue of consumer protection and the first-time \ninclusion of inflation in loss data. The decrease in credit risk is \nmainly explained by the annual update of the parameters in the \ncredit risk model. The RBC ratio is still well above the minimum \nrequirement."

The underlying scenarios take into account \nthe interdependence of the development of the real economy and \nthe financial economy. They are updated quarterly and approved by \nthe Group ALCO. The scenarios describe an extraordinary but \nplausible adverse development in the economy, focusing in \nparticular on portfolio priorities (e.g. export-based sectors in \nGermany) and business strategies of relevance to Commerzbank. \nCurrent adverse developments (e.g. rising energy costs) are also \ntaken into account when creating the scenarios. Stress tests in the \neconomic perspective cover a time horizon of 12 months. The \nscenario simulation is run quarterly at Group level using the input \nparameters of the economic capital requirements calculation for all \nmaterial and quantifiable risk types. In addition to the capital \nrequired, the income statement is also subjected to a stress test \nbased on the macroeconomic scenarios. Based on this, changes in \nthe risk coverage potential are simulated. Whereas the RBC ratio is \nembedded into Commerzbank’s limit system, guidelines for risk-\nbearing capacity are set as an early warning system in the stressed \nenvironment. The ongoing monitoring of the limits and guidelines \nis a key part of internal reporting. Defined escalations are triggered \nif the limits are breached. \nThe risk-bearing capacity and stress testing concept is subject \nto an annual internal review and is refined on an ongoing basis. The \ndevelopment of the regulatory environment is also taken into \naccount. In addition to the regular stress tests, reverse stress tests \nare implemented annually at Group level. Unlike regular stress \ntesting, the result of the simulation – a sustained threat to the \nBank – is determined in advance. The aim of the analysis process in \nthe reverse stress test is to improve the transparency of Bank-\nspecific risk potential and interactions of risk by identifying and \nassessing extreme scenarios and events. On this basis, for instance, \naction fields in risk management including the regular stress tests \ncan be identified and taken into account in the ongoing \ndevelopment efforts. In 2022 Commerzbank participated in the ECB \nclimate risk stress test. In addition to a qualitative analysis of the \nstatus of the internal climate risk stress test framework, both \ntransition and physical climate risk factors were analysed in relation \nto counterparty and market risks on a scenario basis. In addition, \nCommerzbank conducted an internal reverse climate stress test for \nthe first time as a strategic analysis of its own net zero targets for \nspecific portfolios. \nIn 2022 the risk-weighted assets resulting from Commerzbank’s \nbusiness activities decreased from €175bn to €169bn.  \nThe table below gives an overview of the distribution of risk-\nweighted assets, broken down by segment and risk type: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n31.12.2022 \n31.12.2021 \nRisk-weighted assets \n€bn \nDefault \nrisk \nMarket \nrisk \nOperatio-\nnal risk \nTotal \nDefault \nrisk \nMarket \nrisk \nOperatio-\nnal risk \nTotal \nPrivate and Small-Business \nCustomers \n40 \n1 \n13 \n54 \n42 \n1 \n10 \n53 \nCorporate Clients \n73 \n4 \n5 \n82 \n70 \n6 \n5 \n81 \nOthers and Consolidation \n28 \n2 \n3 \n34 \n33 \n3 \n5 \n41 \nGroup  \n140 \n7 \n21 \n169 \n145 \n10 \n20 \n175 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe global economy lost considerable momentum in 2022. \nAlthough \nthe \ncoronavirus \nsituation \neased \nnoticeably \nand \ncoronavirus restrictions were largely lifted in most economies, \nRussia’s war against Ukraine triggered new shock waves.

Since 1 January 2014, the associated Capital \nRequirements Regulation and Directive (CRR and CRD) have been \nin force as the European implementation of Basel 3, with some of \nthe rollout taking place in stages up to 2019 (“phase-in”). Numerous \nsupplementary regulations have since been published, in particular \nby the European Banking Authority (EBA), and these are now \nprogressively entering into force; this will continue in the years to \ncome.  \nWith Basel 4 (“finalisation of Basel 3”), the next banking regula-\ntion package is currently being agreed in Europe. The entry into \nforce of the corresponding CRR III and CRD VI is currently planned \nfor 1 January 2025. \nCommerzbank has analysed the effects of the increase in the \ncountercyclical capital buffer in Germany, which will take effect \nfrom February 2023, and other currently foreseeable changes in the \ncountercyclical capital buffer, as well as the introduction of a \nsectoral systemic risk buffer in Germany on loans secured by \nresidential real estate, and reflects them in its internal capital \nplanning. \nFurther information on the countercyclical capital buffer can be \nfound in the outlook and opportunities report in the Group \nmanagement report. \nThe ECB, in its capacity as the supervisory authority for the \neurozone banks directly supervised by it, conducted the annual \nSupervisory \nReview \nand \nEvaluation \nProcess \n(SREP). \nOn \n21 December 2022, in its final SREP decision for 2022, the ECB \ninformed Commerzbank of the results of the SREP and the \nassociated supervisory requirements. It did not change the bank-\nspecific capital requirements for the Commerzbank Group, “P2R” \nand “P2G”, set for 2023. With effect from 1 January 2023 the SREP \ndecision replaces the previous SREP decision. \nIn 2022, the ECB progressed with the establishment of environ-\nmental risk management by supervised SSM banks through both a \nthematic review and a comprehensive ECB supervisory climate \nstress test. Commerzbank participated in both ECB initiatives with \ngreat success, especially in comparison with its peers. The ECB \nexpects full compliance with the requirements set out in its “Guide \non climate-related and environmental risks” by the end of 2024. \nThe EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive has been in \nforce since mid-2014. Responsibility for the drafting of resolution \nplans and the resolution of at-risk banks supervised by the ECB was \ntransferred to the Single Resolution Board (SRB) in Brussels with \neffect from 1 January 2016. At the same time, eurozone banks \nstarted to fund the Single Resolution Fund. The SRB defines the \nformal minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities \n(MREL) for the banks under its responsibility on a consolidated and \nindividual basis.  \nThe legal basis for setting the Minimum Requirement for Own \nFunds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) and Total Loss-Absorbing \nCapacity (TLAC) was revised at European level and published on \n7 June 2019 as part of the Risk Reduction Package in the form of \nthe Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR II), the Bank \nRecovery and Resolution Directive II (BRRD II) and the CRR II. The \nBRRD II as a European directive requires implementation into \nnational law within 18 months. The amendments included, among \nother things, adjustments to the calculation logic and, for certain \nbanks, a statutory subordination requirement for parts of MREL. \nMost of the new provisions came into force in December 2020. \nThe Group-wide recovery plan was updated in the fourth quarter \nof 2022 to reflect the regulatory requirements. The recovery plan \ndescribes in detail for instance the courses of action and recovery \npotential available to the Bank in the event of a crisis and which \nspecific recovery measures, in various stress scenarios, will enable \nthe Bank to complete its recovery.  \nCommerzbank operates in markets subject to national and \nsupranational regulation. In addition, it is subject to the overarching \nrequirements imposed by accounting standards. Changes in \nregulatory \nrequirements \nand \naccounting \nstandards \nhave \nsignificantly grown in frequency and materiality in recent years. \nThey may have lasting implications for the financial industry in \ngeneral and Commerzbank’s business model in particular. \nCommerzbank continues to participate actively and at an early stage \nin the consultation processes aimed at preparing for the constant \nchanges in the operating environment. It also monitors and \nevaluates current developments as regards future regulatory \nprojects. Specific examples of these at global level are the final \nstandards for revising capital requirements for market risk now \npublished by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and the \nrevision of the framework for operational risk and credit risk, \nincluding the associated floor rules and disclosure requirements \n(“Basel 4”).

It is a quantifiable \nmaterial risk and includes the sub-risk types of credit default risk, \nissuer risk, counterparty risk, country and transfer risk, dilution risk \nand reserve risk. \nStrategy and organisation \n \nThe credit risk strategy is the sub-risk strategy for default risks and \nis derived from the overall risk strategy. It is embedded in the ICAAP \nprocess of the Commerzbank Group and forms a link between the \nBank’s overall risk management across all risk types and the \noperationalisation of default risk management. The overriding aim \nis to ensure the adequate quality of the credit portfolio. To this end, \nthe credit risk strategy defines the credit risk tolerance, specifies \nrisk strategy priorities, provides an overview of the material credit \nrisk management concepts and thereby plays an integral part in \nmaintaining the Group’s risk-bearing capacity. The credit risk \nstrategy makes use of quantitative and qualitative management \ntools that give decision-makers clear guidance on both portfolio \nmanagement and decisions in specific cases. \nCredit risk management is a joint task of the front office and the \nrisk function, based on a standardised Group-wide credit risk \nculture. Impeccable moral and ethical conduct in compliance with \nthe law and regulations is a key element of a culture of integrity and \ncore to the credit risk culture. Default risks are assessed against \nuniform standards, regardless of segment limits. In line with the \nthree lines of defence principle, the front office is the first line of \ndefence and must take risk aspects into account when taking \nbusiness decisions. The risk function (back office and Risk \nControlling) is the second line of defence, its fundamental task \nbeing to manage, limit and monitor risks. The third line of defence \nis Internal Audit. It is tasked with independently auditing the Bank’s \nprocesses and safeguards, and as such also assesses the activities \nof the first and second lines of defence. \nThe Group Credit Committee is the highest decision-making \ncommittee for operative credit risk management, comprising two \nrepresentatives each from the back office and front office. It takes \ndecisions in line with the competencies delegated to it by the Board \nof Managing Directors and is responsible for managing all credit \nrisks. In so doing, the Group Credit Committee operates on the basis \nof the valid credit risk strategy. Reporting to the Group Credit \nCommittee are sub-credit committees, which operate on the basis \nof their respective rules of procedure and within the competencies \napproved by the Board of Managing Directors. They comprise at \nleast \ntwo \nrepresentatives \nfrom \nthe \nsegments \nand \ntwo \nrepresentatives from Group Risk Management. The sub-credit \ncommittees are responsible for managing all credit risks in the sub-\nportfolios within their respective remit and are entitled, in turn, to \nsub-delegate certain credit decisions within their prescribed \ncompetencies.  \nDiscrete back-office areas are responsible for operational credit \nrisk management at portfolio level and on a case-by-case basis. The \nresponsibilities are separated between the performing loan area on \nthe one hand and Intensive Care on the other. All credit decisions \nin the performing loan area are risk/return decisions. The front and \nback office take joint responsibility for risk and return from an \nexposure, with the front office having primary responsibility for the \nreturn, and the back office for the risk. Accordingly, neither office \ncan be overruled in its primary responsibility in the credit decision \nprocess.  \nHigher-risk customers are handled by specialist Intensive Care \nareas. The customers are moved to these areas as soon as they meet \ndefined criteria for assignment or mandatory transfer. The principal \nreasons for assignment to Intensive Care areas are criteria relating \nto number of days overdrawn, together with event-related criteria \nsuch as rating, third-party enforcement measures or credit fraud. \nThe Intensive Care function decides on further action based on the \ncircumstances of individual cases. Customers must be transferred \nto Intensive Care if they are in default (for example due to \ninsolvency). This graduated approach ensures that higher-risk \ncustomers can continue to be managed promptly by specialists in a \nmanner appropriate to the risks involved and in defined \nstandardised processes. \nRisk management \n \nCommerzbank manages default risk using a comprehensive risk \nmanagement system. The management framework comprises an \norganisational structure, methods and models, quantitative and \nqualitative management tools and regulations and processes. The \nrisk management system ensures that the entire portfolio and the \nsub-portfolios, right down to individual exposure level, are \nmanaged consistently and thoroughly on a top-down basis. \nThe ratios and measures required for the operational process of \nrisk management are based on the overarching Group objectives. \nThe principle of seeking a low-risk profile in all business decisions \nis closely combined here with the risk function’s aim of providing \nthe front office with appropriate support. Preference is given to \ntransactions and products with a low level of complexity. Another \nfocus is on the responsiveness of a credit line or exposure.  \nQuantitative credit risk strategy guidelines limit risks with regard \nto poorer credit ratings and exposures with high loss-at-default \ncontributions (concentration management) and for selected sub-\nportfolios with a high risk weight or regulatory importance, and, as \napplicable, for individual products with a high portfolio share. \nDefault risk"

      "text": "118 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nDetailed arrangements for operationalising the guidelines for \nselected sub-portfolios are set out in separate portfolio policies. In \naddition, qualitative management guidelines in the form of credit \npolicies define the target business of the Bank. At the level of \nindividual transactions, they regulate the transaction type for which \nthe available risk resources are to be used. These credit policies are \nfirmly embedded in the credit process: transactions which do not \nmeet the requirements are escalated through a fixed competence \nregulation. \nGroup-wide guiding principles are based on risk-oriented \nanalyses of trends (e.g. of the development of weaker credit ratings \nover time) combined with an assessment of external framework \nconditions and internal rules. Risk-oriented analyses on key dates \n(e.g. rating profile of individual asset classes) are used in particular \nto derive portfolio guiding principles. Trend analyses of product-\nspecific risk drivers are key factors for determining product guiding \nprinciples (e.g. loan-to-value of mortgage lending). In contrast, \ncredit and portfolio policies are primarily produced through a multi-\nlevel coordination process involving the product and portfolio \nmanagers from the front and back offices, combined with an \nassessment of internal and external information sources. \nTo monitor compliance with credit risk strategic rules, \ncontinuous monitoring and reporting has also been set up at whole \nGroup level and at segment or sub-portfolio level. Asset quality \nreviews by the risk function make an important contribution here to \nquality assurance and early risk detection. The focal points of the \nmonitoring vary depending on the issue and target group. Ad hoc \nreporting processes have been established. In addition, crisis events \nmay pose a risk to the Bank’s capital and liquidity adequacy and \nthereby to its risk-bearing capacity. In a crisis, the Risk Mitigation \nTask Force will manage decisions flexibly in a coordinated, Group-\nwide process. For example, in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war \nthe Task Force was established at the beginning of 2022 in order to \nidentify effects on the Group portfolio as quickly as possible and to \nbe able to take countermeasures. As part of the process, emergency \naction plans ensure that risk-mitigation measures are implemented \nquickly and efficiently.  \nThe avoidance of risk concentrations is a core strategy of risk \nmanagement. Risk concentrations are actively managed in order to \nidentify at an early stage and contain the increased potential for loss \nfrom the synchronous movement of risk positions. In addition to \nexposure-related credit risk concentrations (bulk risks), default risk \nalso includes country and sector concentrations. Segment-specific \nfeatures are taken into account here. \nManagement and the Supervisory Board’s Risk Committee are \nregularly informed about the results of the analyses."

To this end, all \nrelevant risk types in the overall risk strategy for economic risk \ncapital are given limits on a Group-wide basis, with, in particular, a \nCVaR limit being specified. Due to the systematically restricted \noptions for reducing default risk on a short-term basis, it is \nimportant to take account of expected trends (medium-term and \nlong-term) in order to manage credit risk. For this reason, forecast \nvalues of credit risk parameters play a key role in ongoing \nmanagement. At segment and business area level, changes to \nforecasts are monitored and adjustments made when necessary. \nThere is no cascaded capital limit concept for credit risk below \nGroup level. \nRating classification \nThe Commerzbank rating method comprises 25 rating classes for \ncustomers not in default (1.0 to 5.8) and 5 default classes (6.1 to \n6.5). The Commerzbank master scale allocates precisely one rating \nclass, stable over time, to each probability of default. The rating \nmethods are validated annually and recalibrated where necessary \nso that they reflect the latest assessment based on all actual \nobserved defaults.  \nThe probability of default ranges assigned to the ratings are the \nsame for all portfolios. This ensures internal comparability \nconsistent with the master scale method. For guidance and \nindicative purposes, the Commerzbank master scale also shows \nexternal ratings as well as credit quality steps in accordance with \nArticle 136 CRR. However, a direct reconciliation is not possible, \nbecause external ratings of different portfolios show fluctuating \ndefault rates from year to year.  \nIn lending decisions, which are based among other things on the \nrating result, the credit approval authorities of both individual staff \nand the committees (Board of Managing Directors, Credit \nCommittee, sub-credit committees) are graduated by a range of \nfactors including size of exposure and rating class."

The coronavirus TLA of €–523m was \ntherefore fully reversed in the second quarter of 2022.  \nEconomic uncertainty and the consequences of the Russian \ninvasion of Ukraine are still weighing heavily on the macroeconomic \noutlook. The model-based parameters used to establish loan loss \nprovisions do not yet fully reflect these effects. The secondary \neffects TLA booked in this regard in the second quarter was \nreviewed during the year at the quarterly reporting dates and \ncontinues to reflect adequately the anticipated effects. The scenario \non which the TLA is based includes the following assumptions: \n• Problems in supply chains and in the provision of raw materials \ncontinue to hamper industrial production and lead to rising \nprocurement prices (for paper, wood, metals, oil, etc.). \n• The US Federal Reserve’s sharp interest rate hikes will lead to a \ndecline in growth in early 2023. \n• Although the Chinese government has eased its zero-Covid \npolicy, growth remains below pre-pandemic levels because of \nthe issues in the real estate sector and the high level of corporate \ndebt. \n• In Europe, the high cost of energy due to the war has a \nsignificant negative impact on GDP growth and continues to \ndrive inflation. \n• The German economy is burdened by rising inflation, shrinking \nexport markets and the higher interest rate environment, while \nextensive state support programmes somewhat lessen the \nimpact of higher energy costs. \n• Rising consumer price inflation further increases consumer \nrestraint across the eurozone or triggers a wage-price spiral. If \ncost increases can only be passed on to a limited extent, this will \nweigh heavily on corporate earnings. \n \nAs at 31 December 2022, the total for the TLA for secondary \neffects stood at €–482m. The adequacy of the TLA is continually \nreviewed. (Details on the background to and adjustment of the TLA \ncan also be found in Note 31 of the Group financial statements \n(Credit risks and credit losses)).  \nFurther drivers of the risk result in the reporting period are \naddressed in the following explanatory notes on the segments.  \nIn the pessimistic scenario described in Note 31 of the Group \nfinancial statements (Credit risks and credit losses), Commerzbank, \nin addition to its current process for calculating its loan loss \nprovisions, simulates the potential impact of deteriorating \ncreditworthiness that could occur if the gas supply is rationed due \nto a material shortage in the supply of Russian gas (compared to \n31 December 2022) along with the simultaneous assumption of \ndirect or indirect government support measures to support any \nhouseholds and businesses impacted. The analysis shows an \nincreased need for loan loss provisions in the amount of \napproximately €–600m in the event that this scenario, contrary to \ncurrent expectations, should come to pass.  \nDefault portfolio \nThe Group’s default portfolio increased by €1,502m in 2022 and \nstood at €5,658m as at the end of the year. The additions in 2022 \nmainly comprised additions of individual exposures to the default \nportfolio as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the \nCorporate Clients segment and in the Others and Consolidation \nsegment. \nThe following breakdown of the default portfolio shows the \nclaims in the default portfolio in the amortised cost and fair value \nOCI (other comprehensive income) categories. The loans are almost \nexclusively assigned to the amortised cost category, of which by far \nthe greatest share of €5.4bn (31 December 2021: €3.9bn) relates to \nthe loans and receivables class and €249m (31 December 2021: \n€244m) to off-balance-sheet transactions. As at 31 December 2022, \nthe volume of defaulted securities that can be assigned to the debt \nsecurities class was €0m (31 December 2021: €3m fair value OCI \ncategory). The collateral shown is liable to the full extent for loans \nin the amortised cost category, with €1,373m (31 December 2021: \n€1,087m) relating to loans and receivables and €16m (31 December \n2021: €27m) to off-balance-sheet transactions. \nAs at 31 December 2022 there was €57m default volume to be  \nreported for credit transactions in the fair value OCI category \n(31 December 2021: €0m)."

The positions shown are already contained in full in the \nGroup and segment presentations above. \n \nCorporates portfolio by sector \nOn the whole, the German industrial sectors coped well with the \nstrains of the coronavirus pandemic and the immediate effects of \nthe Russian war of aggression on Ukraine, assisted by government \nlending and support programmes. However, the recovery is patchy \nand not all sectors have returned to pre-pandemic levels of revenue \nand income.  \nAt present, the indirect consequences of the war in Ukraine, in \nparticular higher prices, continue to have a negative impact. Energy \nand raw material prices have risen significantly, while inflation has \nreached a level that few would have expected. As a result, an \nappreciable increase in interest rates has also been recorded. With \ncontinuing robust demand and incipient catch-up effects as a result \nof the easing in supply chain issues, companies are mostly able to \npass on the increased costs to a broad extent. However, disposable \nhousehold income will shrink, depending partly on wage growth \nand energy prices, and this will dampen demand, with \ncorresponding effects on corporate earnings.  \nInvestments in environmental protection and CO2-neutral \nproduction will require considerable capital expenditure. Reducing \ndependencies and ensuring a stable supply chain will also create a \ncost burden. However, we regard our clients as being broadly well \npositioned in these respects. \nA key factor for the medium-term performance of the German \neconomy will be the stabilisation of energy prices in Germany and \nEurope and the establishment of a competitive price level in \nGermany in particular. Furthermore, it must be ensured that the \ncountry’s gas requirements are met. A shortage of gas supplies \ncould have a considerable impact and bring major upheaval. The \ncoronavirus has become widespread in China, and supply chain \ndisruptions could result. Potential mutations would again pose great \nchallenges to the world. \nA breakdown of the corporates exposure by sector is shown \nbelow: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n31.12.20221 \n31.12.2021 \nCorporates portfolio by sector \n \nExposure  \nat default \n€bn \nExpected  \nloss \n€m \nRisk  \ndensity \nbp \nExposure  \nat default \n€bn \nExpected  \nloss \n€m \nRisk  \ndensity \nbp \nConsumption \n14 \n39 \n27 \n16 \n38 \n24 \nTechnology/Electrical industry \n14 \n29 \n20 \n15 \n27 \n18 \nWholesale \n12 \n28 \n24 \n13 \n37 \n27 \nEnergy supply/Waste management \n12 \n28 \n24 \n22 \n51 \n23 \nAutomotive \n10 \n24 \n25 \n10 \n30 \n30 \nTransport/Tourism \n9 \n27 \n30 \n13 \n46 \n37 \nBasic materials/Metals \n8 \n15 \n18 \n10 \n25 \n24 \nServices/Media \n8 \n17 \n21 \n10 \n28 \n28 \nChemicals/Plastics \n8 \n19 \n23 \n8 \n26 \n31 \nMechanical engineering \n8 \n15 \n20 \n7 \n19 \n25 \nConstruction \n4 \n8 \n18 \n5 \n12 \n22 \nPharma/Healthcare \n4 \n8 \n20 \n6 \n25 \n42 \nOther \n30 \n78 \n26 \n5 \n3 \n6 \nTotal \n142 \n335 \n24 \n141 \n367 \n26 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 The definition of the sectors was adjusted in January 2022, and the figures as at 31 December 2022 are therefore only to a limited extent comparable to those as at 31 December 2021. \n \nFinancial Institutions portfolio \nOur network of correspondent banks continued to focus on trade \nfinance activities on behalf of our corporate customers and on \ncapital market activities.

As at \nthe reporting date 31 December 2022, risk exposures with a value \nof €8.8bn were retained (31 December 2021: €9.8bn). By far the \nlargest share of all positions was accounted for by €8.7bn \n(31 December 2021: €9.6bn) on senior tranches, which are almost \nentirely rated good to very good.

In this context, Commerzbank acts mainly as an \narranger \nof \nasset-backed \nsecurities \ntransactions \nvia \nthe \nCommerzbank-sponsored multi-seller conduit Silver Tower. The \nvolume and risk values for the securitisation of receivables in the \nCorporate Clients segment were stable at €3.9bn in 2022. \nLiquidity risk subsumes the risk that Commerzbank will be \nunable to meet its payment obligations on a day-to-day basis. \nLiquidity risks from securitisations are modelled in the internal \nliquidity risk model on a risk-adjusted basis. In the case of \ntransactions subject to variable utilisation, it is assumed that the \npurchase facilities provided to the special-purpose companies must \nbe refinanced almost in full by Commerzbank for the duration of \ntheir term and until the maturity of the last financed receivable. \nSecuritisations only qualify as liquid assets if they are eligible for \nrediscount at the European Central Bank. These positions are only \nincluded in the liquidity risk calculation after risk-adjusted \ndiscounts are applied. \nThe other asset-backed exposures mainly comprise government-\nguaranteed asset-backed securities (ABS) held by Commerzbank \nFinance & Covered Bond S.A. and Commerzbank AG in Germany. \nIn 2022 the volume declined to €3.4bn (December 2021: €3.9bn), \nas did the risk values1 at €3.4bn (December 2021: €3.9bn). \nThere are also investments in the Structured Credit area. The \nvolume of new investments entered into since 2014 stood at €7.1bn \n(December 2021: €6.9bn). We have invested in bonds of senior \ntranches of securitisation transactions in the consumer (auto) ABS, \nUK RMBS and CLO asset classes, which have a robust structure and \na moderate risk profile. At 31 December 2022, this portfolio solely \ncontained AAA-rated CLO positions (also the case at the end of \n2021). Remaining structured credit positions with a volume of \n€0.2bn were already in the portfolio prior to 2014 (December 2021: \n€0.2bn), while risk values stood at €0.1bn (December 2021: €0.2bn). \nForbearance portfolio \nThe EBA’s definition of forbearance comprises two requirements, \nwhich have to be met concurrently: the debtor is in financial \ndifficulties and the measures of the bank to help the debtor include \nconcessions to the debtor that the bank would not have agreed to \nunder different circumstances. Examples of concessions include \ndeferrals, increases in limits or loans and waivers in connection with \nrestructuring. The definition of forbearance applies independently \nof whether the debtor is in the performing or the non-performing \nportfolio. \n \n \n \n1 Risk value is the balance sheet value of cash instruments. For long CDS positions, it \ncomprises the nominal value of the reference instrument less the net present value of \nthe credit derivative."

      "text": "132 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nMarket risk is the risk of potential financial losses due to changes in \nmarket prices (interest rates, commodities, credit spreads, \nexchange rates and equity prices) or in parameters that affect prices \nsuch as volatilities and correlations. Losses may impact profit or loss \ndirectly, e.g. in the case of trading book positions. However, for \nbanking book positions they are reflected generally in the \nrevaluation reserve or in hidden liabilities/reserves. \nStrategy and organisation \n \nCommerzbank’s market risk strategy is derived from its overall risk \nstrategy and the business strategies of the individual segments. It \nsets targets for market risk management in relation to \nCommerzbank’s main business activities. The core market risk \nmanagement tasks are the identification of all material market risks \nand drivers of market risk and the independent measurement and \nevaluation of these. The results and estimates serve as the basis for \nrisk/return-oriented management. \nThe Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank is \nresponsible for ensuring the effective management of market risk \nthroughout the Commerzbank Group. Specific levels of authority \nand responsibility in relation to market risk management have been \nassigned to the appropriate market risk committee. \nIn the Group Market Risk Committee, segment representatives, \nalong with representatives from the risk function and finance area, \ndiscuss current risk positioning issues and decide on appropriate \naction. Chaired by the risk function, the Group Market Risk \nCommittee, which meets monthly, deals with the Commerzbank \nGroup’s market risk position. Discussions centre on the monthly \nmarket risk report, which is also presented to the Board of \nManaging Directors for their consideration. The report summarises \nthe latest developments on financial markets, the Bank’s positioning \nand related risk ratios.  \nThe risk management process involves the identification, \nmeasurement, management and monitoring of risks and reporting \non them. It is the responsibility in functional terms of market risk \nmanagement, which is independent of trading activities. Central \nmarket risk management is complemented by decentralised market \nrisk management units at segment level and for regional units and \nsubsidiaries. The close integration of central and local risk \nmanagement with the business units means that the risk \nmanagement process starts in the trading areas themselves. The \ntrading units are responsible in particular for the active \nmanagement of market risk positions, e.g. reduction measures or \nhedging. \nRisk management \n \nCommerzbank uses a wide range of quantitative and qualitative \ntools to manage and monitor market risk. Quantitative limits for \nsensitivities, value at risk, stress tests, scenario analyses and ratios \non economic capital limit the market risk. Our comprehensive \nrulebook, in the form of market risk policies and guidelines as well \nas restrictions on portfolio structure, new products, maturities and \nminimum ratings, establishes the qualitative framework for market \nrisk management. The market risk strategy lays down the weighting \nof figures in each segment by reference to their relevance. Thereby \nallowance is made for the varying impact of the parameters for the \nmanagement of the segments in line with the business strategy. \nMarket risk is managed internally at Group level, segment level \nand in each segment’s reporting units. A comprehensive internal \nlimit system broken down to portfolio level is implemented and \nforms a core part of internal market risk management. \nThe quantitative and qualitative factors limiting market risk are \ndetermined by the market risk committees by reference to the \nGroup’s management of economic capital. The utilisation of these \nlimits, together with the relevant net income figures, is reported \ndaily to the Board of Managing Directors and the responsible heads \nof the Group divisions. Based on qualitative analyses and \nquantitative ratios, the market risk function identifies potential \nfuture risks, anticipates potential financial losses in collaboration \nwith the finance function, and draws up proposals for further action, \nwhich are discussed with the front office units. Voting on the \nproposed measures or risk positions takes place in the above-\nmentioned market risk committee and is subsequently submitted to \nthe Board of Managing Directors for approval. \nRisk concentrations are restricted directly using specific limits \nor are indirectly avoided, for example, using stress test limits. In \naddition, the combination of various conventional risk measures \n(e.g. VaR, sensitivities) ensures the appropriate management of \nconcentration risks. Furthermore, risk drivers are analysed on a \nregular basis in order to identify concentrations. The risk \nmanagement of existing concentrations is also reviewed using \nsituation-driven analyses and, where necessary, supplemented by \ntargeted measures such as limits.  \nAny limits that are breached are handled in a separate escalation \nprocedure. After a limit breach has been identified, the front office \nand risk units design adequate countermeasures. If the limit breach \ncannot be remedied within a reasonable period, it will be escalated \nby the market risk function to the next hierarchical level. \n \n \nMarket risk"

Stressed VaR measures the risk in the present \nposition in the trading book by reference to market movements from \na specified crisis period in the past. The crisis observation period \nused for this is checked regularly through model validation and \napproval processes and adjusted where necessary. The crisis \nobservation period remained the same during the year. \nThe market risk profile in stressed VaR is also diversified across \nall asset classes.

In the process, a distinction is \nmade between the variants backtesting of the hypothetical change \nin portfolio value (clean P&L) and backtesting of the actual change \nin portfolio value (dirty P&L).

In dirty P&L backtesting, by contrast, profits and \nlosses from newly concluded and expired transactions from the day \nunder consideration are also included (actual profits and losses \ninduced by portfolio value changes). Profits and losses from \nvaluation adjustments and model reserves are factored into dirty \nand clean P&L according to the regulatory requirements."

      "text": "134 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nIf the actual loss exceeds the VaR, it is described as a negative \nbacktesting outlier. Analysing the results of backtesting provides an \ninformative basis for checking parameters and for potential \nimprovement to the market risk model. In 2022 three negative clean \nP&L outliers/dirty P&L outliers were measured. The clean P&L/dirty \nP&L outliers are mainly due to market movements in interest rates, \nforeign currencies and commodities, against the backdrop of the \nUkraine war. \nBacktesting is also used by the supervisory authorities for \nevaluating internal risk models. Negative outliers are classified by \nmeans of a traffic-light system laid down by the supervisory \nauthorities. All negative backtesting outliers at Group level (from \nboth clean P&L and dirty P&L) must be reported to the supervisory \nauthorities, citing their extent and cause. \nAs the VaR concept gives a prediction of potential losses \nassuming normal market conditions, it is supplemented by stress \ntests. These stress tests measure the risk to which Commerzbank is \nexposed, based on unlikely but still plausible events. These events \nmay be simulated using extreme movements on various financial \nmarkets. The key scenarios relate to major changes in credit \nspreads, interest rates and yield curves, exchange rates, share \nprices and commodities prices. Events simulated in stress tests \ninclude all stock prices falling by 15%, a parallel shift in the yield \ncurve or changes to the curve’s gradient. \nExtensive Group-wide stress tests and scenario analyses are \ncarried out as part of risk monitoring. \nThe internal model’s individual components are validated at \nregular intervals to assess their appropriateness for risk \nmeasurement. The identification and elimination of model \nweaknesses are of particular importance in this. \n \nBanking book \n \nThe key drivers of market risk in the banking book are the Group \nTreasury portfolios, with their credit spread, interest rate and basis \nrisks. \nIn market risk management, credit spread sensitivities in the \nbanking and trading books are considered together. Credit spread \nsensitivities (downshift of 1 basis point) for all securities and \nderivative positions (excluding loans) were at €30m as at the end of \nfiscal year 2022 (31 December 2021: €50m). The main reason for \nthe decrease was the rise in the level of interest rates. \nMost credit spread sensitivities related to securities positions \nmeasured at amortised cost. Changes in market price have no \nimpact on the revaluation reserve or the income statement for these \npositions. The impact of an interest rate shock on the economic \nvalue of the Group’s banking book is simulated monthly in \ncompliance with regulatory requirements. In accordance with the \nEU Banking Directive, the German Federal Financial Supervisory \nAuthority and the European Central Bank have prescribed two \nscenarios of uniform, sudden and unexpected changes in interest \nrates (+/–200 basis points) to be used by all banks, which have to \nreport on the results of this stress test every quarter. In the scenario \n–200 basis points, the yield curve is floored at 0 (negative sections \nof the yield curve are left unchanged). \nAs a result of the scenario +200 basis points, a potential \neconomic loss of €2,062m as at 31 December 2022 (31 December \n2021: €2,523m potential economic loss) was determined, and in the \nscenario –200 basis points a potential economic profit of €1,133m \n(31 December 2021: €746m potential economic profit). Commerz-\nbank does not, therefore, need to be classified as a bank with \nelevated interest rate risk, as the decline in net present value \nrepresents less than 20% of its regulatory capital. \nThe interest rate sensitivity of the overall banking book \n(excluding pension funds) fell to €2.4m as at 31 December 2022 \n(31 December 2021: €7.3m) per basis point of falling interest rates \nmainly due to increased interest rate levels and position changes in \nthe treasury."

The duration of the \nliabilities is extremely long (cash outflows modelled over almost \n90 years), and the main portion of the overall portfolio’s present \nvalue risk is in maturities of 15 years and over. The main risk drivers \nare long-term euro interest rates, credit spreads and expected euro \ninflation due to anticipated pension dynamics. Equity, volatility and \nforeign exchange risk also need to be taken into consideration. \nDiversification effects between individual risks reduce the overall \nrisk. The extremely long maturities of these liabilities represent the \ngreatest challenge, particularly for hedging credit spread risk. This \nis because there is insufficient liquidity in the market for \ncorresponding hedging products. \nMarket liquidity risk \n \nMarket liquidity risk is the risk of the Bank not being able to \nliquidate or hedge risky positions in a timely manner, to the desired \nextent and on acceptable terms as a result of insufficient liquidity in \nthe market.  \nMarket liquidity risk is taken into account in Commerzbank’s \nrisk-bearing capacity concept by scaling the value at risk to one year, \ni.e. the implicitly recognised liquidation period. Additional valuation \nadjustments for market liquidity risk are also reflected in the \ncalculation of the risk coverage capital.  \nLiquidity risk \nWe define liquidity risk in the narrower sense as the risk that \nCommerzbank will be unable to meet its payment obligations on a \nday-to-day basis. In a broader sense, liquidity risk describes the risk \nthat future payments cannot be funded for the full amount, in the \nrequired currency or at standard market conditions, as and when \nthey are due. \nStrategy and organisation \n \nThe Board of Managing Directors adopts the business strategy and \nthe Bank’s risk tolerance, which is associated with it. Liquidity risk \ntolerance is then operationalised by defining the liquidity reserve \nperiod and the limit framework. In order to ensure an appropriate \nliquidity risk management process, the Board of Managing \nDirectors delegates certain competences and responsibilities in \nconnection with the Group-wide liquidity risk strategy to the Risk \nand Treasury functions.  \nThe Group Asset Liability Committee (Group ALCO) is \nresponsible for limiting, analysing and monitoring liquidity risk and \nfor strategic liquidity positioning. The Group ALCO is supported by \nvarious sub-committees in this. \nRisk management \n \nCommerzbank uses a wide range of tools to manage and monitor \nliquidity risks on the basis of its own liquidity risk model. The stress \nscenario within the Bank that underlies the model and is relevant \nfor management purposes allows for the impact of both a bank-\nspecific stress event and a broader market crisis. Binding regulatory \nrequirements are an integral component of the management \nmechanism.  \nGroup Treasury is responsible for the Group’s liquidity \nmanagement operations. Group Treasury is represented in all major \nlocations of the Group in Germany and abroad and has reporting \nlines into all subsidiaries. Commerzbank manages its global \nliquidity centrally using cash pooling. This approach ensures that \nliquidity resources are used efficiently and that this occurs across \nall time zones, as Group Treasury units are located in Frankfurt, \nLondon, New York and Singapore. Additional information on this \nsubject can be found in the “Funding and liquidity of the \nCommerzbank Group” section of the Group management report. \nLiquidity risk is monitored on the basis of the Bank’s own \nliquidity risk model by the independent risk function."

      "text": "136 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nThe Bank has established early warning indicators for the \npurpose of managing liquidity risk. These ensure that appropriate \nsteps can be taken in good time to secure long-term financial \nsolidity. \nRisk concentrations can lead to increased outflows of liquidity, \nparticularly in a stress situation, and thus to increased liquidity risk. \nThey can, for example, occur with regard to maturities, large \nindividual creditors or currencies. By means of ongoing monitoring \nand reporting, emerging risk concentrations in funding can be \nrecognised in a timely manner and mitigated through suitable \nmeasures. \nThis also applies to payment obligations in foreign currencies. \nThe Bank also mitigates concentration by continuously using its \naccess to broadly diversified sources of funding, in particular \ndiverse customer deposits and capital market instruments.  \nCommerzbank also ensures that it limits and monitors foreign \nexchange risks. \nIn the event of a market-driven and/or idiosyncratic liquidity \ncrisis, the liquidity contingency plan provides for certain measures \nwhich, depending on the nature of the crisis, can be initiated either \nthrough Treasury’s extended authority to act or through the \nrecovery process of the recovery plan. The liquidity contingency \nplan is an independent part of emergency planning and upstream \nof the recovery plan. Both the liquidity contingency plan and the \nrecovery plan at Commerzbank are updated at least once a year; the \nindividual measures of the recovery plan are checked regularly \nduring the year for plausibility. The liquidity contingency plan also \ndefines a clear allocation of responsibilities for the processes to be \nfollowed in emergency situations and gives details of any action that \nmay need to be taken. \nThe internal rules and the models used are reviewed at least \nannually and regularly audited by Internal Audit, the auditor and the \nsupervisory authority (ECB). \nLiquidity risk model \n \nA key component of liquidity risk management is the daily \ncalculation of the liquidity gap profile. The liquidity gap profile \nshows the deterministic or stochastic inflows and outflows expected \nin the future on a given reporting date and across all portfolios. This \nforms the basis for calculating liquidity requirements or excess \nliquidity per maturity band. This also includes modelling the \nproportion of customer deposits that will be permanently available, \nknown as the core deposit base.  \nThe liquidity gap profile is also used to set the issuance strategy \nof the Commerzbank Group, which is operationalised by the Group \nTreasury division. The Group Finance division is responsible for \ncalculating and allocating liquidity costs on the basis of the liquidity \ngap profile, which are then incorporated in the management of the \nsegments’ business activities. \nBased on the liquidity gap profile, management mechanisms \nsuch as recovery and early warning indicators are limited and \nmonitored accordingly. The liquidity gap profile is limited in the \nmaturity bands up to 1 year. The Group limits are broken down into \nindividual Group units and currencies. The internal liquidity risk \nmodel is complemented by the regular analysis of additional \nadverse, reverse and historical stress scenarios. \nQuantification and stress testing \n \nCommerzbank uses a wide range of tools to manage and monitor \nliquidity risks on the basis of its own liquidity risk model. In addition \nto internal economic considerations, liquidity risk modelling also \nfactors in the binding regulatory requirements under the Capital \nRequirements Regulation (CRR) and the requirements of the \nMinimum \nRequirements \nfor \nRisk \nManagement \n(MaRisk). \nCommerzbank incorporates this within its liquidity risk framework, \nthereby quantifying the liquidity risk appetite established by the \nBoard of Managing Directors.  \nThe stress scenarios within the Bank that underlie the model and \nare relevant for management purposes allow for the impact of both \na bank-specific stress event and a broader market crisis. The \nCommerzbank-specific idiosyncratic scenario simulates a stress \nsituation arising from a rating downgrade of two notches, whereas \nthe market-wide scenario is derived from experience of the \nsubprime crisis and simulates an external market-wide shock. The \nmain liquidity risk drivers of both scenarios are a markedly \nincreased outflow of short-term customer deposits, above-average \ndrawdown of credit lines, prolongations of lending business \nregarded as commercially necessary, the need to provide additional \ncollateral for secured transactions and the application of higher risk \ndiscounts to the liquidation values of assets. \nAs a complement to the individual scenarios, the Bank also \nsimulates the impact on the liquidity gap profile (net liquidity \nposition) of a scenario that combines idiosyncratic and market-\nspecific effects. The liquidity gap profile is shown for the whole of \nthe modelling horizon across the full spectrum of maturities and \nfollows a multi-level concept. This allows for a nuanced presen-\ntation – deterministic and modelled cash flows in existing business \non the one hand and the inclusion of prolongations on the other. \nThe table below shows the liquidity gap profile values after \napplication of the respective stress scenarios for periods of one and \nthree months as at the end of the year. Significantly more liquidity \nflows out in a combined scenario compared with the individual \nscenarios. As at the end of 2022, in the one-month and three-month \nperiods, the combined stress scenario leaves net liquidity of \n€21.2bn and €20.9bn respectively."

      "text": "138 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nBased on the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), Commerz-\nbank defines operational risk (OpRisk) as the risk of loss resulting \nfrom the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people and \nsystems or from external events. This definition includes, among \nother things, legal risk, human resources risk, IT risk, outsourcing \nrisk or tax risk, as well as product risk, conduct risk and risks from \nthe area of environmental, social, governance (ESG). In this \ndefinition the focus is not on strategic or reputational risk. In view \nof their increased economic significance, compliance risk and cyber \nrisk are managed as separate risk types. However, losses from \ncompliance risks and cyber risks are incorporated into the model \nfor determining the economic capital required for operational risks.  \nStrategy and organisation \n \nWithin Commerzbank, OpRisk and governance issues of the Internal \nControl System (ICS) are closely connected in terms of both \norganisational structure and methodology and are continuously \nbeing enhanced. This is because many OpRisk cases are closely \nlinked with failures in the control mechanisms. A properly \nfunctioning ICS thereby helps to reduce or avoid losses from \noperational risks and thus to lower the amount of economic capital \nrequired to cover operational risks in the medium to long term. \nConversely, the operational risk management systems enable the \nICS to adapt itself consistently to them. The further development of \nthe ICS structure is an essential aspect of the proactive reduction or \nprevention of operational risks.  \nChaired by the CRO, the Group OpRisk Committee meets at least \nfour times a year and deals with the management of operational \nrisks within the Commerzbank Group. It also acts as the escalation \nand decision-making committee for key OpRisk topics that span all \nareas. The Management Boards and/or the Segment Committees \nwith responsibility for operational risk deal with the management of \noperational risk in the relevant units. They analyse OpRisk issues \nthat affect them, such as loss events, and define subsequent \nmeasures or recommend action. \nCommerzbank’s OpRisk strategy is approved on an annual basis \nby the Board of Managing Directors after it has been discussed and \nvoted upon in the Group OpRisk Committee. The OpRisk strategy \ndescribes the risk profile, key elements of the desired risk culture, \nits management framework and measures to be taken by \nCommerzbank to manage operational risk. OpRisk management is \nbased on three consecutive levels (three lines of defence) which, \nwhen taken together, are crucial for reaching the given strategic \naims. \nRisk management \n \nCommerzbank takes an active approach to managing operational \nrisk, aiming to systematically identify OpRisk profiles and risk \nconcentrations and to define, prioritise and implement risk \nmitigation measures.  \nOperational risks are characterised by asymmetric distribution \nof losses. This means that most of the losses are relatively small, \nwhile isolated losses with a very low probability of occurrence have \nthe potential to be large and devastating. This makes it necessary \nnot only to limit high loss potential but also to proactively manage \nlosses that can be expected to occur frequently. \nTo do this, Commerzbank has set up a multi-stage system that \nbrings together the defined limits on economic capital (risk capacity) \nand those set for operative risk management during the year (risk \nappetite/tolerance), complemented by rules on the transparent and \nconscious acceptance and approval of individual risks (risk \nacceptance). \nOpRisk management includes an annual evaluation of the Bank’s \nICS key controls and a risk scenario assessment. OpRisk loss events \nare also subject to ongoing analysis and ICS backtesting on an \nevent-driven basis. Lessons learned activities are carried out after \nall material loss events.  \nSince the fourth quarter of 2021 Commerzbank has measured \nregulatory capital using the standardised approach (SA), while \neconomic capital for operational risks continues to be measured \nusing a dedicated internal model (OpRisk ErC model). Risk-\nweighted assets for operational risks on this basis at the end of the \nfourth quarter of 2022 amounted to €21.2bn (31 December 2021: \n€19.8bn). Main driver of the rise compared to the previous year \nwere the revenues in 2022. The economically required capital was \n€2.3bn. The internal model used for this corresponds to the \nadvanced measurement approach (AMA) previously in use. A \ncomparison with the previous year (31 December 2021: €1.5bn) \nshows a sharp increase.\n \n \n \nOperational risk"

Legal risk also \narises in realised losses or provisions due to or in connection with \ncourt cases brought against Commerzbank (passive proceedings). \nCases brought by Commerzbank (active proceedings) generally \nrepresent a credit risk rather than an operational risk, so the risk of \nloss is already taken into account through write-downs. However, \nthe costs of legal action (court and lawyers’ costs) for active \nproceedings are classified as legal risk. \nOrganisation \nWithin Commerzbank, the functional management of legal risk \nthroughout the Group is the responsibility of Group Legal. All legal \nstaff at the various Group Legal locations including the foreign \nbranches as well as the legal staff of the legal departments of the \ndomestic and foreign subsidiaries are as legal risk managers \noperationally responsible for the identification and management of \nthe Group-wide legal risk within Commerzbank."

They must ensure that they are always up to date with \nall legal changes or new findings within their area of responsibility \nand inform the business units affected about the impact on legal \nrisk and any action that needs to be taken as a result. \nThe legal risk managers are responsible for arranging or \nadjusting legal provisions and look after and monitor new and \nongoing court proceedings.  \nIn the case of passive proceedings, provisions are recognised on \nthe basis of the risk assessment carried out by the responsible legal \nrisk manager. The expected risk of loss for proceedings generally \ncorresponds to the size of the provisions to be recognised. To \nestimate the expected loss, the amount that the Bank would \nreasonably have to pay to settle the dispute at the current point in \ntime is calculated after each significant stage in the proceedings.

This \nreport is sent to the Bank’s management and Supervisory Board, \nthe supervisory authority and the OpRisk Committee. \nCurrent developments \nCommerzbank and its subsidiaries are involved in a variety of court \nand arbitration cases, claims and official investigations (legal \nproceedings) in connection with a broad range of issues. They \ninclude, for example, allegations of defective advice, disputes in \nconnection \nwith \ncredit \nfinance \nor \npayment \ntransactions, \nentitlements to occupational pensions, allegedly false accounting \nand incorrect financial statements, enforcement of claims due to tax \nissues, allegedly incorrect prospectuses in connection with \nunderwriting transactions, alleged violations of competition laws, \nand cases brought by shareholders and other investors as well as \ninvestigations by supervisory authorities. In addition, changes to \nrulings by supreme courts, which may render them more restrictive, \nas well as to legal conditions, e.g. in the private customer business, \nmay result in more claims being brought against Commerzbank or \nits subsidiaries. In these court cases, claimants are mostly asking \nfor the payment of compensation, claims on account of unjust \nenrichment or the reversal of agreements already entered into. If \nthe courts were to find in favour of one or more of the claimants in \nthese cases, Commerzbank could be liable to pay compensation, \nwhich could in some cases be substantial, or could incur the \nexpense of reversing agreements or of other cost-intensive \nmeasures.  \nRegulatory authorities and governmental institutions in various \ncountries in which Commerzbank and its subsidiaries are or have \nbeen active have for some years been investigating irregularities in \nconnection with the fixing of foreign exchange rates and with \nforeign exchange business in general. In the course of these \ninvestigations, regulatory authorities and governmental institutions \nhave also sought checks on Commerzbank or have approached the \nBank with requests for information. Commerzbank has cooperated \nfully with these bodies and also looked into the relevant matters on \nthe basis of its own comprehensive investigations. The cases are no \nlonger active with the exception of one case in which the \ninvestigating authority transferred the matter to the national \ncompetition tribunal. Financial consequences cannot be ruled out.  \nThe public prosecutor’s office in Frankfurt is investigating equity \ntransactions conducted by Commerzbank and the former Dresdner \nBank around the dividend record date (cum-ex transactions). \nCommerzbank had already initiated a forensic analysis of cum-ex \ntransactions at the end of 2015, which was concluded at the start of \n2018 in respect of Commerzbank’s equity transactions and in \nSeptember 2019 in respect of the equity transactions of the former \nDresdner Bank. All back taxes demanded by the tax authorities have \nbeen paid. \nThe public prosecutor’s office in Cologne has been conducting \ninvestigations at Commerzbank since September 2019 in \nconnection with a separate case concerning cum-ex transactions. It \nis investigating on suspicion that the Bank (including Dresdner \nBank) was involved in cum-ex transactions in various roles, \nincluding by supplying shares to third parties who were allegedly \nacting as short sellers. According to the current understanding, \nthese proceedings do not involve Commerzbank’s own tax credit \nclaims with regard to capital gains tax and the solidarity surcharge \non dividends.  \nThe Bank is cooperating fully with authorities conducting \ninvestigations into cum-ex transactions. It is currently not possible \nto predict whether this will result in a burden, whether it will occur, \nor the amount of any resulting burden. \nBased on the circular on cum/cum transactions published by the \nFederal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2017, the tax auditors \ncommented on the treatment of these transactions in the form of \naudit notes. The tax office reduced the credit for capital gains taxes \naccordingly. \nIn \nresponse, \nCommerzbank \nAG \nmade \nvalue \nadjustments to tax credits shown in the balance sheet and set up \nadditional provisions for possible repayment claims in order to \nreflect the changed risk situation fully and appropriately. The BMF \npublished a revised version of its circular on cum/cum transactions \non 9 July 2021. In view of the potential impact of the BMF circular, \nthe provision was adjusted in the second quarter of 2021. Based on \ncurrent knowledge, the tax risks arising from this issue have thereby \nbeen adequately covered. The possibility of further charges over \nand above the provisions recognised by the Bank cannot be \ncompletely ruled out."

However, the tax offices of various \ncontracting parties partially refused or subsequently disallowed \nsubsequent crediting against corporate income tax. \nIn May 2017, a Polish court admitted a class action lawsuit \nagainst mBank alleging the ineffectiveness of index clauses in loan \nagreements denominated in Swiss francs. A total of 1,731 plaintiffs \nhave joined the class action. The plaintiffs have lodged an appeal \nagainst the ruling of the court of first instance rejecting their claims.  \nIndependently of this, numerous borrowers have also filed \nindividual lawsuits for the same reasons. In addition to the class \naction, 17,627 other individual proceedings were pending as at 31 \nDecember 2022 (31 December 2021: 13,036). mBank has contested \nthese claims.  \nAs at 31 December 2022, there were 1,941 final rulings in \nindividual proceedings against mBank, of which 97 were decided in \nfavour of mBank and 1,844 were decided against mBank. A total of \n33 proceedings before courts of second instance are suspended \nbecause of legal issues that are being considered by the Polish \nSupreme Court and the European Court of Justice (ECJ). \nThe questions submitted to the ECJ by the Polish Supreme Court \non the legality of the process for appointing new judges to the Polish \nSupreme Court are still unanswered and the further course of the \nproceedings and the outcome remain to be seen. \nNew requests for preliminary rulings sent to the ECJ by Polish \ncourts in proceedings concerning mBank raise key issues about \nhow to deal with indexed loans, such as the declaration of such loan \nagreements as null and void, the statute of limitations for repayment \nclaims and the compensation for use owed to the banks (C138/22, \nC139/22 and C140/22). A date for the hearing or pronouncement of \na decision has not yet been set. \nA referral proceeding of another bank at the ECJ (C520/21) \nmainly addresses issues regarding compensation for use and other \nbenefits for funds that are to be returned under a void loan \nagreement. Representatives of the plaintiffs, the defendant, the \nsupervisory authorities and the European Commission presented \ntheir positions at a hearing in October 2022. The court did not \ncomment specifically on the matter. Once implemented by the \nPolish courts, a decision in favour of the plaintiffs could result in \nconsiderable economic burdens for mBank. A decision by the court \nis expected in mid-2023. \nmBank established a settlement programme beginning in the \nfourth quarter of 2022 that is aimed at all customers with active \nloans, including those who already have lawsuits against the bank. \nCustomers will be offered the option of having their loans converted \ninto zloty loans with a fixed or variable interest rate as well as the \ncancellation of an individually negotiated part of the outstanding \nloan value. As at the reporting date, mBank had accounted for risks \nin connection with future settlement payments in the amount of \n€122.1m. \nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Group changed the methodology \nused to calculate the risk provisions for loan agreements indexed to \nSwiss francs. The methodology is now based on historical data, \nsupplemented by expert assessments. The main assumptions are: \nThe expected number of borrowers who will still sue, the nature of \nthe expected court judgments, the amount of the Bank’s loss in the \nevent of a judgment, and the acceptance rate for settlements. The \nmethodology used to calculate the provision is based on parameters \nthat are varied, discretionary and in some cases associated with \nconsiderable uncertainty. Fluctuations in the parameters as well as \ntheir interdependencies and rulings of the Polish courts and the ECJ \nmay mean that the amount of the provision has to be adjusted \nsignificantly in the future. \nAs at 31 December 2022, the portfolio of loans denominated in \nSwiss francs that have not been fully repaid had a carrying amount \nof 6.1bn Polish zloty; the portfolio that had already been repaid \namounted to 7.5bn Polish zloty when it was disbursed. Overall, the \nGroup recognised a provision of €1.4bn for the risks arising from \nthe matter, including potential settlement payments and the class \naction lawsuit (31 December 2021: €899m). \nNew legal provisions in Poland permit consumers, irrespective \nof their financial position, to defer their monthly payments for \ncurrent mortgage loans up to eight times until the end of 2023. In \ncalculating the impact of these provisions, mBank is expecting \nborrowers accounting for 82.5% of the eligible mortgage loan \nportfolio to exercise this right and to request deferrals averaging \n7.7 months. As at 31 December 2022, customers accounting for \n81.8% of the portfolio had requested deferrals averaging 6.8 \nmonths. \nIn April 2021, the German Federal Court of Justice ruled on the \nmechanism for changes to banks’ general terms and conditions \n(AGB Banken) in a case against another bank and declared the \nrelevant clauses of the general terms and conditions to be void. This \nmechanism stipulated that the customer’s consent to certain \nchanges in the contract was given after a certain period of time if \nthe customer had not objected. The Bank has examined the impact \nof this case law on its business units and products, as the charges \nintroduced or increased for consumers as a result of the mechanism \nfor changes to banks’ general terms and conditions may be void."

Since there are \nconsiderable uncertainties as to how such proceedings will develop, \nthe possibility cannot be ruled out that some of the provisions \nrecognised for them may prove to be inadequate once the courts’ \nfinal rulings are known. As a result, substantial additional expense \nmay be incurred. This is also true in the case of legal proceedings \nfor which the Group did not consider it necessary to recognise \nprovisions. The eventual outcome of some legal proceedings might \nhave an impact on Commerzbank’s results and cash flow in a given \nreporting period; in the worst case, it cannot be fully ruled out that \nthe liabilities which might result from them may also have a \nsignificant impact on Commerzbank’s earnings performance, assets \nand financial position. \nFurther information on legal proceedings may be found in Note \n55 regarding provisions and Note 57 regarding contingent liabilities \nand lending commitments in the Group financial statements. \nCompliance risk \nCompliance risk falls within the definition of operational risk \naccording to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). \nCommerzbank acknowledges and understands the existence of \ninherent compliance risk in its areas of business, which are subject \nto the risk of abuse in general and in particular by financial crime. \nCompliance risk in this context comprises risks relating to money \nlaundering, terrorist financing, sanctions/embargoes, markets \ncompliance, fraud, bribery and corruption, as well as consideration \nof human rights and environmental risks in accordance with the \nGerman Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG). \nIn order to actively promote a compliance culture in the Bank, \nthe Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank has laid down \nand communicated corresponding values in the Code of Conduct. \nOrganisation \nGroup Compliance is led by the Divisional Board member for Group \nCompliance, who reports directly to the Board of Managing \nDirectors. Pursuant to Art. 87 (5) of the German Securities Trading \nAct (WpHG) and BT 1.1 MaComp (minimum requirements of the \ncompliance function), the division head of Group Compliance is \nboth the Group’s Compliance Officer and, under Art. 25 h (7) of the \nGerman Banking Act (KWG) and Arts. 7 and 9 of the German Anti-\nMoney Laundering Act (GwG), the Anti-Money Laundering Officer; \nthis person is supervised as such by the Federal Financial \nSupervisory Authority (BaFin).  \nThe Group Compliance division head also assumes the role as \nhuman rights officer according to the German Supply Chain Due \nDiligence Act (LkSG). The human rights officer shall have a deputy \nhuman rights officer who shall have the rights and powers of the \nhuman rights officer. \n \nGroup Compliance is responsible for: \nA. The five types/areas of compliance risk:  \n1) anti money laundering / fighting terrorist financing  \n2) sanctions and embargoes  \n3) combating fraud, bribery and corruption  \n4) markets compliance  \n5) consideration of human rights and environmental risks in \naccordance with the LkSG \n \nas well as  \nB. Further responsibilities:  \n1) coordination of the requirements under MaRisk section 4.4.2 \n(“MaRisk compliance function”),  \n2) independent implementation of internal special investigations \nwith compliance relevance. \n \nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Bank decided to implement in \nCompliance the requirements set out in the LkSG.  \nThe responsibilities based on the obligations under the QI \n(Qualified Intermediary), FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance \nAct) and CRS (Common Reporting Standard) regimes as well as in \nrelation to the prevention of the aiding and abetting of tax evasion \n(Anti-Tax Evasion Facilitation − ATEF) have been bundled within the \nGroup Tax function; the corresponding role of the QI and FATCA \nResponsible Officer was transferred to Group Tax in July 2022.

These procedures for ensuring compliance \nwith material legal provisions and requirements are referred to in \ntheir \nentirety \nas \na compliance \nmanagement \nsystem. \nCommerzbank’s compliance management system is based on \ninternational market standards and the regulatory requirements in \nthe various countries which are relevant for Commerzbank’s \nbusiness activities. Commerzbank is constantly developing its \ncompliance management system in order to meet its responsibilities \nand address the growing complexity and increasing regulatory \nrequirements. Under the three lines of defence principle, protecting \nagainst undesirable compliance risks is an activity that is not \nrestricted to the compliance function (Group Compliance). Instead, \nthe organisational control and monitoring elements are aligned in \nthree sequential levels. The units in the first line of defence (1st LoD) \nassume responsibility as part of their operational activities for \nidentifying and managing risks and for complying with their own \nbusiness rules; they are also responsible for setting up process-\noriented control mechanisms. Group Compliance, the second line \nof defence (2nd LoD), sets standards for appropriate risk \nmanagement, oversees the appropriateness and effectiveness of the \nprocedures and controls in the first line of defence, and assesses \nand communicates any deficiencies found. In addition, Group \nCompliance carries out analyses and assessments of compliance \nrisks and ensures that the risk management framework is \nimplemented. Internal Audit, the third line of defence (3rd LoD), \nuses regular and independent audits to check that compliance in \nboth the 1st LoD and 2nd LoD is appropriate and effective. \nCompliance risks are managed in a control circuit with \ninteracting elements. Commerzbank constantly monitors relevant \nregulatory requirements and ensures the definition and/or \nadjustment of corresponding internal standards intended to make \nsure it complies with the requirements. Regular internal training \nmeasures and consulting services from the compliance function \nsupport the effective implementation of these standards in the \nGroup. Implementation encompasses setting up and carrying out \nsuitable processes and controls in daily work, assuring their quality \nand testing their effectiveness in the 1st and 2nd LoD. Compliance \nrisks are monitored and are the subject of regular internal reporting. \nWhere necessary, matters are escalated according to their urgency \nand severity.  \nThe compliance sub-risk strategy, as part of the overall risk \nstrategy of Commerzbank, sets the risk strategy framework for \ndealing with compliance risks and contains a detailed description of \ncompliance risk management in addition to strategic and \norganisational elements. In particular, the risk appetite per \ncompliance risk type is specified and the strategic fields of action \nare defined. \nRisk analysis (compliance risk analysis) is one of the core \nelements of risk management. It assesses the inherent risk arising \nfrom doing business with different customer groups and products \nand compares this in the Control Assessment with an evaluation of \nthe corresponding control environment for mitigating the inherent \nrisk. A residual risk is determined as the outcome. The Bank defines \nmeasures to further enhance risk management (e.g. introducing \nadditional controls) as necessary and tracks implementation closely. \nCurrent developments \nIn recent years, Commerzbank has worked through all the findings \nfrom the settlements with various US authorities regarding \nviolations of US sanctions and money laundering prevention \nregulations. Commerzbank last reported to the DFS (Department of \nFinancial Services) for the fourth quarter of 2022. \nOn 13 April 2022 Commerzbank London received confirmation \nfrom the UK financial services supervisory authority, the Prudential \nRegulation Authority (PRA), that its application to be recognised as \na “third-country branch” had been approved. This approval allows \nthe Bank to continue operating as a branch of Commerzbank AG in \nthe UK; it had been operating under the Temporary Permissions \nRegime (TPR) since 1 January 2021. The approval also means \ndiscontinuation of all voluntary restrictions on business, which were \nput in place during the review carried out in the branch by the \n“skilled person” appointed by the UK Financial Conduct Authority \n(FCA). \nIn August 2022 Commerzbank reached an agreement with the \nHong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to pay a fine of HKD 6m. \nThe fine is due to breaches of the Money Laundering Ordinance in \nthe area of KYC for the period April 2012 to June 2016. Following \nthe report from the HKMA, an immediate programme to work \nthrough the infringements was launched, and this has already been \ncompleted. \nReputational risk \nReputational risk is the risk that stakeholders may lose confidence \nin Commerzbank or that its reputation may be damaged as a result \nof negative events in its business activities. Commerzbank’s \nstakeholder groups include in particular the public and the media, \nnon-governmental organisations and its customers. In the present-\nday competitive environment, a company’s reputation is becoming \nmore and more important. The main factor determining this is how \ncompanies handle sustainability considerations (environmental or \nsocial risks) in the market segments’ customer business (intrinsic \nreputational risks). Companies are judged not only on the basis of \npeople’s personal experiences of them, but also on reports reaching \nthe public, especially through the media. Reputational risk therefore \ngoes hand in hand with communication risk."

The segments and significant subsidiaries \nbear direct responsibility for reputational risk resulting from their \nparticular business activity. The Reputational Risk Management \ndepartment is part of the central Group Communications division of \nthe Commerzbank Group and focuses on intrinsic reputational risk \nthat may directly lead to reputational damage among stakeholder \ngroups. The department maintains close links with the relevant front \noffice units. Management of intrinsic reputational risk is the \nresponsibility of the Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors. \nIt is a component of Commerzbank’s overall risk strategy. Reputa-\ntional Risk Management’s tasks include identifying, evaluating and \naddressing intrinsic reputational risk in systematic processes at an \nearly stage and suggesting or implementing appropriate measures \n(early warning function). \nRisk management \nManaging intrinsic reputational risk means identifying and reacting \nto potential environmental and social risks at an early stage, thereby \nreducing any potential communication risk or even preventing it \ncompletely. Intrinsic reputational risk is managed by means of \na qualitative approach. As part of a structured process, transactions, \nproducts and customer relationships in connection with sensitive \nareas are assessed with reference to environmental and social risks \non a qualitative five-point scale. This assessment can contain \nconditions and in some cases a negative verdict, which could lead \nto a rejection. In addition to the qualitative assessment of intrinsic \nreputational risks, an annual scenario-based ICAAP materiality \nanalysis is used to quantitatively assess the impact of climate and \nenvironmental risks on reputational risks and to ensure appropriate \nICAAP consideration via business risk.  \nThe sensitive areas regularly and comprehensively analysed in \nReputational Risk Management include armaments exports and \ntransactions, products and customer relationships relating to power \ngeneration and commodities extraction. Commerzbank’s attitude \ntowards these areas is laid down in positions and guidelines that are \nbinding for all employees. Commerzbank’s Reputational Risk \nManagement department regularly observes and analyses new \nenvironmental and social issues and informs the relevant parts of \nthe Bank about these. The reputational risks identified and \naddressed by the department are incorporated into the quarterly \nreputational risk report – part 1: non-quantifiable risks; part 2: high \nand major intrinsic reputational risks (sustainability issues) – which \nis prepared for the Board of Managing Directors and the Risk \nCommittee of the Supervisory Board. \nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) \nrisks \nThe integration of ESG aspects into the Bank’s risk management \nprocesses is hugely important for sustainable finance.  \nThe three lines of defence concept for ESG risks was refined \nduring 2022. ESG risks are considered a type of horizontal risk and \nas such are managed by various control units across the Bank. \nGroup Sustainability Management also acts the second line of \ndefence for social (S) and governance (G) risks, serving as a central \npoint of oversight. Environmental (E) risks are dealt with within the \nrisk control function. A Chief Environmental Risk Officer (CERO) has \nalso been appointed and tasked with bringing the Environmental \nRisk Control unit into operation. \nThrough the ESG framework published in July 2022 we have \nmade our understanding of and commitment to sustainability \ntransparent for all stakeholders. The framework creates a Bank-\nwide standard that enables stringent management of all relevant \nproducts, processes and activities and ensures the sustainable \ntransformation of Commerzbank. The focus of the ESG framework \nis on our core business. We distinguish between “transformation \nfinance” and “sustainable finance”. We are convinced that the \nentire economy has a role to play in sustainable transformation and \nmust act accordingly. Therefore, we classify all portfolio \ncomponents that are not affected by our exclusion criteria as \ntransformation finance. Sustainable finance, on the other hand, \ndescribes that part of our portfolio that we classify as explicitly \nsustainable. This includes financial products and services that serve \npositive environmental and/or social purposes and thus contribute, \nfor example, to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement or the \nUN Sustainable Development Goals. In order to determine which \nexposures meet our sustainability requirements and are thus part of \nsustainable finance, we have developed a transparent review system \nand our own criteria, which are disclosed in the ESG framework. \nThe ESG framework also provides an overview of our sustainability \ndirectives and exclusion criteria.  \nTo this end, we have formulated sector-specific requirements, \nfor example for mining, energy and fossil fuels, including oil and \ngas. Cross-sector requirements relate to human rights and \nindigenous peoples. Exclusion criteria were defined for particularly \ncritical products, transactions or business relationships. This \nincludes, for example, financing for oil and gas production projects \n(conventional and unconventional production methods), as well as \nthe Group-wide decision not to finance new construction or \nexpansion for coal mines, coal infrastructure or coal-fired power \nplants. Financing of such projects is excluded under our Fossil \nFuels Policy. In this way, we ensure that even existing customers \nare not supported by any business that is prohibited under the Fossil \nFuels Policy.

In view of the special risks \nassociated with fossil fuels and armaments, the Board of Managing \nDirectors of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft has passed its own \nbinding directives on these matters that define many of the relevant \ntransactions and business relationships in these areas as being \nsubject to assessment, and encompass exclusion criteria. The fossil \nfuels directive was revised at the beginning of 2022 and includes \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s requirements for customers in \nthe coal, oil and gas sectors. \nAdjustments were also made in relation to arms during the year \nunder review. What has not changed is that we recognise the basic \nright of states to defend themselves and do not question the need \nfor the German armed forces to exist or to be adequately equipped. \nWe therefore continue to finance arms manufacturers who produce \nweapons and armament systems for the Federal Republic of \nGermany and its allies. Nevertheless, we have tightened and \nexpanded the requirements and criteria for the arms industry \napplying to Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, which have been in \nplace since 2008. The Board of Managing Directors approved the \nnew Arms and Surveillance Technology Policy in January 2023. It \npreserves the fundamental parameters of the old policy, which \nmeans that Commerzbank will not fund arms business in conflict \nzones or areas of tension, or business relating to what are termed \n“controversial weapons”. In addition, the new policy now also \ngoverns the approach in relation to autonomous weapons and \nsurveillance technology. \nIn the Reputational Risk Management department, business \ntransactions and business relationships in sectors in which human \nrights play a significant role, such as mining, raw materials \nextraction or the cotton sector, are intensively researched, analysed \nand assessed in detail. In addition, Commerzbank Aktiengesell-\nschaft worked intensively in the reporting year to implement the \nLkSG, which has come into force on 1 January 2023.  \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft’s \nReputational \nRisk \nManagement department thus defines the criteria for and limits of \nbusiness operations and assesses transactions, products and \ncustomer relationships after careful analysis. The assessment \nprocess starts in the front office: as soon as an issue defined as \nsensitive by the Bank is affected, Reputational Risk Management \nmust be brought in. The assessment uses a five-point scale and can \nresult in a rejection of the product, the transaction or the business \nrelationship.  \nmBank in Poland operates its own Reputational Risk \nManagement department based on its commitment to the United \nNations Global Compact. mBank’s risk management strategy is \nbased on three pillars: supporting sustainable growth, striving for \nprudent and stable risk management, and strengthening its skills in \nmanaging ESG and cyber risks. mBank has formulated its own \nexclusion criteria for various sectors based on the EU’s climate and \nenergy policies. These include the mining and energy sectors, \namong others: for example, financing for the construction or \nexpansion of hard coal and lignite mines is excluded. mBank’s \nreputational risk strategy is reviewed annually and coordinated with \nthe parent company. \nIn order to lay the foundation for future management of \nbiodiversity, in 2022 we conducted an impact analysis for the first \ntime using the “Encore” tool. Encore provides a science-based link \nbetween economic activities and biodiversity-damaging impacts. In \nour analysis, we compared the business volume of the sectors we \nfinance with the tool’s external data and then weighted them. We \nidentified potential areas of action and strategic priorities and will \ndevelop further analyses and measures to protect biodiversity.  \nWe are pursuing the strategic goal of reducing the CO2 emissions \nof our entire loan and investment portfolio to net zero by 2050. For \nthis purpose, in 2022 we analysed the CO2 intensity of the loan \nportfolio of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft using sector-specific \ntarget values in accordance with the Paris Agreement. In terms of \nmethodology, we are guided by the Science Based Targets Initiative \n(SBTi), which advocates the reduction of greenhouse gases on the \nbasis of scientifically calculated targets. This enables companies to \nalign their climate policy with the goals of the Paris Agreement and \neffectively counteract climate change. Using the SBTi method we \nhave set specific sector-specific goals with a view to reducing the \nCO2 emissions associated with our loan portfolio (what are called \n“financed emissions”) and ultimately to meet our net zero \ncommitment. \nWe aim to manage all portfolios highlighted as requiring \nattention in the SBTi method, with a particular focus on emissions-\nintensive sectors. These include power generation, fossil fuels, \nautomotive manufacturing, as well as the production of cement, iron \nand steel. We will likewise consider the private residential mortgage \nloan portfolio, which is deemed optional in the SBTi analysis. In the \n2022 reporting year, corresponding emissions intensity reduction \ntargets were formulated for all these portfolios and validated under \nthe SBTi. The portfolio targets according to the SBTi are published \nin the ESG framework, and the status of target achievement is \nregularly updated there. Our ambition is to support companies in \nthe real economy in their transition process and to sustainably \nreduce emissions."

In this process, all risk types assessed as \nmaterial in the risk inventory are evaluated in terms of their \nmateriality in relation to climate risks, and both transition and \nphysical risks are taken into consideration. Transition risks arise for \ncompanies, for example, as a result of regulatory or legal changes \nin energy policy, changes in market sentiment and preferences, or \ntechnological innovations. Physical risks, on the other hand, \ndevelop as a result of changing climatic conditions and the \nassociated more extreme and more frequent acute weather events, \nsuch as floods, or chronic effects, such as rising sea levels.  \nDepending on the risk type, the assessment was made on \na qualitative and/or quantitative basis. As a result of the analysis, \nthe influence of climate and environmental risks for the risk types \ncredit risk, market risk, operational risk (including compliance and \ncyber risk), reputational risk and business risk was confirmed as \nmaterial. The findings of the materiality analysis feed into the \ncreation of the business strategy, the overall risk strategy and the \nsub-risk strategies as well as into other core elements of the Bank’s \ninternal process to ensure an adequate capital position, such as the \ninternal stress test framework and the risk-bearing capacity concept.  \nWith regard to credit risk, relevant parameters of various climate \nscenarios were holistically translated into economic effects. For \ntransition risks, changes in regulation, price changes, changes in \nsupply or demand, and the effects of technological changes are \nconsidered, among other things; to assess physical risks, climate \nscenarios involving acute flooding and heat events are used and \nanalysed. This is followed by a statement on the impact of climate \nrisks in the short, medium and long term up to 2050. \nTransition risks are industry-specific, with sometimes significant \ndifferences in the sub-sectors within an industry (e.g. mechanical \nengineering). We look at the impact on an industry from both \na macroeconomic and an internal Bank perspective. Potential \nimpacts of physical climate risks vary, in some cases significantly, \nby geographic location and circumstances, and must be considered \nwhen taking a portfolio perspective.  \nAs a major financier of the German economy, we are also active \nin sectors that are particularly exposed to climate-related physical \nor transition risks. However, we have little exposure to some of the \nhardest-hit sectors (agriculture, for example). Sectors that could \npotentially be more heavily affected by climate risks and that have \na sufficiently large exposure are, for example, the energy sector, the \nautomotive sector and mechanical engineering. Owing to the \ngeographical focus of our portfolio in Germany and Europe, we are \nless affected by physical climate risks, such as hurricanes and rising \nsea levels, than other regions in the world. Overall, both climate-\nrelated transition and physical risks are considered material to \ncredit risk over a long-term time horizon. \nIn order to proactively manage the effects of climate risks in \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s lending business, we are \nsystematically optimising our processes and methods. Lending \ndecisions for companies and institutional customers therefore take \ninto account not only an individual risk assessment but also – where \nrelevant – the extent to which they involve climate risks and the level \nof resilience to them.  \nIn this, we are progressively combining the specific findings \nfrom the scenario analyses with the individual risk analysis at \ncustomer level. We take a portfolio-specific approach and thus take \nappropriate account of the differences in terms of affectedness and \nthe risk drivers. In the particularly relevant portfolios, such as large, \ninternational companies, special financing and commercial real \nestate finance, we have supplemented the qualitative risk analysis \nin the individual loan decisions with specific aspects for the analysis \nof climate risks.  \nThe results of the analyses are aggregated into a structured \nassessment that is incorporated into the decision-making processes. \nWe take this score into account in individual lending decisions, but \nwe also use it as part of portfolio analysis and management. We will \nprogressively extend this approach to other relevant portfolios and \ninclude smaller companies, for example. In our target state, we \nwant to integrate climate risks – as far as possible – into the \nquantitative credit risk analysis and thus fully reflect them across \nthe process chain, including in pricing and reporting."

The Bank uses the \nfuture scenarios based on the representative CO2 concentration \npathways set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange to determine an accurate exposure of assets and the \nportfolio. In its risk assessment, including scenario analyses, \nCommerz Real relies on tools such as the Carbon Risk Real Estate \nMonitor (CRREM) and the PwC Climate Excellence Tool. The \nCRREM tool shows climate pathways using asset class and country-\nspecific CO2 and final energy target values for a 1.5° and a 2.0° \nscenario. The Climate Excellence Tool, on the other hand, allows for \na site-specific evaluation of physical climate risks for different \nscenarios. In this way, Commerz Real tries to perform a risk analysis \nthat is as accurate as possible for the location on the basis of \nexisting data and to derive specific measures to prevent damage at \nan early stage. The results feed into the risk assessment and the \nsustainability assessment of all real estate transactions and are \ntaken into account accordingly in the management phase. The basis \nof climate risk management is collecting all consumption and \nemissions data and location data in a way that is as reliable as \npossible. To this end, Commerz Real has implemented a \nsustainability data management system and also uses external \npartners to collect data on a global level. \nIn addition to climate risks, risks from the loss of biodiversity are \nalso among the relevant environmental risks. In 2022 the materiality \nanalysis examined for the first time the extent to which biodiversity \nis material as a risk driver for the Commerzbank Group. As with \nclimate risks, biodiversity risks can be divided into physical and \ntransition risks. While physical biodiversity risks arise from a loss \nor degradation of things provided by the ecosystem on which the \neconomic system depends (e.g. pollination or genetic diversity), \ntransition risks in this context refer to risks that arise from the \ntransformation process towards a more sustainable and environ-\nmentally friendly economy. \nThe physical risk analysis focused on an assessment of the \ndependence on the ecosystem of sectors in which Commerzbank is \nrepresented through credit exposures. To do this, we used external \ndata that classify the degree of dependence of sectors on the \necosystem, and we considered these data in conjunction with the \nvolume of business in each sector.  \nIn the case of transition biodiversity risks for credit risk, the \nnegative impact of business activities on the environment and the \nconsequences due to anticipated future regulatory changes to \nprotect biodiversity were included. As a result, we currently assess \nphysical biodiversity risks as not material, but consider transition \nrisks to be material risk drivers for credit risk in the medium and \nlong term. It can be assumed that biodiversity risks will tend to \nincrease with time. In the future, a more in-depth analysis is \nplanned, supported by corresponding scenarios – where available – \nand more advanced evaluation methods in this context. \nIT risk \nIT risk is a form of operational risk. In our internal definition, we \ndefine IT risk as risks to the security of information processed in our \nsystems in terms of meeting the four IT security objectives set out \nbelow: \nConfidentiality: Information is confidential if it is not accessible \nto, or capable of being reconstructed by, unauthorised persons, \nbusiness processes or IT systems.  \nIntegrity: Information possesses integrity if it has not been \nmodified or destroyed by any unauthorised means. An information-\nprocessing system (IT system) possesses integrity if it can perform \nits intended functions without hindrance and free of unauthorised \nmanipulations, whether deliberate or accidental. \nTraceability: Actions and technologies applied to information \nare traceable if they themselves and their source can be traced back \nwithout any ambiguity. \nAvailability: Information is available if it is always capable of \nbeing used to a predefined extent by authorised persons, business \nprocesses and IT systems when it is required. \nCommerzbank attaches great importance to the protection and \nsecurity of its own information, of that entrusted to it by customers, \nand of the business processes and IT products used to process it. \nThey form a permanent core element in our IT strategy. IT security \nrequirements are based on the IT security objectives referred to \nabove and are set down in policies and procedural instructions. \nIT risks are identified, evaluated and regularly reviewed as part \nof IT governance processes. IT risk is covered in the quarterly IT \nrisk report. Information security is also established as a principal \nobjective for our Internal Control System. As a result of altered \nconditions, more attention has been given to consideration of the \nfour IT security objectives for home office technologies.  \nRelevant IT risks are also evaluated as part of operational risk \nmanagement through risk scenarios and considered in the Bank’s \nRWA calculation. This includes the risk of a breakdown of critical IT, \nthe risk of external attack on the Bank’s systems or data and, since \n2021, the risks of modern cloud sourcing (cyber crime, advanced \npersistent threat (APT)1 and cloud scenarios), the theft of corporate \ndata or the default of service providers and vendors. See also the \ndescription of cyber risk. \nGiven the major importance of IT security to Commerzbank, it is \nfurther developed and improved on an ongoing basis by means of \nstrategic initiatives. We have taken into account the significance of \nthe “human” factor in IT security and cyber security by introducing \nadditional training and awareness-raising measures.\n \n1 An advanced persistent threat is a special form of cyber attack. The intention of an \nAPT attack is to remain undetected for as long as possible in order to steal sensitive\ninformation (internet espionage) or cause other types of damage over a longer period."

      "text": "148 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nCyber risk \nCyber risk comprises risks with direct relevance to security and \nrisks that lead to relevance to security (with respect to cyber space). \nThe part of cyber space of relevance to Commerzbank is all \nconnected IT environments within the Bank and those outside the \nBank that lead to customers, business partners and service \nproviders. Cyber risk is therefore concerned with the digital \nrepresentation of the Bank’s assets (data, information) within cyber \nspace. \nThe strategic guidelines from the Group risk strategy and the \ncyber and information security strategy apply without limitation to \ncyber risk.  \nCommerzbank manages cyber and information security risks via \nthe Group division “Group Risk Management – Cyber Risk & \nInformation Security” (GRM-CRIS), which reports to the Group \nChief Information Security Officer (CISO). In addition to established \nsecurity functions such as the ISO 27001 certified Information \nSecurity Management System (ISMS) as well as risk reporting on \nkey risk indicators, GRM-CRIS focuses on managing cyber risk \nappropriately and on strengthening Commerzbank’s cyber-\nresilience (including its information security incident management \ncapabilities). It also addresses the interaction between cyber and \ninformation security risks and other types of material risk relating \nto areas such as operational risk. \nThe main factor in the current cyber risk situation is the \ngeopolitical tension surrounding the Ukraine war. The actual threat \nsituation has so far been limited to cross-sector attacks by pro-\nRussian and pro-Ukrainian activists. Cyber attacks and sabotage \ncampaigns by state actors have thus far been focused on Ukraine. \nDevelopments in the cyber context are observed on an ongoing \nbasis at Commerzbank by an interdisciplinary task force (top \nmanagement and \nspecialists from \nGRM-CRIS and Group \nTechnology Foundations – GS-TF). \nIn connection with the increased remote use of Bank resources, \nfor example in connection with split operations or working from \nhome, there are still no new or expanded methods of attack against \nthe Bank and its employees.  \nIn the last two years the increasing spread of ransomware in \ncyber crime has to be emphasised, even if Commerzbank has not \nbeen affected by this so far. Ransomware is a special type of \nmalware that blocks access to or encrypts data on IT devices and \nthen requires the victim to pay a ransom for its recovery. The \nsignificant damage potential of such attacks is illustrated by a \nnumber of recent incidents in which supply chains were disrupted. \nBy closely interlinking the 1st and 2nd line of defence (LoD) \nactivities in the field of cyber threat analysis, including \ncorresponding protective measures and incident management \nprocesses, the Bank shall continue to be adequately protected \nagainst ransomware attacks.  \nHuman resources risk \nHuman resources risk falls within the definition of operational risk \nreferred to in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). The \ninternal, management-oriented interpretation of this definition at \nCommerzbank includes the following elements in human resources \nrisk: \nAdjustment risk: Adjustment risk results when organisational \nand operational circumstances change (for example, restructuring, \nchanges in management culture, qualification needs), these \nchanges impact employees’ scope of responsibilities and therefore \nrequire a greater willingness to change on the part of the staff. We \noffer selected internal and external training, continuing education \nand change programmes to ensure that the qualification levels of \nour employees keep pace with the current requirements, guidance \nis provided for structural changes and our employees can fulfil their \nduties and responsibilities. \nMotivation risk: Motivation risk arises when demotivating \nfactors are not eliminated and employees do not adequately \nperceive motivating factors such as management or remuneration. \nThe effects (such as withheld performance by employees) can have \na direct impact on the working environment and the organisation’s \nproductivity. Employee surveys enable us to respond as quickly as \npossible to potential changes in our employees’ level of corporate \nloyalty and to initiate adequate measures. \nDeparture risk: Departure risk takes into account the \nconsequences of undesired employee departures (for example, if an \nemployee resigns voluntarily), particularly when high performers \nare involved. We take great care to ensure that the absence or \ndeparture of employees does not result in long-term disruptions to \nour operations. We also monitor staff turnover on a regular basis \nfrom both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective."

Appropriate quantitative \nand qualitative staffing aims to ensure that internal operating \nrequirements, business activities and Commerzbank’s strategy can \nbe implemented. \nEmployees are a key resource for Commerzbank. Human \nresources risk is systematically managed by Group Human \nResources with the aim of identifying, assessing and managing risks, \nfor instance by applying selected personnel tools. The Board of \nManaging Directors is regularly informed about human resources \nrisk.  \nOverall, the Bank will continue to monitor human resources risk. \nThere is a risk that the human resources risk situation will \ndeteriorate as a result of frequent structural changes due to a \nchange in Group strategy. Change and organisational measures \nhave already been initiated to counter human resources risk. \nBusiness strategy risk \nBusiness strategy risk is the medium- to long-term risk of negative \ninfluences on the achievement of Commerzbank’s strategic goals, \nfor example as a result of changes in the market or competitive \nenvironment, capital market requirements, regulatory/political \nfactors or the inadequate implementation of the Group strategy \n(primary risk drivers). \nGroup strategy is developed further in a process that takes both \nexternal and internal factors into account. On the basis of these \nfactors, the Board of Managing Directors sets out a sustainable \nbusiness strategy describing the major business activities and steps \nrequired to meet the targets. To ensure proper implementation of \nthe Group strategy to achieve the business targets, strategic \ncontrols are carried out through regular monitoring of quantitative \nand qualitative targets in the Group and the segments.  \nResponsibility for strategic corporate management lies with the \nBoard of Managing Directors. Specific business policy decisions \n(acquisition and sale of equity holdings > €300m) also require the \nauthorisation of the Supervisory Board’s Risk Committee. In \naddition, all major initiatives and projects are decided by the Board \nof Managing Directors. \nModel risk \nModel risk is the risk of incorrect management decisions based on \nan inaccurate depiction of reality by the models used. With regard \nto the causes of model risk we distinguish between model risk from \nexceeding model boundaries and model risk from model errors \n(manual errors in model development/implementation). In line with \nthe focus of the Group risk strategy, namely to ensure that the Bank \nhas adequate capital and liquidity, the models for assessing risk-\nbearing capacity (capital requirements under the Basel framework \nand economic capital requirements, respectively) and liquidity \nresources are central for risk management. \nThe basic principles of model risk management are the \nidentification and avoidance of model risks and appropriate \nconsideration of known model risks (e.g. through conservative \ncalibration or consideration of margins of conservatism or model \nreserves). Model risks that are unknown and hence cannot be \nmitigated are accepted as an inherent risk in the complexity of the \nCommerzbank business model. In respect of the governance of \nmodel risk management, requirements relating to model validation \nand model changes are established. \nThe war in the Ukraine and its geopolitical impact as well as the \neconomic secondary effects from the Corona pandemic pose \nchallenges for the risk models used. Commerzbank has introduced \nmeasures to counter the increased model risk and to ensure \nappropriate management even in the current phase.  \nThe initiative from 2022 to strengthen management of model risks \nwill further continue. This concerns both aspects of governance and \nthe scope of monitoring and validation activities. In addition, strategi-\ncally relevant models are currently being revised fundamenttally \n(various credit risk models). In this context, high standards in model \ndevelopment and initial validation play a major role."

      "text": "150 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nFurther development \nIn May 2017, a Polish court admitted a class action lawsuit against \na subsidiary of Commerzbank alleging the ineffectiveness of index \nclauses in loan agreements denominated in Swiss francs (CHF). \nSince then, various legal issues have come before the Polish courts \nand the ECJ. On 16 February 2023, the opinion of the Advocate \nGeneral of the ECJ in case C520/21, in proceedings against another \nbank, was presented, the subject of which is whether, in the event \na mortgage loan agreement is void in its entirety, the contracting \nparties can assert claims from a contracting party beyond \nreimbursement of the monetary consideration, in particular to \nremuneration. \nThe Advocate General points out that “it is a matter for the \nnational court to determine, by reference to national law, whether \nconsumers have the right to assert such claims and, if so, to rule on \ntheir merits.” If the referring court takes the view that national law \nentitles the consumer to claim additional benefits from the bank, \nDirective 93/13 does not preclude this. National courts may also \nhave the power to dismiss such actions if they are abusive. \nWith regard to the bank’s claims against the consumer, the \nAdvocate General also notes that “it is, in principle, a matter for the \nnational court to determine, by reference to domestic law, whether \n(...) a bank is entitled to assert against a consumer claims that go \nbeyond reimbursement of the loan capital transferred and payment \nof default interest at a statutory rate.”  \nHowever, the Advocate General considers that Directive 93/13, \neven if this were permissible under national law, excludes those \nclaims, since it is clear from its general notion that, rather than \nseeking to ensure a contractual balance between the rights and \nobligations of the parties to the contract, it seeks to avoid an \nimbalance between those rights and obligations to the detriment of \nconsumers. In addition, a bank cannot derive any economic benefit \ncreated by its own unlawful behaviour. The sanction of free credit is \nthe normal consequence of the ex tunc annulment of the loan \nagreement upon the removal of its unfair terms. \nThe Advocate General’s opinion is not binding on the ECJ, nor is \nit binding in the national courts and the Polish Supreme Court. The \nECJ can share the position of the Advocate General’s, but it may also \nrule otherwise, interpreting Directive 93/13 differently.  \nTaking into account the opinion of the Advocate General at the \nECJ in case C520/21 against another bank, the subsidiary has \nperformed a reassessment of the assumptions of the model applied \nas at the balance sheet date in order to assess the impact on the \nclaims and the settlement programme. In the opinion of the \nsubsidiary, given the lack of binding force of the opinion, as at the \nbalance sheet date, there is no need to change the assumptions \napplied. The subsidiary will await the ECJ’s ruling and the \nsubsequent development of Polish jurisprudence. The ruling will be \nof significant importance for the shaping of case law in matters of \nforeign currency indexed loans. It will also be reflected in the \nparameters of the model, such as the distribution of expected court \nrulings or scenarios, and will affect the behaviour of borrowers in \nterms of willingness to accept settlements or to file lawsuits. It \ncannot be ruled out that such future events may have a significant \nnegative impact on the estimation of the legal risk associated with \nmortgage loans in Swiss francs in the future. If the periodic \nmonitoring of the parameters and assumptions of the model \nnecessitates changes, they will be implemented. \nThis has no effect on Commerzbank’s Group financial statements \nas at 31 December 2022. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDisclaimer \nCommerzbank’s internal risk measurement methods and models \nwhich form the basis for the calculation of the figures shown in this \nreport are state-of-the-art and based on banking sector practice. \nThe risk models produce results appropriate to the management of \nthe Bank. The measurement approaches are regularly reviewed by \nRisk Controlling and Internal Audit as well as by German and \nEuropean \nsupervisory \nauthorities. \nDespite \nbeing \ncarefully \ndeveloped and regularly checked, models cannot cover all the \ninfluencing factors that have an impact in reality or illustrate their \ncomplex behaviour and interactions. These limits to risk modelling \napply in particular in extreme situations. Supplementary stress tests \nand scenario analyses can only show examples of the risks to which \na portfolio may be exposed in extreme market situations; stress-\ntesting all imaginable scenarios is not feasible. They cannot \ndefinitively estimate the maximum loss should an extreme event \noccur."

In the \nprevious year, the third AT1 bond under the issuance programme \nwas successfully issued. The bond has a volume of €500m and a \nfixed coupon of 4.25% per annum. The instrument has a perpetual \nmaturity and the first call date is in the period from October 2027 \nto April 2028. The issuing costs amounted to €4.5m. \n \nOther changes \nAs \nat \n31 December \n2022, \nthe \nsubscribed \ncapital \nof  \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft pursuant to the Bank’s Articles of \nAssociation was €1,252m and was divided into 1,252,357,634 no-\npar-value shares (accounting value per share of €1.00).  \nA proposal to pay a dividend of €0.20 per share out of  \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s net profit for the 2022 financial \nyear will be put before the AGM. With 1 252 357 634 issued shares, \nthere results a distribution of €250m. No dividend was paid in the \nprevious year. \n \nAs at 31 December 2022, and as in the previous year, there was \nno material impact on “Other reserves” from non-current assets \nheld for sale and disposal groups. \nAs at 31 December 2022, the portion of inactive hedging \nrelationships in the cash flow hedge reserve was €-3m (previous \nyear: €-5m), and the portion of active hedging relationships was €-\n114m (previous year: €-83m).  \nThe main changes in the currency translation reserve in the \ncurrent financial year were due to the US dollar, Polish zloty, British \npound, Hungarian forint and Russian rouble. \nOther changes primarily include changes in the group of \nconsolidated companies and changes from taxes not recognised in \nthe income statement. \nThe changes in ownership interests in retained earnings of €-2m \n(previous year: €-1m) resulted from the purchase of additional \ninterests in already consolidated companies."

The parent company is \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, which is registered in the \nCommercial Register at the District Court of Frankfurt/Main under \nregistration no. HRB 32000. Commerzbank is one of Germany’s \nleading banks for private and corporate clients and an \ninternationally active commercial bank. Our Group financial \nstatements as at 31 December 2022 were prepared in accordance \nwith Art. 315 e of the German Commercial Code (Handels-\ngesetzbuch, or “HGB”) and Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 (the IAS \nRegulation). In addition, other regulations for adopting certain \ninternational accounting standards on the basis of the International \nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS) approved and published by \nthe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and their \ninterpretation by the IFRS Interpretations Committee have also \nbeen applied. \nAll standards and interpretations that are mandatory within the \nEU in the 2022 financial year have been applied. We have not \napplied standards and interpretations that are not required until the \n2023 financial year or later. \nThe information required under IFRS 7.31 to 7.42 (nature and \nextent of exposure to risks arising from financial instruments) is \nbasically reported in the Group management report, Risk section \n(for further information please refer to notes 33 and 34). \nThe Group management report, including the separate Group \nrisk report appears on pages 73 to 150 of this Annual Report. \nThe Group financial statements are prepared in euros, the \nreporting currency of the Group. Unless otherwise indicated, all \namounts are shown in millions of euros. All items under \n€500,000.00 are presented as €0.00, and zero items are denoted by \na dash. Due to rounding, in some cases the individual figures \npresented may not add up precisely to the totals provided. \nFor information on environmental, social and governance (ESG) \nrisks, we refer to the management report of this Annual Report \n(pages 145 ff.). \n(1) Initially applicable, revised and new standards \nStandards to be applied for the first time \n \nGlobal minimum taxation \nVarious agreements have been reached on a global level, including \nan agreement by over 135 countries to introduce a global minimum \ntax rate of 15%, in order to address concerns about large \nmultinationals’ unequal distribution of their profits and about \nunequal tax payments. The OECD published a draft legal framework \nin December 2021, followed by detailed guidelines in March 2022, \nto be used by individual countries that have signed the agreement \nto amend their local tax laws. The Group may become subject to the \nminimum tax as soon as the changes in the tax laws take effect, or \nare about to take effect, in the countries in which Commerzbank \nGroup operates.  \nAs at the date on which the consolidated financial statements \nwere released for publication, legislation relating to the minimum \ntax did not apply, and was not about to apply, in any of the countries \nin which the Group operated. The Group may become subject to the \nminimum tax because it has various subsidiaries that may have an \neffective tax rate of less than 15%. GM-Tax, the Group’s reporting \nand control unit for tax obligations, is closely following the progress \nof the legislative process in each country in which the Group \noperates and has conducted an initial impact analysis. Based on the \ndata from completed financial years used for this impact analysis, \nglobal minimum taxation is not expected to cause a significant tax \nburden in any jurisdiction in which a Group company operates. An \nupdate and implementation plan is being formulated for the relevant \nfinancial years. \n \nIBOR reform \nAs part of the Interbank Offered Rates reform (IBOR reform), the \nIBOR reference rates and the Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA) \nhave been replaced by other reference rates called risk-free rates \n(RFR). On 31 December 2021, Commerzbank carried out the \nconversion of various LIBOR interest rates to the respective new \nreference interest rates for GBP, CHF and JPY as well as the \nconversion of EONIA to €STR in EUR. The SONIA have been used \nfor new business in GBP, SARON for new business in CHF and \nTONA for JPY since 1 January 2022 respectively. Transactions \ndenominated in EUR are conducted by reference to €STR or \nEURIBOR (which continues to exist). The necessary methodological \nand technical changes have been fully implemented in the relevant \nsystems and processes for trading and settlement. The IBOR project, \nwhich ran in 2021, was terminated at the end of 2021 as planned. \nNotes"

IFRS 17 aims to achieve consistent, principles-based \naccounting for insurance contracts. It stipulates that insurance \nliabilities must be measured at the current settlement amount, \ninstead of at historical cost. The IASB’s intention in issuing IFRS 17 \nis to create a uniform basis for recognising, measuring, reporting \nand making disclosures in the notes regarding insurance contracts. \nOther matters relating to insurance-specific contracts were defined \nin the additional amendments published. The standard must be \napplied in the EU for financial years beginning on or after 1 January \n2023.

Until 30 June 2022 \nthe option for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 was \napplied (see Note 42). Beside this change, we have applied the same \naccounting and measurement policies in these Group financial \nstatements as in our Group financial statements as at 31 December \n2021 (see page 178 ff. of the Annual Report 2021).  \n \n(3) Significant principles and uncertainties in estimates  \nSignificant principles  \nUniform accounting and measurement methods explained in the \nnotes below are used throughout Commerzbank Group in preparing \nthe financial statements. \nThe Group financial statements are based on the going concern \nprinciple. Financial assets and liabilities are generally measured at \namortised cost, unless a different form of measurement is required \nby IFRS standards. In particular, this applies to certain financial \ninstruments classified in accordance with IFRS 9 and investment \nproperties.  \nIncome and expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis; they \nare recognised in the income statement for the period to which they \nare attributable in economic terms. Interest from all contractual \nagreements relating to financial assets or liabilities is reported in \nnet interest income on an accrual basis. We have reported negative \ninterest separately in net interest income (see Note 9). Dividend \nincome is only recognised where a corresponding legal entitlement \nexists. Commission income and expenses are recognised on the \nbasis of the accounting treatment of the associated financial \ninstruments and on the basis of the nature of the activity. \nCommission income for services which are performed over a given \nperiod is recognised over the period in which the service is \nperformed. Fees associated with the completion of a particular \nservice are recognised at the time of completion of the service. \nPerformance-related fees are recognised when the performance \ncriteria are met. Commission income on trading transactions \ncarried out on behalf of customers is reported in net commission \nincome.  \nBorrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, \nconstruction or production of a significant tangible or intangible asset \nare capitalised in the balance sheet, provided that a period of at least \n12 months is required to prepare the asset for its intended use. \nAssets and liabilities must be posted in the balance sheet as \ngross (not netted). However, in accordance with IAS 32.42, financial \nassets and liabilities relating to the same counterparty are netted \nand shown in the balance sheet on a net basis if there is a legally \nenforceable right to net the amounts and the transactions are \nfulfilled on a net basis or the asset is realised simultaneously with \nthe settlement of the liability. In addition to the netting of positive \nand negative fair values attributable to derivatives with clearing \nagreements and any variation margins payable on them, this also \napplies to the netting of claims and liabilities in reverse repo and \nrepo transactions with central and bilateral counterparties, provided \nthey have the same term. \nFor fully consolidated companies and holdings in companies \naccounted for using the equity method in the Group financial \nstatements we have generally used financial statements prepared as \nat 31 December 2022. As regards companies accounted for using \nthe equity method, in some cases we use the most recent audited \nfinancial statements under national GAAP if the company’s financial \nstatements for the current financial year are not yet available at the \ndate the Group financial statements are being prepared.  \nWhere there is an intention to sell the assets and liabilities of \nsubsidiaries and companies accounted for using the equity method \nand their sale is highly probable within one year, they are reported \nseparately in the relevant balance sheet items and notes (see \nNotes 47 and 48) and in the statement of changes in equity in \naccordance with IFRS 5 until transfer of the shares is completed. \nNote 37 contains a breakdown of all balance sheet items into \nshort-term and long-term items. The maturities for all financial \ninstruments held as liabilities, financial guarantees and irrevocable \nlending commitments with contractual maturity dates are also \nreported in this note. \nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign \ncurrencies and pending spot foreign exchange transactions are \ntranslated at the spot mid-rate on the reporting date. Realised \nincome and expenses are normally translated using the spot rate \napplying on the date of realisation.  \nAverage exchange rates may also be used to translate income \nand expenses, provided the prices on the reporting date have not \nundergone major fluctuations. Hedged expenses and income are \ntranslated using the hedging rate. The expenses and income \nresulting from the translation of items in the balance sheet are \nrecognised in the net income from financial assets and liabilities \nmeasured at fair value through profit and loss. \nNon-monetary items are translated using the current rate \nmethod. Gains and losses on the translation of non-monetary items \nare recognised either in equity or profit or loss depending on the \nway the net gain or loss is recognised. \nMonetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities in the financial \nstatements of consolidated subsidiaries and companies accounted"

For simplification purposes, a price can \nbe used for translation which represents an approximation of the \nexchange rate on the transaction date, for example the average \nexchange rate over a given period. All differences arising on \ntranslation are recognised as a separate component of equity in the \ncurrency translation reserve. Effects arising from the translation of \nthe capital components of subsidiaries included in the consolidation \nof the capital accounts are recognised in equity in the currency \ntranslation reserve. On the date of the sale or partial sale of \ncompanies reporting in foreign currency, the translation gains or \nlosses are recognised in other net income. Even if an equity holding \nin a foreign currency is reduced without being fully deconsolidated, \nthe effect of this partial reduction on the currency translation \nreserve is recognised in profit or loss. \nUncertainties in estimates  \nThe Group financial statements include values which are \ndetermined, as permitted, on the basis of estimates and judgements. \nThe estimates and judgements used are based on past experience \nand other factors, such as planning and expectations or forecasts of \nfuture events that are considered likely as far as we know today. The \nestimates and judgements themselves and the underlying \nestimation methods and judgement factors are reviewed regularly \nand compared with actual results. Nonetheless, the actual outturns \nmay differ from the estimates in the instances listed below. \nEstimation uncertainties arise, among other things, in the \ncalculation of fair values or the expected cash flows of financial \ninstruments and in the creation of loan loss provisions, which may \noccur in particular when determining the Secondary-Effects-Top-\nLevel-Adjustments. As climate and environmental risks are \n“horizontal risks”, they can influence different types of risk, in \nparticular the credit risk and the associated loan loss provisions. \nGreater detail can be found in the ESG (environmental, social and \ngovernance) risks section of the Group risk report in the Group \nmanagement report. For the calculation of loan loss provisions, \nplease also refer to the counterparty risk section of the Group risk \nreport within the Group management report. \nThere are also uncertainties surrounding the fair value of \ninvestment properties, in the accounting of pension obligations, and \nin provisions for tax-related operational risks. \nPension obligations are measured based on the projected unit \ncredit method for defined benefit pension plans. In measuring such \nobligations, assumptions have to be made, in particular regarding \nthe discount rate, the long-term rate of increase in pensions, and \naverage life expectancy. Changes in the underlying assumptions \nfrom year to year and divergences from the actual annual effects are \nreported as remeasurements without effect on income in retained \nearnings (see Note 55 on the impact of changes in parameters). \nProvisions for tax-related operational risks are recognised taking \ninto account the most current information from the ongoing tax \naudit and case law (see Note 50). \nThere are also uncertainties in the recognition of deferred tax \nassets.  \nThe assumptions and parameters underlying the estimates we \nhave made are based on the exercise of appropriate judgement by \nmanagement. This applies in particular to the appropriate selection \nand use of parameters, assumptions and modelling techniques \nwhen valuing financial instruments for which there are no market \nprices and no comparative parameters observable on the market. \nWhere differing valuation models lead to a range of different \npotential valuations, management uses its judgement to determine \nthe choice of the model to be used. \nThe following items in the financial statements are also subject \nto the judgement of management: \n the impairment of loans and securities and the recognition of \nprovisions for off-balance-sheet lending exposures, in particular \nthe analysis of the borrower’s financial situation and the \ndetermination of the expected cash flows including the \nrecognition, level and timing of the realisation of collateral (see \nNote 31); \n impairment testing of other financial assets such as holdings in \ncompanies accounted for using the equity method and financial \ninstruments held for sale, in particular the choice of criteria used \nto determine whether an asset is impaired (see Note 47); \n Impairment testing of deferred tax assets, in particular \ndetermining the methodology used for tax planning and to \nassess the probability that the expected future tax results will \nactually occur (see Notes 49 and 50), as well as accounting for \ntax risk positions; the assessment of the availability of tax assets \nis primarily based on the potential future taxable income based \non our multi-year planning;"

Any gains or losses realised \nin the Group on intragroup transactions are likewise consolidated \nas part of interim results elimination. The ability of the \nCommerzbank Group to access or use assets and monitor the \nliabilities of subsidiaries including structured entities, associated \ncompanies and joint ventures can be subject to legal, regulatory and \ncontractual restrictions. \n(5) Subsidiaries and business combinations \n \nSubsidiaries are entities which are directly or indirectly controlled \nby Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, because Commerzbank has \nthe power to direct the relevant activities of the entity, has exposure, \nor rights, to significant variable returns from its involvement and \nhas the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount \nof its returns. When deciding whether or not to consolidate, we \nreview a range of factors such as voting rights, the object and \nstructure of the company and our ability to exert influence. If voting \nrights are the sole and immediate dominant factor in directing the \nrelevant activities, control can be established more in these cases. \nWe are nonetheless obliged to investigate whether there are any \nother factors present, such as legal provisions or contractual \nagreements, which prevent Commerzbank from exercising control \nin spite of holding a majority of voting rights. Other factors can also \nlead to control, for example if Commerzbank and the entity stand in \na principal-agent relationship. In this case, another party with \ndecision-making powers acts as agent for Commerzbank, but does \nnot control the entity, because it only exercises powers which have \nbeen delegated by Commerzbank (the principal). Consolidation \ntakes place from the time when the Group acquires control of the \nsubsidiary. \nAs part of the first-time consolidation of capital, we completely \nremeasure the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries irrespective of \nthe interest held at the time of acquisition. The assets and liabilities \nthen measured at fair value are included in the Group balance sheet \nnet of deferred taxes; identified hidden reserves and liabilities are \naccounted for in accordance with the applicable standards in \nsubsequent reporting periods. Any difference over net assets on \nremeasurement is recognised as goodwill. Any negative goodwill is \nreported in the income statement. \nHoldings in subsidiaries not consolidated for reasons of \nimmateriality and holdings in associated companies and joint \nventures which, because of their immateriality, are not accounted \nfor using the equity method, are shown at their fair value under \nfinancial assets in the Mandatorily Fair Value P&L category. \nSubsidiaries are deconsolidated as at the date on which the Bank \nloses its control over them. \n(6) Associated companies and joint ventures \n \nAssociated companies are entities over which Commerzbank  \nAktiengesellschaft has a significant direct or indirect influence, but \ndoes not control. A significant influence is assumed to exist where \nthe share of voting rights is between 20% and 50%. Further factors \nindicating significant influence could, for example, be membership \nof an executive or Supervisory Board or significant transactions \nwith the company. \nA joint arrangement is where two or more parties agree \ncontractually to exercise joint control over this arrangement. A joint \narrangement can be a joint venture or a joint operation. In the \nCommerzbank Group there are only joint ventures.  \nAssociated companies and joint ventures are ordinarily \naccounted for using the equity method and are reported in the \nbalance sheet under holdings in companies accounted for using the \nequity method.  \nThe acquisition cost of these investments including goodwill is \ndetermined at the time of their initial consolidation, applying by \nanalogy the same rules as for subsidiaries. If associated companies \nand joint ventures are material, appropriate adjustments are made \nto the carrying value in the accounts, in accordance with \ndevelopments in the company’s equity. Losses attributable to \ncompanies accounted for using the equity method are only \nrecognised up to the level of the carrying value (see Note 43). \nLosses in excess of this amount are not recognised, since there is \nno obligation to offset excess losses. Future profits are first offset \nagainst unrecognised losses. \nEquity accounting for holdings in associated companies ends on \nthe date that the Group ceases to exert significant influence over \nthe associated company. Equity accounting for joint ventures ends \non the date that joint control of the venture comes to an end"

Examples of \nstructured entities are securitisation companies, leasing structured \nentities and some investment funds. \nCommerzbank also acts as sponsor to structured entities in \nwhich it does not have an equity holding.

All consolidated structured \nentities and structured entities that have not been consolidated for \nmateriality reasons are listed in Note 70. \n \n(8) Consolidated companies \n \nThe Group financial statements include all material subsidiaries \nwhich are directly or indirectly controlled by Commerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft. These also include material structured entities. \nSignificant associated companies and joint ventures are accounted \nfor using the equity method.  \nSubsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures of minor \nsignificance for the Group’s assets, liabilities financial position and \nfinancial performance are not fully consolidated or not accounted \nfor using the equity method; instead, they are measured at fair value \nand reported under “Financial assets – Mandatorily fair value P&L”.  \nPlease refer to Note 70 for more information on the structure of \nCommerzbank Group including a full list of the Group’s ownership \ninterests. \n \nDisposal Commerzbank ZRT \n \nThe sale of Commerzbank Zrt., Budapest, a wholly-owned \nHungarian subsidiary, to Erste Group Hungary Zrt. was completed \nduring the fourth quarter of 2022, following approval by the banking \nsupervisory and antitrust authorities. The sale resulted in a negative \neffect of €–49m in other net income. This loss relates to the \nCorporate Clients segment and results in particular from the \nreversal of the negative foreign currency reserve. \n \nChanges in the previous financial year  \n \nAs at 31 December 2021, Gesellschaft für Kreditsicherung mbH was \nincluded in the scope of consolidation. Commerzbank AG has a 63% \nholding in this company. \nThe fair value of its participation in Gesellschaft für \nKreditsicherung mbH was €111m as at the reporting date. Shares \nwith a value of €171m and other assets and liabilities totalling €2m \nwere added. Non-controlling interests of €64m were recorded in \naccordance with the shareholding. No goodwill arose from this."

      "text": "184 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nNotes to the balance sheet \n \nFinancial assets and liabilities in accordance with IFRS 9 \nGeneral classification and measurement \nIn accordance with IFRS 9, all financial assets and liabilities – which \nalso include derivative financial instruments – must be recognised \nin the balance sheet. A financial instrument is a contract that gives \nrise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity \ninstrument of another. On initial recognition, financial instruments \nare measured at fair value. For financial instruments that are not \nmeasured at fair value through profit and loss, directly attributable \ntransaction costs are included in the fair values as acquisition-\nrelated costs, which increase the fair value of financial assets or \nreduce the fair value of financial liabilities. In accordance with \nIFRS 13, fair value is defined as the exit price, i.e. the price that the \nmarket participant would receive for the sale of an asset or pay to \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction. The fair value is a price \nobserved on an active market (mark-to-market) or determined using \nvaluation models (mark-to-model). The relevant inputs for the \nvaluation model are either observed directly on the market or, if not \nobservable on the market, are estimates made by experts. \nIn \nsubsequent \nmeasurement, \nfinancial \ninstruments \nare \nrecognised in the balance sheet either at (amortised) cost or at fair \nvalue, depending on the category.  \na) Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments \nA financial asset or a financial liability is generally recognised in the \nbalance sheet when Commerzbank Group becomes a party to the \ncontractual provisions of the financial instrument. For regular-way \npurchases or sales of financial assets in the cash market the trading \nand settlement dates normally differ. These regular-way cash \nmarket purchases and sales may be recognised using either trade \ndate or settlement date accounting. In the Commerzbank Group, \nregular-way cash market purchases and sales of financial assets are \naccounted for on their recognition and disposal on the trade date. \nThe derecognition rules of IFRS 9 are based both on the concept \nof risks and rewards and on the concept of control. However, when \ndeciding whether an asset qualifies for derecognition, the \nevaluation of the transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership \ntakes precedence over the evaluation of the transfer of control. If \nthe risks and rewards are transferred only partially and control over \nthe asset is retained, the continuing involvement approach is used. \nThe financial asset continues to be recognised to the extent of the \nGroup’s continuing involvement, and special accounting policies \napply. The extent of the continuing involvement is the extent to \nwhich the Group is exposed to changes in the value of the \ntransferred asset. A financial liability (or part of a financial liability) \nis derecognised when it is extinguished, i.e. when the obligations \narising from the contract are discharged or cancelled or expire. The \nrepurchase of own debt instruments is also a transfer of financial \nliabilities that qualifies for derecognition. Any differences between \nthe carrying value of the liability (including discounts and premiums) \nand the purchase price are recognised in profit or loss; if the asset \nis sold again at a later date a new balance sheet liability is \nrecognised at cost equal to the price at which the asset was sold. \nDifferences between this cost and the repayment amount are \nallocated over the term of the debt instrument using the effective \ninterest rate method. \nSome amendments of contractual terms and conditions between \nborrowers and the Bank, for example as a consequence of \nforbearance measures or restructuring, can lead to derecognition. \nA substantial modification of the contractual terms and conditions \nof a financial instrument between an existing borrower and the \nBank leads to the derecognition of the original financial asset and \nthe recognition of a new financial instrument.  \nSimilarly, a substantial modification of the contractual terms and \nconditions of an existing debt instrument is to be treated as a \nrepayment of the original financial liability. In quantitative terms, an \namendment of the contractual terms and conditions is regarded as \nsubstantive if the discounted net present value of the cash flows \nunder the new contractual terms and conditions varies by at least \n10% from the discounted net present value of the residual cash \nflows of the original debt instrument."

If Commerzbank \nGroup is the guarantee holder, the financial guarantee is not \nrecorded in the accounts and is only recognised when determining \nan impairment of a guaranteed asset. As the issuer, Commerzbank \nGroup recognises the liability arising from a financial guarantee at \ninception. Initial measurement is at fair value at the time of \nrecognition. In general terms, the fair value of a financial guarantee \ncontract at inception is zero because for fair market contracts the \nvalue of the premium agreed normally corresponds to the value of \nthe guarantee obligation (net method). Subsequent measurement is \nat the higher of amortised cost or the provision that is required to \nbe recognised if payment of the guarantee becomes probable. \ne) Embedded derivatives \nEmbedded derivatives are derivatives that are integrated into \nprimary financial instruments. These include, for example, reverse \nconvertible bonds (bonds that may be repaid in the form of equities) \nor bonds with index-linked interest payments. \nIn accordance with IFRS 9, we only separate those derivatives \nthat are embedded in financial liabilities. Financial assets are \nassessed in their entirety, meaning that the host contract is not \naccounted for separately from the embedded derivative. Instead, \nfinancial assets are classified based on the business model and their \ncontractual terms and conditions. \nIn the case of financial liabilities, such a separation for \naccounting purposes is only required if the following three \nconditions are met: \n The economic characteristics and risks of the embedded \nderivative are not closely related to those of the host contract. \n A separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded \nderivative would meet the definition of a derivative under IFRS 9. \n The primary financial liability is not measured at fair value \nthrough profit or loss. \nIn this case, the embedded derivative to be separated is regarded \nas part of the held-for-trading category and is recognised at fair value. \nChanges on remeasurement are recognised in the net income from \nfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit and \nloss. The host contract is accounted for and measured applying the \nrules of the category to which the financial instrument is assigned. \nIf the above three conditions are not cumulatively met, the \nembedded derivative is not shown separately and the total financial \ninstrument or structured product is measured as a whole in \naccordance with the general provisions of the category to which the \nfinancial liability is assigned."

As part of the closure of \nthe Asset & Capital Recovery segment (run-off portfolio), this \nportfolio was grouped under Treasury and has been administered \nby the Investment Office since 1 January 2019 (see also Note 58). \nDistribution and sales activities for the portfolio have been \ndiscontinued.

The \nobjective of the portfolio is to generate contractually agreed cash \nflows. The contractually agreed cash flows are solely payments of \ninterest and principal for the purposes of IFRS 9. The change of \nbusiness model resulted in reclassification from the mFVPL \nmeasurement category to the AC measurement category.  \nThe effective interest rate calculated at the time of \nreclassification was 2.8%. In the 2022 financial year the interest \nincome for the reclassified portfolio amounted to €88m (previous \nyear: €88m). There was no interest expense in the current financial \nyear or the previous financial year. \nThe fair value of the portfolio at 31 December 2022 was €1.6bn \n(previous year: €3.1bn).

This would have \nresulted in net income of €42m (previous year: €28m), which would \nhave been the consequence of both credit spread and interest rate-\nrelated effects. Since reclassification, the cash flows of the \nunderlying transactions of the portfolio have been assigned to the \nportfolio fair value hedge accounting of Commerzbank."

Due to several increases in key interest rates in \nthe second half of the financial year, there is no longer any need \nunder IAS 20 to recognise an interest rate subsidy for the time to \nmaturity. In total, interest income of €190m (previous year: €442m) \nwas received in the 2022 financial year."

      "text": "194 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \n(31) Credit risks and credit losses \nPrinciples and measurements  \nIFRS 9 stipulates that impairments for credit risks from loans and \nsecurities that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss \nmust be recognised using a three-stage model based on expected \ncredit losses.  \nIn the Commerzbank Group, the following financial instruments \nare included in the scope of this impairment model: \n financial assets in the form of loans and advances as well as debt \nsecurities measured at amortised cost; \n financial assets in the form of loans and advances as well as debt \nsecurities measured at fair value through other comprehensive \nincome (FVOCI); \n lease receivables; \n irrevocable lending commitments which under IFRS 9 are not \nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss;  \n financial guarantees within the scope of IFRS 9 that are not \nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss; \n guarantees and letters of credit that do not meet the definition \nof a “financial guarantee” under IFRS 9, Appendix A. \n \nThe Group determines the impairment using a three-stage \nmodel based on the following requirements: \nIn stage 1, as a rule all financial instruments are recognised if \ntheir risk of a loan loss (hereinafter default risk) has not increased \nsignificantly since their initial recognition. In addition, stage 1 \nincludes all transactions with limited default risk on the reporting \ndate (option under IFRS 9). These are financial instruments with \nstates, local or regional authorities of the OECD whose internal \ncredit rating on the reporting date is in the investment grade range \n(corresponding to Commerzbank rating 2.8 or better). For financial \ninstruments in stage 1, an impairment must be recognised in the \namount of the expected credit losses from possible events of default \nover the term of the transaction, subject to a maximum of 12 months \n(12-month ECL). \nStage 2 includes those financial instruments with default risk \nthat has increased significantly since their initial recognition and \nwhich, as at the financial reporting date, cannot be classified as \ntransactions with limited default risk. In addition to a client-specific \nchange in the probability of default (PD), Commerzbank defines \nfurther qualitative criteria whose presence is assumed to denote a \nsignificant increase in default risk. Instruments are then allocated \nto stage 2 independently of the individual change in PD. \nImpairments in stage 2 are recognised in the amount of the financial \ninstrument’s lifetime expected credit loss (LECL). For financial \ninstruments that are committed for an unlimited period (open \ntransactions), a top-down approach is used to determine the LECL \nas a percentage of the current loss at default (LaD) on the basis of \nrealised historical losses. \nFinancial instruments that are classified as impaired as at the \nreporting date are allocated to stage 3. As the criterion for this, \nCommerzbank uses its definition of a default pursuant to Article 178 \nCRR as well as the supplementary EBA guidance on the application \nof the definition of default pursuant to Article 178 of Regulation (EU) \nNo. 575/2013. This approach is consistent because the ECL \ncalculation also uses statistical risk parameters derived from the \nBasel IRB approach, which are modified to meet the requirements \nof IFRS 9.  \nThe following events can be indicative of a customer default: \n over 90 days past due; \n unlikely to pay; \n financial rescue/distressed restructuring with concessions; \n the Bank has demanded immediate repayment of its claims; \n the customer is in insolvency. \n \nThe LECL is likewise used as the value of the required \nimpairment for stage-3 financial instruments in default. When \ndetermining the LECL, the Group distinguishes in principle \nbetween significant and insignificant cases. The amount of the \nLECL for insignificant transactions (volumes up to €5m) is \ndetermined based on statistical risk parameters. The LECL for \nsignificant transactions (volumes greater than €5m) is the expected \nvalue of the losses derived from individual expert assessments of \nfuture cash flows based on several potential scenarios and their \nprobability of occurrence. The scenarios and probabilities are based \non assessments by recovery and resolution specialists. For each \nscenario – without regard to whether it is a continuation or sale \nscenario – the timing and amount of the expected future cash flows \nare estimated. Both the customer-specific and the macroeconomic \nsituation are taken into account (for example currency restrictions, \ncurrency value fluctuations, commodity price developments), as \nwell as the sector environment, with a view to the future. The \nestimate is also based on external information. Sources include \nindices (e.g. World Corruption Index), forecasts (e.g. by the IMF), \ninformation from global associations of financial service providers \n(e.g. the Institute of International Finance) and publications from \nrating agencies and auditing firms."

After recovery, a new \nassessment is made based on the updated rating information to see \nif the default risk has increased significantly since initial recognition \nin the balance sheet and the instrument is allocated to stage 1 or \nstage 2 accordingly. \nFinancial instruments which when initially recognised are \nalready considered impaired as per the aforementioned definition \n(“purchased or originated credit-impaired”, or “POCI”, financial \ninstruments) are handled outside the three-stage impairment model \nand are therefore not allocated to any of the three stages. The initial \nrecognition is based on fair value without recording an impairment, \nbut using an effective interest rate that is adjusted for \ncreditworthiness. The impairment recognised in the income \nstatement in subsequent periods equals the cumulative change in \nthe LECL since the initial recognition in the balance sheet. The \nLECL remains the basis for the measurement, even if the value of \nthe financial instrument has increased. \nClaims are written off in the balance sheet as soon as it is \nreasonable to assume that a financial asset is not realisable in full \nor in part and that the claims are therefore uncollectible. \nUncollectibility may arise in the settlement process for various \nobjective reasons, such as the demise of the borrower without \nrealisable assets in the estate or completion of insolvency \nproceedings without further prospect of payments. Moreover, loans \nare generally regarded as (partially) uncollectible at the latest 720 \ndays after their due date and are (partially) written down to the \nexpected recoverable amount within the framework of existing loan \nloss provisions. Such a (partial) write-down has no direct impact on \nongoing debt collection measures. \nAssessment of a significant increase in default risk \nCommerzbank’s rating systems combine into the customer-specific \nprobability of default (PD) all available quantitative and qualitative \ninformation relevant for forecasting the default risk. This metric is \nbased primarily on a statistical selection and weighting of all \navailable indicators. In addition, the PD adjusted in accordance with \nIFRS 9 requirements takes into account not only historical \ninformation and the current economic environment but also, in \nparticular, forward-looking information such as the forecast for the \ndevelopment of macroeconomic conditions. \nCommerzbank essentially uses the probability of default (PD) as \na frame of reference for assessing whether the default risk of a \nfinancial instrument has increased significantly since the date of its \ninitial recognition. By anchoring the review of the relative transfer \ncriterion in the robust processes and procedures of the Bank’s \nGroup-wide credit risk management framework (in particular, early \nidentification of credit risk, controlling of overdrafts and the re-\nrating process), the Bank ensures that a significant increase in the \ndefault risk is identified in a reliable and timely manner based on \nobjective criteria.  \nCommerzbank applies some key additional qualitative criteria \nfor the allocation to stage 2. These are: \n overdrafts > 20 days; \n clients in intensive care whose Commerzbank credit rating is 4.6 \nor worse on the reporting date; \n clients in intensive care whose Commerzbank credit rating on \nthe reporting date is 4.0 or worse and whose external credit \nrating is 5.0 or worse; \n customers who are granted a forbearance measure according to \nArticle 47b CRR that does not lead to a default (stage 3); \n guarantees and letters of credit that do not meet the definition \nof a “financial guarantee” under IFRS 9, Appendix A. \nFor further information on procedures and processes as well as \ngovernance in credit risk management at Commerzbank, please \nrefer to the statements in the Group Management Report (pages \n106 ff.). \nThe review to determine whether the default risk as at the \nfinancial reporting date has risen significantly since the initial \nrecognition of the respective financial instrument is performed as \nat the end of the reporting period. This review compares the \nobserved probability of default over the residual maturity of the \nfinancial instrument (lifetime PD) against the lifetime PD over the \nsame period as expected on the date of initial recognition. In \naccordance with IFRS requirements, in some subportfolios, the \noriginal and current PD are compared based on the probability of \ndefault over a period of 12 months after the end of the reporting \nperiod (12-month PD). In these cases, the Bank uses equivalence \nanalyses to demonstrate that no material variances have occurred \ncompared with an assessment using the lifetime PD. \nA quantile and then thresholds in the form of rating levels are set \nusing a statistical procedure in order to determine whether an \nincrease in the PD compared with the initial recognition date is \n“significant”. These thresholds, which are differentiated by rating \nmodels, represent a critical degree of variance from the expectation \nof the average PD development. If the current PD exceeds this \nthreshold, a critical deviation is present and leads to an assignment \nto stage 2."

      "text": "196 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nIn order to ensure an economically sound allocation of the stage, \ntransaction-specific factors are taken into account, including the \nextent of the PD at the initial recognition date, the term (to date) \nand the remaining term of the transaction.  \nCommerzbank generally refrains from checking whether there is \na significant increase in the default risk as at the reporting date \ncompared to the time of acquisition of the relevant financial \ninstrument for those transactions for which there is a low default \nrisk as at the reporting date (IFRS 9 option). These are financial \ninstruments with states, local or regional authorities of the OECD \nwhose internal credit rating on the reporting date is in the \ninvestment grade range (corresponding to Commerzbank rating 2.8 \nor better).  \nFinancial instruments are retransferred from stage 2 to stage 1 \nif at the end of the reporting period the default risk is no longer \nsignificantly elevated compared with the initial recognition date. \nCalculation of expected credit loss (ECL) \nCommerzbank calculates the ECL as the probability-weighted, \nunbiased and discounted expected value of future loan losses over \nthe total residual maturity of the respective financial instrument. \nThe 12-month ECL used for the recognition of impairments in \nstage 1 is the portion of the LECL that results from default events \nwhich are expected to occur within 12 months following the end of \nthe reporting period. \nThe ECL for stage 1 and stage 2 as well as for insignificant \nfinancial instruments in stage 3 is determined on an individual \ntransaction basis taking into account statistical risk parameters. \nThese parameters have been derived from the Basel IRB approach \nand modified to meet the requirements of IFRS 9.  \nThe significant main parameters used in this determination \ninclude: \n the customer-specific probability of default (PD); \n the loss given default (LGD); and \n the exposure at default (EaD). \nAll risk parameters used from the Bank’s internal models have \nbeen adjusted to meet the specific requirements of IFRS 9, and the \nforecast horizon has been extended accordingly to cover the entire \nterm of the financial instruments. For example, the forecast for the \ndevelopment of the exposure over the entire term of the financial \ninstrument therefore also includes, in particular, contractual and \nstatutory termination rights. \nIn the case of loan products that consist of a utilised loan amount \nand an open credit line and for which in customary commercial \npractice the credit risk is not limited to the contractual notice period \n(at Commerzbank this relates primarily to revolving products \nwithout a contractually agreed repayment structure, such as \noverdrafts and credit card facilities), the LECL must be determined \nusing a behavioural maturity, which typically exceeds the maximum \ncontractual period. In order to ensure that the LECL for these \nproducts is determined in an empirically sound manner in \ncompliance with IFRS 9 requirements, Commerzbank calculates the \nLECL directly for these products based on realised historical losses. \nAs a rule, the Group estimates the risk parameters specific to \nIFRS 9 based not only on historical default information but also, in \nparticular, on the current economic environment (point-in-time \nperspective) and forward-looking information. This assessment \nprimarily involves reviewing the effects which the Bank’s \nmacroeconomic forecasts will have regarding the amount of the \nECL and including these effects in the determination of the ECL.  \nThis is based on an expert estimate derived from the \nmacroeconomic scenario, which takes account of factors such as \nGDP growth and the unemployment rate. The baseline scenario \nspecifies ranges for this. \nThe baseline scenario was checked for consistency with \nmBank’s baseline scenario with regard to the main scenarios.  \nThe baseline scenario reflects the economic uncertainties and \nthe consequences of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. \nThe baseline scenario includes the following key assumptions: \n The global economy continues to suffer from uncertainties \nrelated to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine and the \nglobal tightening of monetary policy. \n Problems with the supply of raw materials and intermediate \nproducts continue to hamper industrial production and lead to \nrising procurement prices (paper, wood, metals, oil, etc.). \n The US Federal Reserve’s sharp interest rate hikes will lead to a \ndecline in growth in early 2023. \n In Europe, the high cost of energy due to the war has a \nsignificant negative impact on GDP growth and continues to \ndrive inflation. However, it is not necessary to ration gas. \n \nThe baseline scenario takes the following growth assumptions \nand unemployment rate into consideration: \n \nBaseline scenario \n2022 \n2023 \nGDP growth \n \n \nGermany \n1.5% up to \n2.0% \n–1% up to  \n–0.5% \nEurozone \n3.0% up to \n3.5% \n–0,5% up to \n0.0% \nRate of unemployment \n \n \nGermany \n5.6% \n5.6% up to \n5.8% \nEurozone \n7.0% \n5.6% up to \n7.0%"

Due to the uncertainties described below, the underlying \nbaseline scenario is considered reasonable.  \nRelevant experts were adequately consulted, within the \nframework of the existing policies, to ensure that account was taken \nof the current situation and the uncertainties arising from the \nmacroeconomic situation and the Russian war of aggression against \nUkraine. \nPotential effects from non-linear correlations between different \nmacroeconomic scenarios and the LECL are corrected using a \nseparately determined adjustment factor. The factor was reviewed \non an event-driven basis in the fourth quarter of 2022 and \ndecreased. This results in a reversal of provisions in the amount of \n€41m. The baseline scenario as well as a pessimistic and an \noptimistic scenario were used to determine the factor. The \nweightings for the individual scenarios are also always determined \nby relevant experts and are regulated in a policy.  \nThe pessimistic scenario contains the key assumption that the \ncurrently high German stocks of gas will secure supplies until \nautumn 2023 but that, at the end of the heating season, the stocks \nwill almost be empty and the replenishment during 2023 will not \nsuffice to prevent a shortage of gas from November 2023. Stage 3 \nof the German Gas Emergency Plan (rationing) is then expected. \nThe Bank has simulated in an additional analysis that the \nestimated expected credit loss (stages 1 and 2) would increase by \napproximately €0.6bn if – contrary to current expectations – this \npessimistic scenario were to materialise.  \nOn the reporting date, the expected credit loss for stages 1 and \n2 (including the secondary effects TLA contained therein (€482m)), \ncalculated on the basis of the baseline scenario described above, \nwas €1.4bn.  \nUnderlying the optimistic scenario is the key assumption that the \neconomic recovery will cease to be burdened by uncertainties \nregarding Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and renewed \nhealth problems related to the coronavirus pandemic. \n \nIn this optimistic scenario, the estimated expected credit loss \n(stages 1 and 2) would decrease by €0.4bn.  \nThe table below provides an overview of the most important \nunderlying macroeconomic parameters in the optimistic and \npessimistic scenarios, which were subsequently translated into \nexpert-based notch assumptions: \n \n2023 \noptimistic \nscenario \nBaseline \nscenario \npessimistic \nscenario \nGDP growth \n \n \n \nGermany \n2.5% \n–1% up to  \n–0.5% \n–2.2% \nEurozone \n2.5% \n–0.5% up to \n0.0% \n–2.0% \nRate of \nunemployment \n \n \n \nGermany \n5.3% \n5,6% up to \n5.8% \n6.0% \nEurozone \n6.5% \n5.6% up to \n7.0% \n7.5% \n \nIFRS 9 requires the inclusion of forward-looking information \nwhen determining the expected credit loss. However, the IFRS 9 \nECL model result implemented at Commerzbank does not take into \naccount forward-looking scenarios or events resulting from \nunforeseeable, singular events, such as natural disasters, material \npolitical decisions or military conflicts. Such risks are provided for \nby a top-level adjustment (TLA). The examination with the \ninvolvement of senior management as to whether such TLAs are \nnecessary, as well as their possible implementation, are regulated \nin a policy.  \nIn the 2022 financial year, such an adjustment to the IFRS 9 ECL \nmodel result was deemed necessary as the parameters used in the \nrespective models did not reflect the economic uncertainties and \nthe consequences of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. \nThe TLA for direct effects from the Russian war of aggression \nagainst Ukraine is no longer in place, as the risk provisioning \nrequirements remaining after the exposure reduction are now \nreflected in individual transactions.  \nThe methodology used for determining the need for adjustments \nto the ECL model result corresponds to the methodology used for \ndetermining the coronavirus TLA in 2021.  \nThe effects of the adjustments on the stage allocation were taken \ninto account in the calculation of the TLA. This booking was \nportfolio-based. It is shown in the presentation of the change in loan \nloss provisions in the line “Changes in parameters and models”. No \nacross-the-board stage transfers of individual transactions were \nmade. \nFor more information on ECL and TLA, see the Group risk report \nin the Group management report (page 106 ff.). In determining total \nGroup loan loss provisions, it is necessary to make assumptions that \nare subject to high estimation uncertainty, particularly in a dynamic \nenvironment. \nOverall, the valuation allowances for risks arising from financial \nassets and the provisions for off-balance-sheet items changed as \nfollows:"

This population may therefore \ndiffer from other new business surveys, for example those for sales \nmanagement.  \nThe changes in positions resulting from stage transfers show the \nallocations and reversals resulting from a change in assignment to \nstages during the reporting period. During the transfer, the position \nin the previous stage is completely reversed and the whole target \nposition is added in the new stage. Disposals include reversals of \nloss provisions for transactions that were derecognised from the \nbalance sheet during the reporting period. The line “Changes in \nparameters and models” contains changes in positions attributable \nto changes in risk provisioning parameters. This includes changes \nin utilisation (e.g. as a result of repayments) as well as changes in \ncollateral securities and changes in probability of default that did \nnot lead to a change in stage. What is more, adjustment effects from \nregular parameter reviews and from changed macroeconomic \nexpectations as well as the TLA booked in the reporting period are \nshown here. The utilisation reflects the extent to which the risk \nprovision was reduced by write-downs not recognised in the income \nstatement. The line “Exchange rate changes/reclassifications” \nshows the currency effects and, where applicable, transfers from \nreclassifications. \nThe presentation is based on postings for individual transactions. \nAt customer level, it may therefore happen that several items in the \nschedule are addressed. For example, both new business and \ndisposals may be included. No offsetting is carried out. \n€62m of the total amount of the provisions is attributable to off-\nbalance-sheet items that are not financial guarantees as defined in \nIFRS 9 (certain guarantees, letters of credit), but which under the \nimpairment model need to be provisioned for using the lifetime \nexpected credit loss (see Note 57).  \nClaims totalling €311m were (partially) written down in the \nreporting period.

      "text": "206 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \n(34) Securitisation of loans \n \nThe use of credit derivatives (such as credit default swaps, total \nreturn swaps and credit-linked notes) can reduce the risk weighting \nof a loan portfolio. The hedging effect of a credit derivative may \nrelate both to individual loans or securities and to entire portfolios \nof loans or securities. As a rule, security is furnished by means of a \nsynthetic securitisation by credit default swaps (CDS) and/or by \ncredit-linked notes (CLNs). This enables three important goals to be \nachieved: \n risk diversification (reduction of credit risks in the portfolio, \nespecially concentration risks); \n easing the burden on equity capital (the transfer of credit risks \nto investors leads to a reduction in the regulatory capital \nrequirements);  \n funding (use of securitisation as an alternative funding \ninstrument to unsecured bearer bonds). \n \nAs at the end of the 2022 financial year, Commerzbank Group \nhad launched six securitisation transactions as the buyer of \nprotection. \nOverall, a total volume of €14.1bn (previous year: €12.6bn) of \nloans to customers had been hedged by end of December 2022. \nThis reduced the Bank’s risk-weighted assets by €4.4bn (previous \nyear: €3.3bn). \n \n \nName of \ntransaction \nBuyer of protection \nYear \ntransacted \nContract \nperiod of \ntransactions \nin years \nType of claim \nTotal \nlending \n \n€m \nReduction of \nrisk-weighted \nassets \n€m \nCoCo Finance II-3 \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft\n2020 \n10 \nCorporate clients\n7,063 \n2,466 \nCoCo Finance III-2 \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft\n2019 \n10 \nCorporate clients\n671 \n0 \nCoCo Finance III-3 \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft\n2019 \n10 \nCorporate clients\n1,344 \n167 \nCoCo Finance III-4 \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft\n2020 \n10 \nCorporate clients\n2,374 \n686 \nK2 \nmBank S.A. \n2022 \n16 \nCorporate clients\n1,885 \n717 \nEverest \nmBank S.A. \n2022 \n18 \nCorporate clients\n750 \n387 \nTotal \n \n \n \n \n14,087 \n4,423"

The market approach \nrelies on measurement methods that draw on information about \nidentical or comparable assets and liabilities. \nThe income approach reflects current expectations about future \ncash flows, expenses and income. The income approach may also \ninclude option price models. These valuations are subject to a \nhigher degree to judgements by management. Market data or third-\nparty inputs are relied on to the greatest possible extent, and \ncompany-specific inputs to a limited degree. \nAll fair values are subject to Commerzbank Group’s internal \ncontrols and procedures, which set out the standards for \nindependently verifying or validating fair values. These controls and \nprocedures are carried out and coordinated by the Independent \nPrice Verification (IPV) Group within the risk function. The models, \ninputs and resulting fair values are reviewed regularly by senior \nmanagement and the risk function.\nDisclosure obligations \nBelow, a distinction is made between: \na) financial instruments measured at fair value (fair value OCI, fair \nvalue option, mandatorily fair value P&L and held for trading); \nb) financial instruments measured at amortised cost. \nThe respective disclosure requirements regarding these \nfinancial instruments are set out in IFRS 7 and IFRS 13.  \na) Financial instruments measured at fair value \nAccording to IFRS 13, the fair value of an asset is the amount for \nwhich it could be sold between knowledgeable, willing parties in an \narm’s length transaction. The fair value therefore represents an exit \nprice. The fair value of a liability is defined as the price at which the \ndebt could be transferred to a third party as part of an orderly \ntransaction. \nThe measurement of liabilities must also take account of the \nBank’s own credit spread. If third parties provide security for our \nliabilities (e.g. guarantees), this security is not taken into account in \nthe valuation of the liability, as the Bank’s repayment obligation \nremains the same. \nWhen measuring derivative transactions, the Group uses the \npossibility of establishing net risk positions for financial assets and \nliabilities. The measurement takes into account not only \ncounterparty credit risk but also the Bank’s own default risk. The \nGroup determines credit valuation adjustments (CVAs) and debit \nvaluation adjustments (DVAs) by simulating the future fair values of \nits portfolios of derivatives with the respective counterparty based \non observable market data (e.g. CDS spreads). In the case of funding \nvaluation adjustments (FVAs), the funding costs or income of \nuncollateralised derivatives, as well as collateralised derivatives \nwhere there is only partial collateral or the collateral cannot be used \nfor funding purposes, are recognised at fair value. Like CVAs and \nDVAs, FVAs are also determined from the expected value of the \nfuture positive or negative portfolio fair values using observable \nmarket data (e.g. CDS spreads). The funding curve used to calculate \nthe FVAs is approximated by the Commerzbank funding curve."

      "text": "212 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nSensitivity analysis \n \nWhere the value of financial instruments is based on unobservable \ninput parameters (level 3), the precise level of these parameters at \nthe reporting date may be derived from a range of reasonable \npossible alternatives at the discretion of management. In preparing \nthe Group financial statements, levels for these unobservable input \nparameters are chosen which are consistent with existing market \nevidence and in line with the Group’s valuation control approach. \nThe purpose of this disclosure is to illustrate the potential impact \nof the relative uncertainty in the fair values of financial instruments \nwith valuations based on unobservable input parameters (level 3). \nInterdependencies frequently exist between the parameters used to \ndetermine level 3 fair values. For example, an anticipated \nimprovement in the overall economic situation may cause share \nprices to rise, while securities perceived as being lower risk, such \nas \nGerman \nGovernment \nBonds, \nmay \nlose \nvalue. \nSuch \ninterdependencies are accounted for by means of correlation \nparameters insofar as they have a significant effect on the fair values \nin question. If a valuation model uses several parameters, the choice \nof one parameter may restrict the range of possible values the other \nparameters may take. So, by definition, this category will contain \nmore illiquid instruments, instruments with longer-term maturities \nand instruments where sufficient independent observable market \ndata are difficult to obtain. The purpose of this information is to \nillustrate the main unobservable input parameters for level 3 \nfinancial instruments and subsequently present various inputs on \nwhich the key input parameters were based. \nThe main unobservable input parameters for level 3 and the key \nrelated factors may be summarised as follows: \n Internal rate of return (IRR): \nThe IRR is defined as the discount rate that sets the net present \nvalue of all future cash flows from an instrument equal to zero. \nFor bonds, for example, the IRR depends on the current bond \nprice, the nominal value and the duration. \n Credit spread: \nThe credit spread is the yield spread (premium or discount) \nbetween securities that are identical in all respects except for \ntheir respective credit quality. The credit spread represents the \nexcess yield above the benchmark reference instrument that \ncompensates for the difference in creditworthiness between the \ninstrument and the benchmark. Credit spreads are quoted in \nterms of the number of basis points above (or below) the quoted \nbenchmark. The wider (higher) the credit spread in relation to the \nbenchmark, the lower the instrument’s creditworthiness, and vice \nversa for narrower (lower) credit spreads. \n Interest rate-forex (IR-FX) correlation: \nThe IR-FX correlation is relevant for the pricing of exotic interest \nrate swaps involving the exchange of funding instruments in one \ncurrency and an exotic structured leg that is usually based on \nthe development of two government bond yields in different \ncurrencies. Consensus market data for longer durations are not \nobservable for certain exotic interest products. For example, \nConstant Maturity Treasury (CMT)-yields for US government \nbonds with a duration of more than ten years are not observable. \n Recovery rates, survival and default probabilities: \nSupply and demand as well as the arbitrage relationship with \nasset swaps tend to be the dominant factors driving pricing of \ncredit default swaps (CDS). Models for pricing credit default \nswaps tend to be used more for exotic structures and off-market \ndefault swap valuation for which fixed interest payments above \nor below the market rate are agreed. These models calculate the \nimplied default probability of the reference asset as a means of \ndiscounting the cash flows expected in a credit default swap. The \nmodel inputs are credit spreads and recovery rates that are used \nto interpolate (“bootstrap”) a time series of survival probabilities \nof the reference asset. A typical recovery rate assumption in the \ndefault swap market for senior unsecured contracts is 40 %. \nAssumptions about recovery rates are a factor determining the \nshape of the survival probability curve. Different recovery rate \nassumptions translate into different survival probability rates. \nFor a given credit spread, a high recovery rate assumption \nimplies a higher probability of default (relative to a low recovery \nrate assumption) and hence a lower survival probability. There \nis a relationship over time between default rates and recovery \nrates of corporate bond issuers. The correlation between the two \nis an inverse one: an increase in the default rate (defined as the \npercentage of issuers defaulting) is generally associated with a \ndecline in the average recovery rate. In practice, market \nparticipants use market spreads to determine implied default \nprobabilities. Estimates of default probabilities also depend on \nthe joint loss distributions of the parties involved in a credit \nderivative transaction. The copula function is used to measure \nthe correlation structure between two or more variables. The \ncopula function creates a joint distribution while keeping the \ncharacteristics of the two independent marginal distributions."

Generally, \nthese are short dated maturities ranging from O/N up to \n12 months. Beyond 12-month maturities the repo curve \nparameter may become unobservable, particularly for emerging \nmarket underlyings, due to the lack of available independent \nobservable market data. In some cases, proxy repo curves may \nbe used to estimate the repo curve input parameter. Where this \nis deemed insufficient, the input parameter will be classified as \nunobservable. Furthermore, mutual fund related repos may also \ncontain unobservable repo curve exposures. \n Price: \nCertain interest rate and loan instruments are accounted for on \nthe basis of their price. It follows that the price itself is the \nunobservable parameter of which the sensitivity is estimated as \na deviation in the net present value of the positions. \n Investment fund volatility: \nIn general, the market for options on investment funds is less \nliquid than the market for stock options. As a result, the volatility \nof the underlying investment funds is determined based on the \ncomposition of the fund products. There is an indirect method of \ndetermining the corresponding volatility surfaces. This method \nis assigned to level 3 because the market data it uses are not \nliquid enough to be classified as level 2. \n Inflation volatility: \nInflation volatility represents the degree of fluctuation in \nfinancial instruments that transfer inflation risk between parties. \nThis is based on a historical time series of cash flows, linked to \nthe inflation trend. \n Correlation between shares and interest rates: \nCorrelation is a parameter that measures the movements \nbetween two instruments. It is measured by a correlation \ncoefficient. In this specific case, the parameter refers to the \ncorrelation between shares and interest rates. \n Mean reversion: \nMean reversion represents the long-term trend of prices and \nreturns towards a mean price or average. This long-term average \nmay be either a historical average of a price or yield or some \nother relevant average.  \n Surrender rate: \nThe surrender rate refers to the percentage of policyholders who \nterminate their life insurance policies before their regular expiry \ndates and receive a portion of the premiums paid. \n Lapse rate: \nThe lapse rate refers to the percentage of policyholders who let \ntheir cover lapse through non-payment of premiums. In general, \nthe lapse rate is higher for policies with higher premiums, longer \ndurations and lower accumulation of net present value."

The initial \ncarrying value of such transactions is the fair value. The difference \nbetween the transaction price and the fair value under the model is \ntermed the “day one profit or loss”. The day one profit or loss is \ngenerally not recognised immediately in the income statement but \nover the term of the transaction. As soon as there is a quoted market \nprice on an active market for such transactions or all material input \nparameters become observable, the accrued day one profit or loss \nis immediately recognised in the income statement in the net \nincome from financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value \nthrough profit or loss. A cumulated difference between the \ntransaction price and fair value determined by the model is \ncalculated for the level 3 items in all categories. Material impacts \nresult only from financial instruments of the HFT category. \nThe amounts changed as follows: \n \n \n€m \nDay-One Profit or Loss \n \nFinancial assets – \nHeld for trading \nFinancial liabilities \n– Held for trading \nTotal \nBalance as at 1.1.2021 \n– \n14 \n14 \nAllocations not recognised in income statement \n– \n0 \n0 \nReversals recognised in income statement \n– \n– 6 \n– 6 \nBalance as at 31.12.2021 \n– \n8 \n8 \nAllocations not recognised in income statement \n– \n0 \n0 \nReversals recognised in income statement \n– \n– 5 \n– 5 \nBalance as at 31.12.2022 \n– \n3 \n3 \n \nb) Financial instruments measured at amortised cost \n \nIFRS 7 additionally requires disclosure of the fair values for financial \ninstruments not recognised in the balance sheet at fair value. The \nmeasurement methodology to determine fair value in these cases is \nexplained below. \nThe nominal value of financial instruments that fall due on a daily \nbasis is taken as their fair value.  \nMarket prices are not available for loans. In the case of loans, \nthe Bank therefore applies a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. \nThe cash flows are discounted using a risk-free interest rate plus \npremiums for risk costs, refinancing costs, operating expenses and \nequity costs. The risk-free interest rate is determined based on swap \nrates (swap curves) that match the corresponding maturities and \ncurrencies. These can usually be derived from external data. \nIn addition, the Bank applies a premium in the form of a \ncalibration constant that includes a profit margin. The profit margin \nis reflected in the model valuation of loans such that fair value as at \nthe initial recognition date corresponds to the disbursement amount. \nData on the credit risk costs of major banks and corporate \ncustomers are available in the form of credit spreads. \nIn the case of securities accounted for in the amortised cost \ncategory of IFRS 9, fair value is determined based on available \nmarket prices (level 1), assuming an active market exists. If there is \nno active market, recognised valuation methods are to be used to \ndetermine the fair values. In general, an asset swap pricing model \nis used for the valuation. The parameters applied comprise yield \ncurves and the asset swap spreads of comparable benchmark \ninstruments. \nFor deposits, a DCF model is generally used for determining fair \nvalue, since market data are usually not available. In addition to the \nyield curve, own credit spread and a premium for operating \nexpenses are also taken into account. Credit spreads of the \nrespective counterparties are not used in the measurement of \nliabilities.  \nThe fair value of debt securities issued is determined on the \nbasis of available market prices. If no prices are available, the \ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to determine the fair \nvalues.

The underlying asset may, for example, be an \ninterest rate, commodity price, share price, foreign exchange rate \nor bond price. The financial instrument does not require any initial \nnet investment or an initial investment that is smaller than would be \nrequired for other types of instrument expected to have a similar \nresponse to changes in market factors. It is settled at a future date. \nMost of the derivatives transactions involve OTC derivatives, \nwith a nominal amount, maturity and price which are agreed \nindividually between the Bank and its counterparties. However, the \nBank also concludes derivatives contracts on regulated stock \nexchanges. These are standardised contracts with standardised \nnominal amounts and settlement dates. \nThe nominal amount shows the volume traded by the Bank. The \npositive and negative fair values, however, are the expenses which \nwould be incurred by the Bank or the counterparties to replace the \ncontracts originally concluded with transactions of an equivalent \nfinancial value. From the Bank’s point of view, a positive fair value \nthus indicates the maximum potential counterparty-specific default \nrisk present from derivative transactions on the reporting date. \nIn order to minimise both the economic and regulatory credit \nrisk arising from these instruments, we conclude master \nagreements (bilateral netting agreements) with our counterparties \n(such as 1992 ISDA Master Agreement Multi-Currency Cross-\nBorder; German Master Agreement for Financial Futures). By \nmeans of such bilateral netting agreements, the positive and \nnegative fair values of the derivatives contracts included under a \nmaster agreement can be offset against one another, and the future \nregulatory risk add-ons for these products can be reduced. This \nnetting process reduces the credit risk to a single net claim on the \nparty to the contract (close-out netting). \nFor both regulatory reports and the internal measurement and \nmonitoring of our credit commitments, we use such risk-mitigating \ntechniques only where we consider them enforceable in the \njurisdiction in question if the counterparty should become insolvent. \nWe obtain legal opinions from various international law firms in \norder to verify enforceability. \nSimilar to the master agreements are the collateral agreements \n(e.g. collateralisation annex for financial futures contracts, Credit \nSupport Annex), which we conclude with our business partners to \nsecure the net claim or liability remaining after netting (receiving \nor furnishing of collateral). As a rule, this collateral management \nreduces credit risk by means of prompt – usually daily or weekly – \nmeasurement and adjustment of the customer exposure. \nThe total effect of balance sheet netting amounted to €143,376m \nas at 31 December 2022 (previous year: €67,589m). On the assets \nside, €131,387m of this was attributable to positive fair values \n(previous year: €62,415m), and to claims for variation margins \n€11,990m (previous year: €5,174m). Netting on the liabilities side \ninvolved negative fair values of €131,250m (previous year: \n€62,126m) and liabilities for variation margins payable of \n€12,127m (previous year: €5,463m). \nAs at the reporting date, the outstanding volume of \nCommerzbank Group’s transactions as a protection buyer and seller \namounted to €11,967m (previous year: €13,748m) and €7,742m \n(previous year: €9,411m). We employ these products, which are \nused to transfer credit risk, both for arbitrage purposes in trading \nand in the banking book for diversifying our loan portfolios."

      "text": "226 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \n(42) Hedging relationships \n \nCommerzbank prospectively changed its hedge accounting from \nIAS 39 to IFRS 9 as at 1 July 2022. The portfolio fair value hedge for \ninterest rate risks has been excluded from the changeover and will \nbe continued until it is mandatory to apply new accounting rules for \nmacro hedging after the IASB has completed its dynamic risk \nmanagement project. IAS 39 and IFRS 9 contain extensive hedge \naccounting regulations which apply if it can be shown that the \nhedging instruments – especially derivatives – are employed to \nhedge risks in the underlying non-trading transactions. Three types \nof hedge accounting are used: \n  Fair value hedge accounting: \nIAS 39 and IFRS 9 prescribe the use of hedge accounting to \navoid a distorted impact on earnings for derivatives which serve \nto hedge financial instruments of the valuation categories AC \n(Amortised Cost) and FVOCI (Fair Value through Other \nComprehensive Income) against one or more defined risks. The \nGroup’s issuing and lending business and the securities holdings \nfor liquidity management are particularly subject to interest rate \nrisk when fixed-income securities are involved. Interest rate \nswaps are primarily used to hedge these risks. Use is also made \nof swaptions, inflation swaps, forwards and, to a limited extent, \nof other structured derivatives. \nThe derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes \nare recognised in the income statement at fair value as fair \nvalues of derivative hedging instruments. Any changes in the fair \nvalue of the hedged asset or hedged liability resulting from an \nopposite move in the hedged risk are also recognised in the \nbalance sheet. Offsetting changes on remeasurement associated \nwith the hedging instruments and the hedged underlying \ntransactions are recognised in the income statement as net \nincome from hedge accounting. Any portion of the changes in \nfair value of the hedged underlying transactions that are not \nattributable to the hedged risk is accounted for in accordance \nwith the rules of the valuation category to which the hedged \nasset or liability belongs.  \nFor interest rate risks fair value hedge accounting can either be \na micro fair value hedge or a portfolio fair value hedge. \n– In micro fair value hedge accounting an underlying \ntransaction is linked with one or more hedging transactions \nin a hedging relationship. The carrying amounts of the \nhedged transactions are adjusted through profit or loss in the \nevent of changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. \n– In a portfolio fair value hedge, interest rate risks are hedged \nat the portfolio level. It is not individual transactions or \ngroups of transactions with a similar risk structure that are \nhedged, but, rather, a quantity of underlying transactions in \na portfolio grouped by maturity bands in accordance with the \nexpected repayment and interest adjustment dates. Portfolios \nmay contain only assets, only liabilities, or a mixture of both. \nIn this type of hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of \nthe underlying transactions are reported in the balance sheet \nas a separate asset or liability item.  \n Cash flow hedge accounting: \nThe use of cash flow hedge accounting also serves to avoid a \ndistorted impact on profit or loss for derivatives which serve to \nhedge the risk of a change in future cash flows of hedged \nunderlying transactions. Interest rate swaps are primarily used \nto hedge these cash flows. Derivatives used in cash flow hedge \naccounting are measured at fair value. The effective portion of \ngains and losses are recognised net of deferred taxes in the cash \nflow hedge reserve under equity. The ineffective portion, on the \nother hand, is reported in the income statement in net income \nfrom hedge accounting. The general accounting rules set out \nabove for the underlying transactions of the hedged cash flows \nremain unchanged by this. \n Net investment hedge accounting: \nBy applying net investment hedge accounting, effects on profit \nor loss from foreign currency hedging transactions are avoided \nto the extent that they serve to hedge a net investment in a \nforeign currency.  \n \nThe application of hedge accounting rules is tied to a number of \nconditions. These relate above all to the documentation of the \nhedging relationship and also to its effectiveness. \nThe hedge must be documented in accordance with IFRS 39 or \nIFRS 9 at inception. Documentation must include in particular the \nidentification of the hedging instrument, the related hedged item or \ntransaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how \neffectiveness of the hedge is assessed. Besides the documentation, \nIAS 39 and IFRS 9 also require evidence of an effective hedge for \nthe entire period of the hedging relationship in order to apply hedge \naccounting rules. Effectiveness in this context means the \nrelationship between the change in fair value or cash flow of the \nhedged item and the offsetting change in fair value or cash flow of \nthe hedging instrument. If these changes offset each other almost \nfully, a high degree of effectiveness exists. Proof of effectiveness"

To continue \nportfolio hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39, it must also \nbe demonstrated that the hedging relationship was highly effective \nduring the reporting period (retrospective effectiveness). The \neffectiveness of the micro hedge relationships accounted for in \naccordance with IAS 39 until 1 July 2022 and the portfolio fair value \nhedges continued in accordance with IAS 39 must be within a range \nof 0.8 to 1.25 both prospectively and retrospectively. \nCommerzbank’s fair value hedge accounting includes hedges \nagainst interest rate risk, inflation risk and full fair value risk. \nInterest rate risks arise from the fact that asset and liability \nportfolios consist of variable and fixed cash flows that lead to \nfluctuating net interest income in the event of interest rate changes. \nAt Commerzbank, this relates to commercial business as well as \nliquidity, investment and issuing portfolios. \nInterest rate risk is managed centrally by the Treasury function \nof Commerzbank based on an aggregated net interest rate risk \nposition. For this purpose, it is transferred daily to Treasury using \nan internal interest transfer price. Other components of fair value, \nsuch as credit spread or margin and liquidity components, are not \nincluded in the internal interest transfer price. The Treasury \nfunction performs its interest rate risk hedging mainly via a risk \ntransfer to central swap trading with the Corporate Clients segment, \nwhere the bundled risks are closed by external transactions or are \nretained subject to limits. \nFor certain holdings in the investment portfolio, inflation risk \nhedging or full fair value hedging is also carried out.  \nCommerzbank applies micro fair value hedge accounting (MFVH) \nwhen Treasury also hedges the interest rate risk, inflation risk or full \nfair value risk economically at the micro level. Hedges in the IFRS \nmicro fair value hedging relationships are generally based on \neconomic hedge accounting. Portfolio fair value hedge accounting \n(PFVH) is used for the remaining interest rate risk position. For this \npurpose, external derivatives are selected based on their net risk \nposition (NRP), and their changes in fair value are compared with \nthe changes in fair value of the allocated hedged items – likewise \nbased on their NRP. \nIn hedge accounting for interest rate risk hedges, the benchmark \nfor the risk to be hedged for most currencies is the respective 3-\nmonth reference interest rate for the position currency (3M Euribor \ncurve for transactions in EURO). Positions in the currencies British \npound (GBP), Swiss franc (CHF) and Japanese yen (JPY) were \nswitched to the relevant overnight index swaps (OIS) rate as part of \nthe IBOR reform. For micro fair value hedge accounting, a fair value \nbased on interest rate risk is determined, and the future interest and \nnominal payments are discounted using the defined interest rate \ncurve. In portfolio fair value hedge accounting, the future cash flows \nfor the commercial transaction are derived from the internal interest \ntransfer price and also discounted using the defined yield curve. \nCommerzbank’s portfolio fair value hedge accounting is closely \naligned to economic interest rate risk management. The underlying \ntransactions to be hedged mainly derive from the Bank’s \ncommercial business and form a dynamic portfolio which changes \ncontinuously in the individual maturity bands as a result of new \nbusiness or the shift of the overall portfolio into shorter maturity \nbands. The derivative net risk position generates either payer or \nrecipient positions for each maturity band, to which assets or \nliabilities in the respective maturity bands are allocated. The \nportfolio hedge relationships are usually designated for a two-week \nperiod. They are then closed down and a redesignation is made \nbased on the changed overall portfolio. \nCommerzbank uses the statistical method of regression analysis \nto assess effectiveness in micro fair value hedge accounting. The \nchanges in fair value of the underlying transaction and the hedging \ninstrument are determined by means of historical simulations for \nthe prospective effectiveness test. Regression analysis is also used \nfor the prospective effectiveness test in portfolio fair value hedge \naccounting, while the dollar-offset method is used for the \nretrospective effectiveness test. \nWithin Commerzbank’s micro and portfolio fair value hedge \naccounting, the causes of ineffective hedging lie primarily in the \nrisk contained in the measurement of the fair value of the hedging \ninstruments – mainly interest rate swaps – which cannot be used in \ndetermining the fair value of the hedged item. As a result, the \nchanges in the fair value of the respective hedging instrument are \nnot fully offset by the changes in the fair value of the hedged item. \nThe most significant risk in this context is the basis risk, in \nparticular the tenor basis risk. \nCommerzbank holds a portfolio of inflation-linked bonds issued \nby utility companies under the UK private finance initiative (PFI), \nfor which risk management focuses on changes in fair value \nresulting from fluctuations in GBP interest rates and implicit \ninflation expectations of the UK Retail Price Index (UK RPI). Risk \nmanagement is based on the use of a portfolio of simple fixed-for-\nfloat GBP interest rate swaps and simple zero coupon inflation \nswaps, settled in each case generally through the London Clearing \nHouse. The primary sensitivity of zero coupon inflation swaps \nrelates to fluctuations in UK RPI swap rates, and they are used to \nhedge changes in the value of the inflation-linked bonds resulting \nfrom fluctuations in inflation expectations. Each inflation swap has \nonly one cash flow at maturity. As inflation expectations move up or \ndown, the expected cash flows at maturity will rise or fall to offset \nchanges in the value of the inflation-linked bonds. The interest rate \nswaps are used to hedge the sensitivity of the inflation-linked bonds \nto interest rate risk, with payment dates generally matching those of \nthe inflation-linked bonds during the term."

On the \none hand, this includes derivatives used to swap the variable cash \nflows from a group of similar mortgage loans into fixed cash flows. \nOn the other hand, cash flow hedge accounting is applied for cross \ncurrency swaps that were concluded to hedge the cash flows of \nfloating-rate mortgage bonds. The prospective and retrospective \neffectiveness test is based on linear regression. The fair value \nchanges of the hedged transactions are determined using the \n“hypothetical derivative” method. Ineffectiveness mainly arises \nfrom fair value adjustments (credit and debit valuation adjustments) \nwhich are taken into account only in the hedging transaction. \nCommerzbank also applies net investment hedge accounting to \navoid currency effects from shipping company investments. The \neffective portion of the net remeasurement gain or loss is \nrecognised directly in equity in the currency reserve after taking \ndeferred taxes into account."

Commerzbank Group also reports properties \nacquired as a result of the realisation of collateral (rescue purchases) \nand properties owned by Commerzbank Group that are let under \noperating leases in this category. These are primarily commercial \nproperties. \nInvestment properties are measured at cost including directly \nattributable transaction costs on initial recognition in accordance \nwith IAS 40. If a property is transferred from fixed assets to \ninvestment properties due to a change in use, it is booked at fair \nvalue on the initial recognition date. In subsequent measurements, \ninvestment properties are measured at fair value. The fair value is \ndetermined based on valuations conducted by independent and \nqualified experts based on current market values. Properties used \nfor commercial purposes are usually valued based on capitalised \nincome; individual residential buildings are generally valued using \nthe cost or sales comparison approach. The valuation of the \nproperties using the capitalised income approach is based on \nstandard rental values for the locality, with discounts for \nmanagement, acquisition costs and vacancy rates, and on \nremaining useful lives and land values. In some cases, contractually \nagreed rents are also used. The property yield, which is a further \ninput in the valuation process, takes account of the market interest \nrate level and the specific property and location risk attaching to the \nproperty. The main parameters observable on the market are local \nrent levels and property yields. \nCurrent income and expenses are recognised in other net \nincome. Remeasurement changes arising from changes in fair value \nare also shown under other net income in the income statement for \nthe period. \nThe properties held as investments in the amount of €57m \n(previous year: €41m) were classified at fair value hierarchy level 3 \nand developed as follows: \n \n€m \n2022 \n2021 \nCarrying amount as at 1.1. \n41 \n13 \nCost of acquisition/production as at 1.1. \n50 \n23 \nExchange rate changes \n– 0 \n– \nAdditions \n3 \n– \nDisposals \n1 \n– \nChanges in the group of consolidated companies \n– \n– \nReclassifications \n119 \n28 \nReclassifications to non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups \n– \n– \nCost of acquisition/production as at 31.12. \n171 \n50 \nCumulative changes from remeasurement at fair value \n– 114 \n– 10 \nCarrying amount as at 31.12. \n57 \n41 \n \nIn the year under review, as in the previous year, no investment \nproperties were acquired in rescue purchases. In the current \nfinancial year, one property was transferred from fixed assets to \ninvestment properties due to a change in use. \nThere are no restrictions on resale, nor are there any obligations \nto purchase properties that need to be reported here. \nWe use the country-specific rental indices for commercial and \noffice properties published by the Association of German Pfandbrief \nBanks (vdp) over a period of at least 18 years for the sensitivity \nanalysis of investment properties. We use the medium fluctuation \nrange calculated on this basis to determine the potential changes in \nvalue of our properties."

In addition, deferred \ntaxes are recognised for both tax loss carryforwards as well as for \nas yet unused tax credits. The valuation of deferred taxes is based \non income tax rates already approved as at 31 December 2022 and \napplicable upon realisation of the temporary differences. \nDeferred tax assets on tax-relieving temporary differences, on as \nyet unused tax losses and on unused tax credits are only recognised \nto the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be generated \nby the same taxable entity and in relation to the same tax authority \nin the foreseeable future. To assess impairment, detailed 5-year tax \nprofit projections are made on the basis of the multi-year planning \napproved by the Board of Managing Directors. Furthermore, \nrecognition is justified if it is likely that a sufficient taxable profit \nwill be available even beyond the 5-year time frame. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised and carried \nforward either in the income statement under taxes on income, or \nin equity, depending on the treatment of the underlying transaction. \nIncome tax expenses or income are reported under taxes on \nincome in the Group income statement.  \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are netted if there is a right to \nnet current taxes on income and the deferred tax assets and \nliabilities relate to taxes on income levied by the same fiscal \nauthority on the same taxable entity. \nTaxable \ntemporary \ndifferences \nrelating \nto \nshares \nin \nCommerzbank Group companies for which no significant deferred \nincome tax liabilities were recognised amounted to €414m \n(previous year: €464m). \nThe current and deferred tax assets as well as the current and \ndeferred tax liabilities are set out in the balance sheet and detailed \nin the notes. \n(49) Tax assets \n \n€m \n31.12.2022 \n31.12.2021 \nChange in % \nCurrent tax assets \n178 \n222 \n– 19.9 \nIn Germany \n144 \n169 \n– 14.8 \nOutside Germany \n34 \n53 \n– 36.2 \nDeferred tax assets \n3,123 \n3,130 \n– 0.2 \nTax assets recognised in income statement \n2,939 \n2,865 \n2.6 \nTax assets not recognised in income statement \n184 \n265 \n– 30.5 \nTotal \n3,300 \n3,352 \n– 1.5 \n \nDeferred tax assets represent the potential income tax relief arising \nfrom temporary differences between the values assigned to assets \nand liabilities in the Group balance sheet in accordance with IFRS \nand their values for tax accounting purposes as reported by the \nGroup companies in accordance with the local tax regulations, as \nwell as future income tax relief arising from tax loss carryforwards \nand as yet unused tax credits. \nFor the following tax loss carryforwards no deferred tax assets \nnor any impairments of existing deferred tax assets were \nrecognised as at 31 December 2022 due to the limited planning \nhorizon and the resulting insufficient probability of their being \nutilised.

We \nrecognise the right of use under fixed assets (see Note 45) and \ndepreciate it on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The \ndepreciation of the right of use is shown in the operating expenses \n(see Note 18). Extension, termination and purchase options are \nrecognised as soon as their exercise is deemed sufficiently certain. \nAround half of the leases include such options, mainly extension \noptions. This relates primarily to extension options. The \nCommerzbank Group does not expect any significant cash outflows \nin the future which have not been taken into account in measuring \nthe lease liability. \nThe lease liability is recognised at the net present value of the \nfuture lease payments to be made under other liabilities (see \nNote 54). Interest expense includes the unwinding of the discount \nof the lease liabilities. Subsequent measurement is performed using \nthe effective interest method. We make use of the option to exclude \nlow-value leases from accounting and recognise them directly as \nexpenses.  \nIn 2022, expenses for short-term leases were €0m (previous year: \n€0m). Expenses for low-value leases were €2m (previous year: \n€2m). Variable lease payments (as in the previous year) of €0m \nwere not included in lease liabilities, and income of €16m (previous \nyear: €15m) from sub-lease agreements was recorded in the period \nunder review. Total lease payments amounted to €333m (previous \nyear: €313m ). \nThe Group as lessor \nWe classify a lease as an operating lease if it does not substantially \ntransfer to the lessee all the risks and rewards incidental to \nownership. By contrast, we classify leases where the lessee bears \nall the substantial risks and rewards as finance leases. Risks and \nrewards are allocated on the basis of the present value of the cash \nflow associated with the leases. \nIf the present value equals at least the amount invested into the \nleased asset, the lease is classified as a finance lease. \n \nOperating leases \nCommerzbank acts as a lessor in operating lease arrangements. The \nassets where the Group acts as lessor include, in particular, \ntechnical equipment and machines, real estate and office furniture \nand equipment (e.g. vehicles, machinery and equipment). No \ncontingent rents have been agreed in the leases. \nThe following minimum lease payments stemming from non-\ncancellable leases will accrue to Commerzbank Group over the next \nfew years from operating leases granted: \n \nMaturity | €m \n31.12.2022 \n31.12.2021 \nup to 1 year \n103 \n129 \nin 1 year up to 5 years \n212 \n278 \nin more than 5 years \n40 \n60 \nTotal \n355 \n467"

Accordingly, we make provisions for liabilities of an \nuncertain amount to third parties and anticipated losses arising \nfrom pending transactions in the amount of the claims expected. \nThe amount recognised as a provision represents the best estimate \nof the expense required to meet the current obligation as at the \nreporting date. Risks and uncertainties (including with regard to the \nactual level of the costs at the date of any utilisation of the provision \nand potential increases in costs for long-term provisions) are taken \ninto account in the estimate. Provisions are recognised at their net \npresent value if they are long-term. \nAllocations to the different types of provisions are made via \nvarious items in the income statement. Provisions for lending \nbusiness are charged to expenses for loan loss provisions and \nprovisions for restructuring are charged to restructuring expenses. \nOther provisions are generally charged to operating expenses and \nreleased through other net income. \nCompanies within the Commerzbank Group are involved both in \nGermany and other countries in court and arbitration cases (legal \nproceedings) and in out-of-court and supervisory proceedings \n(recourse claims) as defendants and claimants or in other ways. \nMoreover, legal cases in which Commerzbank and its subsidiaries \nare not directly involved could have an impact on the Group because \nof their fundamental importance for the banking sector. The Group \nrecognises appropriate provisions for legal proceedings and \nrecourse claims, with the charge shown in other net income, if a \nloss is likely and can be determined sufficiently accurately. \nProvisions \nof \nrecourse \nclaims \nrelate, \nfor \nexample, \nto \nreimbursements of processing fees for consumer loans which have \nbeen ruled as invalid and possible claims from customer misselling. \nIn the case of provisions for legal proceedings, the procedure differs \ndepending on whether a company within the Group is the claimant \n(active proceedings) or defendant (passive proceedings). In active \nproceedings, provisions are recognised for the legal and court fees \nand ancillary costs, which may vary based on the specific practices \nin each country. In passive proceedings provisions are also \nrecognised if the outflow of resources is probable. However, the \nGroup’s final liability may differ from the provisions that have been \nrecognised, as a high degree of judgement is involved in assessing \nthe probability of uncertain liabilities in such legal proceedings and \nquantifying them. These estimates may turn out to be inaccurate at \na later stage of the proceedings. Legal risks for which no provisions \nhave been recognised are reported as contingent liabilities (see \nNote 57). \nRestructuring provisions are recognised if Commerzbank Group \nhas a detailed formal restructuring plan and has already begun \nimplementing this plan or has announced the main details of the \nrestructuring. The detailed plan must contain information on the \ndepartments and main locations involved, the approximate number \nof staff whose jobs are affected by the restructuring, the costs \ninvolved and the period during which the restructuring will be \ncarried out. The detailed plan must be communicated in such a way \nthat those affected can expect it to be realised. The restructuring \nexpenses item in the income statement can contain further direct \nrestructuring expenses which are not included in the restructuring \nprovision. \nProvisions for pensions and similar commitments are recognised \nfor occupational pension schemes. These comprise pension \ncommitments under both defined benefit and defined contribution \npension plans. Defined benefit plans exist for obligations from \npension entitlements and current benefits based on a direct pension \ncommitment on the part of Commerzbank, where the level of the \npension payment is mainly pre-defined and dependent on factors \nsuch as age, salary level and length of service. Provisions are \nestablished for these plans. The contributions paid for defined \ncontribution pension plans are recognised directly under personnel \nexpenses."

The underlying actuarial parameters are based \non the norms in the country in which the pension plan was \nestablished. Apart from biometric assumptions (the Heubeck \nmortality tables 2018 G in Germany and country-specific biometric \ntables in other countries), the actuaries rely in particular on a \ncurrent discount rate based on the yield on high-quality, long-term \ncorporate bonds, as well as expected future rates of pension \nincreases.  \nThe expected pension adjustments were increased to 2.4% p.a. \nin 2022 (previous year: 2.0%). The rise in the expected adjustments \nto pensions resulted in a one-off negative effect of around €371m \nbefore taxes, which was recognised directly in equity. \nThe future change in salaries does not have a material influence \non the amount of the pension obligation due to the structure of the \nrespective pension plans both in Germany and abroad. As a result, \nin line with the materiality principle, the parameter and its \nsensitivities are not disclosed.  \nFor German pension obligations, the discount factor is \ndetermined using a proprietary Commerzbank model derived from \nEuro interest swap rates with the same maturity and adjusted by a \nspread premium for high-quality corporate bonds. \nThe parameters outside Germany are determined on the basis of \nweighted averages taking account of the respective relevant \npension plans."

The amount of \nthe benefits under CBA consists of an initial module for the period \nup to 31 December 2004, plus a benefit module – possibly \naugmented by a dynamic module – for each contributory year from \n2005 onwards; the benefits are structured as a lifelong pension with \nthe option to take a lump sum. The use of the lump-sum option is \nconsidered in the actuarial valuation accordingly.  \nStaff joining the Bank after 1 January 2005 have pension rights \nunder the Commerzbank capital plan for company pension benefits, \nknown as the CKA. The CKA guarantees a minimum benefit on the \nmodular basis, but also offers additional opportunities for higher \npension benefits through investing assets in investment funds. \nSince 1 January 2010 the direct pension arrangements for staff \nformerly employed by Dresdner Bank Aktiengesellschaft have also \nbeen based on the company pension modules (CBA). \nFurthermore, some foreign subsidiaries and branches, primarily \nin the United Kingdom and the USA, also have defined benefit plans. \nIn addition to the occupational pension plans, there is an \ninternally-financed healthcare plan in the United Kingdom which \nentitles members in retirement to reimbursement of medical costs. \nThe resulting obligations are accounted for according to the rules \nfor defined benefit pension plans as specified by IAS 19. \nIn order to meet the direct pension liabilities in Germany, cover \nassets were transferred to a legally independent trustee, \nCommerzbank Pension Trust e. V. (CPT), under a Contractual Trust \nArrangement (CTA). The assets held by CPT and the cover assets \nfor pension obligations in our foreign units qualify as plan assets \nwithin the definition of IAS 19.8. The trust agreements signed by \nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and other Group companies in \nGermany with the CPT also provide insolvency insurance for the \ndirect occupational pension commitments funded by plan assets. \nThe insolvency insurance covers all vested benefits of active and \nformer employees and all current benefits being paid to pensioners. \nIt covers the portion of vested or current benefits that are not \ncovered by Pensions-Sicherungs-Verein (PSV), the German \npensions insurance fund. The trust agreements do not require the \ntrustor companies to pay in contributions. However, the plan assets \nmust cover the liabilities not covered by PSV at all times. The \ncompanies that are party to the agreements may only request \nrebates from the plan assets for pension benefits that have been \npaid up to this limit.  \nThe investment guidelines for the German plan assets are laid \ndown jointly by the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft and the CPT. There are no legal requirements for \nthe investment guidelines. The investment management is carried \nout by the Executive Pension Committee (EPC), which follows a \nliability-driven investment (LDI) approach as part of its Asset \nLiability Management. It also sets the framework for determining \nthe actuarial assumptions. The main aim of the investment strategy \nis to replicate the future cash flows for the pension liabilities using \nderivatives for interest rates, inflation and credit spreads, with the \naim of reducing the risks directly attributable to the future \ndevelopment of the pension liabilities. Apart from the usual pension \nrisks such as inflation and biometric risks there are no other unusual \nrisks at Commerzbank. The portfolio of the plan assets is well-\ndiversified and mainly comprises fixed-income securities, equities \nand alternative investments. \nThe pension plans outside Germany have their own trust \nstructures independent from the CPT. Overall, they currently \nrepresent around 4 % of the Group’s total pension liabilities. The \nEPC also acts as the steering committee for the plan assets of the \nforeign pension plans. Different national regulations also apply in \neach of the foreign countries. However, these plans also generally \nuse an LDI approach. The biggest plan sponsors outside Germany"

Most of the foreign pension schemes are \nfunded defined benefit plans. In some cases, there are also pension \nliabilities on a small scale outside Germany that are not covered by \nplan assets. \nThe net liability or net asset resulting from the present value of \nthe defined benefit obligations less the fair value of the plan assets, \nsubject, if applicable, to the asset ceiling, is recognised in the \nbalance sheet.  \nThe pension expenses for defined benefit plans, which are \nreported under personnel expenses and in net interest income, \nconsist of the service cost and the net interest cost or income. \nService cost comprises current service cost, which represents the \nentitlements earned by members during the financial year as well \nas the past service cost or income. In the 2021 financial year, this \neffect was based on a curtailment in the existing pension \nobligations in Germany, which was caused by headcount reduction \nmeasures carried out as part of the social plan. Net interest \nexpense/income is calculated as the difference in interest rate \nbetween the present value of the obligation and the fair value of the \nplan assets. When calculating the pension obligation with respect \nto the net liability and plan assets under defined benefit plans, the \ndiscount rate is applied. \nThe difference between the remeasurement of the pension \nobligation on the reporting date as compared with the value \nprojected at the beginning of the year is the actuarial gain or loss. \nActuarial gains and losses are, like the return on plan assets (with \nthe exception of amounts contained in net interest expense/ \nincome), recognised directly in retained earnings within equity and \nare reported in the statement of comprehensive income."

In addition, the BVV is \nentitled to demand further contributions from the member \ncompanies in case the economic situation of the BVV makes this \nnecessary. \nHowever, no provisions for the BVV pension commitment were \nrecognised either in the current or previous financial years, as \nrecourse to this statutory liability is regarded as unlikely.  \nFurthermore, some foreign subsidiaries and branches, primarily \nin the United Kingdom and the USA, also have defined contribution \nplans. The expenses for defined contribution plans included €62m \n(previous year: €69m) in payments to the BVV. Contributions in \n2023 are expected to be around the same amount."

      "text": "254 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \nLegal disputes \nIn case of legal proceedings or possible third-party recourse claims \nfor which provisions need to be recognised, and which are contained \nin “Other provisions” under legal proceedings and recourse claims, \nneither the duration of the proceedings nor the level of utilisation of \nthe provision can be predicted with certainty at the date the provision \nis recognised. The provisions cover the costs expected according to \nour judgement as at the reporting date.  \n Commerzbank and its subsidiaries operate in a large number of \njurisdictions subject to different legal and regulatory \nrequirements. In isolated cases in the past, infringements of \nlegal and regulatory provisions have come to light and have \nbeen prosecuted by government agencies and institutions. \nSome companies within Commerzbank Group are currently still \ninvolved in a number of such cases. \n Commerzbank and its subsidiaries are especially active in the \narea of investment advisory within the Private and Small-\nBusiness Customers segment. The legal requirements for \ninvestor- and investment-oriented advisory services have been \nmade more rigorous, especially in recent years. Commerzbank \nand its subsidiaries have consequently been involved in a number \nof legal disputes, some of which are still pending, with investors \nwho claim to have received poor or inadequate investment advice \nand who demand compensation for damages or the reversal of \ninvestment \ntransactions \nwhere \ninformation \nregarding \ncommission fees was lacking (e.g. for closed-end funds).  \n Commerzbank is exposed to claims from customers owing to \n“cancellation joker” (“Widerrufsjoker”) issues. Following a \nchange in the law, according to which any right to cancel loan \nagreements concluded between 2002 and 2010 could lapse no \nlater than on 21 June 2016, many borrowers cancelled their \nagreements and asserted that the information given to them \nabout cancellation when they concluded the agreement had \nbeen deficient. Some of them took legal action against the Bank \nwhen it refused to accept their cancellation, intending to \nimmediately pay back the loan prior to the expiry of the fixed \ninterest term without having to compensate the Bank for the loss \nincurred as a consequence of the early repayment. For \nagreements concluded after 2010, an attempt is also being made \nto use the cancellation joker to withdraw from the agreements \nprematurely. The Bank has contested these claims. We have not \nset out the provision amounts to avoid influencing the outcome \nof the proceeding. \nIn its judgement of 26 March 2020, the European Court of Justice \n(ECJ) decided that a reference to other legal provisions \ncontained in the (statutory) boilerplate information on \ncancellation for customer loan agreements was unclear to the \nconsumer and regarded this as a breach of the requirements of \nthe European Consumer Credit Directive. In its consumer loan \nagreements the Bank has used the legal model which the \nGerman Federal Court of Justice has already deemed to be in \norder in several decisions. The Federal Court of Justice has \nconvincingly justified this by arguing that the German courts \ncannot disregard a national standard which is clear in its \nwording and meaning. The Federal Court of Justice most \nrecently confirmed its stance in a decision on 31 March 2020. \nFor this reason the Bank does not consider itself to be exposed \nto any increased risks as a result of the ECJ ruling for the current \nportfolio of consumer loans. \n A subsidiary of Commerzbank was involved in a South American \nbank which in the meantime has gone into liquidation. A number \nof investors and creditors of this bank have launched various legal \nactions in Uruguay and Argentina against the subsidiary, and, in \nsome cases, Commerzbank as well, alleging liability as \nshareholders of the bankrupt companies as well as breaches of \nduty by the persons nominated by the subsidiary for the banks’ \nsupervisory boards. In addition, the subsidiary was involved in \ntwo funds which raised money from investors and were managed \nby third parties. The liquidators of these funds have launched \ncourt proceedings in the USA demanding the repayment of \namounts received by the subsidiary from the funds. We have not \nset out the provision amounts to avoid influencing the outcome \nof the proceeding. \n A subsidiary of Commerzbank was sued by a customer in May \n2014 for compensation due to alleged fraudulent misselling of \nderivative transactions. The subsidiary has defended itself against \nthe claim. We have not set out the provision amounts to avoid \ninfluencing the outcome of the proceeding. \n In May 2017, a Polish court admitted a class action lawsuit \nagainst \na \nsubsidiary \nof \nCommerzbank \nalleging \nthe \nineffectiveness \nof \nindex \nclauses \nin \nloan \nagreements \ndenominated in Swiss francs (CHF). A total of 1,731 plaintiffs \nhave joined the class action. The plaintiffs have lodged an appeal \nagainst the ruling of the court of first instance rejecting their \nclaims.  \nIndependently of this, numerous borrowers have also filed \nindividual lawsuits for the same reasons. In addition to the class \naction, 17,627 other individual proceedings were pending as at \n31 December 2022 (previous year: 13,036). The subsidiary has \ncontested these claims. \nAs at 31 December 2022, there were 1,941 final rulings in \nindividual proceedings against the subsidiary, of which 97 were \ndecided in favour of the subsidiary and 1,844 were decided \nagainst the subsidiary. A total of 33 proceedings before courts of \nsecond instance are suspended because of legal issues that are \nbeing considered by the Polish Supreme Court and the European \nCourt of Justice (ECJ)."

A date for the hearing or \npronouncement of a decision has not yet been set. \nA referral proceeding of another bank at the ECJ (C520/21) \nmainly addresses issues regarding compensation for use and \nother benefits for funds that are to be returned under a void loan \nagreement. Representatives of the plaintiffs, the defendant, the \nsupervisory \nauthorities \nand \nthe \nEuropean \nCommission \npresented their positions at a hearing in October 2022. The court \ndid not comment specifically on the matter. Once implemented \nby the Polish courts, a decision in favour of the plaintiffs could \nresult in considerable economic burdens for mBank. A decision \nby the court is expected in mid-2023. \nThe subsidiary established a settlement programme beginning \nin the fourth quarter of 2022 that is aimed at all customers with \nactive loans, including those who already have lawsuits against \nthe bank. Customers will be offered the option of having their \nloans converted into zloty loans with a fixed or variable interest \nrate as well as the cancellation of an individually negotiated part \nof the outstanding loan value. As at the reporting date, the \nsubsidiary had accounted for risks in connection with future \nsettlement payments in the amount of €122.1m. \nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Group changed the methodology \nused to calculate the risk provisions for loan agreements indexed \nto Swiss francs. The methodology is now based on historical data, \nsupplemented by expert assessments. The main assumptions are: \nThe expected number of borrowers who will still sue, the nature \nof the expected court judgments, the amount of the Bank’s loss \nin the event of a judgment, and the acceptance rate for \nsettlements. The methodology used to calculate the provision is \nbased on parameters that are varied, discretionary and in some \ncases associated with considerable uncertainty. Fluctuations in \nthe parameters as well as their interdependencies and rulings of \nthe Polish courts and the ECJ may mean that the amount of the \nprovision has to be adjusted significantly in the future. \nAs at 31 December 2022, the portfolio of loans denominated in \nSwiss francs that have not been fully repaid had a carrying \namount of 6.1bn Polish zloty; the portfolio that had already been \nrepaid amounted to 7.5bn Polish zloty when it was disbursed. \nOverall, the Group recognised a provision of €1.4bn for the risks \narising from the matter, including potential settlement payments \nand the class action lawsuit (31 December 2021: €899m). \nA Commerzbank subsidiary, together with another bank, was \nsued for damages in May 2018 due to alleged unfair price \ncollusion in connection with the levying of settlement fees. An \nappeal against the first instance judgement in favour of the \nbanks is still possible. We have not stated the provision amounts \nto avoid influencing the outcome of the proceedings. \n A subsidiary of Commerzbank was sued by a customer for \ncompensation due to alleged unlawful selling of collateral. The \nsubsidiary is defending itself against the claim. We have not \nstated the provision amounts to avoid influencing the outcome \nof the proceedings. \n In proceedings relating to a specific retail mortgage loan \nagreement, a court overturned the finding of the lower court and \nruled that the contractual clause concerning the calculation of \nprepayment penalty fees was insufficient and the prepayment \npenalty fee received by the Bank had to be refunded. The \njudgement is final. The Bank has recognised a corresponding \nprovision for the possibility that a refund must be made in similar \ncases. We have not stated the provision amounts to avoid \ninfluencing the outcome of these cases. \n In April 2021, the German Federal Court of Justice ruled on the \nmechanism for changes to banks’ general terms and conditions \n(AGB Banken) in a case against another bank and declared the \nrelevant clauses of the general terms and conditions to be void. \nThis mechanism stipulated that the customer’s consent to \ncertain changes in the contract was given after a certain period \nof time if the customer had not objected. The Bank has examined \nthe impact of this case law on its business units and products, as \nthe charges introduced or increased for consumers as a result of \nthe mechanism for changes to banks’ general terms and \nconditions may be void. We have not stated the provision \namounts to avoid influencing the outcome of the proceedings. \n Based on the circular on cum/cum transactions published by the \nFederal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2017, the tax auditors \ncommented on the treatment of these transactions in the form of \naudit notes. The tax office reduced the credit for capital gains \ntaxes accordingly. In response, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft \nmade value adjustments to tax credits shown in the balance sheet \nand set up additional provisions for possible repayment claims in \norder to reflect the changed risk situation fully and appropriately. \nThe BMF published a revised version of its circular on cum/cum \ntransactions on 9 July 2021. In view of the potential impact of the \nBMF circular, the provision was adjusted in the second quarter of \n2021. Based on current knowledge, the tax risks arising from this \nissue have thereby been adequately covered. The possibility of \nfurther charges over and above the provisions recognised by the \nBank cannot be completely ruled out.  \n With respect to securities lending transactions, Commerzbank is \nexposed to compensation claims (including in court) from third \nparties for crediting entitlements that have been denied. In the \ncontext of these securities lending transactions, the contracting"

However, the tax offices of \nvarious contracting parties partially refused or subsequently \ndisallowed subsequent crediting against corporate income tax. \nWe have not stated the provision amounts to avoid influencing \nthe outcome of the proceedings. \n The Bank terminated an outsourcing project prematurely by \nexercising a special right of termination granted in the \noutsourcing agreement.

The CIP is an equity-\nsettled plan with a settlement option in cash for the employer, which \nfalls within the scope of IFRS 2. In some locations different or \nsupplementary CIP rules apply reflecting local legal or employment \nlaw requirements.  \nUnder the CIP, employees designated as risk takers can receive \nparts of their individual variable remuneration as a cash component \nand a stock component, linked to the performance of Commerzbank \nshare. The variable remuneration consists of a short-term incentive \n(STI) and, in the case of risk takers whose variable remuneration \nexceeds the risk taker limit, a long-term incentive (LTI). \nA risk taker is an employee whose role has a material impact on \nCommerzbank’s overall risk profile. The criteria on the basis of \nwhich the risk takers are identified are divided into the categories \nof management responsibility, risk responsibility and remuneration \nlevel. Depending on the employee’s hierarchical level and the risk \nrelevance of their role, the Bank designates what kind of risk taker \nthe employee is: “risk taker I” or “risk taker II”. Risk taker I status \napplies to employees whose role entails a higher risk relevance. \nThe risk taker limit is the amount up to which the payment of a \nrisk taker’s entire variable remuneration for a financial year takes \nthe form of a cash STI payment. For risk takers whose variable \nremuneration does not exceed the risk taker limit, and for \nemployees without risk taker status (non-risk takers), variable \nremuneration is paid entirely as a cash STI. Only if the risk taker \nlimit is exceeded is the variable remuneration divided up into STI \nand LTI components subject to the CIP rules applying to these \ncomponents.  \nThe following rules apply once the risk taker limit has been \nexceeded: \n For the risk taker I category, the STI component is 40% and the \nLTI component is 60% of the potential variable remuneration. \n50% of both the STI and LTI are paid in shares. \n For the risk taker II category, the STI component is generally 60% \nand the LTI component 40% of the potential variable \nremuneration. Once an internally defined threshold for variable \nremuneration has been reached, the division into STI and LTI is \nin line with the system for the risk taker I category. Half of both \nSTI and LTI is share-based remuneration. \nAn individual’s variable remuneration is determined on the basis \nof the results of their annual target attainment meeting \n(performance appraisal I), which is held in the first three months of \nthe following financial year. The number of Commerzbank shares \ngranted is set at the same time as the variable remuneration for both \nthe STI and the LTI. If risk takers receive share-based remuneration \ncomponents, the number of Commerzbank shares is calculated by \ndividing 50% of the euro amounts in the STI and the LTI by the \nsubscription price. If there are any fractional amounts, the number \nof shares is rounded up. The subscription price for the variable \nremuneration set until the 2018 financial year is the simple \narithmetic average of the Xetra closing prices of the Commerzbank \nshare on all trading days during the reference period (December of \nthe previous year and January and February of the next year). For \nthe variable remuneration that has been set from the 2019 financial \nyear onwards, the reference period for the subscription price is the \nmonth of January of the year following the financial year. \nUnder the rules of the share-based remuneration components \nCommerzbank has the right to make a payment in cash rather than \nin shares. Use is made of this option as a rule. In the STI, the shares, \nor the optional cash settlement, are subject to a twelve-month \nlockup (“retention period”). This means that the STI share \ncomponent of the financial year (n) will generally be paid out in \nApril of the after next financial year (n+2). \nIn the LTI, variable remuneration set for the financial years up to \nand including 2018 may be acquired at the earliest after the expiry \nof a three-year deferral period, provided there are no other grounds \nunder performance appraisal II to block the allocation. Since 25 \nSeptember 2021, when the latest amendment to the Remuneration \nOrdinance for Institutions (Institutsvergütungsverordnung), which \ntransposes the European requirements into German law, came into \nforce, risk takers I can acquire it at the earliest after five years and \nrisk takers II at the earliest after four years. Performance appraisal \nII is held after the end of the deferral period and consists of a review \nof the underlying performance appraisal I and fulfilment of \nindividual and Group-specific qualitative targets during the deferral \nperiod. In the LTI, if a claim arises, the shares or the optional cash \nsettlement are also subject to a retention period, as in the STI. Until \nnow the LTI has been paid out in October of the fourth year after \nthe underlying financial year. The payment of variable remuneration, \nwhich was set from the 2019 financial year onwards, will be made \nafter completion of the performance appraisal II for risk takers I, for \nLTI Cash in November of the sixth year (n+6), and for LTI Equity in \nOctober of the seventh year (n+7). For risk takers II, LTI Cash was \npaid in November of the fourth year (n+4) and LTI Equity in October \nof the fifth year (n+5) until the 2021 financial year. From the 2022 \nfinancial year, LTI Cash will be paid in November of the fifth year \n(n+5) and LTI Equity in October of the sixth year (n+6). \nIn the event of a cash settlement of the share component the \ncash amount is calculated on the basis of the simple arithmetic \naverage of Xetra closing prices of the Commerzbank share on all \ntrading days during the reference period. The reference period for \nentitlement to variable remuneration set until the 2018 financial \nyear is the month of September preceding the due date of the"

The reference \nperiod for entitlement from the 2019 financial year onwards is the \nlast full calendar month preceding the end of the retention period \nof the respective share-based remuneration components. \nIf Commerzbank has paid dividends or carried out capital actions \nduring the term of the CIP, then, for equity components with \nvariable remuneration set until the 2018 financial year, an additional \ncash amount equal to the dividend per share, or a cash settlement \nfor the capital action, will be paid out when the STI and LTI \ncomponents mature. From the 2019 financial year onwards, no \nentitlement to compensation for dividends or subscription rights \npaid or granted to shareholders arises in the deferral period, unlike \nthe retention period.  \nThe various remuneration components are estimated in the \nunderlying financial year on the basis of budget forecasts, and \nprovisions are recognised proportionally over the lifetime of the \nplans. Moreover, regular reviews, revaluations based on movements \nin the share price and/or adjustments of the amounts are carried out \nthroughout the lifetime of the CIP.  \n \nb) Share-based payment plans of mBank S.A. \nIn 2012 a share-based programme was launched in which members \nof the Management Board could participate up until 2017. Until \n2013 this programme comprised both a short-term component \n(cash payment) and a long-term component which entitled the \nparticipants to make regular subscriptions to mBank shares over a \nperiod of three years. The programme was modified in 2014 and \nnow consists of cash payments and the subscription of mBank \nshares in both components over three years. A given quantity of \nthese shares were issued each year and made available to those \nentitled for purchase at a pre-determined price. In addition, a \nsignificant number of risk takers were added to this programme in \n2015. In all of these programmes, participation is linked to a \nminimum return on equity by the mBank sub-group. The long-term \ncomponent of the programme from 2012 (modified in 2014) is also \nlinked to the participants’ performance assessment.  \nIn 2018, the programme was technically adapted and the long-\nterm component for members of the Board of Managing Directors \nwas extended from three to five years (pro rata). In 2021, the long-\nterm component for risk takers below the Board of Managing \nDirectors was extended from three to five years (pro rata) for so-\ncalled senior management positions, and from three to four years \n(pro rata) for all other risk takers below the Board of Managing \nDirectors. \nBoth plans, which entitle the holders to subscribe for mBank \nshares (firstly for members of the Board of Managing Directors from \n2012, modified in 2014 and with a technical adjustment in 2018, \nand secondly for risk takers below the Board of Managing Directors \nwith a technical adjustment in 2021) are classified as share-based \npayments settled in the form of equity instruments. \nc) Remuneration of the Board of Managing Directors  \nPlease refer to the separate Remuneration report in the Group \nmanagement report for a detailed account of the remuneration of \nmembers of the Board of Managing Directors. \nAccounting and valuation of share-based payment and bonus \nplans \nThe staff compensation plans are accounted for under the rules of \nIFRS 2 – Share-based Payment and IAS 19 – Employee Benefits. A \ndistinction is made between share-based remuneration payments \nsettled in the form of equity instruments and those settled in cash. \nFor both types of remuneration, however, the granting of share-\nbased remuneration has to be recognised at fair value in the Group \nfinancial statements. \nAccounting \n Equity-settled \nshare-based \nremuneration \ntransactions:  \nThe fair value of share-based remuneration payments settled in \nthe form of equity instruments is recognised as personnel \nexpenses and reflected within equity in retained earnings. The \nfair value is determined on the date on which the rights are \ngranted. If rights cannot be exercised because the conditions for \nexercise are not met due to market conditions, no change is \nmade to the amounts already recognised in equity. However, if \nrights cannot be exercised because other conditions for exercise \nare not met (service and non-market conditions), the amounts \nalready recognised in equity are adjusted through profit or loss. \n Cash-settled share-based remuneration transactions: \nThe portion of the fair value of share-based remuneration \npayments settled in cash that relates to services performed up to \nthe date of measurement is recognised as personnel expenses \nwhile at the same time being recorded as a provision. The fair \nvalue is recalculated on each reporting date up to and including \nthe settlement date. Any change in the fair value of the obligation \nmust be recognised through profit or loss. On the date of \nsettlement, therefore, the provision must correspond as closely \nas possible to the amount payable to the eligible employees. The \nprovisions fluctuate on each subsequent reporting date in \nparallel \nwith \nthe \nperformance \nof \nCommerzbank \nAktiengesellschaft share price. This affects the portion of the \nshare-based variable remuneration that was determined using \nan average price for Commerzbank share. The price itself is \ndetermined as the average Xetra closing price of the months of \nJanuary and February plus December of the previous year. \nMeasurement \nThe provision for the Commerzbank Incentive Plan is determined \nby multiplying the number of shares earned by participants by the \nclosing price of the Commerzbank share on 31 December of the \nreporting year. The expense for the allocations to the provisions can"

      "text": "260 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \n(57) Contingent liabilities and lending commitments \n \nThis item mainly shows contingent liabilities arising from \nguarantees and indemnity agreements as well as irrevocable \nlending commitments at their nominal value.  \nSituations where the reporting company acts as guarantor to the \ncreditor of a third party for the fulfilment of a liability of that third \nparty must be shown as guarantees. Indemnity agreements include \ncontractual obligations that involve taking responsibility for a \nparticular outcome or performance. These are normally guarantees \nissued at a customer’s request, which give us a right of recourse to \nthe customer in the event that the guarantee is called upon. All \nobligations that could incur a credit risk must be shown here as \nirrevocable lending commitments. These include obligations to \ngrant loans (e.g. credit lines that have been granted to customers), \nto buy securities or provide guarantees or acceptances. In contrast, \nloan commitments allocated to the trading portfolio are recognised \nunder Financial assets – Held for trading or Financial liabilities – \nHeld for trading. \nProvisions for risks in respect of contingent liabilities and \nlending commitments are included in provisions for off-balance-\nsheet lending. \nIncome from guarantees is reported in net commission income; \nthe level of this income is determined by the application of agreed \nrates to the nominal amount of the guarantees. \nLegal risks where the occurrence of a loss cannot be ruled out \nbut for which no provisions have been recognised because a claim \nis highly improbable, are also reported under contingent liabilities. \nWe take a wide variety of factors into account in determining the \nprobability of a loss, including the type of claims and judgements \non similar issues. \nThe Commerzbank Group extends credit facilities to its \ncustomers, granting them rapid access to funds to meet their short-\nterm and long-term financing needs. The credit facilities can be \nprovided in different forms, as shown in the following examples:  \n guarantees, where the Group guarantees the repayment of a loan \nborrowed by a customer from another party;  \n standby letters of credit, which enhance a customer’s credit \nstanding and enable the customer to obtain trade finance at a \nlower cost;  \n documentary credits for trade finance payments, which are \nmade on behalf of a customer and where the Group is \nreimbursed at a later date;  \n standby facilities for short-term debt instruments and debt paper \nissued on a revolving basis, which enable customers to issue \nmoney market paper or medium-term debt instruments when \nneeded without having to go through the normal issue procedure \nevery time. \nExisting collateral may serve to cover the total liabilities of \ncustomers from loans and guarantees. Also, third parties may have \nsub-participations in irrevocable lending commitments and \nacceptances.  \nThe contingent liabilities also include the irrevocable payment \nobligation provided by the Single Resolution Board (SRB) after \napproval of the Bank’s request for security for payment of part of \nthe banking levy. \nThe figures listed in the table below do not take account of any \ncollateral and would only have to be written off if all customers \nutilised their credit facilities completely and then defaulted (and \nthere was no collateral). In practice, the majority of these facilities \nexpire without ever being utilised. Consequently, these amounts are \nunrepresentative in terms of assessing risk, the actual future loan \nexposure \nor \nresulting \nliquidity \nrequirements. \nThe \nGroup \nmanagement report contains further information on credit risk and \nliquidity risk and how they are monitored and managed. Loan loss \nprovisions for off balance-sheet commitments have been deducted \nfrom the respective items in these tables."

However, since there is some probability of their \noccurrence, they are presented under contingent liabilities. It is \nimpossible to reliably estimate the date on which such risk may \nmaterialise or any potential reimbursements. Depending on the \noutcome of the legal and fiscal proceedings, the estimate of our risk \nof loss may prove to be either too low or too high. However, in a \nlarge majority of cases the contingent liabilities for legal risks do \nnot ever materialise and, therefore, the amounts are not \nrepresentative of the actual future losses. As at 31 December 2022, \ncontingent liabilities for legal risks amounted to € 563 m (previous \nyear: € 379 m) and related to the following material issues: \n Several claims have been filed against a subsidiary of \nCommerzbank by customers of a former corporate customer. The \nclaims were definitively dismissed in May 2022.  \n A customer sued Commerzbank for recovery of monies in April \n2016. The claimant is demanding the repayment of interest which \nin its view was wrongly paid to Commerzbank and is also \ndemanding the release of collateral which is being held as security \nfor a claim by Commerzbank against the claimant. The first-\ninstance ruling in favour of Commerzbank is not yet legally \nenforceable. Commerzbank is continuing to defend itself against \nthe action. \n A Commerzbank subsidiary together with another bank was sued \nfor damages in February 2020 due to alleged unfair price collusion \nin connection with the levying of settlement fees. The subsidiary \nis defending itself against the action. \n In February 2022, Commerzbank was sued in Hungary for \ndamages in connection with a failed project. The first-instance \nruling in favour of Commerzbank is not yet legally enforceable. \nThe Bank is defending itself against the action. \nThe contingent liabilities for tax risks relate to the following material \nissues: \n The public prosecutor’s office in Frankfurt is investigating equity \ntransactions conducted by Commerzbank and the former \nDresdner Bank around the dividend record date (cum-ex \ntransactions). Commerzbank had already initiated a forensic \nanalysis of cum-ex transactions at the end of 2015, which was \nconcluded at the start of 2018 in respect of Commerzbank’s \nequity transactions and in September 2019 in respect of the \nequity transactions of the former Dresdner Bank. All back taxes \ndemanded by the tax authorities have been paid. \nThe public prosecutor’s office in Cologne has been conducting \ninvestigations at Commerzbank since September 2019 in \nconnection with a separate case concerning cum-ex transactions. \nIt is investigating on suspicion that the Bank (including Dresdner \nBank) was involved in cum-ex transactions in various roles, \nincluding by supplying shares to third parties who were \nallegedly acting as short sellers. According to the current \nunderstanding, \nthese \nproceedings \ndo \nnot \ninvolve \nCommerzbank’s own tax credit claims with regard to capital \ngains tax and the solidarity surcharge on dividends. \nThe Bank is cooperating fully with authorities conducting \ninvestigations into cum-ex transactions. It is currently not \npossible to predict whether this will result in a burden whether \nit will occur, or the amount of any resulting burden."

      "text": "262 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \n(58) Segment reporting \n \n \n \nSegment reporting reflects the results of the operating segments \nwithin Commerzbank Group. The following segment information is \nbased on IFRS 8 Operating Segments, which applies the \nmanagement approach. The segment information is prepared on \nthe basis of internal management reporting, which the chief \noperating decision maker draws on in assessing the performance of \nthe operating segments and determining the allocation of resources \nto the operating segments. Within Commerzbank Group, the \nfunction of chief operating decision maker is exercised by the Board \nof Managing Directors. \nOur segment reporting addresses the segment structure, \ncomprising Private and Small-Business Customers, Corporate \nClients and the Others and Consolidation segment. This reflects \nCommerzbank Group’s organisational structure and forms the basis \nfor internal management reporting. The business segments are \ndefined by differences in their products, services and/or customer \ntarget groups.  \nThe Credit Solutions division was transferred from the Corporate \nClients segment to the Others and Consolidation segment in the \nsecond quarter of 2021.  \nThere were no changes of the structure of the internal \norganization that changed the composition of the reportable \nsegments in 2022. \nFurther information on the segments is provided in the Group \nmanagement report section of this Annual Report. At the beginning \nof the financial year 2022, the operating segments’ capital \nrequirement for risk-weighted assets have increased to 12.5% \n(previous year: 12%).  \nThe performance of each segment is measured in terms of \noperating profit or loss and pre-tax profit or loss, as well as \noperating return on equity and the cost/income ratio. Operating \nprofit or loss is defined as the sum of net interest income, dividend \nincome, risk result, net commission income, net income from \nfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit \nor loss, net income from hedge accounting, other net income from \nfinancial instruments, current net income from companies \naccounted for using the equity method and other net income less \noperating expenses and compulsory contributions. The operating \nprofit does not include any impairments on goodwill or other \nintangible assets or restructuring expenses. As we report pre-tax \nprofits, non-controlling interests are included in the figures for both \nprofit and loss and average capital employed. All the revenue for \nwhich a segment is responsible is thus reflected in the pre-tax profit. \nWhen showing the elimination of intragroup profits from intragroup \ntransactions in segment reporting, the transferring segment is \ntreated as if the transaction had taken place outside the Group. \nIntragroup profits and losses are therefore eliminated in Others and \nConsolidation. \nThe operating return on equity is calculated as the ratio of \noperating profit to average capital employed. It shows the return on \nthe capital employed in a given segment. The cost/income ratio in \noperating business reflects the cost efficiency of the various \nsegments. It is calculated from the ratio of the sum of operating \nexpenses and compulsory contributions to income before the risk \nresult. We also report a cost/income ratio in operating business that \nexcludes compulsory contributions, to take account of the fact that \nthis item cannot be influenced in terms of either amount or \nperiodicity. \nIncome and expenses are reported within the segments by \noriginating unit and at market prices, with the market interest rate \nmethod being used for interest operations. The actual funding costs \nfor the business-specific equity holdings of the segments are shown \nin net interest income. The Group’s return on capital employed is \nallocated to the net interest income of the various segments in \nproportion to the average capital employed in the segment. The \ninterest rate used is the long-term risk-free rate on the capital \nmarket. Net interest income also contains liquidity costs. These \ncosts include both externally paid funding costs as well as the \ncomplete allocation of liquidity costs to the businesses and \nsegments based on our transfer price system for liquidity costs. This \nsystem is used to allocate the interest expenses resulting from the \nBank’s external funding to the individual transactions and portfolios \nof the segments. This allocation is based on a central liquidity price \ncurve in accordance with cost causation. The average capital \nemployed in the segments is calculated based on the average \nsegmented risk-weighted assets. At Group level, Common Equity \nTier 1 (CET1) capital is shown, which is used to calculate the \noperating return on equity. The reconciliation of average capital \nemployed in the segments to the Group’s CET1 capital is carried out \nin Others and Consolidation. We also report the assets and liabilities \nfor the individual segments and the carrying amounts of companies \naccounted for using the equity method. Due to our business model, \nthe segment balance sheet only balances out at Group level."

The total \nremuneration therefore also includes the payment of long-term \ncomponents of the remuneration for the 2017 financial year \n(previous year: for 2015 and 2016 financial years), since these were \nlegally binding in the year under review. Total remuneration also \nincludes 149,488 (previous year: 256,554) virtual shares with a total \nvalue of €1,470 thousand (previous year: €1,897 thousand), which \nwill not be paid out until spring of 2023 or in 2024 at the share price \nvalid prior to the respective payment.

      "text": "276 \nCommerzbank Annual Report 2022 \n \n(66) Information on unconsolidated structured entities \n \nThe unconsolidated structured entities of Commerzbank Group \ncomprise the transaction types (clusters) set out below. \n Asset-backed securities (ABS) \nAsset-backed securities are collateralised securities designed to \nconvert particular assets, usually loans, into interest-bearing \ntradeable securities through securitisation. The underlying \nassets may include, for example, consumer loans (auto loans, \ncredit card assets), mortgage loans and high-grade corporate \nloans. The companies are financed through the issue of various \ntranches of asset-backed securities. Investors in these securities \nare subject to the default risk of the underlying asset. \nCommerzbank only invests in investment grade ABS tranches. \n Own securitisations and securitisation platform \nCommerzbank’s own securitisations are true-sale and synthetic \nsecuritisations used for the purpose of steering the liquidity, \ncapital and risk-weighted assets of the Bank. The companies that \nacquire the assets are financed through the issue of various \ntranches of securities that are placed on the capital market. \nFurthermore, Commerzbank also sponsors a securitisation \nplatform (Silver Tower). With this securitisation programme, \nCommerzbank \nstructures, \narranges \nand \nsecuritises \nthe \nreceivables of third parties who are customers of the Corporate \nClients segment. The refinancing takes place through credit \nlines or registered bonds issued by Luxembourg-based Silver \nTower S.A. In addition to existing over-collateralisation, the risk \nof bad debts is partly covered by external credit insurance. \n Leasing property companies \nThese companies design need-based leasing and financing \nconcepts for large plant such as real estate, aircraft, ships and \nregenerative energy systems. Normally, for every transaction, an \nautonomous special-purpose company is established in which \nthe Commerz Real Group is a majority or minority stakeholder. \nAs a financial services company, the Commerz Real Group does \nnot provide loans to these companies. Loans are instead \nprovided by lending institutions within and outside the Group. \nThe core business of the Commerz Real Group does, however, \ninclude administration related to the structured entities. \n Other \nThese are structured entities that are not included in the above \ncategories. This category mainly includes capital market \ntransactions by Asset Finance (AF) and structured transactions \nin connection with credit derivatives transactions. AF carries out \ntransactions for customers with limited access to the capital \nmarkets and brings them together with alternative providers of \ncapital. The focus in Structured Asset Finance is on structuring \nand distributing financing and investment solutions for \ncorporate customers and financial institutions. Structured Asset \nFinance concentrates on the financing of tangible assets and \nother assets using leasing or structured financing. This also \nincludes the involvement of alternative providers of capital from \noutside the banking sector. These activities are supplemented \nwith the structuring of investment solutions, and the \nunderwriting and placement of suitable financings for that \npurpose. \n \nThe carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities and income \nand expenses of Commerzbank Group relating to unconsolidated \nstructured entities are set out in the tables below: The size of the \nunconsolidated structured entities and Commerzbank Group’s \nmaximum exposure to loss are also shown.  \nThe maximum exposure to loss for Commerzbank Group with \nregard to unconsolidated structured entities results from \nrecognised assets and from lending commitments and guarantees \nprovided to unconsolidated structured entities that had not yet been \nutilised as at the reporting dates. The maximum risk of loss on \nassets with regard to unconsolidated structured entities is \nequivalent to the current carrying values of these items after the risk \nresult. For loan commitments and guarantees we treat the nominal \nvalue of the commitment as the maximum risk of loss. \nThe maximum risk of loss is shown gross, i.e. without regard to \ncollateral or hedging activities serving the purpose of risk mitigation."

December 2022 by using  \nthe USD / RUB rate and the USD / EUR rate (both as of 31. December 2022). \n \nReport on events after the reporting period \nIn May 2017, a Polish court admitted a class action lawsuit against \na subsidiary of Commerzbank alleging the ineffectiveness of index \nclauses in loan agreements denominated in Swiss francs (CHF). \nSince then, various legal issues have come before the Polish courts \nand the ECJ. On 16 February 2023, the opinion of the Advocate \nGeneral of the ECJ in case C520/21, in proceedings against another \nbank, was presented, the subject of which is whether, in the event \na mortgage loan agreement is void in its entirety, the contracting \nparties can assert claims from a contracting party beyond \nreimbursement of the monetary consideration, in particular to \nremuneration. \nThe Advocate General points out that “it is a matter for the \nnational court to determine, by reference to national law, whether \nconsumers have the right to assert such claims and, if so, to rule on \ntheir merits.” If the referring court takes the view that national law \nentitles the consumer to claim additional benefits from the bank, \nDirective 93/13 does not preclude this. National courts may also \nhave the power to dismiss such actions if they are abusive. \nWith regard to the bank’s claims against the consumer, the \nAdvocate General also notes that “it is, in principle, a matter for the \nnational court to determine, by reference to domestic law, whether \n(...) a bank is entitled to assert against a consumer claims that go \nbeyond reimbursement of the loan capital transferred and payment \nof default interest at a statutory rate.”  \nHowever, the Advocate General considers that Directive 93/13, \neven if this were permissible under national law, excludes those \nclaims, since it is clear from its general notion that, rather than \nseeking to ensure a contractual balance between the rights and \nobligations of the parties to the contract, it seeks to avoid an \nimbalance between those rights and obligations to the detriment of \nconsumers. In addition, a bank cannot derive any economic benefit \ncreated by its own unlawful behaviour. The sanction of free credit is \nthe normal consequence of the ex tunc annulment of the loan \nagreement upon the removal of its unfair terms. \nThe Advocate General’s opinion is not binding on the ECJ, nor is \nit binding in the national courts and the Polish Supreme Court. The \nECJ can share the position of the Advocate General’s, but it may also \nrule otherwise, interpreting Directive 93/13 differently.  \nTaking into account the opinion of the Advocate General at the \nECJ in case C520/21 against another bank, the subsidiary has \nperformed a reassessment of the assumptions of the model applied \nas at the balance sheet date in order to assess the impact on the \nclaims and the settlement programme. In the opinion of subsidiary’s , \ngiven the lack of binding force of he opinion, as at the balance sheet \ndate, there is no need to change the assumptions applied. The \nsubsidiary will await the ECJ’s ruling and the subsequent \ndevelopment of Polish jurisprudence. The ruling will be of significant \nimportance for the shaping of case law in matters of foreign currency \nindexed loans. It will also be reflected in the parameters of the model, \nsuch as the distribution of expected court rulings or scenarios, and \nwill affect the behaviour of borrowers in terms of willingness to \naccept settlements or to file lawsuits. It cannot be ruled out that such \nfuture events may have a significant negative impact on the \nestimation of the legal risk associated with mortgage loans in Swiss \nfrancs in the future. If the periodic monitoring of the parameters and \nassumptions of the model necessitates changes, they will be \nimplemented. \nThis has no effect on Commerzbank’s Group financial statements \nas at 31 December 2022 \n."

These matters were addressed in \nthe context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as \na whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a \nseparate opinion on these matters. \n \nCalculation of model-based loan loss provisions for credit losses \n \nThe significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 \n\"Significant accounting principles and uncertainties in estimates\" \nin the consolidated financial statements. For information on \nimpairment losses under IFRS 9, please refer to Note 31 \"Credit \nrisks and credit losses\" in the consolidated financial statements. \n \nTHE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK \nIn its consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2022, \nCOMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft presents loan loss provisions \nfor risks arising from loans and advances in Stage 1 in the amount \nof EUR 293 million and in Stage 2 in the amount of EUR 735 million. \nIn accordance with accounting standard IFRS 9 – Financial \nInstruments, COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft uses a three-\nstage approach to measure loan loss provisions, with an ECL model \nbeing used to calculate the expected credit losses (ECL). The loan \nloss provisions in Stage 1 correspond to the expected credit losses \nwithin the next twelve months. The loan loss provisions for Stage 2 \nrelate to financial instruments whose credit risk has risen \nconsiderably since initial recognition, while the loan loss provisions \nin Stage 3 are attributable to creditimpaired financial assets. The \nloan loss provisions in Stages 2 and 3 take into account all expected \ncredit losses for the entire remaining term. \nCalculating the loan loss provisions for expected credit losses in \nStages 1 and 2 requires judgement and the use of complex models, \ninputs and assumptions. The loan loss provision is determined \nusing the following inputs: probability of default (PD), loss given \ndefault (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). \nEconomic uncertainty and the consequences of the Russian war \nof aggression on Ukraine are still strongly overshadowing the \nmacroeconomic outlook. The model-based inputs used for \ncalculating loan loss provisions do not yet fully reflect these effects. \nCOMMERZBANK \nAktiengesellschaft \nrecognised \na \ntop-level \nadjustment (TLA) for indirect effects to take account of this matter. \nThere is the risk for the financial statements that appropriate \nmodels or inputs are not used for the calculation of loan loss \nprovisions for expected credit losses in Stages 1 and 2. \n \nOUR AUDIT APPROACH \nBased on our risk assessment and evaluation of the risks of material \nmisstatement, we used both control-based and substantive audit \nprocedures for our audit opinion. \nWe tested the design, setup and effectiveness of the relevant \ncontrols used to determine loan loss provisions and performed \nadditional substantive audit procedures. \nAmong others, our audit included control testing procedures \nrelated to: \n Calculation of input-based loan loss provisions \n Derivation of top-level adjustments for the input-based loan loss \nprovisions and \n Validation of the input-based loan loss provision model.  \nWe took account of the results of our control testing for the \ndetermination of the nature and scope of the other substantive audit \nprocedures. These included in particular: \n Evaluation of the methods and accounting policies for \ndetermining loan loss provisions according to IFRS 9 \n Evaluation of validations of the Bank for selected significant \nmodels and recalculation of validation tests \n Assessment of the appropriateness of the key assumptions for \nthe allocation to the stage, macroeconomic variables, scenarios \nand their weighting \n Risk-based recalculation of loan loss provisions for Stage 1 and \nStage 2 \n Review of the ratings and solvency for selected borrowers based \non the information in the respective loan files and assessment of \nthe criteria used to identify a significant increase in the credit \nrisk as well as \n Comprehension of the input-based loan loss provision \ncalculation, including the calculation methodology for top-level \nadjustments.  \n \nOUR OBSERVATIONS \nThe valuation models and inputs used to determine the loan loss \nprovisions for expected credit losses in Stages 1 and 2 are \nappropriate. \n \nValuation of financial instruments for which no observable market \nprices on active markets are available \n \nThe significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 \n\"Significant accounting principles and uncertainties in estimates\" \nin the consolidated financial statements. For information on \nfinancial instruments, please refer to Note 35 \"IFRS 13 fair value \nhierarchies and disclosure requirements\" in the consolidated \nfinancial statements."

In \naddition, COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft presents financial \nassets in the amount of EUR 5.4 billion and financial liabilities in \nthe amount of EUR 0.1 billion as fair value Level 3 financial \ninstruments.  \nThe fair values of these financial instruments are to be \ndetermined based on recognised valuation methods. The valuation \nmethods used may be based on complex models and include \nassumptions requiring judgements, especially for unobservable \ninputs. \nThe risk for the financial statements in particular is that not \nappropriate valuation models and appropriate inputs are used to \ndetermine the fair values of Level 2 and Level 3 financial  \ninstruments. \n \nOUR AUDIT APPROACH \nBased on our risk assessment and evaluation of the risks of material \nmisstatement, we used both control-based and substantive audit \nprocedures for our audit opinion.  \nWe tested the design, setup and effectiveness of the controls \nrelevant for the determination of fair values and performed \nadditional substantive audit procedures. In doing this, we involved \nKPMG's in-house valuation experts. \nAmong others, our audit included control testing procedures \nrelated to: \n Validation carried out of newly introduced or modified valuation \nmodels and the continual monitoring processes of existing \nvaluation models \n Independent review of the market inputs and data used for \nmeasurement as well as \n Determination and recognition of necessary value adjustments.  \nWe took account of the results of our control testing for the \ndetermination of the nature and scope of the other substantive audit \nprocedures.

For information on legal \nrisks from loans denominated in Swiss franc, please refer to Note \n55 \"Provisions\" in the consolidated financial statements. \n \nTHE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK \nIn its consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2022, \nCOMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft presents a provision for legal \nrisks from loans granted in the past and denominated in Swiss franc \nby a subsidiary in the amount of EUR 1.4 billion. \nCOMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft is facing a class action \nlawsuit as well as numerous individual claims due to alleged \nineffectiveness of index clauses in loan agreements denominated in \nSwiss franc. In this context, there is substantial uncertainty \nsurrounding the expected cash flows from the loans affected, as \nsignificant legal questions have not yet been conclusively ruled \nupon by the higher courts.  \nThe Bank assesses the impacts on the expected cash flows from \nloans denominated in Swiss franc based on probabilities for \ndifferent scenarios of future events, such as the outcome of pending \ncourt proceedings and future settlement agreements with clients. \nThis involves assumptions being made about the expected number \nof pending court proceedings, the probability of losing these cases, \nthe outcome of the legal issues before the Polish Supreme Court \nand the ECJ and the results of settlement agreements with clients, \nwhich are heavily subject to judgement.  \nThere is the risk for the financial statements that appropriate \nassumptions are not made for the calculation of provisions for the \nexpected burden arising from loans denominated in Swiss franc."

These included in particular: \n Assessment of the method for estimating the financial impacts \nof the loans denominated in Swiss franc and the related \naccounting policy \n Assessment of the accuracy and completeness of significant data \nincluded in the estimation of the provision \n Obtaining lawyer confirmations about the number of pending \nprocedures and \n Evaluation of significant assumptions for the estimation of \nfinancial impacts of the risk, especially the probabilities of future \nscenarios for future settlements with clients, how the number of \nclaims will develop, the probability of losing these cases and \npotential outcomes of pending court proceedings.  \n \nOUR OBSERVATIONS \nThe assumptions made for the calculation of provisions for the \nexpected burden arising from loans denominated in Swiss franc are \nappropriate. \n \nRecognition and measurement of deferred tax assets \nThe significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 \n\"Significant accounting principles and uncertainties in estimates\" in \nthe consolidated financial statements. For information on deferred \ntax assets, please refer to Note 49 \"Tax assets\" in the consolidated \nfinancial statements. \n \nTHE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK \nIn its consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2022, \nCOMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft presents deferred tax assets of \nEUR 3.1 billion.  \nThe recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets require \njudgements and also necessitate – besides the consideration of \nobjective factors – numerous estimates of future taxable earnings \nand the usability of tax losses and previously unused tax credits.  \nThe usability of the assets is estimated especially based on future \ntaxable earnings potential according to corporate planning, which, \nin consideration of the expected changes in significant value-\ndeterminant assumptions and inputs contained therein, is subject \nto estimation uncertainty. These include in particular assumptions \non the development of pre-tax earnings, the influence of potential \nspecial items as well as permanent effects, which determine the \npositive taxable earnings available in the future. The assumptions \nalso concern political and economic developments and conditions, \nspecific national tax regulations and tax planning strategies, as well \nas the transformation as part of the Strategy 2024 programme. \nThere is the risk for the financial statements that appropriate \nassumptions are not made regarding the future usability of deferred \ntax assets.  \n \nOUR AUDIT APPROACH \nBased on our risk assessment and evaluation of the risks of material \nmisstatement, we used both control-based and substantive audit \nprocedures for our audit opinion.  \nWe tested the design, setup and effectiveness of the controls \nrelevant for the determination of deferred tax assets and performed \nadditional substantive audit procedures. In doing this, we involved \nour KPMG in-house tax experts. \nOur audit also included control testing procedures regarding \nchanges in the assumptions used to determine the future taxable \nprofit.  \nWe took account of the results of our control testing for the \ndetermination of the nature and scope of the other substantive audit \nprocedures. These included in particular: \n Evaluation of the methodology applied by COMMERZBANK \nAktiengesellschaft for the recognition and measurement of \ndeferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of \nIAS 12 \n Evaluation of the appropriateness of the inputs used in corporate \nplanning \nabout \nCOMMERZBANK \nAktiengesellschaft's \nexpectations regarding future taxable earnings and \n Evaluation of the interpretation of various tax laws and \nrequirements and the materialisation of future taxable earnings \nas well as the suitability and feasibility of tax planning strategies. \n \nOUR OBSERVATIONS \nThe assumptions made on the future usability of deferred tax assets \nare appropriate."

They also have the responsibility for \ndisclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In \naddition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the \ngoing concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to \nliquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic \nalternative but to do so. \nFurthermore, the Board of Managing Directors is responsible for \nthe preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, \nprovides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all \nmaterial respects, consistent with the consolidated financial \nstatements, complies with German legal requirements, and \nappropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future \ndevelopment. In addition, the Board of Managing Directors is \nresponsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they \nhave considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group \nmanagement report that is in accordance with the applicable German \nlegal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate \nevidence for the assertions in the group management report. \nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s \nfinancial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated \nfinancial statements and of the group management report. \n \nAuditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements and of the Group Management Report \nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether \nthe consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether \nthe group management report as a whole provides an appropriate \nview of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is \nconsistent with the consolidated financial statements and the \nknowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal \nrequirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and \nrisks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report \nthat includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements \nand on the group management report. \nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a \nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 \nHGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German \nGenerally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits \npromulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always \ndetect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud \nor error and are considered material if, individually or in the \naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the \neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these \nconsolidated financial statements and this group management \nreport. \nWe exercise professional judgement and maintain professional \nscepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the \nconsolidated financial statements and of the group management \nreport, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit \nprocedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that \nis sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.
