      "text": "Jerry Baack\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer and President\nFELLOW SHAREHOLDERS, \nSince our initial public offering in 2018, \nBridgewater Bancshares, Inc. has delivered \nconsistently strong financial results driven \nby a business model that has remained vir-\ntually the same since we founded the bank. \nLast year was no different as we again saw \nrobust loan growth, a high level of efficiency, \nsuperb asset quality and a corporate culture \nthat continues to differentiate us in the mar-\nket. With a strong team in place and a proven \nstrategy, we are poised to continue providing \nresponsive service to our clients while gain-\ning market share. As we enter 2023 in a more \nuncertain economic environment, our team is \ntaking a thoughtful approach to manage the \nbalance sheet, optimize profitability and drive \nshareholder value over the long-term. \nA LOOK BACK AT 2022\n2022 was again highlighted by the continued \ngrowth of the bank, not only in terms of the \nsize of the balance sheet, which grew to $4.3 \nbillion, but also in terms of the investments \nmade in our people, technology and the scal-\nability of the business. With the ongoing exe-\ncution of our business model, we saw revenue \nincrease by 18.5 percent and another year of \noverall record earnings. Our successes also \nresulted in tangible book value growth of \n6.5 percent, a key metric in how we measure \nshareholder value. This was especially impres-\nsive in 2022 as rising interest rates negative-\nly impacted the value of securities portfolios \nacross the industry and led to tangible book \nvalue dilution for many banks.  \nBridgewater’s ability to consistently generate \nrobust loan growth has been a key differenti-\nator over the years. This continued into 2022 \nas we saw total loan growth of 26.6 percent \nwith growth spread across all of our portfo-\nlios, led by multifamily and commercial real \nestate. Loan demand began to decline late \nin the year due to fewer deals penciling out \nas interest rates increased; however, with our \n3"

      "text": "deepening brand presence in the Twin Cities \nand the strong relationships we have built, we \ncontinued to win deals with high quality cli-\nents and projects.\nDeposit growth was also strong with balances \nup 16 percent during the year. While our team \nhas done a good job of generating strong core \ndeposit growth over the past few years, we \nalso leveraged additional wholesale deposits \nand borrowings to continue supporting our \nrobust loan growth. With this continued bal-\nance sheet growth, net interest income grew \n18.4 percent in 2022, even as the net interest \nmargin declined by 9 basis points as funding \ncosts began to rise later in the year. Manag-\ning our balance sheet growth will be a key ini-\ntiative for us in 2023 as we look to optimize \nrevenue going forward in the midst of a more \nuncertain interest rate environment. \nBridgewater continued to be one of the most \nefficient banks in the industry in 2022 with \nan efficiency ratio of 41.5 percent. We have \na highly efficient culture that starts with a \nbranch-light model of just seven branches \nacross the Twin Cities. In addition, our focus \non larger commercial real estate relationships \nresults in less overall expense than business \nmodels with more of a retail focus. As a result, \nthe pace of expense growth was well-con-\ntrolled and came in less than the pace of as-\nset growth in 2022, even as we continued to \nmake key investments in our people and tech-\nnology. On the people front, we responded \nto the challenging hiring environment by re-\nfining our recruitment efforts and leveraging \nour strong corporate culture to attract and \nretain top talent. On the technology front, \nwe launched a commercial loan origination \nplatform in March 2022 that has digitized our \nend-to-end lending process and created effi-\nciencies to support future growth.\nAsset quality remained superb due in part to \nour measured risk selection, consistent un-\nderwriting standards, active credit oversight, \nand experienced lending and credit teams. \nFor example, over 80% of our real estate loan \nbalances are in the Twin Cities market and ap-\nproximately 80% of our loan origination vol-\nume during the year required full loan com-\nmittee approval. In addition, we had no net \ncharge-offs for the second consecutive year \nand nonperforming assets as a percent of to-\ntal assets totaled just 0.01 percent. We also \ntook steps to scale our enterprise risk man-\nagement program and mitigate risks across \nthe business, including credit. \nLastly, our team and culture continued to pro-\nvide the foundation for our success as an or-\nganization. Our culture is, quite simply, just \nnot like your typical bank. Whether it’s our un-\nconventional team building and social events, \nteam member development programs, or \neven our expanded health and wellness initia-\ntives, which in 2022 included education and \nresources to help identify and manage mental \nhealth-related issues, our culture remains a \nprimary reason why we are able to attract and \nretain top talent.

With inter-\nest rates continuing an unprecedented rise \nand the potential for an upcoming recession, \nwe expect to take a more cautious approach \nin the near-term. We will be focused on man-\naging our balance sheet growth to navigate \nnear-term funding challenges, while also \nthinking strategically about initiatives to bet-\nter position us for the long-term. Our strate-\ngic objectives for 2023 include the following:\nManage High Quality Balance Sheet Growth\nWe expect robust balance sheet growth to \nalways be a key part of Bridgewater’s busi-\nness model. However, with a renewed focus \non funding more of our growth with core \ndeposits over the course of the year, we ex-\npect a more moderate pace of loan growth \nin 2023. In addition to better alignment \nwith our funding capabilities, we expect \nthis approach to also benefit capital and li-\nquidity, support asset quality, and optimize \nnet interest income to drive continued rev-\nenue growth over time.\nMaintain High Efficiency While Investing in \nthe Business\nWe believe we can continue to make in-\nvestments in our people and our business \nwhile maintaining an efficiency ratio that \ndifferentiates us in the market. This starts \nwith fully leveraging and embracing the \nrecent technology investments we have \nmade to maximize operational efficiencies. \nIt also includes identifying opportunities to \nmanage our discretionary spend and align \nexpense growth with a slower pace of asset \ngrowth. Finally, it means making ongoing \ninvestments in the scalability of our busi-\nness to position us for future growth, such \nas further expansion of our enterprise risk \nmanagement program. \nProactively Assess and Monitor Asset \nQuality Risks\nFollowing another year of superb asset \nquality in 2022, we have yet to see signs of \ncredit issues as we head into 2023. Howev-\ner, given ongoing economic challenges, we \nexpect credit to normalize at some point \nand are putting extra focus on watching for \nearly warning signs. In addition, we are tak-\ning proactive steps to get ahead of poten-\ntial risks by expanding covenant testing, \nassessing repricing risk on maturing loans \nand enhancing stress testing capabilities. \nIn 2022, Bridgewater was an equity investor \nin this 62-unit project in Columbia Heights, \nMN, providing a much needed affordable \nhousing option for the community.\nFINANCED BY BRIDGEWATER\nColumbia Heights, MN\n5"

For example, we are \nworking on building out our C&I capabil-\nities to support further growth and diver-\nsification of the loan portfolio, as well as \nnew deposit growth channels. We do not \nexpect this to have a meaningful impact \non the balance sheet in 2023, but we will \nbe laying the groundwork now for a bigger \nimpact down the road. In addition, we con-\ntinue to evaluate potential M&A opportuni-\nties and prepare ourselves to act when the \nright deal comes along. While we continue \nto see plenty of organic growth opportuni-\nties in the Twin Cities, M&A could be helpful \non our longer term growth journey.\nI want to extend a special “thank you” to our \nBoard of Directors for their counsel through-\nout 2022 and our team members for their \ncommitment and hard work, both of which \nwill again be vital to our success in 2023.

BUSINESS \nCompany Overview and History \nBridgewater Bancshares, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Minnesota corporation and financial holding company with \ntwo wholly-owned subsidiaries, Bridgewater Bank (the “Bank”) and Bridgewater Risk Management, Inc., a captive \ninsurance entity. The Bank has two wholly-owned subsidiaries: BWB Holdings, LLC, which was formed for the purpose \nof holding repossessed property; and Bridgewater Investment Management, Inc., which was formed for the purposes of \nholding certain municipal securities and engaging in municipal lending activities. The Bank has seven full-service \noffices located in Bloomington, Greenwood, Minneapolis (2), St. Louis Park, Orono, and St. Paul, Minnesota.  \nThe Company is headquartered in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, a suburb located approximately 5 miles southwest \nof downtown Minneapolis. The Company and Bank were established in 2005 as a de novo bank by a group of industry \nveterans and local business leaders committed to serving the diverse needs of commercial real estate investors, small \nbusiness entrepreneurs, and high net worth individuals.   \nSince inception, the Company has grown significantly and profitably, with a focus on organic growth, driven \nprimarily by commercial real estate lending. Assets have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 32.8% since \n2005, surpassing total asset milestones of $500 million in 2013, $1.0 billion in 2016, $2.0 billion in 2019, $3.0 billion in \n2021, and $4.0 billion in 2022. While this growth has been almost entirely organic, in 2016 the Company completed a \ncomplementary small bank acquisition that added approximately $76.1 million in assets, $66.7 million in seasoned core \ndeposits and two branch locations within its market area.  \nAs of December 31, 2022, total assets were $4.35 billion, total gross loans were $3.57 billion, total deposits \nwere $3.42 billion, and total shareholders’ equity was $394.1 million."

      "text": "5 \nThe principal sources of funds for loans and investments are transaction, savings, time, and other deposits, and \nshort-term and long-term borrowings. The Company’s principal sources of income are interest and fees collected on \nloans, interest and dividends earned on investment securities and service charges. The Company’s principal expenses are \ninterest paid on deposit accounts and borrowings, employee compensation and other overhead expenses.  The \nCompany’s simple, highly efficient business model of providing responsive support and simple solutions to clients \ncontinues to be the underlying principle that drives the Company’s profitable growth.   \nMarket Area and Competition \nThe Company operates in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Statistical Area, or MSA, which had total deposits of \n$232.4 billion as of June 30, 2022, and ranks as the 16th largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States in total \ndeposits, and the third largest metropolitan statistical area in the Midwest in total deposits, based on Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation, or FDIC, data. This area is commonly known as the “Twin Cities” after its two largest cities, \nMinneapolis, the city with the largest population in the state, and St. Paul, the state capital. \nThe Twin Cities MSA is defined by attractive market demographics, including strong household incomes, \ndense populations, a resilient employee base and the presence of a diverse group of large and small businesses. As of \nDecember 31, 2022, the Company’s market ranked second in median household income in the Midwest and eighth in the \nnation, when compared to the top 20 MSAs by population size in each area, based on data available on S&P Global \nMarket Intelligence. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the population in the Twin Cities MSA was \napproximately 3.7 million as of December 31, 2022, making it the third largest MSA in the Midwest and 16th largest \nMSA in the United States. The Twin Cities MSA had an unemployment rate of 2.6%, which was lower than the national \naverage of 3.5%, as of December 31, 2022. These strong labor market fundamentals can be attributed to the significant \npresence of national and international businesses across diverse industries operating within the Twin Cities MSA. \nThe Company operates in a competitive market area and competes with other, often much larger, retail and \ncommercial banks and financial institutions. Two large, national banking chains, Wells Fargo and US Bank, together \ncontrolled 62.3% of the deposit market share in the Twin Cities MSA as of June 30, 2022, based on FDIC data and as \ndisplayed in the table below. By comparison, as of the same date, the Company had a deposit market share of \napproximately 1.4%, which ranked the Company ninth in the Twin Cities MSA overall and fourth in the Twin Cities \nMSA among banks headquartered in Minnesota. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n     \nTotal \n     \nMarket \n \n \n \n \nState \n \nBranch \n \nDeposits \n \nShare \nRank \n \nInstitution \n \nHeadquarters \n \nCount \n \n($000) \n \n(%) \n1  . . . . . . . . . . . .

      "text": "6 \nProducts and Services \nThe Company offers a full array of simple, quality loan and deposit products primarily for commercial clients. \nWhile the Company provides products and services that compete with those offered by large national and regional \ncompetitors, the Company additionally offers responsive support and personalized solutions tailored for each client. The \nCompany emphasizes customer service and believes in providing distinguishing levels of client service through the \nexperience of employees, the responsiveness and certainty of the credit process and the efficiency with which business is \nconducted. The Company believes that clients notice a difference in service compared to the much larger institutions in \nthe market. The Company has built a strong referral network that continually provides opportunities with new client \nrelationships. At this time, the Company does not operate any non-depository business lines such as mortgage, wealth \nmanagement or trust. \nLending.  The Bank focuses primarily on commercial lending, consisting of loans secured by nonfarm, \nnonresidential properties, loans secured by multifamily residential properties, nonowner occupied single family \nresidential properties, construction loans, land development loans and commercial and industrial loans. The Bank has a \nparticular expertise in multifamily financing which has historically represented a large portion of the loan portfolio. This \nasset class has performed extremely well and has lower historical loss rates when compared to other loan types. \nCommercial real estate loans (excluding multifamily and construction) consist of owner and nonowner occupied \nproperties. This portfolio segment is well diversified with loans secured by office buildings, retail strip centers, industrial \nproperties, senior housing and hospitality properties and mixed-use properties. In addition to loans secured by improved \ncommercial real estate properties, the Bank engages in construction lending, which includes single family residential \nconstruction loans, land development, finished lots and raw land loans, and commercial and multifamily construction.  \nIn recent years, the Bank has increased its focus on commercial and industrial lending. This portfolio includes a \nmix of term equipment loans and revolving lines of credit to support the needs of local businesses. Additionally, the \nBank has a niche within the tax credit investment market whereby it bridges equity capital receivables on various tax \ncredit projects. \nThe Bank focuses on lending to borrowers located or investing in the Twin Cities MSA across a diverse range \nof industries and property types, however, as a relationship lender, it will from time to time finance properties located \noutside of Minnesota for its existing local clients in select situations. As of December 31, 2022, over 80% of the Bank’s \nreal estate loan balances were secured by properties located in the Twin Cities market. \nRobust and consistent growth over the last several years has been attributable to the Bank’s strengthening brand \nand service model in the Twin Cities, client and banker acquisitions resulting from M&A-related market disruption and \nthe expansion of talented lending and business service teams. As a result, the Bank’s ability to cultivate relationships \nwith certain individuals and businesses has resulted in a concentration of large loans to a small number of borrowers. \nThe Bank has established an informal, internal limit on a single loan to finance one transaction, but may, under certain \ncircumstances, consider going above this internal limit in situations where management’s understanding of the industry, \nthe borrower’s financial condition, overall credit quality and property fundamentals are commensurate with the increased \nsize of the relationship. Loan demand remained high for most of 2022, but in late 2022, the Bank began seeing a \nreduction in overall loan demand due to the rising interest rate environment. \nDeposits.  The Bank has developed a suite of deposit products targeted at commercial clients, including a \nvariety of remote deposit and cash management products, along with commercial transaction accounts. The Bank also \noffers consumers traditional retail deposit products through its branch network, along with online, mobile and direct \nbanking channels. Many of the deposits do not require a branch visit, creating efficiencies across the Bank’s branch \nnetwork. \nDeposits continue to be the primary funding source for the Bank’s lending activities, both core and non-core \ndeposits. Deposit growth has been positively impacted by new client and bank acquisition opportunities due to M&A-\nrelated market disruption in the Twin Cities and the expansion of the treasury management team. As interest rates \nincreased sharply in 2022, generating core deposit growth became difficult, especially with the emergence of"

As a result, the Bank utilized additional brokered deposits to \nsupplement core deposits. \nWhile the Bank remains committed to growing core deposits, brokered deposits have remained a strategic \ncomponent of the funding strategy and interest rate risk management. The Bank’s Asset Liability Management, or ALM, \nCommittee monitors the size of this portfolio, and ongoing opportunities. \nThe Bank has developed relationships with certain individuals and businesses that have resulted in a \nconcentration of large deposits from a small number of clients. As of December 31, 2022, the 10 largest depositor \nrelationships accounted for approximately 15.0% of total deposits. This high concentration of depositors presents a risk \nto liquidity if one or more of them decides to change its relationship with the Bank and to withdraw all or a significant \nportion of their accounts. \nCompetitive Strengths \nAs the Company seeks to continue to grow the business, management believes the following strengths provide a \ncompetitive advantage over other financial institutions operating in its market area: \nCommercial Banking Expertise.  Management believes the Company has earned the reputation as one of the \nprominent commercial real estate lenders in the Twin Cities MSA due in large part to the strength of the lending team. \nThe Company has an experienced, professional team of 25 lenders, and believes the ability to drive quality commercial \nloan growth is a result of being able to provide each client with access to a knowledgeable, experienced, responsive and \ndedicated banker. Due to their market knowledge and understanding of clients’ businesses, the lenders are well \npositioned to provide timely and relevant feedback to clients. Management believes the responsive credit culture \nseparates the Company from its competitors. \nMultifamily Lending Expertise.  The Company specializes in multifamily lending, which has historically \nrepresented a large portion of the total loan portfolio. The Company believes this lending niche lowers the risk profile of \nthe overall loan portfolio due to its lower historical loss rates when compared to other loan types. In fact, the multifamily \nportfolio has experienced no net charge-offs over the past five years and only $62,000 of net charge-offs since inception. \nAs a result of the Company’s segment expertise and strong portfolio performance, the Company has been comfortable \ncontinuing to grow the multifamily portfolio. \nEngaged and Experienced Board of Directors and Management Team.  The Company’s board of directors \nconsists of highly accomplished individuals with strong industry and business experience in the market area. The \ncombined expertise of the board of directors and the significant banking and regulatory experience of the strategic \nleadership team help execute the Company’s growth strategy.  \nThe Company’s seven-person strategic leadership team has a strong balance of extensive banking and \nregulatory experience, drive and talent. The team has over 130 years of combined banking and financial services \nexperience and more than 20 years of regulatory experience. Three members of the team have been leading the Company \nsince its formation, and with an average age of 50, the strategic leadership team can drive growth and strategy for years \nto come.  \nIn addition to the strategic leadership team, the Company has demonstrated an ability to grow through the \nrecruitment of high performing individuals. The Company seeks to hire people with significant in-market experience \nwho fit the Company’s hard-working, entrepreneurial culture. Through targeted hiring and internal development efforts, \nthe Company has established a deep bench of talent to continue to grow and manage the business. The Company has \nstructured its team to prepare for long-term growth and stability by combining the experienced strategic leadership and \ncommercial lending teams with its next generation of leaders.  \nEfficiency.  The Company operates as a highly efficient organization based on a simple business model. By \nfocusing on commercial real estate lending, employee overhead is low due to its lenders maintaining larger loan \nportfolio sizes compared to other types of commercial lending. In addition, the Company serves its clients through a"

The Company has developed a hard-working and entrepreneurial \nculture, which is a critical component for attracting and retaining experienced and talented bankers, as well as clients. \nThe Company has established a set of core values, based on characteristics that describe and inspire the culture—\nUnconventional, Responsive, Dedicated, Growth and Accurate. To maintain the culture, all potential and current \npersonnel evaluations include an assessment of these attributes. Clients notice the unconventional environment with \ndedicated employees who feel like they are part of building a high performing bank. \nSolid Asset Quality Metrics.  A risk-management focused business model has contributed to solid asset quality \nduring a period of strong loan growth and economic uncertainty. The Company diligently monitors and routinely stress \ntests the loan portfolio. The strong credit metrics are the result of measured risk selection, consistent underwriting \nstandards, active credit oversight and experienced lending and credit teams. \nProactive Enterprise Risk Management.  The Company’s enterprise risk management practices provide an \nenhanced level of oversight allowing management to be proactive rather than reactive. The Company has been focused \non scaling its enterprise risk management function to address emerging risks and support growth plans. The \nmanagement-level enterprise risk management committee, comprised of the strategic leadership team, the Chief Risk \nOfficer and senior representatives from all departments, meets quarterly to identify, assess, measure, monitor, and \nmanage the Company’s overall enterprise risk position and to discuss how the Company’s strategic initiatives may \nimpact the Company’s risk profile. Enterprise risk management reports are provided to the full Company board on a \nquarterly basis. Furthermore, in 2016, Bridgewater Risk Management, Inc. was formed as a captive insurance subsidiary \nto provide supplemental insurance coverage to the Company and its subsidiaries for risk management purposes. \nThe Company also has a comprehensive Commercial Real Estate Portfolio Risk Management Policy which \nimplements formal processes and procedures designed to manage and mitigate risk within the commercial real estate \nportfolio. This policy addresses regulatory guidelines for institutions, such as the Bank, that exhibit higher levels of \ncommercial real estate concentrations. These processes and procedures include board and management oversight, \ncommercial real estate exposure limits, portfolio monitoring tools, management information systems, market reports, \nunderwriting standards, a credit risk review function and periodic stress testing to evaluate potential credit risk and the \nsubsequent impacts on capital and earnings.  \nStrategies for Growth \nThe Company had a track record of generating consistent, robust growth over the past seventeen years. Given \nthe current interest rate environment, which has resulted in increased funding pressure and reduced loan demand, the \nCompany intends to continue growing the balance sheet, albeit at a slower pace over the near-term. To generate future \ngrowth, the Company intends to continue to execute the proven strategies that it has used in prior years to achieve some \nof the strongest performance results in the community banking industry. These strategies include the following: \nFocus on Organic Growth in the Market Area.  The Company intends to continue to grow its business \norganically in a focused and strategic manner by leveraging its competitive strengths, including commercial banking \nexpertise, an experienced management team, an efficient business model and strong branding, to capitalize on the \nopportunities in the Company’s market area. As a publicly traded but locally-headquartered bank, the Company can go \nbeyond what small banks can provide by offering sophisticated products and services similar to those offered by the \nmuch larger, out-of-state banks, but in a manner that is tailored to the needs of local clients in a more efficient, \nresponsive and flexible way. Although the growth potential of the current market is substantial and provides the ability \nto continue to grow organically in the market, the Company will continue to consider opportunistic acquisitions that \ncomplement the current business and support the potential for longer term growth and returns for shareholders. \nThe Company plans to increase core deposits over time to support loan growth and build market share by \nexpanding existing client relationships and by developing new deposit-focused clients. The Company plans to continue \nto expand its footprint through marketing and networking efforts focused on generating deposits. Although the Company"

      "text": "9 \nis committed to growing core deposits, growth will continue to be supplemented, when necessary, with non-core, \nwholesale funding sources. On the lending side, the Company intends to rely on the expertise of the lenders, and believes \nthe Company is well-positioned to continue to organically grow commercial loans based on the favorable market \ndemographics in the Twin Cities MSA. \nLeverage Entrepreneurial Culture and Talent.  The Company has built a team of bankers that is hard-working, \npassionate and energized by the opportunities to continue to grow the Company’s business and develop its brand in the \nTwin Cities MSA. With an experienced strategic leadership team and a strong layer of talented middle managers, the \nCompany is well positioned for future growth. The Company aggressively recruits qualified personnel and develops \ntalent internally and believes the culture, which empowers employees to be entrepreneurs for the business, will allow the \nCompany to attract and develop the talent needed to drive growth. \nConsider Opportunistic Acquisitions.  In addition to organic growth, from time to time, the Company may \nconsider additional acquisition opportunities that fit with the organization. Specifically, the Company will evaluate \nacquisitions that would be complementary to its existing business. The Company will continue to seek acquisitions that \nwill bolster its balance sheet in areas where the Company would like to grow or diversify, without compromising the \nCompany’s risk profile or culture. While pursuing potential acquisitions, the Company intends to be disciplined in its \napproach to pricing, new business lines and new markets. In the future, the Company may evaluate and act upon \nacquisition opportunities that would produce attractive returns for shareholders. Management believes that there will be \nfurther bank consolidation in the Twin Cities MSA and that the Company is well positioned to be a preferred partner for \nsmaller institutions looking to exit through a sale to an in-market buyer. \nHuman Capital Resources \nThe Company believes that its growth and success are dependent on its ability to attract, develop, and retain a \nhigh-performing and diverse team of people. The Company’s unconventional corporate culture is a key differentiator \nand meaningful driver in achieving this objective. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 246 full-time equivalent \nemployees, most of which are full-time employees, an increase of 12% from December 31, 2021. None of the \nCompany’s employees are a party to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company considers the relationship with its \nemployees to be good and has not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements. \nThe Company believes embracing and understanding diversity, equity and inclusion has and will continue to \nmake the Company stronger. In 2019, the Company established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee that \nfocuses on building an inclusive culture that encourages, supports and celebrates the diversity of the Company’s \nemployees and the communities in which it serves. The Company recognizes that different perspectives enhance its \nthinking and improve its employees’ experience by bringing together unique backgrounds, beliefs, cultures, and \nexperiences at the Company. As of December 31, 2022, women and people of color comprised 52% and 18% of the \nCompany’s total workforce, respectively. Similarly, women and people of color made up 54% and 11% of manager \nroles, respectively.  \nEmployee retention helps the Company operate efficiently and carry out its mission of being the finest \nentrepreneurial bank. The Company believes its commitment to its core values (Unconventional, Responsive, Dedicated, \nGrowth and Accurate), as well as prioritizing concern for its employees’ well-being, supporting its employees’ career \ngoals and offering competitive wages and benefits aid in the retention of its employees. For example, in 2021, the \nCompany became one of the few local Minnesota companies to establish a $20 per hour minimum wage. \nThe Company believes developing employees’ leadership skills is a critical factor for the long-term future \nsuccess of the Company. The Company has a Mentorship Program that gives employees the opportunity to open the door \nto professional advice and constructive communication from leaders at all levels within the organization. The program \nprovides participants with ways to build leadership skills, learn from others outside of their normal area of activity, and \ncontinue to grow both personally and professionally.  \nThe Company strives to give back to the communities in which it operates by encouraging employees to be \nengaged in the communities where they live and work.

      "text": "11 \nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION \nGeneral \nFDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal \nand state law.  As a result, the Company’s growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management \ndecisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the \nregulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Company’s primary regulator, the Federal \nReserve, and the Bank’s primary federal regulator, the FDIC and primary state regulator, the Minnesota Department of \nCommerce, Financial Institutions Division, or MDOC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, as the \nregulator of consumer financial services and their providers. Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal \nRevenue Service, or IRS, and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards \nBoard, or FASB, securities laws administered by the SEC and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering \nlaws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or Treasury, have an impact on the Company’s business. The \neffect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to the Company’s operations \nand results. \nFederal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on \nthe operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the \nprotection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than shareholders. These laws, and the \nregulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of the Company’s \nbusiness, the kinds and amounts of investments the Company and the Bank may make, reserve requirements, required \ncapital levels relative to assets, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to \nmerge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with the Company’s and the Bank’s insiders and affiliates and the Company’s \npayment of dividends. In reaction to the global financial crisis and particularly following the passage of the Dodd-Frank \nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act, the Company experienced heightened regulatory \nrequirements and scrutiny. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, \ntheir influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and caused the Company’s compliance \nand risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and \nConsumer Protection Act of 2018, or Regulatory Relief Act, eliminated questions about the applicability of certain \nDodd-Frank Act reforms to community bank systems, including relieving the Company of any requirement to engage in \nmandatory stress tests, maintain a risk committee or comply with the Volcker Rule’s complicated prohibitions on \nproprietary trading and ownership of private funds. The Company believes these reforms have been favorable to the \nCompany’s operations. \nThe supervisory framework for U.S. banking organizations subjects banks and bank holding companies to \nregular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not \npublicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only \ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and \nperformance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to \nimpose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other \nthings, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with \nlaws and regulations. \nThe following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to \nthe Company and the Bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor \ndoes it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by \nreference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision. \nThe Role of Capital \nRegulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the \nrisks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions generally are required to hold more capital than other \nbusinesses, which directly affects the Company’s earnings capabilities.

Banks have been required to hold minimum levels of capital based on guidelines established by \nthe bank regulatory agencies since 1983. The minimums have been expressed in terms of ratios of “capital” divided by \n“total assets”. The capital guidelines for U.S. banks beginning in 1989 have been based upon international capital \naccords (known as “Basel” rules) adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central \nbanks and bank supervisors that acts as the primary global standard-setter for prudential regulation, as implemented by \nthe U.S. bank regulatory agencies on an interagency basis. The accords recognized that bank assets for the purpose of the \ncapital ratio calculations needed to be risk weighted (the theory being that riskier assets should require more capital) and \nthat off-balance sheet exposures needed to be factored in the calculations. Following the global financial crisis, the \nGroup of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, \nannounced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known \nas Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis.  \nThe Basel III Rule. The United States bank regulatory agencies adopted the Basel III regulatory capital \nreforms, and, at the same time, effected changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in regulations that were effective (with \ncertain phase-ins) in 2015. Basel III, or the Basel III Rule, established capital standards for banks and bank holding \ncompanies that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously: it increased the required quantity and \nquality of capital; and it required a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of risk in the calculation of risk \nweightings. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital \nrequirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to most bank and savings \nand loan holding companies. The Company and the Bank are each subject to the Basel III Rule as described below. \nNot only did the Basel III Rule increase most of the required minimum capital ratios in effect prior to January 1, \n2015, but, in requiring that forms of capital be of higher quality to absorb loss, it introduced the concept of Common \nEquity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of Treasury stock), retained \nearnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also \nchanged the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered \nAdditional Tier 1 Capital (primarily non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that meets certain requirements) and Tier \n2 Capital (primarily other types of preferred stock and subordinated debt, subject to limitations).  The Basel III Rule also \nconstrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and required \ndeductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital in the event that such assets exceeded a percentage of a banking \ninstitution’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. \nThe Basel III Rule requires minimum capital ratios as follows:  \n• \nA ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; \n• \nA ratio of Tier 1 Capital equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets;  \n• \nA continuation of the minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8% of risk-\nweighted assets; and \n• \nA leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly average assets equal to 4% in all circumstances. \nIn addition, institutions that seek the freedom to make capital distributions (including for dividends and \nrepurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5% in \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to a capital conservation buffer. The purpose of the conservation buffer is to \nensure that banking institutions maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial \nand economic stress. Factoring in the conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to 7% for \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital.  \nWell-Capitalized Requirements. The ratios described above are minimum standards for banking organizations \nto be considered “adequately capitalized.” Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks to hold more capital and"

For example, a banking \norganization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements \notherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or \napplications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if \nwarranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. For example, the Federal \nReserve’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among \nother things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading \nactivities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to \nmaintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions (i.e., Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the \nminimum levels. \nUnder the capital regulations of the Federal Reserve for the Company and the FDIC for the Bank, in order to be \nwell-capitalized, a banking organization must maintain: \n• \nA Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or more;  \n• \nA ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% or more;  \n• \nA ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10% or more; and  \n• \nA leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets of 5% or greater. \nIt is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital \nconservation buffer discussed above. \nAs of December 31, 2022: (i) the Bank was not subject to a directive from MDOC or FDIC to increase its \ncapital and (ii) the Bank was well-capitalized, as defined by FDIC regulations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company \nhad regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve’s requirements and met the Basel III Rule requirements to be \nwell-capitalized. The Company was also in compliance with the capital conservation buffer as of December 31, 2022. \nPrompt Corrective Action. The concept of an institution being “well-capitalized” is part of a regulatory \nenforcement regime that provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take “prompt corrective action” to \nresolve the problems of undercapitalized depository institutions based on the capital level of each particular institution.  \nThe extent of the regulators’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “adequately capitalized,” \n“undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized,” in each case as defined by \nregulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators’ corrective powers \ninclude: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution’s asset growth and \nrestricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) \nor to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that \nthe institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior \nexecutive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent \nbanks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on \nsubordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. \nCommunity Bank Capital Simplification.  Community banks have long raised concerns with bank regulators \nabout the regulatory burden, complexity, and costs associated with certain provisions of the Basel III Rule.  In response, \nCongress provided an “off-ramp” for institutions, like the Company, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 \nbillion. Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act instructed the federal banking regulators to establish a single \n“Community Bank Leverage Ratio”, or CBLR, of between 8 and 10%. Under the final rule, a community banking \norganization is eligible to elect the new framework if it has less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited \namounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a CBLR greater than 9%. The Company may elect the \nCBLR framework at any time but has not currently determined to do so."

      "text": "14 \nSupervision and Regulation of the Company \nGeneral. The Company, as the sole shareholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company that has elected \nfinancial holding company status. As a bank holding company, the Company is registered with, and is subject to \nregulation supervision and enforcement by, the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. The Company is legally obligated to \nact as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where the \nCompany might not otherwise do so. Under the BHCA, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal \nReserve. The Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of the Company’s operations and \nsuch additional information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries as the Federal Reserve may require. \nAcquisitions, Activities and Financial Holding Company Election. The primary purpose of a bank holding \ncompany is to control and manage banks. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for \nany merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank \nholding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the \nFederal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In \napproving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the \naggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution \naffiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-\nstate institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a \nminimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. \nFurthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-\nmanaged in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions. For a discussion of the capital requirements, see “—The \nRole of Capital” above. \nThe BHCA generally prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more \nthan 5% of a class of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than \nthat of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general \nprohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, \nand to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, \n1999 to be “so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto.” This authority permits the Company to \nengage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a savings association, or any \nentity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software \ndevelopment) and mortgage banking and brokerage services. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the \ndomestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.  \nAdditionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and \nelect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of \nnonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other \nactivity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is \nfinancial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be \ncomplementary to any such financial activity, as long as the activity does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or \nsoundness of FDIC-insured institutions or the financial system generally. The Company has elected to operate as a \nfinancial holding company. In order to maintain its status as a financial holding company, the Company and the Bank \nmust be well-capitalized, well-managed, and the Bank must have a least a satisfactory CRA rating. If the Federal \nReserve determines that a financial holding company or any bank subsidiary is not well-capitalized or well-managed, the \nFederal Reserve will provide a period of time in which to achieve compliance, but, during the period of noncompliance, \nthe Federal Reserve may place any limitations on the Company that it deems appropriate. Furthermore, if non-\ncompliance is based on the failure of the Bank to achieve a satisfactory CRA rating, the Company would not be able to \ncommence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities. \nChange in Control. Federal law prohibits any person or company from acquiring “control” of an FDIC-insured \ndepository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. “Control” is \nconclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or \nbank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 10% and 24.99% ownership."

      "text": "15 \nCapital Requirements. The Company is subject to the complex consolidated capital requirements of the Basel \nIII Rule, see “—the Role of Capital” above.  \nDividend Payments. The Company’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders may be affected by both \ngeneral corporate law considerations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies. As a \nMinnesota corporation, the Company is subject to the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, as amended, which prohibits \nthe Company from paying a dividend if, after giving effect to the dividend the Company would not be able to pay its \ndebts as the debts become due in the ordinary course of business, or the Company’s total assets would be less than the \nsum of its total liabilities plus, the amount that would be needed, if the Company were to be dissolved at the time of the \ndistribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to \nthose receiving the distribution. \nAs a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company \nshould eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to shareholders if: (i) the company’s net income available to \nshareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund \nthe dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall \ncurrent and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its \nminimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding \ncompanies and their nonbank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or \nviolations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of \ndividends by banks and bank holding companies.  In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom \nto pay dividends have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer. \nSee “—The Role of Capital” above. \nMonetary Policy. The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of \nfinancial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, and this is evidenced in its increases in the targeted federal \nfunds rate throughout 2022. Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open \nmarket transactions in U.S. government securities and changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings. These means are \nused in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and \ntheir use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. \nFederal Securities Regulation. The Company’s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Exchange \nAct. Consequently, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions \nand requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act. \nCorporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and \nexecutive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. It increased shareholder influence \nover boards of directors by requiring companies to give shareholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and \nso-called “golden parachute” payments, and authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to \nnominate and solicit voters for their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the \nFederal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of bank holding companies, \nregardless of whether such companies are publicly traded.  \nSupervision and Regulation of the Bank \nGeneral. The Bank is a Minnesota-chartered bank. The deposit accounts of the Bank are insured by the FDIC’s \nDeposit Insurance Fund, or DIF, to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations, currently \n$250,000 per insured depositor category. As a Minnesota-chartered FDIC-insured bank, the Bank is subject to the \nexamination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the MDOC, the chartering authority for Minnesota \nbanks, and the FDIC, designated by federal law as the primary federal regulator of insured state banks that, like the \nBank, are not members of the Federal Reserve.  \n Deposit Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium \nassessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay"

      "text": "16 \ninsurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification. For institutions like the Bank that are not considered large \nand highly complex banking organizations, assessments are now based on examination ratings and financial ratios. The \ntotal base assessment rates currently range from 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. At least semi-annually, the FDIC \nupdates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increases or decreases the assessment rates, following \nnotice and comment on proposed rulemaking.  \nThe reserve ratio is the DIF balance divided by estimated insured deposits. In response to the global financial \ncrisis, the Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total \ninsured deposits. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the reserve ratio briefly exceeded the statutory threshold, but, \nbecause of extraordinary insured deposit growth caused by an unprecedented inflow of deposits during the pandemic, the \nreserve ratio fell below 1.35% and continues to be below the threshold. The FDIC staff closely monitors the factors that \naffect the reserve ratio, and, in order to raise the reserve ratio to 1.35% by September 30, 2028, the FDIC increased the \ninitial deposit insurance rates by two basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of the 2023 \nassessment. As a result of this change, the Bank’s FDIC insurance assessment will increase beginning in 2023.  \nSupervisory Assessments. All Minnesota-chartered banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the \nMDOC to fund the operations of that agency. The amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of the Bank’s total \nassets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bank paid supervisory assessments to the MDOC totaling \napproximately $84,400. \nCapital Requirements. Banks are generally required to maintain capital levels in excess of other businesses. For \na discussion of capital requirements, see “—The Role of Capital” above. \nLiquidity Requirements. Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which bank assets may be \nconverted to cash. Liquid assets are those that can be converted to cash quickly if needed to meet financial obligations. \nTo remain viable, FDIC-insured institutions must have enough liquid assets to meet their near-term obligations, such as \nwithdrawals by depositors. Because the global financial crisis was in part a liquidity crisis, Basel III also includes a \nliquidity framework that requires FDIC-insured institutions to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. One \ntest, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, is designed to ensure that the banking entity has an adequate \nstock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that can be converted easily and immediately in private markets into \ncash to meet liquidity needs for a 30-calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The other test, known as the net stable \nfunding ratio, or NSFR, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of \nFDIC-insured institutions over a one-year horizon. These tests provide an incentive for banks and holding companies to \nincrease their holdings in Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets, increase the use of long-\nterm debt as a funding source and rely on stable funding like core deposits (in lieu of brokered deposits). \nIn addition to liquidity guidelines already in place, the federal bank regulatory agencies implemented the Basel \nIII LCR in 2014, and in 2016 proposed implementation of the NSFR. While these rules do not, and will not, apply to the \nBank, it continues to review its liquidity risk management policies. \nDividend Payments. The primary source of funds for the Company is dividends from the Bank. Under \nMinnesota law, the Bank cannot declare or pay a cash dividend or dividend in kind unless it will have a surplus \namounting to not less than 20% of its capital after payment of the dividend. Once this surplus amount reaches 50% of the \nBank’s capital, the Bank may pay dividends out of net profits if the dividends will not reduce the Bank’s capital, \nundivided profits and reserves below requirements established by the MDOC. Further, the Bank may not declare or pay \na dividend until cumulative dividends on preferred stock, if any, are paid in full. \nThe payment of dividends by any FDIC-insured institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate \ncapital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and an FDIC-insured institution generally is \nprohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. As \ndescribed above, the Bank exceeded its capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of December 31, 2022. \nNotwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, however, the FDIC and the MDOC may prohibit the payment of \ndividends by the Bank if either or both determine such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

See “—The Role of Capital” above. \nState Bank Investments and Activities.  The Bank is permitted to make investments and engage in activities \ndirectly or through subsidiaries as authorized by Minnesota law. However, under federal law and FDIC regulations, \nFDIC-insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a \ntype, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law and FDIC regulations also prohibit FDIC-\ninsured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is \nnot permitted for a national bank unless the bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital \nrequirements and the FDIC determines that the activity would not pose a significant risk to the DIF. These restrictions \nhave not had, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on the operations of the Bank. \nInsider Transactions. The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on “covered \ntransactions” between the Bank and its “affiliates.” The Company is an affiliate of the Bank for purposes of these \nrestrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments \nin the stock or other securities of the Company and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as \ncollateral for loans made by the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with \naffiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for \nwhich collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. \nCertain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Bank to its \ndirectors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, to principal shareholders of the \nCompany and to “related interests” of such directors, officers and principal shareholders. In addition, federal law and \nregulations may affect the terms on which any person who is a director or officer of the Company or the Bank, or a \nprincipal shareholder of the Company, may obtain credit from banks with which the Bank maintains a correspondent \nrelationship. \nSafety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management. FDIC-insured institutions are expected to operate in a \nsafe and sound manner. The federal banking agencies have adopted operational and managerial standards to promote the \nsafety and soundness of such institutions that address internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan \ndocumentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality \nand earnings. \nIn general, the safety and soundness standards prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each \ninstitution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. If an institution fails to operate in a \nsafe and sound manner, the FDIC-insured institution’s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a \nplan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance \nplan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal \nregulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency \ncited in the regulator’s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the FDIC-insured institution’s rate of growth, require the \nFDIC-insured institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates that the institution pays on deposits or require the \ninstitution to take any action that the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Operating in an unsafe or \nunsound manner will also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, \nincluding cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments. \nDuring the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound \nrisk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions \nthat they supervise. Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking \nactivities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of \nfinancial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks \nfacing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal and reputational risk. \nThe key risk themes identified for 2023 are discussed under “—Risk Factors.”"

The Bank is subject to many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing \nrequirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect non-public confidential information of their customers. \nThese laws require the Bank to periodically disclose its privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such \ninformation and permit consumers to opt out of their ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under \ncertain circumstances. They also impact the Bank’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates \nfor marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. In addition, as a part of its \noperational risk mitigation, the Bank is required to implement a comprehensive information security program that \nincludes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records \nand information and to require the same of its service providers. These security and privacy policies and procedures are \nin effect across all business lines and geographic locations. \nBranching Authority. Minnesota banks, such as the Bank, have the authority under Minnesota law to establish \nbranches anywhere in the State of Minnesota, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The Dodd-Frank \nAct permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new interstate branches or acquire individual branches \nof a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) without impediments. Federal \nlaw permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal \nand state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence \nfor a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger.  \nTransaction Account Reserves. Federal law requires FDIC-insured institutions to maintain reserves against \ntheir transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts) to provide liquidity. The amount of reserves \nis established by the Federal Reserve based on tranches of zero, three and ten percent of a bank’s transaction account \ndeposits. However, in March 2020, in an unprecedented move, the Federal Reserve announced that the banking system \nhad ample reserves, and, as reserve requirements no longer played a significant role in this regime, it reduced all reserve \ntranches to zero percent, thereby freeing banks from the legally mandated reserve maintenance requirement. The action \npermits the Bank to loan or invest funds that were previously unavailable. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it \nexpects to continue to operate in an ample reserves regime for the foreseeable future. \nCommunity Reinvestment Act Requirements. The CRA requires the Bank to have a continuing and affirmative \nobligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and \nmoderate-income neighborhoods. Federal regulators regularly assess the Bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its \ncommunities. Applications for acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of the Bank’s effectiveness in meeting \nits CRA requirements. In May 2022, the bank regulatory agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking called the \nJoint Proposal to Strengthen and Modernize Community Reinvestment Act Regulations (the “CRA Proposal”). The CRA \nProposal is designed to update how CRA activities qualify for consideration, where CRA activities are considered, and \nhow CRA activities are evaluated. More specifically, the bank regulatory agencies described the goals of the CRA \nProposal as follows: (i) to expand access to credit, investment, and basic banking services in low and moderate income \ncommunities; (ii) to adapt to changes in the banking industry, including mobile and internet banking by modernizing \nassessment areas while maintaining a focus on branch based areas; (iii) to provide greater clarity, consistency, and \ntransparency in the application of the regulations through the use of standardized metrics as part of CRA evaluation and \nclarifying eligible CRA activities focused on low and moderate income communities and underserved rural \ncommunities; (iv) to tailor CRA rules and data collection to bank size and business model; and (v) to maintain a unified \napproach among the regulators. A final rule has not yet been issued. \nAnti-Money Laundering. The USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act and other similar laws are designed \nto deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and have significant implications \nfor FDIC-insured institutions and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. These laws mandate financial \nservices companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address the following matters: \n(i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting"

Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy \ntoo many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in commercial real estate, or CRE, is one example of \nregulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management \nPractices guidance, or CRE Guidance, provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to \nassist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that \nmay warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) CRE loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the \npreceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance \ndoes not limit banks’ levels of CRE lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management \npractices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentrations. On \nDecember 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices \nrelated to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased \ncompetitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal \nbank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-\nmanagement practices to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-\ninsured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk.  \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Bank’s total loans secured by multifamily and CRE nonowner occupied \nproperties plus total construction and land development loans represented more than 514.9% of its total risk-based \ncapital. Thus, the Bank is deemed to have a concentration in CRE lending. Accordingly, pursuant to the Policy \nGuidance, the Bank is required to have heightened risk management practices in place to account for the heightened \ndegree of risk associated with CRE lending. \nConsumer Financial Services. The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to \nall providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB \ncommenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority \nfor a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including the \nBank, as well as the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination \nand enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion \nor less in assets, like the Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators.  \nBecause abuses in connection with residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the global \nfinancial crisis, many rules issued by the CFPB, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, addressed mortgage and mortgage-\nrelated products, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded \nunderwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law \ncombating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act and the \nCFPB’s enabling rules imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks and savings \nassociations, in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower’s ability to repay, while also establishing a \npresumption of compliance for certain “qualified mortgages.” The CFPB’s rules have not had a significant impact on the \nBank’s operations, except for higher compliance costs."

Additionally, we had $176.4 million in loans whose \npurpose was to finance commercial real estate projects, but were secured by other types of collateral. Commercial real \nestate secured loans represented 73.4% of our total gross loan portfolio and 514.9% of the Bank’s total risk-based capital \nat December 31, 2022. The market value of real estate securing our commercial real estate loans can fluctuate in a short \nperiod of time as a result of interest rates and market conditions. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in \nour market area could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Additionally, the repayment of \ncommercial real estate loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the \nloans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of the control \nof the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties. If \nthe loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled during a time when market conditions are declining or \nhave declined, then we may not be able to realize the full value of the collateral that we anticipated at the time of \noriginating the loan, which could force us to take charge-offs or require us to increase our provision for loan losses, \nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth \nprospects. \nBecause a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy \naffecting real estate values and liquidity, as well as environmental factors, could impair the value of collateral \nsecuring our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses. \nAt December 31, 2022, approximately 87.6% of our total gross loan portfolio was comprised of loans with real \nestate as a primary component of collateral.

The market value of real estate can \nfluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of interest rates and market conditions in the area in which the \nreal estate is located. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our \nmarkets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, significantly impair the value of property \npledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional \nlosses, which could result in losses that would adversely affect our profitability. Such declines and losses would have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nIn addition, if hazardous or toxic substances are found on properties pledged as collateral, the value of the real \nestate could be impaired. If we foreclose on and take title to such properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as \nwell as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to \naddress unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property’s value or limit our ability to use or sell the \naffected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to \nexisting laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial \nliabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nA decline in the business and economic conditions in our market could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nUnlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we conduct our operations almost exclusively in \nthe Twin Cities MSA. Because of the geographic concentration of our operations in the Twin Cities MSA, if the local \neconomy weakens, our growth and profitability could be constrained. Weak economic conditions are characterized by, \namong other indicators, deflation, elevated levels of unemployment, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets and \nlower home sales and commercial activity. These factors could negatively affect the volume of loan originations, \nincrease the level of nonperforming assets, increase the rate of foreclosures and reduce the value of the properties \nsecuring our loans. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects the Twin Cities MSA may affect us and our \nprofitability more significantly and more adversely than those of our competitors whose operations are less \ngeographically focused. \nOur business depends on our ability to manage credit risk. \nAs a bank, our business requires us to manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our \nborrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their \nloans, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, \nincluding risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan \nunderwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with \nindividual borrowers, including the risk that a borrower may not provide information to us about its business in a timely \nmanner, or may present inaccurate or incomplete information to us, as well as risks relating to the value of collateral. To \nmanage our credit risk, we must, among other actions, maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and \nensure that our lenders follow those standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, such as an attempt to \nattract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans or \nour inability to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting \nborrowers and the quality of our loan portfolio, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs and may \nnecessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan losses, each of which could adversely affect our net \nincome. As a result, our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, \nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio. \nWe establish and maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level that management considers adequate to \nabsorb probable loan losses based on an analysis of our loan portfolio and current market environment. The allowance \nfor loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon \nrelevant information available to us at such time. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been"

Additions to the allowance for loan losses, which are charged to earnings through the \nprovision for loan losses, are determined based on a variety of factors, including an analysis of the loan portfolio, \nhistorical loss experience and an evaluation of current economic conditions in our market area. The actual amount of \nloan losses is affected by, among other things, changes in economic, operating and other conditions within our market, \nwhich may be beyond our control, and such losses may exceed current estimates. \nAs of December 31, 2022, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans was 1.34% and as a \npercentage of total nonperforming loans was 7,511.11%. Although management believes that the allowance for loan \nlosses was adequate on such date to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible, losses in \nexcess of the existing allowance will reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, \nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. We may also be required to take additional provisions for \nloan losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for loan losses, either due to management’s assessment that \nthe allowance is inadequate or as required by our banking regulators. Our banking regulators periodically review our \nallowance for loan losses and the value attributed to impaired loans and may require us to adjust our determination of the \nvalue for these items. These adjustments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results \nof operations and growth prospects. \nThe Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses \nand may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \nThe new accounting standard for establishing the allowance for loan losses, referred to as Current Expected \nCredit Loss, or CECL, requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on \nloans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This standard became applicable to us on \nJanuary 1, 2023. Under the revised methodology, credit losses are measured based on past events, current conditions and \nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions that affect the collectability of financial assets. The new \nstandard requires the application of the revised methodology to existing financial assets through a one-time adjustment \nto retained earnings upon initial effectiveness. The change will also likely greatly increase the types of data we will need \nto collect and analyze to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Actual losses are difficult to \nforecast, especially if those losses stem from factors beyond the Company's historical experience or are otherwise \ninconsistent with its credit quality assessments. If our assumptions are inaccurate, our current allowance may not be \nsufficient to cover potential credit losses, and additional provisions may be necessary, which would negatively impact \nour results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in our level of \nallowance for loan losses and could result in the need for additional capital. \nContinued elevated levels of inflation could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations \nand growth prospects. \nThe United States has experienced elevated levels of inflation, with an annual increase in the consumer price \nindex of approximately 6.5% as of the end of 2022. These elevated levels of inflation, which are currently expected to \npersist into 2023, could have complex effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth \nprospects, some of which could be materially adverse. For example, inflation-related increases in our interest expense \nmay not be offset by corresponding increases in our interest income, while inflation-driven increases in our levels of \nnoninterest expense could negatively impact our results of operations. Continued elevated levels of inflation could also \ncause increased volatility and uncertainty in the business environment, which could adversely affect loan demand and \nour clients’ ability to repay indebtedness. It is also possible that governmental responses to the current inflation \nenvironment could adversely affect our business, such as changes to monetary and fiscal policy that are too strict, or the \nimposition or threatened imposition of price controls. The duration and severity of the current inflationary period cannot \nbe estimated with precision. \nMany of our loans are to commercial borrowers, which have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans. \nCommercial loans represented 12.2% of our total gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. Because payments \non such loans are often dependent on the successful operation of the business involved, repayment of such loans is often"

Accordingly, a challenging \nbusiness and economic environment may increase our risk related to commercial loans. In the current economic \nenvironment, the cumulative effects of rising inflation, labor shortages and supply chain constraints and the threat of a \nrecession may adversely affect the collectability of commercial loans, especially if general economic conditions worsen. \nUnlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrowers’ ability to make repayment \nfrom their employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily \nascertainable, commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers’ ability to make repayment from the \ncash flow of the commercial venture. Our commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the \nborrower and secondarily on the collateral underlying the loans. Most often, this collateral consists of accounts \nreceivable, inventory and equipment. Inventory and equipment may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise \nand may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the \nborrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Due to the larger average size of each commercial loan as \ncompared with other loans such as residential loans, as well as collateral that is generally less readily-marketable, losses \nincurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nConstruction and land development loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the complete \nproject. These estimates may be inaccurate, and we may be exposed to significant losses on loans for these projects. \nConstruction and land development loans comprised approximately 10.3% of our total loan portfolio as of \nDecember 31, 2022. Such lending involves additional risks because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, \nwhich is of uncertain value prior to its completion, and costs may exceed realizable values in declining real estate \nmarkets. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the realizable market value of the \ncompleted project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate \naccurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction and \nland development loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the \nsuccess of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the \nborrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be \noverstated or market values or rental rates decline, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon \ncompletion of construction of the project. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a \ndefault, we may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related \nforeclosure and holding costs. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and \nmay have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time while we attempt to dispose of it. \nOur high concentration of large loans to certain borrowers may increase our credit risk. \nOur growth over the last several years has been partially attributable to our ability to cultivate relationships with \ncertain individuals and businesses that have resulted in a concentration of large loans to a small number of borrowers. As \nof December 31, 2022, our 10 largest borrowing relationships accounted for approximately 19.4% of our total gross loan \nportfolio. We have established an informal, internal limit on a single loan to finance one transaction, but we may, under \ncertain circumstances, consider going above this internal limit in situations where management’s understanding of the \nindustry, the borrower’s financial condition, overall credit quality and property fundamentals are commensurate with the \nincreased size of the loan. Along with other risks inherent in these loans, such as the deterioration of the underlying \nbusinesses or property securing these loans, this high concentration of borrowers presents a risk to our lending \noperations. If any one of these borrowers becomes unable to repay its loan obligations as a result of business, economic \nor market conditions, or personal circumstances, such as divorce or death, our nonaccruing loans and our provision for \nloan losses could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, \nresults of operations and growth prospects. \nThe small to midsized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, \nwhich may impair their ability to repay their loans. \nWe lend to small to midsized businesses, which generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or \nborrowing capacity than larger entities, frequently have smaller market share than their competition, may be more"

In addition, the \nsuccess of a small and midsized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two people or a \nsmall group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material \nadverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the \nmarkets in which we operate and small to midsized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise \naffected by adverse business developments, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects \nmay be materially adversely affected. \nGreater seasoning of our loan portfolio could increase risk of credit defaults in the future. \nAs a result of our rapid growth, a significant portion of our loan portfolio at any given time is of relatively \nrecent origin. Typically, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been \noutstanding for some period of time (which varies by loan duration and loan type), a process referred to as “seasoning.” \nAs a result, a portfolio of more seasoned loans may more predictably follow a bank’s historical default or credit \ndeterioration patterns than a newer portfolio. Because 72.3% of the dollar amount of our portfolio has been originated in \nthe past three years, the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not represent the level that may prevail as the \nportfolio becomes more seasoned. If delinquencies and defaults increase, we may be required to increase our provision \nfor loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and \ngrowth prospects. \nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our net interest income. \nAs of December 31, 2022, our nonperforming loans (which consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due \n90 days or more) totaled $639,000, or 0.02% of our total gross loan portfolio, and our nonperforming assets totaled \n$639,000, or 0.01% of total assets. In addition, we had $186,000 in accruing loans that were 30-89 days delinquent as of \nDecember 31, 2022. \nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our net interest income in various ways. We do not record interest \nincome on nonaccrual loans or foreclosed assets, thereby adversely affecting our net income and returns on assets and \nequity. When we take collateral in foreclosure and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its \nthen-fair market value, which may result in a loss. These nonperforming loans and foreclosed assets also increase our \nrisk profile and the level of capital our regulators believe is appropriate for us to maintain in light of such risks. The \nresolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management, which increases our loan \nadministration costs and adversely affects our efficiency ratio, and can be detrimental to the performance of their other \nresponsibilities. If we experience increases in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, our net interest income \nmay be negatively impacted and our loan administration costs could increase, each of which could have a material \nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nLiquidity and Funding Risks \nLiquidity risks could affect our operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition, results of operations and \ngrowth prospects. \nLiquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to meet our obligations as \nthey come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, or the potential that we cannot \neasily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly adjusting market prices because of inadequate market \ndepth or market disruptions. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans or investment \nsecurities and from other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of \nfunds consists of our client deposits, which can decrease for a variety of reasons, including when clients perceive \nalternative investments, such as bonds, treasuries or stocks, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If clients move \nmoney out of bank deposits and into other investments, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds, which would \nrequire us to seek other funding alternatives, including increasing our dependence on wholesale funding sources, in order"

If we are unable to pledge sufficient collateral to secure public funding, we may lose access to this \nsource of liquidity that we have historically utilized. In addition, the availability of and fluctuations in these funds \ndepends on the individual municipality’s fiscal policies and cash flow needs. \nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash from operations, investment security maturities and sales and \nproceeds from the issuance and sale of our equity and debt securities to investors. Additional liquidity is provided by \nbrokered deposits and the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, \nor FHLB. We may also borrow from third-party lenders from time to time. Our access to funding sources in amounts \nadequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that \naffect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or \nnegative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Economic conditions and a loss \nof confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of \ncapital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the \nFederal Reserve.  \nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to continue to implement our strategic plan, \nincluding originating loans and investing in securities, or to fulfill obligations such as paying our expenses, repaying our \nborrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, \nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nWe depend on non-core funding sources, which causes our cost of funds to be higher when compared to other \nfinancial institutions. \nWe use certain non-core, wholesale funding sources, including brokered deposits, federal funds purchased, and \nFHLB advances. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $776.2 million of brokered deposits, which \nrepresented approximately 22.7% of our total deposits, $97.0 million of FHLB advances and $287.0 million of federal \nfunds purchased. Unlike traditional deposits from our local clients, there is a higher likelihood that the wholesale \ndeposits will not remain with us after maturity. For example, depositors who have deposited funds with us through \nbrokers are a less stable source of funding than typical relationship deposit clients. Although we are increasing our \nefforts to reduce our reliance on non-core funding sources, we may not be able to increase our market share of \ncore-deposit funding in our highly competitive market area. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to increase the \namounts of wholesale funding sources. The cost of these funds can be volatile and may exceed the cost of core deposits \nin our market area, which could have a material adverse effect on our net interest income. In addition, our maximum \nborrowing capacity from the FHLB is based on the amount of mortgage and commercial loans we can pledge. As of \nDecember 31, 2022, our advances from the FHLB were collateralized by $1.20 billion of real estate and commercial \nloans. If we are unable to pledge sufficient collateral to secure funding from the FHLB, we may lose access to this \nsource of liquidity that we have historically relied upon. If we are unable to access any of these types of funding sources \nor if our costs related to them increases, our liquidity and ability to support demand for loans could be materially \nadversely affected. \nOur high concentration of large depositors may increase our liquidity risk, and the loss of any large depositor may \nnegatively impact our net interest margin. \nWe have developed relationships with certain individuals and businesses that have resulted in a concentration of \nlarge deposits from a small number of clients. As of December 31, 2022, our 10 largest depositor relationships accounted \nfor approximately 15.0% of our total deposits. This high concentration of depositors presents a risk to our liquidity if one \nor more of them decides to change its relationship with us and to withdraw all or a significant portion of their deposits. If \nsuch an event occurs, we may need to seek out alternative sources of funding that may not be on the same terms as the \ndeposits being replaced, which could negatively impact our net interest margin if the alternative source of funding is at a"

Various federal and state laws and \nregulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. For example, Minnesota law only \npermits banks to pay dividends if a bank has established a surplus fund equal to or more than 20% of the bank’s capital \nstock and if the dividends will not reduce the bank’s capital, undivided profits and reserves below specific requirements. \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Bank had the capacity to pay the Company a dividend of up to $24.3 million without the \nneed to obtain prior regulatory approval. Also, the Company’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a \nsubsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. In the event the Bank \nis unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service any debt we may incur, which could have a material \nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to \nlosses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our business, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory \ncompliance, would be adversely affected. \nWe face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. We may need to raise \nadditional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and \nbusiness needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. In addition, the Company, on a \nconsolidated basis, and the Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain \nsufficient liquidity. Importantly, regulatory capital requirements could increase from current levels, which could require \nus to raise additional capital or contract our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in \nthe capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the \nbanking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. In \nparticular, if we need to raise additional capital in the current interest rate environment, we believe the pricing and other \nterms investors may require in such an offering may not be attractive to us. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we \nwill be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to maintain capital to meet \nregulatory requirements, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects would be \nmaterially and adversely affected. \nWe may be adversely affected by changes in the actual or perceived soundness or condition of other financial \ninstitutions. \nFinancial services institutions that deal with each other are interconnected as a result of trading, investment, \nliquidity management, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. Concerns about, or a default by, one institution \ncould lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions, as the commercial and financial \nsoundness of many financial institutions is closely related as a result of these credit, trading, clearing and other \nrelationships. Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of, or questions about, a counterparty may lead to market-wide \nliquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions. This systemic risk may adversely affect financial \nintermediaries with which we interact on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the FHLB, which could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our access to liquidity. In addition, our credit risk may increase when the collateral held by us \ncannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative \nexposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of \noperations and growth prospects."

Our growth requires that we increase our loans and deposits \nwhile managing risks by following prudent loan underwriting standards without increasing interest rate risk or \ncompressing our net interest margin, hiring and retaining qualified employees and successfully implementing strategic \nprojects and initiatives. Even if we are able to increase our interest income, our earnings may nonetheless be reduced by \nincreased expenses, such as additional employee compensation or other general and administrative expenses and \nincreased interest expense on any liabilities incurred or deposits solicited to fund increases in assets. \nAdditionally, if our competitors extend credit on terms we find to pose excessive risks, or at interest rates which \nwe believe do not warrant the credit exposure, we may not be able to maintain our lending volume and could experience \ndeteriorating financial performance. Our inability to manage our growth successfully could have a material adverse \neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nWe are highly dependent on our strategic leadership team, and the loss of any of our senior executive officers or \nother key employees, or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, could harm our ability to implement \nour strategic plan and impair our relationships with clients. \nOur success is dependent, to a large degree, upon the continued service and skills of our strategic leadership \nteam. Our business and growth strategies are built primarily upon our ability to retain employees with experience and \nbusiness relationships within our market area. The loss of any of the members of our strategic leadership team or any of \nour other key personnel could have an adverse impact on our business and growth because of their skills, years of \nindustry experience, knowledge of our market area, the difficulty of finding qualified replacement personnel and any \ndifficulties associated with transitioning of responsibilities to any new members of the strategic leadership team. As \nsuch, we need to continue to attract and retain key personnel and to recruit qualified individuals who fit our culture to \nsucceed existing key personnel to ensure the continued growth and successful operation of our business. Leadership \nchanges may occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant retirements or resignations will occur or \nwhether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. \nCompetition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the financial services and banking industry is \nintense, which means the cost of hiring, incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase. In \naddition, our ability to effectively compete for senior executives and other qualified personnel by offering competitive \ncompensation and benefit arrangements may be restricted by applicable banking laws and regulations. The loss of the \nservices of any senior executive or other key personnel, the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future \nor the failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan could have a material adverse effect on our business, \nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nLabor shortages and a failure to attract and retain qualified employees could negatively impact our business, \nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nA number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including the \nhigh employment levels, and decreased labor force size and participation rates in recent periods. Although we have not \nexperienced any material labor shortage to date, we have recently observed an overall tightening and increasingly \ncompetitive local labor markets. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base could \nlead to increased costs, such as increased compensation expense to attract and retain employees. \nIn addition, if we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation \nmeasures we take to respond to a decrease in labor availability have unintended negative effects, our business could be \nadversely affected.

Damage to our reputation \ncould undermine the confidence of our current and potential clients in our ability to provide high-quality financial \nservices. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our counterparties and vendors and ultimately affect our \nability to effect transactions. Maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in maintaining our \nservice-focused culture and controlling and mitigating the various risks described in this report, but also on our success \nin identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, \nanti-money laundering, client personal information and privacy issues, client and other third party fraud, record-keeping, \nregulatory investigations and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure of us to comply with legal \nand regulatory requirements. Maintaining our reputation also depends on our ability to successfully prevent third parties \nfrom infringing on the “Bridgewater Bank” brand and associated trademarks and our other intellectual property.

Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, \nincluding check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information \nsecurity breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by \nus or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks and malware or other cyber-attacks. \nThere continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the \nfinancial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial \nbank accounts. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail \ncompanies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate \ninformation, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting \nthem to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which could \nincrease their risks of identity theft and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us. \nInformation pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on networks and \nsystems maintained by us and certain third party partners, such as our online banking, mobile banking or accounting \nsystems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over \nthese systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain the \nconfidence of our clients. Breaches of information security also may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by \nthose having access to our systems or the confidential information of our clients, including employees. In addition, \nincreases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, \nvulnerabilities in third party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result \nin a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and \nto protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access \nour systems. Our third party partners’ inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could \nresult in a number of negative events, including losses to us or our clients, loss of business or clients, damage to our \nreputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, disruption to our business, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties \nor our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on \nour business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects."

We outsource to third parties many of our major systems, such as data processing and mobile \nand online banking. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third party software license or service \nagreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology \nand telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, we could experience service denials \nif demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or experience interruptions. A system \nfailure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process loans or gather deposits and provide \ncustomer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, result in potential noncompliance with applicable laws \nor regulations, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny \nand possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results \nof operations and growth prospects. In addition, failures of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, \nor fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties, could disrupt our operations or adversely \naffect our reputation. \nIt may be difficult for us to replace some of our third party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core \nbanking and information services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in \nthe future for any reason and even if we are able to replace them, it may be at higher cost or result in the loss of clients. \nAny such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and \ngrowth prospects. \nOur operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of information and the \nmonitoring of a large number of transactions on a minute-by-minute basis, and even a short interruption in service could \nhave significant consequences. We also interact with and rely on retailers, for whom we process transactions, as well as \nfinancial counterparties and regulators. Each of these third parties may be targets of the same types of fraudulent \nactivity, computer break-ins and other cybersecurity breaches described above, and the cybersecurity measures that they \nmaintain to mitigate the risk of such activity may be different than our own and may be inadequate. \nAs a result of financial entities and technology systems becoming more interdependent and complex, a cyber \nincident, information breach or loss, or technology failure that compromises the systems or data of one or more financial \nentities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including ourselves. As a result of \nthe foregoing, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third \nparties with whom we interact. \nOur use of third party vendors and our other ongoing third party business relationships is subject to increasing \nregulatory requirements and attention. \nOur use of third party vendors for certain information systems is subject to increasingly demanding regulatory \nrequirements and attention by our federal bank regulators. Regulations require us to enhance our due diligence, ongoing \nmonitoring and control over our third party vendors and other ongoing third party business relationships. In certain cases \nwe may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors to meet these enhanced requirements, which could \nincrease our costs. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of \nour third party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. As a result, if \nour regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third party vendors or other \nongoing third party business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, we could be \nsubject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines, as \nwell as requirements for customer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, \nfinancial condition, results of operations and growth prospects."

In addition to better serving clients, the effective use of technology increases \nefficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to \naddress the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for \nconvenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow. The widespread \nadoption of new technologies, including mobile banking services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require \nus in the future to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and \ndevelop new products to satisfy our customers' expectations and comply with regulatory guidance. We may experience \noperational challenges as we implement these new technology enhancements, which could result in us not fully realizing \nthe anticipated benefits from such new technology or require us to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges \nin a timely manner. \nMany of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. \nAs a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to offer, which would \nput us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, a risk exists that we will not be able to effectively implement new \ntechnology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our clients. \nIn addition, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and \nintegrate new ones may also cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and \nmay cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws. We expect that new technologies and business processes applicable \nto the banking industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies and business processes may be better than \nthose we currently use. Because the pace of technological change is high and our industry is intensely competitive, we \nmay not be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete or as \nbetter ones become available. A failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial \nservices industry and failure to avoid interruptions, errors and delays could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties. \nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, and in evaluating and monitoring our loan \nand deposit portfolios on an ongoing basis, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and \ncounterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on \nrepresentations of those clients or counterparties or of other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the \naccuracy and completeness of that information.

In the event that \nwe pursue additional acquisitions, we may have difficulty completing them and may not realize the anticipated benefits \nof any transaction we complete. For example, we may not be successful in realizing anticipated cost savings, and we \nmay not be successful in preventing disruptions in service to existing client relationships of the acquired institution. Our \npotential acquisition activities could require us to use a substantial amount of cash, other liquid assets or incur additional \ndebt. In addition, if goodwill recorded in connection with our potential future acquisitions were determined to be \nimpaired, then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings, which could materially and adversely \naffect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized."

Our inability to overcome risks associated with acquisitions could \nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nNew lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject us to additional risks. \nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and product enhancements \nas well as new services within our existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with \nthese efforts, particularly in instances in which the markets are not fully developed. In implementing, developing or \nmarketing new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, we may invest significant time and \nresources, although we may not assign the appropriate level of resources or expertise necessary to make these new lines \nof business, products, product enhancements or services successful or to realize their expected benefits. Further, initial \ntimetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services \nmay not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance \nwith regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also affect the ultimate implementation \nof a new line of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services.

We compete with national commercial \nbanks, regional banks, private banks, savings banks, credit unions, non-bank financial services companies and other \nfinancial institutions operating within or near the areas we serve, many of whom target the same clients we do in the \nTwin Cities MSA. As client preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry \nand made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and for \nnon-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic \npayment systems. The banking industry is experiencing rapid changes in technology, and, as a result, our future success \nwill depend in part on our ability to address our clients’ needs by using technology. Client loyalty can be influenced by a \ncompetitor’s new products, especially offerings that could provide cost savings or a higher return to the client. Increased \nlending activity of competing banks has also led to increased competitive pressures on loan rates and terms for \nhigh-quality credits. We may not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in our markets, \nparticularly with larger financial institutions that have significantly greater resources than us, and we may have to pay \nhigher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, \nresulting in lower net interest margins and reduced profitability.

Other benchmarks may perform \ndifferently than LIBOR or alternative benchmarks have performed in the past or have other consequences that cannot \ncurrently be anticipated. It is also uncertain what will happen with instruments that rely on LIBOR for future interest rate \nadjustments and which remain outstanding if LIBOR ceases to exist.   \nWhile there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the Alternative \nReference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants, selected by the \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, started in May 2018 to publish the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as \nan alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury \nsecurities that was selected by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee due to the depth and robustness of the \nTreasury repurchase market. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether SOFR will become an accepted alternative \nto LIBOR. \nWe have loans, available for sale securities, derivative contracts, and subordinated debentures with terms that \nare either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR to alternative rates such as SOFR, \ncould create considerable costs and additional risk. Any such transition could: (i) adversely affect the interest rates paid \nor received on, the revenue and expenses associated with, and the value of our floating-rate obligations, loans, deposits, \nderivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given \nLIBOR’s role in determining market interest rates globally; (ii) prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in"

Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, \npayments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our \nmarket risk profile, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. \nFurther, a failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely affect our reputation. \nAlthough we are currently unable to assess the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR, a failure to adequately \nmanage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and \ngrowth prospects.   \nLegal, Accounting and Compliance Risks \nWe are subject to commercial real estate lending guidance issued by the federal banking regulators that impacts our \noperations and capital requirements. \nThe federal banking regulators have issued guidance regarding concentrations in commercial real estate lending \ndirected at institutions that have particularly high concentrations of commercial real estate loans within their lending \nportfolios. This guidance suggests that institutions whose commercial real estate loans exceed certain percentages of \ncapital should implement heightened risk management practices appropriate to their concentration risk and may be \nrequired to maintain higher capital ratios than institutions with lower concentrations in commercial real estate lending. \nAs of December 31, 2022, our commercial real estate secured loans represented 514.9% of the Bank’s total risk-based \ncapital. As a result, we are deemed to have a concentration in commercial real estate lending under applicable regulatory \nguidelines. Accordingly, pursuant to guidance issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies, we are required to have \nheightened risk management practices in place to account for the heightened degree of risk associated with commercial \nreal estate lending and may be required to maintain capital in excess of regulatory minimums. We cannot guarantee that \nthe risk management practices we have implemented will be effective to prevent losses relating to our commercial real \nestate portfolio. In addition, increased capital requirements could limit our ability to leverage our capital, which could \nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nOur risk management framework and programs may not be effective in mitigating risks or losses to us. \nOur risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to \nmanage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, strategic, operational, reputational, credit, \ncapital, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling \nmethodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be \neffective under all circumstances and it may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our framework is not \neffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth \nprospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory \nconsequences, which may adversely affect our reputation. \nOur accounting estimates, risk management processes and controls rely on analytical and forecasting techniques and \nmodels and assumptions, which may not accurately predict future events. \nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to the manner in which we record and report our \nfinancial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many \nof these accounting policies and methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management’s judgment of the most \nappropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select \nthe accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the \ncircumstances, yet which may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a \ndifferent alternative."

They \nrequire management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially \ndifferent amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical \naccounting policies include policies related to the allowance for loan losses, investment securities impairment, fair value \nof financial instruments and deferred tax assets. See “Note 1 – Description of the Business and Summary of Significant \nAccounting Policies” of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this Annual Report on \nForm 10-K for further information. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be \nrequired to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for loan losses or sustain loan losses \nthat are significantly higher than the reserve provided, experience additional impairment in our securities portfolio, \nchange the carrying value of our financial instruments and the amount of revenue or loss recorded, or record a valuation \nallowance against our deferred tax assets. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nOur risk management processes, internal controls, disclosure controls and corporate governance policies and \nprocedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurances that the \nobjectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls, processes and procedures or failure to \ncomply with regulations related to controls, processes and procedures could necessitate changes in those controls, \nprocesses and procedures, which may increase our compliance costs, divert management attention from our business or \nsubject us to regulatory actions and increased regulatory scrutiny. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on \nour business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nChanges in accounting policies or standards could materially impact our financial statements. \nFrom time to time, the FASB or the SEC, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that \ngovern the preparation of our financial statements. Such changes may result in us being subject to new or changing \naccounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking \nregulators or outside auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. In \naddition, trends in financial and business reporting, including ESG related disclosures, could require us to incur \nadditional reporting expense. These changes may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and can materially \nimpact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required \nto apply a new or revised standard retroactively, or apply an existing standard differently, in each case resulting in our \nneeding to revise or restate prior period financial statements. \nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, \nwhich may divert time and attention from our business operations. \nAs a public company, we are required to file periodic reports containing our consolidated financial statements \nwith the SEC within a specified time following the completion of quarterly and annual periods. As a public company, we \nalso incur significant legal, accounting, insurance, and other expenses. Compliance with these reporting requirements \nand other rules of the SEC could increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time \nconsuming and costly, which could negatively affect our efficiency ratio. Furthermore, the need to establish and \nmaintain the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management’s attention from \nimplementing our strategic plan, which could prevent us from successfully implementing our growth initiatives and \nimproving our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nAs an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, \nwe are taking advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements, including reduced \ndisclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and an exemption \nfrom the requirement to obtain an attestation from our auditors on management’s assessment of our internal control over \nfinancial reporting. When these exemptions cease to apply, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased \nmanagement effort toward ensuring compliance with them."

This focus has only intensified since the financial crisis, with regulators and \nprosecutors focusing on a variety of financial institution practices and requirements, including foreclosure practices, \ncompliance with applicable consumer protection laws, classification of “held for sale” assets and compliance with \nanti-money laundering statutes, the Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets \nControl of the U.S. Treasury. \nIn the normal course of business, from time to time, we have in the past and may in the future be named as a \ndefendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our \ncurrent or prior business activities. Legal actions could include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages \nor claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We may also, from time to time, be the subject of subpoenas, requests \nfor information, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding \nour current or prior business activities. Any such legal or regulatory actions may subject us to substantial compensatory \nor punitive damages, significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices or other requirements \nresulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to our reputation. Our involvement in any such matters, \nwhether tangential or otherwise and even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause \nsignificant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business. Further, any \nsettlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by \ngovernment agencies may result in litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government agencies \nbegin independent reviews of the same activities. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nWe are subject to extensive regulation, and the regulatory framework that applies to us, together with any future \nlegislative or regulatory changes, may significantly affect our operations. \nThe banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws and regulations \nthat are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, clients, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking \nsystem as a whole, not for the protection of our shareholders. The Company is subject to regulation and supervision by \nthe Federal Reserve, and the Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the FDIC and the Minnesota Department \nof Commerce. The laws and regulations applicable to us govern a variety of matters, including permissible types, \namounts and terms of loans and investments we may make, the maximum interest rate that may be charged, the amount \nof reserves we must hold against deposits we take, the types of deposits we may accept, maintenance of adequate capital \nand liquidity, changes in the control of us and our bank, restrictions on dividends and establishment of new offices. We \nmust obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in certain activities, and there is the risk that such approvals \nmay not be obtained, either in a timely manner or at all. Our regulators also have the ability to compel us to take certain \nactions, or restrict us from taking certain actions entirely, such as actions that our regulators deem to constitute an unsafe \nor unsound banking practice. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and \ninterpretations of such laws and regulations, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or \ndamage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results \nof operations and growth prospects. \nSince the financial crisis, federal and state banking laws and regulations, as well as interpretations and \nimplementations of these laws and regulations, have undergone substantial review and change. In particular, the \nDodd-Frank Act drastically revised the laws and regulations under which we operate. As an institution with less than \n$10 billion in assets, certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act have not been applied to us and provisions of the \nRegulatory Relief Act are intended to result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks and their holding \ncompanies. While we endeavor to maintain safe banking practices and controls beyond the regulatory requirements \napplicable to us, our internal controls may not match those of larger banking institutions that are subject to increased \nregulatory oversight."

This \nincreased regulatory burden has resulted and may continue to result in increased costs of doing business and may in the \nfuture result in decreased revenues and net income, reduce our ability to compete effectively to attract and retain clients, \nor make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services. Any future changes in federal and \nstate laws and regulations, as well as the interpretation and implementation of such laws and regulations, could affect us \nin substantial and unpredictable ways, including those listed above or other ways that could have a material adverse \neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, political \ndevelopments, including recent changes in law introduced by the Biden administration in the United States, add \nuncertainty to the implementation, scope and timing of regulatory reforms. \nChanges in tax laws and regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations, may have \na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nWe operate in an environment that imposes income taxes on our operations at both the federal and state levels \nto varying degrees. We engage in certain strategies to minimize the impact of these taxes. Consequently, any change in \ntax laws or regulations, or new interpretation of an existing law or regulation, could significantly alter the effectiveness \nof these strategies. \nThe net deferred tax asset reported on our balance sheet generally represents the tax benefit of future deductions \nfrom taxable income for items that have already been recognized for financial reporting purposes. The bulk of the \ndeferred tax asset consists of deferred loan loss deductions. The net deferred tax asset is measured by applying \ncurrently-enacted income tax rates to the accounting period during which the tax benefit is expected to be realized. As of \nDecember 31, 2022, our net deferred tax asset was $22.9 million. \nWe also face risk based on actions of the U.S. Treasury and the IRS. In November 2016, these agencies issued a \nnotice making captive insurance company activities “transactions of interest” due to the potential for tax avoidance or \nevasion. We have a captive insurance company, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that provides \ninsurance coverage to the Company and its subsidiaries for risk management purposes or where commercial insurance \nmay not be available or economically feasible. It is not certain at this point how the notice may impact us or the \ncontinued operation of the captive insurance company as a risk management tool, but if the activity is deemed by the IRS \nto be an abusive tax structure, we may become subject to significant penalties and interest. \nIn addition, in February of 2018, we formed Bridgewater Investment Management, Inc., a Minnesota \ncorporation and a subsidiary of the Bank, to hold certain municipal securities and to engage in municipal lending \nactivities. Based on current tax regulations and guidance, we believe that municipal securities held by a non-bank \nsubsidiary of a financial institution are eligible to receive favorable federal income tax treatment. Like our captive \ninsurance company, there is a risk that the IRS may investigate these types of arrangements and issue new guidance \neliminating the tax benefit to such a structure. \nThere is uncertainty surrounding potential legal, regulatory and policy changes by the Biden administration in the \nUnited States that may directly affect financial institutions and the global economy. \nChanges in federal policy and at regulatory agencies occur over time through policy and personnel changes \nfollowing elections, which lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services industry. \nThe nature, timing and economic and political effects of potential changes to the current legal and regulatory framework \naffecting financial institutions remain highly uncertain. Uncertainty surrounding future changes may adversely affect our \noperating environment and therefore our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nWe are subject to more stringent capital requirements. \nBanking institutions are required to hold more capital as a percentage of assets than most industries. In the wake \nof the global financial crisis, our capital requirements increased, both in the amount of capital we must hold and in the \nquality of the capital to absorb losses. Holding high amounts of capital compresses our earnings and constrains growth. \nIn addition, the failure to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements could result in one or more of our regulators"

If, as a result of an examination, a banking \nagency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, \nliquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or \nregulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the \npower to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any \nviolation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, \nto restrict our growth, to assess civil money penalties, to fine or remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that \nsuch conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance \nand place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect \non our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair \nlending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions. \nThe CRA requires the Bank, consistent with safe and sound operations, to ascertain and meet the credit needs of \nits entire community, including low and moderate income areas. Our failure to comply with the CRA could, among other \nthings, result in the denial or delay of certain corporate applications filed by us, including applications for branch \nopenings or relocations and applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or holding \ncompany. In addition, the CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and \nregulations prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, bank \nregulatory agencies and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A challenge to \nan institution’s compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including \ndamages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on \nexpansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also challenge an institution’s \nperformance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect \non our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nNoncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could result in \nfines or sanctions against us. \nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among \nother duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and to file reports such as suspicious \nactivity reports and currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering \nrequirements. The bank regulatory agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose \nsignificant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated \nenforcement efforts against banks and other financial services providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug \nEnforcement Administration and IRS. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by \nthe Office of Foreign Assets Control. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject \nto liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the \nnecessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition \nplans. \nFailure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing \ncould also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on \nour business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects."

For example, our business is \nsubject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share \nnonpublic personal information about our clients with nonaffiliated third parties, (ii) requires that we provide certain \ndisclosures to clients about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford clients the right to “opt \nout” of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires that we \ndevelop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate \nsafeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of client \ninformation we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking \nregulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, \nconsumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. \nMoreover, legislators and regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information \nsecurity and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, \ndata protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of \nconsumer or employee information and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our \ncosts of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes \nincreased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission and the CFPB, as \nwell as at the state level, such as with regard to mobile applications. \nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those \nregarding security breach notification) affecting client or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher \ncompliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could \nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Our \nfailure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant \nregulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which \ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank. \nAs a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and \nmanagerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act \ncodified the Federal Reserve’s policy on serving as a source of financial strength. Under the “source of strength” \ndoctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary \nbank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit \nresources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the \nresources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Any loans by a holding \ncompany to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such \nsubsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any \ncommitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. \nMoreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment \nover the claims of the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any \nborrowing that must be done by the Company to make a required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive \nand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act and because we have decided to take \nadvantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and other requirements applicable to emerging growth \ncompanies, our common stock could be less attractive to investors. \nFor as long as we remain an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, we will have the option to \ntake advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and other requirements that are applicable to other public \ncompanies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation"

If we have to restate any historical financial statements it could have a material adverse effect \non our financial condition and results of operations. \n \nCertain banking laws and certain provisions of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation may have \nan anti-takeover effect. \nProvisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it difficult for a \nthird party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. Acquisition of 10% or \nmore of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company or depository institution, including shares of our common \nstock, generally creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer “controls” the bank holding company or depository \ninstitution. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before, among other \nthings, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, including the \nBank. \nThere are also provisions in our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and \nrestated bylaws, such as the classification of our board of directors and limitations on the ability to call a special meeting \nof our shareholders, that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. In addition, our board of directors is \nauthorized under our second amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue shares of preferred stock, and \ndetermine the rights, terms conditions and privileges of such preferred stock, without shareholder approval. These \nprovisions may effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. \nOur amended and restated bylaws have an exclusive forum provision, which could limit a shareholder’s ability to \nobtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees. \nOur amended and restated bylaws have an exclusive forum provision providing that, unless we consent in \nwriting to an alternative forum, the state or federal courts in Hennepin County, Minnesota shall be the sole and exclusive \nforum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim for \nbreach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company to the Company or the \nCompany’s shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Minnesota Business \nCorporation Act, the articles or the bylaws of the Company, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal \naffairs doctrine, in each case subject to said courts having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as \ndefendants therein. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be \ndeemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our bylaws.

Alternatively, if a court were to find the \nexclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated \nwith resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nMarket and Interest Rate Risks \nOur business is subject to interest rate risk, and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings. \nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively affect our business and may weaken demand for some of our \nproducts. Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent on our net interest income, which is the difference between \nthe interest income that we earn on interest earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest \nexpense that we pay on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Additionally, changes in interest \nrates also affect our ability to fund our operations with client deposits and the fair value of securities in our investment \nportfolio and derivatives portfolio. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, including changes in federal \nfiscal and monetary policies, can have a significant effect on our net interest income and results of operations. \nOur interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may react in different degrees to changes in market \ninterest rates. Interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in broader market \ninterest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind. The result of these changes to rates may \ncause differing spreads on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. We cannot control or accurately predict \nchanges in market rates of interest. \nIt is currently expected that during 2023, and perhaps beyond, the Federal Open Market Committee of the \nFederal Reserve, or FOMC, will continue to increase interest rates to reduce the rate of inflation. In 2022, the FOMC \nincreased at various dates throughout the year the target range for the federal funds rate from 0.00% to 0.25% to a range \nof 4.25% to 4.50%. All of these increases were expressly made in response to inflationary pressures, which are currently \nexpected to continue into 2023. In February of 2023, the FOMC increased rates again by 0.25%. If the FOMC further \nincreases the targeted federal funds rates, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the entire \nnational economy. In addition, our net interest income could be adversely affected if the rates we pay on deposits and \nborrowings increase more rapidly than the rates we earn on loans and other interest earning assets. Rising interest rates \nalso may reduce the demand for loans and the value of fixed-rate investment securities. These effects from interest rate \nchanges or from other sustained economic stress or a recession, among other matters, could have a material adverse \neffect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and growth prospects. \n \nWe seek to mitigate our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivative \ncontracts from time to time with counterparties. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding \ninterest rates, asset levels, and general market factors and subject us to counterparty risk. There is no assurance that our \ninterest rate mitigation strategies will be successful, and if our assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our \nhedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, we may incur losses that could \nadversely affect our earnings. \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $884.3 million of noninterest bearing deposit accounts and $2.53 billion of \ninterest bearing deposit accounts. We do not know what future market rates will be, and based on recent guidance from \nthe Federal Reserve, we expect interest rates to remain elevated in 2023. If we need to offer higher interest rates on these \naccounts to maintain current clients or attract new clients, our interest expense will increase, perhaps materially. \nFurthermore, if we fail to offer interest in a sufficient amount to keep these demand deposits, our core deposits may be \nreduced, which would require us to obtain funding in other ways or risk slowing our future asset growth. \nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or \neconomic and market conditions deteriorate. \nAs of December 31, 2022, the fair value of our securities portfolio was approximately $548.6 million, or 12.6% \nof our total assets. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and"

      "text": "43 \ncan cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities acquired by us \nare generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited \nto, rating agency downgrades of the securities or our own analysis of the value of the security, defaults by the issuer or \nindividual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing \nfactors could cause an other than temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for \ndetermining whether impairment is other than temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future \nfinancial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of \nreceiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market \nconditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the \nunderlying collateral, we may recognize realized or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have a material \nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.  \n \nA large percentage of our investment securities classified as available-for-sale have fixed interest rates. As is \nthe case with many financial institutions, our emphasis on increasing the development of core non-maturity deposits has \nresulted in our interest-bearing liabilities having a shorter duration than our interest-earning assets. This imbalance can \ncreate significant earnings volatility because interest rates change over time. As interest rates have increased, our cost of \nfunds has increased more rapidly than the yields on a substantial portion of our interest-earning assets. In addition, the \nmarket value of our fixed-rate assets, for example, our investment securities, has declined in recent periods. In line with \nthe foregoing, we have experienced and may continue to experience an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities \nprimarily due to raising the rates we pay on some of our deposit products to stay competitive within our market and an \nincrease in borrowing costs from increases in the federal funds rate. \n \nAt December 31, 2022, we had $34.1 million of unrealized losses, net of tax, in our securities portfolio. If we \nare forced to liquidate any of those investments prior to maturity, including because of a lack of liquidity, we would \nrecognize as a charge to earnings the losses attributable to those securities.  \n \nMonetary policies of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \nIn the current environment, economic and business conditions are significantly affected by U.S. monetary \npolicy, particularly the actions of the Federal Reserve in its effort to fight elevated levels of inflation. The Federal \nReserve is mandated to pursue the goals of maximum employment and price stability, and beginning in March 2022 it \nmade a series of significant increases to the target Federal Funds rate as part of an effort to combat elevated levels of \ninflation affecting the U.S. economy, which is expected to continue in 2023. This has helped drive a significant increase \nin prevailing interest rates and, while this will have a positive effect on our net interest income, it also harmed the value \nof our securities portfolio, which had $34.1 million in unrealized losses, net of tax, in our available-for-sale investment \nsecurities portfolio at December 31, 2022. This decline in value has negatively affected our tangible book value. Higher \ninterest rates can also negatively affect our customers’ businesses and financial condition, and the value of collateral \nsecuring loans in our portfolio.  \n \nGiven the complex factors affecting the strength of the U.S. economy, including uncertainties regarding the \npersistence of inflation, geopolitical developments such as the war in Ukraine and resulting disruptions in the global \nenergy market, the effects of the pandemic in China, and tight labor market conditions and supply chain issues, there is a \nmeaningful risk that the Federal Reserve and other central banks may raise interest rates too much, thereby limiting \neconomic growth and potentially causing an economic recession. As noted above, this could decrease loan demand, \nharm the credit characteristics of our existing loan portfolio and decrease the value of collateral securing loans in the \nportfolio. \n \nOur stock is relatively thinly traded. \nAlthough our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the average daily trading volume of our \ncommon stock is relatively low compared to many public companies. The desired market characteristics of depth, \nliquidity, and orderliness require the substantial presence of willing buyers and sellers in the marketplace at any given \ntime. In our case, this presence depends on the individual decisions of a relatively small number of investors and general \neconomic and market conditions over which we have no control.

Conversely, attempts to purchase a significant \namount of our stock could cause the market price to rise above the reasonable inherent worth of the Company. \nThe price of our common stock could be volatile and other factors could cause our stock price to decline. \nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at \nprices you find attractive. The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide \nfluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control.

If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall \nand may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management. \nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit. \nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the \nFDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity.

You should not purchase shares of common stock offered hereby if you need or desire dividend income from this \ninvestment. \nIn addition, we are a financial holding company, and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on \ncertain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and \ndividends. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank and financial holding companies should generally pay \ndividends on capital stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the \norganization’s expected future needs, asset quality and financial condition. \nFurther, if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason, we may not be able \nto make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our common stock in the event we decide to \ndeclare dividends. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. \nFuture issuances of common stock could result in dilution, which could cause our common stock price to decline. \nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock, up to the 75,000,000 shares \nof common stock authorized in our second amended and restated articles of incorporation, which could be increased by a \nvote of the holders of a majority of our shares of common stock.

As of December 31, 2022, we \nhad $80.0 million of subordinated debentures outstanding and $69.0 million of preferred stock outstanding. As a result, \nholders of our common stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon the \nliquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company until after all of our obligations to our debt holders have been \nsatisfied and holders of senior equity securities, including the preferred shares, have received any payment or \ndistribution due to them. \nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term \nshareholder value. \nOn August 17, 2022, the Company’s board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program which \nauthorizes the Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million of its common stock, subject to certain limitations and \nconditions. The new stock repurchase program replaced and superseded the previous $40.0 million stock repurchase \nprogram, under which approximately $1.6 million remained.

The Company’s simple, \nefficient business model of providing responsive support and unconventional experiences to clients continues to be the \nunderlying principle that drives the Company’s profitable growth. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared based on the application of certain \naccounting policies, the most significant of which are described in “Note 1 – Description of the Business and Summary \nof Significant Accounting Policies” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included as a part of this report. \nCertain policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject \nto variation and may significantly affect the reported results and financial position for the current period or in future \nperiods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required \nto be recorded or adjusted to reflect fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement \nvolatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on \neither quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such \ninformation is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions \nor estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the future financial condition and results of operations. \nManagement has discussed each critical accounting policy and the methodology for the identification and determination \nof critical accounting policies with the Company’s Audit Committee. \nThe JOBS Act permits the Company an extended transition period for complying with new or revised \naccounting standards affecting public companies. The Company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition \nperiod, which means that the financial statements included in this report will not be subject to all new or revised \naccounting standards generally applicable to public companies for the transition period for so long as the Company \nremains an emerging growth company or until the Company affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended \ntransition period under the JOBS Act. \nThe following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that require the \nCompany to make complex and subjective judgments.  \nAllowance for Loan Losses \nThe allowance for loan losses, sometimes referred to as the “allowance,” is established through a provision for \nloan losses which is charged to expense. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management determines all \nor a portion of the loan balance to be uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for cash \nreceived on previously charged-off amounts. If the allowance is considered inadequate to absorb future loan losses on \nexisting loans for any reason, including but not limited to, increases in the size of the loan portfolio, increases in charge-\noffs or changes in the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, then the provision for loan losses is increased. \nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company \nwill be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. The \ncollection of all amounts due according to original contractual terms means that both the contractual interest and \nprincipal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement. An impaired loan is measured based \non the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or, as a practical \nexpedient, at the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the underlying collateral, reduced by costs to sell on \na discounted basis, is used if a loan is collateral dependent. \nInvestment Securities Impairment \nPeriodically, the Company may need to assess whether there have been any events or economic circumstances \nto indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other than temporary basis. In any such \ninstance, the Company would consider many factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value \nhas been less than the amortized cost basis, the market liquidity for the security, the financial condition and the near-term \nprospects of the issuer, expected cash flows, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time"

Securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other than \ntemporary are written down to fair value, with the write-down recorded as a realized loss in securities gains (losses). \nThe fair values of investment securities are generally determined by various pricing models. The Company \nevaluates the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values. The Company performs an annual analysis on the \npricing of investment securities to ensure that the prices represent reasonable estimates of fair value. The procedures \ninclude initial and ongoing reviews of pricing methodologies and trends. The Company seeks to ensure prices represent \nreasonable estimates of fair value through the use of broker quotes, current sales transactions from the portfolio and \npricing techniques, which are based on the net present value of future expected cash flows discounted at a rate of return \nmarket participants would require. As a result of this analysis, if the Company determines there is a more appropriate fair \nvalue, the price is adjusted accordingly. \nFair Value of Financial Instruments \nThe fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity \ntransacts business. A framework has been established for measuring the fair value of financial instruments that considers \nthe attributes specific to particular assets or liabilities and includes a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value \nbased on the transparency of inputs to each valuation as of the measurement date. The Company estimates the fair value \nof financial instruments using a variety of valuation methods. When financial instruments are actively traded and have \nquoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value and are classified as Level 1. When financial \ninstruments, such as investment securities and derivatives, are not actively traded, the Company determines fair value \nbased on various sources and may apply matrix pricing with observable prices for similar instruments where a price for \nthe identical instrument is not observable. The fair values of these financial instruments, which are classified as Level 2, \nare determined by pricing models that consider observable market data such as interest rate volatilities, yield curve, \ncredit spreads, prices from external market data providers and/or nonbinding broker-dealer quotations. When observable \ninputs do not exist, the Company estimates fair value based on available market data, and these values are classified as \nLevel 3. Imprecision in estimating fair values can impact the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the amount of \nrevenue or loss recorded. \nDeferred Tax Asset \nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by GAAP. \nUnder this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to \ndifferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax \nbasis. If currently available information indicates it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax asset will not be \nrealized, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates \nexpected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or \nsettled. Accounting for deferred income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because the Company exercises \nsignificant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. \nManagement’s determination of the realization of deferred tax assets is based upon management’s judgment of various \nfuture events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, reversing temporary differences \nwhich may offset, and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. These \njudgments and estimates are inherently subjective and reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors \nchange. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require the Company to record a valuation allowance \nagainst the deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period, \nwhich would negatively affect earnings."

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was significantly impacted by increased \nprovisions for loan losses, primarily attributable to economic uncertainties and evolving risks driven by the impacts of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, and non-recurring charges of $7.0 million related to prepayment fees associated with the early \nextinguishment of $94.0 million of higher priced FHLB term advances. ROA was 1.43% and 1.04% for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. ROE was 14.45% and 10.51% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and \n2020, respectively. \nNet Interest Income \nThe Company’s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is impacted by the level of interest \nearning assets and related funding sources, as well as changes in the level of interest rates. The difference between the \naverage yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities is the net interest spread. \nNoninterest bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders’ equity, also support earning assets. The \nimpact of the noninterest bearing sources of funds is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net \ninterest income divided by average earning assets. Both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a \ntax-equivalent basis, which means that tax-free interest income has been adjusted to pretax-equivalent income, assuming \na 21% federal tax rate. Management’s ability to respond to changes in interest rates by using effective asset-liability \nmanagement techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and the momentum of the \nCompany’s primary source of earnings. The FOMC increased the targeted federal funds rate by a total of 425 basis \npoints throughout 2022. This rapid increase may impact the comparability of net interest income between periods."

Core net interest margin (on a \nfully tax-equivalent basis), a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of loan fees and PPP balances, \ninterest, and fees, for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 3.27%, a one basis point decrease from 3.28% for the year \nended December 31, 2021. The Company remains focused on managing the impact of continued interest rate hikes and \nthe evolving shape of the yield curve during this unique interest rate environment.  \nAs the PPP loan portfolio has almost fully paid off, the recognition of fees associated with the originations has \ndecreased significantly, which impacts comparability between periods. The Company recognized $898,000 of PPP \norigination fees for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. \nThere were no remaining PPP origination fees to be recognized as of December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the \nCompany had three PPP loans outstanding totaling $1.0 million, compared to 153 PPP loans outstanding totaling $26.2 \nmillion at December 31, 2021. \nAverage interest earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $674.4 million, or 21.6%, to \n$3.79 billion from $3.12 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in average interest earning assets \nwas primarily due to strong organic growth in the loan portfolio and purchases of investment securities, offset partially \nby the forgiveness of PPP loans and the reduction of cash balances. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $442.3 \nmillion, or 21.2%, to $2.53 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $2.09 billion for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021. The increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in savings and \nmoney market deposits and federal funds purchased, offset partially by a decrease in time deposits. \nAverage interest earning assets produced a fully tax-equivalent yield of 4.35% for the year ended December 31, \n2022, compared to 4.16% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the yield on interest earning assets was \nprimarily due to growth and repricing of the loan and securities portfolios in the rising interest rate environment, offset \npartially by the lower recognition of PPP origination fees. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 1.34% \nfor the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 0.93% for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the \nrapid increase in market interest rates that occurred between the periods, which impacted all funding sources.  \nInterest Income. Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $164.9 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, compared to $129.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $35.2 million, or 27.1%, \nincrease in total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was primarily due to strong organic growth in the loan \nportfolio and purchases of investment securities, offset partially by a reduction in the recognition of PPP origination fees \nas the PPP loan portfolio has almost fully paid off. \nInterest income on cash investments increased $398,000, or 199.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, \ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021, despite a $66.1 million decrease in average balances, primarily due to \nthe interest rate hikes during the year. Interest income on the investment securities portfolio on a fully-tax equivalent \nbasis increased $6.8 million, or 66.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021, primarily due to a $127.6 million, or 32.4%, increase in average balances between the two periods \nand higher rates earned on securities. \nInterest income on loans, on a fully-tax equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31, 2022 was \n$146.8 million, compared to $119.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $27.8 million, or 23.4%, \nincrease was primarily due to a $605.9 million, or 23.4%, increase in the average balance of loans outstanding from \ncontinued organic loan growth and a four basis point increase in the average yield on loans, excluding PPP, partially \noffset by a $5.5 million decline of interest and fees earned on PPP loans. \nLoan interest income and loan fees remain the primary contributing factors to the changes in yield on interest \nearning assets. The aggregate loan yield, excluding PPP loans increased to 4.58% for the year ended December 31, 2022, \nwhich was four basis points higher than 4.54% for the year ended December 31, 2021. While loan fees have maintained \na relatively stable contribution to the aggregate loan yield, the Company has began to experience fewer loan \nprepayments, which historically has accelerated the recognition of loan fees.

The $9.5 million, or 68.9%, increase in interest expense on \ndeposits was primarily due to the upward repricing of the deposit portfolio consistent with the higher rate environment \nand the average balance of interest bearing deposits increasing by $276.2 million, or 14.2%. The cost of total deposits \nincreased 24 basis points from 0.51% for the year ended December 31, 2021, to 0.75% for the year ended December 31, \n2022. The increase was primarily due to the upward repricing of the deposit portfolio in the higher interest rate \nenvironment. \nInterest expense on borrowings increased $5.1 million to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, \ncompared to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the increased \nutilization of federal funds purchased and FHLB advances in the rising interest rate environment.  \n2021 Compared to 2020 \nNet interest income was $109.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $21.5 million, or \n24.5%, compared to $88.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net interest income was \nlargely attributable to growth in average interest earning assets and lower rates paid on deposits, offset partially by \ndeclining yields on loans. \nNet interest margin (on a fully tax-equivalent basis) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 3.54%, \ncompared to 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 8 basis points. Core net interest margin (on a \nfully tax-equivalent basis), a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of loan fees and PPP balances, \ninterest, and fees, for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 3.28%, a 3 basis point increase from 3.25% for the year \nended December 31, 2020. The expansion of core net interest margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, was primarily due \nto the repricing of deposits and the early extinguishment of higher priced FHLB term advances, offset partially by a \ndecline in the core loan yield and higher average cash balances. \nThe Company recognized $5.4 million of PPP origination fees for the year ended December 31, 2021, \ncompared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The elevated fee recognition is illustrated in the 6.24% \nPPP loan yield for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 3.39% for the year ended December 31, 2020.  \nAverage interest earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $550.0 million, or 21.4%, to \n$3.12 billion from $2.57 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in interest \nbearing deposits and the issuance of subordinated debentures in the second quarter of 2021, partially offset by a decrease \nin notes payable and FHLB advances. \nAverage interest earning assets produced a fully tax-equivalent yield of 4.16% for the year ended December 31, \n2021, compared to 4.51% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decline in the yield on interest earning assets was \nprimarily due to excess cash balances and the historically low interest rate environment resulting in lower loan and \nsecurity yields. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 0.93% for the year ended December 31, 2021, \ncompared to 1.53% for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to lower rates paid on deposits, the payoff of \nthe Company’s notes payable and the early extinguishment of $94.0 million of higher priced FHLB term advances, \noffset partially by strong growth of interest bearing deposits and the issuance of additional subordinated debentures. \nInterest Income. Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $129.7 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021, compared to $115.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $14.0 million, or 12.1%, \nincrease in total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was primarily due to continued organic growth in the loan \nportfolio, as well as PPP loan income. \nInterest income on cash investments increased $30,000, or 17.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, \ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a $52.1 million, or 65.0%, increase in average cash \nbalances, due to strong deposit inflows. Interest income on the investment securities portfolio on a fully-tax equivalent \nbasis increased $738,000, or 7.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, \n2020, primarily due to a $70.8 million, or 22.0%, increase in average balances between the two periods, which was \npartially offset by a 34 basis point decline in the aggregate portfolio yield, driven by the historically low interest rate \nenvironment. \nInterest income on loans, on a fully-tax equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31, 2021 was \n$119.0 million, compared to $105.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $13.4 million, or 12.7%, \nincrease was due to a $430.4 million, or 20.0%, increase in the average balance of loans outstanding from continued \norganic loan growth, which was partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in the average yield on loans. The aggregate \nloan yield, excluding PPP loans decreased to 4.54% for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was 45 basis points \nlower than 4.99% for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the historically low interest rate environment.  \nInterest Expense.

The \ncost of interest bearing liabilities declined 60 basis points to 0.93% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to \n1.53% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decline was primarily due to lower rates paid on deposits, and the \nearly extinguishment of $94.0 million of higher priced FHLB term advances, offset partially by growth of interest \nbearing deposits and the issuance of additional subordinated debentures. \nInterest expense on deposits decreased to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to \n$19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $6.0 million, or 30.1%, decrease in interest expense on \ndeposits was primarily due to deposit rate cuts consistent with a lower rate environment and the repricing of time \ndeposits, partially offset by the average balance of interest bearing deposits increasing by $404.4 million, or 26.3%. The \ncost of total deposits declined 42 basis points from 0.93% for the year ended December 31, 2020, to 0.51% for the year \nended December 31, 2021.  \nInterest expense on borrowings decreased $1.5 million to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, \ncompared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the lower average \nbalance of federal funds purchased, the payoff of the Company’s note payable, the early extinguishment of $94.0 million \nof higher priced FHLB term advances, and the partial early redemption of $11.3 million of subordinated debentures \nyielding 5.875%, offset partially by the issuance of $30.0 million of subordinated debentures in July 2021 yielding \n3.25%."

The provision for \nloan losses was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $2.6 million, compared to the \nprovision for loan losses of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the provision for loan \nlosses was primarily attributable to the growth of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses to total loans was \n1.34% at December 31, 2022, compared to 1.42% at December 31, 2021.  \nAs an emerging growth company, the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 “Financial \nInstruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses of Financial Instruments,” or CECL, became \neffective January 1, 2023. With the adoption of CECL, provision expense may become more volatile in future periods \ndue to changes in CECL model assumptions. The Company is currently in the process of finalizing its implementation of \ncontrols and processes which could affect the final impact of the adoption of this standard. \n2021 Compared to 2020 \nThe allowance for loan losses increased $5.2 million as of December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, \n2020, reflecting a provision for loan losses of $5.2 million and net recoveries of $29,000 during 2021. The provision for \nloan losses was $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $7.6 million, compared to the \nprovision for loan losses of $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the provision for loan \nlosses related to improving economic conditions and increased clarity surrounding uncertainty and evolving risks driven \nby the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, offset partially by growth of the loan portfolio. \nThe allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.42% at December 31, 2021, compared to 1.50% at \nDecember 31, 2020. The allowance for loan losses to total loans, excluding PPP loans, was 1.43% at December 31, \n2021, compared to 1.59% at December 31, 2020. \nThe following table presents a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYear Ended December 31, \n(dollars in thousands) \n \n2022 \n     \n2021 \n     \n2020 \nBalance at Beginning of Period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   $ \n 40,020  $ \n 34,841  $ \n 22,526 \nProvision for Loan Losses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    \n 7,700   \n 5,150   \n 12,750 \nCharge-offs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    \n (37)  \n (74)  \n (517)\nRecoveries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    \n 313   \n 103   \n 82 \nBalance at End of Period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   $ \n 47,996  $ \n 40,020  $ \n 34,841 \n \nNoninterest Income \n2022 Compared to 2021 \nNoninterest income was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $5.3 million for the \nyear ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $1.0 million, or 19.3%.

The increase was primarily driven by a $6.1 million \nincrease in salaries and employee benefits as the result of merit increases and increased staff to meet the needs of the \nCompany’s growth, a $684,000 increase in derivative collateral fees, and a $796,000 increase in other expense, offset \npartially by a decrease in debt prepayment fees.  \nThe Company continues to invest in its people across the organization, with 246 full-time equivalent employees \nat December 31, 2022, and 220 employees at December 31, 2021. \nEfficiency Ratio. The efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, reports total noninterest expense, less \namortization of intangible assets, as a percentage of net interest income plus total noninterest income less gains (losses) \non sales of securities. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides a meaningful comparison of \noperational performance and facilitates investors’ assessments of business performance and trends in comparison to \npeers in the banking industry.   \nThe efficiency ratio was 41.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 42.0% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021. The efficiencies of the Company's \"branch-light\" model have positioned the Company well to \ncontinue making investments in technology as the industry adapts to evolving client behavior. At the same time, \nmanagement seeks to contain costs whenever prudent, which is evident in the stable nature of the efficiency ratio. \n2021 Compared to 2020 \nNoninterest expense totaled $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a $2.7 million, or 6.0% \nincrease from $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The increase in total assets was primarily due to strong organic loan growth, purchases of \ninvestment securities and an increase of other assets, offset partially by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Total \ngross loans were $3.57 billion, an increase of $750.0 million, or 26.6%, compared to December 31, 2021.  \nTotal liabilities at December 31, 2022 were $3.95 billion, an increase of $853.2 million, or 27.5%, compared to \nDecember 31, 2021. Total deposits were $3.42 billion, an increase of $470.3 million, or 16.0%, compared to \nDecember 31, 2021. Total borrowings were $476.7 million, an increase of $341.9 million, or 253.8%, compared to \nDecember 31, 2021.  \nInvestment Securities Portfolio \nThe investment securities portfolio is used to make various term investments and is intended to provide the \nCompany with adequate liquidity, a source of stable income, and at times, serve as collateral for certain types of \ndeposits. Investment balances in the investment securities portfolio are subject to change over time based on funding \nneeds and interest rate risk management objectives. The liquidity levels take into account anticipated future cash flows \nand are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to ensure future flexibility in meeting anticipated \nfunding needs. \nThe investment securities portfolio consists primarily of U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities, \nmunicipal securities, and corporate securities comprised primarily of subordinated debentures of banks and financial \nholding companies. In addition, the Company also holds U.S. treasury securities and other debt securities, all with \nvarying contractual maturities. These maturities do not necessarily represent the expected life of the securities as the \nsecurities may be called or paid down without penalty prior to their stated maturities. All investment securities are held \nas available for sale. \n \nSecurities available for sale were $548.6 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $439.4 million at \nDecember 31, 2021, an increase of $109.3 million, or 24.9%. At December 31, 2022, government agency mortgage-\nbacked securities represented 28.8% of the portfolio, municipal securities represented 23.9% of the portfolio, corporate \nsecurities represented 20.0% of the portfolio, U.S. treasury securities represented 0.5% of the portfolio, SBA securities \nrepresented 3.8% of the portfolio, other mortgage-backed securities represented 14.6% of the portfolio, and asset-backed \nsecurities represented 8.4% of the portfolio."

The Company lends \nprimarily to commercial customers, consisting of loans secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties, multifamily \nresidential properties, land, and non-real estate business assets. Responsive service, local decision making, and an \nefficient turnaround time from application to closing have been significant factors in growing the loan portfolio. \nThe Company manages concentrations of credit exposure through a risk management program which \nimplements formalized processes and procedures specifically for managing and mitigating risk within the loan portfolio. \nThe processes and procedures include board and management oversight, commercial real estate exposure limits, \nportfolio monitoring tools, management information systems, market reports, underwriting standards, internal and \nexternal loan review, and stress testing.  \nTotal gross loans increased $750.0 million, or 26.6%, to $3.57 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to \n$2.82 billion at December 31, 2021. Excluding the forgiveness of $25.1 million of PPP loans, gross loans increased \n27.7% at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. The construction and land development, multifamily and \ncommercial real estate, or CRE, nonowner occupied categories contributed most significantly to the $775.1 million of \nnet loan growth, excluding PPP loans. As of December 31, 2022, construction and land development loans increased \n$84.3 million, or 30.0%, multifamily loans increased $396.5 million, or 43.6%, and nonowner occupied CRE loans \nincreased $128.4 million, or 15.7%, when compared to December 31, 2021. While the Company’s strong loan growth \ncontinued to be driven by the strong brand of the Bank in the Twin Cities market and the M&A-related market \ndisruption resulting in client and banker acquisition opportunities, overall loan demand began declining late in 2022 due \nto the rising interest rate environment."

Federal regulations \nand internal policies require the use of an asset classification system as a means of managing and reporting problem and \npotential problem assets. The Company has incorporated an internal asset classification system, substantially consistent \nwith federal banking regulations, as a part of the credit monitoring system. Federal banking regulations set forth a \nclassification scheme for problem and potential problem assets as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is \nconsidered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of \nthe collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the \nfinancial institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all \nof the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present \nmake “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly"

Assets which do not \ncurrently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories \nbut possess weaknesses are required to be designated “watch.” \nThe following table presents information on loan classifications at December 31, 2022.

Loans that warranted a substandard risk rating at \nDecember 31, 2022 totaled $28.0 million, compared to $22.6 million at December 31, 2021. Management continues to \nactively work with these borrowers and closely monitor substandard credits. \nThe Company developed programs for clients who experienced business and personal disruptions due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic by providing interest-only modifications, loan payment deferrals, and extended amortization \nmodifications. In accordance with interagency regulatory guidance and the CARES Act, qualifying loans modified in \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic are not considered TDRs. Modifications under this guidance, which could only be \napplied to modifications made by January 1, 2022, were granted on a case-by-case basis based on specific needs and \ncircumstances affecting each borrower. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no pandemic modified loans \noutstanding compared to 12 modified loans outstanding totaling $35.0 million, representing 1.3% of the loan portfolio, \nexcluding PPP loans, as of December 31, 2021. \nNonperforming Assets \nNonperforming loans include loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and loans 90 days past due and still \naccruing. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans plus foreclosed assets (i.e., real or personal property \nacquired through foreclosure). Nonaccrual loans totaled $639,000 at December 31, 2022 and $722,000 at December 31, \n2021, a decrease of $83,000. There were no loans 90 days past due and still accruing as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \nThere were no foreclosed assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021."

There were no \nloans greater than 90 days past due still accruing for any period shown.  \nThe balance of nonperforming assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions. The Company has \nestablished a policy to discontinue accruing interest on a loan (that is, place the loan on nonaccrual status) after it has \nbecome 90 days delinquent as to payment of principal or interest, unless the loan is considered to be well-collateralized \nand is actively in the process of collection. In addition, a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status before it becomes 90 \ndays delinquent unless management believes that the collection of interest is expected. Interest previously accrued but \nuncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against current income when the receivable is determined to be \nuncollectible. If management believes that a loan will not be collected in full, an increase to the allowance for loan losses \nis recorded to reflect management’s estimate of any potential exposure or loss. Generally, payments received on \nnonaccrual loans are applied directly to principal. There are not any loans, outside of those included in the tables above, \nthat cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of borrowers to comply with present repayment terms. \nDue to the low levels of nonaccrual loans, gross income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans during the \nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $60,000.  \nAllowance for Loan Losses \nThe allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision \nfor loan losses. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level management considers adequate to \nprovide for known and probable incurred losses in the portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on management’s \nevaluation of estimated losses in the portfolio, after consideration of risk characteristics of the loans and prevailing \nand anticipated economic conditions. Loan charge-offs (i.e., loans judged to be uncollectible) are charged against the \nreserve and any subsequent recovery is credited to the reserve. The Company analyzes risks within the loan portfolio \non a continual basis. A risk system, consisting of multiple grading categories for each portfolio class, is utilized as an \nanalytical tool to assess risk and appropriate reserves. In addition to the risk system, management further evaluates \nrisk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current and anticipated economic conditions and considers such factors \nas the financial condition of the borrower, past and expected loss experience, and other factors which management \nfeels deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate reserve. These estimates are reviewed at least quarterly, and as \nadjustments become necessary, they are recognized in the periods in which they become known. Although \nmanagement strives to maintain an allowance it deems adequate, future economic changes, deterioration of \nborrowers’ creditworthiness, and the impact of examinations by regulatory agencies all could cause changes to the \nallowance for loan losses.  \nAt December 31, 2022 the allowance for loan losses was $48.0 million, an increase of $8.0 million from \n$40.0 million at December 31, 2021. Net charge-offs (recoveries) totaled ($276,000) during the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022 and ($29,000) during the year ended December 31, 2021. The allowance for loan losses as a \npercentage of total loans was 1.34% at December 31, 2022, compared to 1.42% at December 31, 2021."

The growth in deposits was primarily due to an increase in \nbrokered deposits, which were used to supplement core deposit growth during the year. The Company’s ability to \nsupport loan growth with core deposit growth was impacted by the higher interest rate environment in 2022, especially \nwith the emergence of unprecedented competition from the Treasury markets. When appropriate, the Company utilizes \nalternative funding sources such as brokered deposits, which provide flexibility in structure, optionality and efficiency \nnot afforded in traditional retail deposit channels. At December 31, 2022, total brokered deposits were $776.2 million or \n22.7% of total deposits, compared to total brokered deposits of $369.3 million, or 12.5% of total deposits at \nDecember 31, 2021. \nThe Company is in a highly competitive market and competes for local deposits by offering attractive products \nwith competitive rates. The Company expects to have a higher average cost of funds for local deposits compared to \ncompetitor banks due to the lack of an extensive branch network. The Company’s strategy is to offset the higher cost of \nfunding with a lower level of operating expense.  \n \nThe following table presents the average balance and average rate paid on each of the following deposit \ncategories for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs of and for the  \n \nAs of and for the  \n \nAs of and for the  \n \n \n \nYear Ended  \n \nYear Ended  \n \nYear Ended  \n \n \n \nDecember 31, 2022 \n \nDecember 31, 2021 \n \nDecember 31, 2020 \n \n \n \nAverage \n Average \nAverage \n Average \nAverage \n Average \n(dollars in thousands) \n     \nBalance \n     Rate      \nBalance \n    Rate  \nBalance \n    Rate  \nNoninterest Bearing Transaction Deposits .   $  910,490  \n — %  $  764,087   \n — %  $  579,595  \n — %\nInterest Bearing Transaction Deposits . . . . .      524,968  \n 0.83  \n   441,528   \n 0.46  \n  \n 295,036  \n 0.55  \nSavings and Money Market Deposits . . . . .      963,096  \n 0.95  \n   773,779   \n 0.48  \n  \n 523,520  \n 1.02  \nTime Deposits < $250,000 . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      215,419  \n 1.00  \n   255,808   \n 1.24  \n  \n 244,779  \n 2.13  \nTime Deposits > $250,000 . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     \n 69,449  \n 1.61  \n  \n 67,830   \n 1.37  \n  \n 129,416  \n 2.01  \nBrokered Deposits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      449,095  \n 1.48  \n   406,863   \n 0.97  \n  \n 348,126  \n 1.45  \nTotal Deposits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   $ 3,132,517   \n 0.75 %  $ 2,709,895   \n 0.51 %  $  2,120,472   \n 0.93 %"

These amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory \nreporting purposes. \nBorrowed Funds \nFederal Funds Purchased \nIn addition to deposits, the Company utilizes overnight borrowings to meet the daily liquidity needs of clients \nand fund loan growth. The Company had $287.0 million federal funds purchased as of December 31, 2022. The \nCompany had no federal funds purchased as of December 31, 2021. \nOther Borrowings \nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding FHLB advances of $97.0 million. The Company’s \nborrowing capacity at the FHLB is determined based on collateral pledged, generally consisting of loans. The Company \nhad additional borrowing capacity under this credit facility of $390.9 million and $550.8 million at December 31, 2022 \nand 2021, respectively. \nThe Company has an outstanding Loan and Security Agreement and revolving note with a third party \ncorrespondent lender, which is secured by 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of the Bank. On September 1, 2022, \nthe Company entered into a second amendment to the agreement which increased the maximum principal amount of the \nCompany’s revolving line of credit from $25.0 million to $40.0 million and extended the maturity date from \nFebruary 28, 2023 to September 1, 2024. Concurrently with the subordinated debenture redemption on October 17, \n2022, the Company drew on its revolving line of credit in the amount of $13.8 million. As of December 31, 2022, there \nwas $13.8 million outstanding balances under the revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2021, there were no \noutstanding balances under the revolving line of credit. \nAdditionally, the Company has borrowing capacity from other sources. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank \nwas eligible to use the Federal Reserve discount window for borrowings. Based on assets pledged as collateral as of the \napplicable date, the Bank’s borrowing availability was approximately $157.8 million and $126.0 million at \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding \nadvances from the discount window.  \nSubordinated Debentures \nOn October 15, 2022, the Company elected to redeem the outstanding 2027 Notes in the aggregate principal \namount of $13.8 million and made all payments of principal and interest due on the 2027 Notes on October 17, 2022.  \nFor additional information, see “Note 12 – Subordinated Debentures” of the Company’s Consolidated Financial \nStatements included as part of this report."

See \n“Note 8 – Leases” of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this report for additional \ninformation. \n \nThe Company believes that it will be able to meet all contractual obligations as they come due through the \nmaintenance of adequate cash levels. The Company expects to maintain adequate cash levels through earnings, loan and \nsecurities repayments and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. As described above, the Company \nhas in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. \nCapital \nTotal shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2022 was $394.1 million, an increase of $14.8 million, or 3.9%, \nover shareholders’ equity of $379.3 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to net income retained and unrealized \ngains in the derivatives portfolio, offset partially by stock repurchases made under the Company’s stock repurchase \nprogram, preferred stock dividends, and an increase in unrealized losses in the securities portfolio. \nStock Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 662,765 \nshares of its common stock, representing 2.4% of the Company’s outstanding shares. Shares were repurchased during \nthis period at a weighted average price of $16.26 for a total of $10.8 million. All shares repurchased under the stock \nrepurchase program were converted to authorized but unissued shares. \nOn August 17, 2022, the Company’s board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program which \nauthorizes the Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million of its common stock, subject to certain limitations and \nconditions. The new stock repurchase program replaced and superseded the $40.0 million stock repurchase program, \nunder which approximately $1.6 million remained. The new stock repurchase program will expire on August 16, 2024. \nAt December 31, 2022, no shares had been repurchased under the new plan. The company remains committed to \nmaintaining strong capital levels while enhancing shareholder value as it strategically executes its stock repurchase \nprogram based on various factors including valuation, capital levels and other uses of capital. \nRegulatory Capital. The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements \nadministered by federal banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory \nand possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct \nmaterial effect on the Company’s and Bank’s business. \nManagement believes the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were \nsubject as of December 31, 2022.

The rules require a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% \nthat was added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes. A banking organization with a conservation \nbuffer of less than the required amount is subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, \nstock repurchases and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. At December 31, 2022, the ratios for \nthe Company and the Bank were sufficient to meet the conservation buffer. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into various transactions to meet the financing needs of \nclients, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in the consolidated balance sheets. These transactions include \ncommitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying \ndegrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance \nsheets. Most of these commitments mature within two years and the standby letters of credit are expected to expire \nwithout being drawn upon. All off-balance sheet commitments are included in the determination of the amount of risk-\nbased capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold. \nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial \ninstrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit is represented by"

The Company decreases its exposure to losses under these \ncommitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. The Company assesses the credit risk \nassociated with certain commitments to extend credit and establishes a liability for probable credit losses. \nThe following table presents credit arrangements and financial instruments whose contract amounts represent \ncredit risk as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 31, 2022 \n \nDecember 31, 2021 \n \n     \nFixed \n     Variable      \nFixed \n     Variable \n(dollars in thousands) \n   \n   \n   \n   \nUnfunded Commitments Under Lines of Credit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   $ 444,669  $ 404,065  $ 335,842  $ 463,306 \nLetters of Credit  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      20,658     95,111     10,521     109,126 \nTotals  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   $ 465,327  $ 499,176  $ 346,363  $ 572,432 \n \nCommitments to extend credit beyond current funding are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is \nno violation of any condition established in the contract. Such commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or \nother termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being \ndrawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each \ncustomer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by us upon \nextension of credit, is based on our management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include accounts \nreceivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties. \n \nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer \nto a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including \ncommercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to \nfacilitate trade or commerce and are paid directly when the underlying transaction is consummated. The credit risk \ninvolved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. \n \nThe Company had outstanding letters of credit with the FHLB in the amount of $78.4 million and $36.5 million \nat December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on behalf of customers and to secure public deposits. \n \nLiquidity \nLiquidity is the Company’s capacity to meet cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost. Maintaining an \nadequate level of liquidity depends on the Company’s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash \nflows and collateral needs without adversely affecting either daily operations or financial condition. The Bank’s ALM \nCommittee, is responsible for managing commitments to meet the needs of customers while achieving the Company’s \nfinancial objectives. The ALM Committee meets regularly to review balance sheet composition, funding capacities, and \ncurrent and forecasted loan demand. \nThe Company manages liquidity by maintaining adequate levels of cash and other assets from on- and off-\nbalance sheet arrangements. Specifically, on-balance sheet liquidity consists of cash and due from banks and unpledged \ninvestment securities available for sale, which are referred to as primary liquidity. In regards to off-balance sheet \ncapacity, the Company maintains available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines with the FHLB, the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and a correspondent lender, as well as unsecured lines of credit for the purpose of \novernight funds with various correspondent banks, which the Company refers to as secondary liquidity.  \nIn addition, the Bank is a member of the American Financial Exchange, or AFX, through which it may either \nborrow or lend funds on an overnight or short-term basis with a group of approved commercial banks. The availability of \nfunds changes daily. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no borrowings outstanding through the \nAFX."

Secondary liquidity decreased $126.9 million as of December 31, 2022 when \ncompared to December 31, 2021, due to a $159.9 million decrease in the borrowing capacity with the FHLB, offset \npartially by a $31.8 million increase on the secured credit line with the Federal Reserve Bank and a $1.3 increase in the \nsecured borrowing capacity with a correspondent lender. \nIn addition to primary liquidity, the Company generates liquidity from cash flows from the loan and securities \nportfolios and from the large base of core customer deposits, defined as noninterest bearing transaction, interest bearing \ntransaction, savings, non-brokered money market accounts and non-brokered time deposits less than $250,000. At \nDecember 31, 2022, core deposits totaled approximately $2.55 billion and represented 74.6% of total deposits. These \ncore deposits are normally less volatile, often with customer relationships tied to other products offered by the Company, \nwhich promote long-standing relationships and stable funding sources. \nThe Company uses brokered deposits, the availability of which is uncertain and subject to competitive market \nforces and regulation, for liquidity and interest rate risk management purposes. At December 31, 2022, brokered deposits \ntotaled $776.2 million, consisting of $591.9 million of brokered time deposits and $184.3 million of non-maturity \nbrokered money market and transaction accounts. At December 31, 2021, brokered deposits totaled $369.3 million, \nconsisting of $238.1 million of brokered time deposits and $131.2 million of non-maturity brokered money market and \ntransaction accounts. \nThe Company’s liquidity policy includes guidelines for On-Balance Sheet Liquidity (a measurement of primary \nliquidity to total deposits plus borrowings), Total On-Balance Sheet Liquidity with Borrowing Capacity (a measurement \nof primary and secondary liquidity to total deposits plus borrowings), Wholesale Funding Ratio (a measurement of total \nwholesale funding to total deposits plus borrowings), and other guidelines developed for measuring and maintaining \nliquidity. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all established liquidity guidelines in the \npolicy."

      "text": "76 \nGAAP Reconciliation and Management Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures \nSome of the financial data included in this report are not measures of financial performance recognized by \nGAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in the analysis of performance:  \n \n• \n\"Pre-Provision Net Revenue\" is defined as net interest income plus total noninterest income (excluding all \ngains and losses on sales of assets) minus total non-interest expense, excluding the amortization of tax \ncredit investments and debt prepayment fees. \n• \n“Core Net Interest Margin” is defined as the ratio of net interest income (on a fully tax-equivalent basis), \nreduced by loan fees and PPP interest and fees, divided by interest earning assets, excluding average PPP \nloans. \n• \n“Efficiency ratio” is defined as noninterest expense less the amortization of intangibles divided by our \noperating revenue, which is equal to net interest income plus noninterest income excluding gains and losses \non sales of assets. In management’s judgment, the adjustments made to operating revenue allow investors \nand analysts to better assess our operating expenses in relation to our core operating revenue by removing \nthe volatility that is associated with certain one-time items and other discrete items that are unrelated to the \nCompany’s core business. \n• \n“Adjusted Efficiency ratio” is defined as the efficiency ratio adjusted to exclude the amortization of tax \ncredit investments and debt prepayments fees from noninterest expense.  \n• \n“Adjusted Noninterest expense to average assets” is defined as the ratio of noninterest expense adjusted to \nexclude the amortization of tax credit investments and debt prepayment fees, divided by average assets. \n• \n“Tangible common equity” is defined as shareholders’ equity reduced by preferred stock, goodwill and \nother intangible assets. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who \nare interested in changes from period to period in common shareholders’ equity exclusive of changes in \nintangible assets. Goodwill and other intangibles that were recorded in a purchase business combination \nhave the effect of increasing both equity and assets while not increasing tangible equity or tangible assets. \n• \n“Tangible common equity to tangible assets” is defined as the ratio of tangible common equity, as defined \nabove, divided by total assets reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company believes that \nthis measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in relative changes from \nperiod to period in common shareholders’ equity to total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible \nassets. Goodwill and other intangibles that were recorded in a purchase business combination have the \neffect of increasing both equity and assets while not increasing our tangible equity or tangible assets. \n• \n“Tangible book value per share” is defined as tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by total \ncommon voting and non-voting shares outstanding. The Company believes that this measure is important \nto many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per \nshare exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangibles that were recorded in a \npurchase business combination have the effect of increasing book value while not increasing tangible book \nvalue. \n• \n“Return on average tangible common equity” is defined as the ratio of net income available to common \nshareholders, divided by average tangible common equity. Management believes that this measure is \nimportant to many investors in the marketplace because it measures the return on common equity, \nexclusive of the effects of preferred stock and intangible assets on earnings and capital.   \n• \n“Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share” is defined as net income available to common \nshareholders excluding the impact of debt prepayment fees divided by diluted weighted average common \nshares outstanding. In our judgment, the adjustments to earnings remove the volatility that is associated \nwith certain one-time items unrelated to our core business."

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \nInterest Rate Risk \nAs a financial institution, the Company’s primary market risk is interest rate risk, which is defined as the risk of \nloss of net interest income or net interest margin because of changes in interest rates. The Company continually seeks to \nmeasure and manage the potential impact of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk occurs when interest earning assets and \ninterest bearing liabilities mature or re-price at different times, on a different basis or in unequal amounts. Interest rate \nrisk also arises when assets and liabilities each respond differently to changes in interest rates. \nThe Company’s management of interest rate risk is overseen by its ALM Committee, based on a risk \nmanagement infrastructure approved by the board of directors that outlines reporting and measurement requirements. In \nparticular, this infrastructure sets limits and management targets for various metrics, including net interest income \nsimulation involving parallel shifts in interest rate curves, steepening and flattening yield curves, and various \nprepayment and deposit duration assumptions. The Company’s risk management infrastructure also requires a periodic \nreview of all key assumptions used, such as identifying appropriate interest rate scenarios, setting loan prepayment rates \nbased on historical analysis and noninterest bearing and interest bearing transaction deposit durations based on historical \nanalysis. The Company does not engage in speculative trading activities relating to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, \ncommodity prices, equities or credit. \nThe Company manages the interest rate risk associated with interest earning assets by managing the interest \nrates and terms associated with the investment securities portfolio by purchasing and selling investment securities from \ntime to time. The Company manages the interest rate risk associated with interest bearing liabilities by managing the \ninterest rates and terms associated with wholesale borrowings and deposits from customers which the Company relies on \nfor funding. For example, the Company occasionally uses special offers on deposits to alter the interest rates and terms \nassociated with interest bearing liabilities.  \nThe Company has entered into certain hedging transactions including interest rate swaps and caps, which are \ndesigned to lessen elements of the Company’s interest rate exposure. Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to \nthe variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions. The Company utilizes cash flow hedges to manage \ninterest rate exposure for the brokered deposit and wholesale borrowing portfolios. At December 31, 2022 and \nDecember 31, 2021, these cash flow hedges had a total notional amount of $288.0 million and $235.0 million, \nrespectively. In the event that interest rates do not change in the manner anticipated, such transactions may adversely \naffect the Company’s results of operations. \nNet Interest Income Simulation \nThe Company uses a net interest income simulation model to measure and evaluate potential changes in net \ninterest income that would result over the next 12 months from immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as of \nthe measurement date. This model has inherent limitations and the results are based on a given set of rate changes and \nassumptions as of a certain point in time. For purposes of the simulation, the Company assumes no growth in either \ninterest-sensitive assets or liabilities over the next 12 months; therefore, the model’s results reflect an interest rate shock \nto a static balance sheet. The simulation model also incorporates various other assumptions, which the Company \nbelieves are reasonable but which may have a significant impact on results, such as: (1) the timing of changes in interest"

Because of the limitations inherent in \nany approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a \nchange in market interest rates on the results, but rather as a means to better plan and execute appropriate asset-liability \nmanagement strategies and to manage interest rate risk. \nPotential changes to the Company’s net interest income in hypothetical rising and declining rate scenarios \ncalculated as of December 31, 2022 are presented in the table below. The projections assume an immediate, parallel shift \ndownward of the yield curve of 100, 200, and 300 basis points and immediate, parallel shifts upward of the yield curve \nof 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points. In the current interest rate environment, a downward shift of the yield curve of \n400 basis points does not provide meaningful results and thus is not presented. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(dollars in thousands) \n \nDecember 31, 2022 \n \nDecember 31, 2021 \nChange (basis points) \n \nForecasted \n \nPercentage \n \nForecasted \n \nPercentage \nin Interest Rates \n     \nNet Interest \n \nChange \n     \nNet Interest \n \nChange \n(12-Month Projection) \n \nIncome \n \nfrom Base \n \nIncome \n \nfrom Base \n+400 \n $ \n 129,621  \n (4.84)% \n$ \n 116,256  \n 5.75 % \n+300 \n   \n 131,357  \n (3.57)  \n  \n 114,328  \n 4.00  \n+200 \n   \n 133,089  \n (2.30)  \n  \n 112,288  \n 2.15  \n+100 \n   \n 134,591  \n (1.20)  \n  \n 110,539  \n 0.55  \n0 \n   \n 136,220  \n —   \n  \n 109,930  \n —  \n−100 \n  \n 137,641  \n 1.04   \n \n 106,955  \n (2.71) \n−200 \n  \n 137,968  \n 1.28   \n \nNM  \nNM  \n−300 \n  \n 138,587  \n 1.74   \n \nNM  \nNM  \n \nThe table above indicates that as of December 31, 2022, in the event of an immediate and sustained 400 basis \npoint increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 4.84% decrease in net interest income. In the event of \nan immediate 300 basis point decrease in interest rates, the Company would experience a 1.74% increase in net interest \nincome. \nThe results of this simulation analysis are hypothetical, and a variety of factors might cause actual results to \ndiffer substantially from what is depicted. For example, if the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes differ from \nthose projected, net interest income might vary significantly. Non-parallel yield curve shifts such as a flattening or \nsteepening of the yield curve or changes in interest rate spreads would also cause net interest income to be different from \nthat depicted. An increasing interest rate environment could reduce projected net interest income if deposits and other \nshort-term liabilities re-price faster than expected or re-price faster than the Company’s assets. Actual results could differ \nfrom those projected if the Company grows assets and liabilities faster or slower than estimated, if the Company \nexperienced a net outflow of deposit liabilities, or if the mix of assets and liabilities otherwise changes. Actual results \ncould also differ from those projected if the Company experienced substantially different prepayment speeds in the loan \nportfolio than those assumed in the simulation model. Finally, these simulation results do not contemplate all the actions \nthat the Company may undertake in response to potential or actual changes in interest rates, such as changes to the \nCompany’s loan, investment, deposit, or funding strategies."

(the “Company”) is a financial holding company headquartered in St. Louis Park, \nMinnesota, whose operations consist of the ownership of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Bridgewater Bank (the “Bank”) \nand Bridgewater Risk Management, Inc. The Bank commenced operations in 2005 and provides retail and commercial \nloan and deposit services, principally to customers within the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI Metropolitan \nStatistical Area. In 2008, the Bank formed BWB Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, for the purpose \nof holding repossessed property. In 2018, the Bank formed Bridgewater Investment Management, Inc., a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of the Bank, for the purpose of holding certain municipal securities and to engage in municipal lending \nactivities.  \nBridgewater Risk Management, Inc. was incorporated in December 2016 as a wholly-owned insurance \ncompany subsidiary of the Company. It insures the Company and its subsidiaries against certain risks unique to the \noperations of the Company and for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today’s \ninsurance marketplace. Bridgewater Risk Management pools resources with several other insurance company \nsubsidiaries of financial institutions to spread a limited amount of risk among themselves. \nPrinciples of Consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements include the amounts of the Company, the Bank, with locations in \nBloomington, Greenwood, Minneapolis (2), St. Louis Park, Orono, and St. Paul, Minnesota, BWB Holdings, LLC, \nBridgewater Investment Management, Inc., and Bridgewater Risk Management, Inc. All significant intercompany \nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. \nUse of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements \nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make \nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets \nand liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses \nduring the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Information available which could affect \njudgments includes, but is not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy, including \nCOVID-19 pandemic related changes, and changes in the financial condition of borrowers.  \nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term include the \ndetermination of the allowance for loan losses, calculation of deferred tax assets, fair value of financial instruments, and \ninvestment securities impairment. \nEmerging Growth Company \nThe Company qualifies as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of \n2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are \napplicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required \nto comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure \nobligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the \nrequirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden \nparachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if the Company complies with the greater obligations of \npublic companies that are not emerging growth companies, the Company may avail itself of the reduced requirements \napplicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as the Company is an emerging growth \ncompany. The Company will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (1) the end of the \nfiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities under the Company’s"

Management cannot predict if investors will find the Company’s common \nstock less attractive because it will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the Company’s common stock less \nattractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for its common stock and the Company’s stock price may \nbe more volatile.  \nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended \ntransition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 for complying with new or revised \naccounting standards. As an emerging growth company, the Company can delay the adoption of certain accounting \nstandards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company elected to take advantage of \nthe benefits of this extended transition period. \nCash and Cash Equivalents \nFor purpose of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash, both interest \nbearing and noninterest bearing balances due from banks and federal funds sold, all of which mature within 90 days. \nCash flows from loans and deposits are reported net. \nBank-Owned Certificates of Deposit \nBank-owned certificates of deposit mature within five years and are carried at cost. \nSecurities Available for Sale \nDebt securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses \nreported in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses on securities available for sale are included in \nnoninterest income and, when applicable, are reported as a reclassification adjustment, net of tax, in other \ncomprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses on sales of securities are determined using the specific identification \nmethod on the trade date. The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recognized in interest income \nover the estimated life (earliest call date, maturity, or estimated life) using a prospective method that approximates level \nyield. \nDeclines in the fair value of individual available for sale securities below their cost that are other than \ntemporary result in write-downs of the individual securities to the fair value. The Company monitors the investment \nsecurities portfolio for impairment on an individual security basis and has a process in place to identify securities that \ncould potentially have a credit impairment that is other than temporary. This process involves analyzing the length of \ntime and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the market liquidity for the \nsecurity, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, expected cash flows, and the Company’s intent \nand ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the temporary loss. The ability to hold is \ndetermined by whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before its \nanticipated recovery. A decline in value due to a credit event that is considered other than temporary is recorded as a loss \nin noninterest income. \nLoans \nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off \ngenerally are reported at their outstanding unpaid balances adjusted for charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses, any \ndeferred fees or costs on originated loans, and premiums or discounts on purchased loans."

Loan origination fees, net of certain direct \norigination costs, as well as premiums and discounts, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the related loan \nyield using the interest method. Amortization of deferred loan fees is discontinued when a loan is placed on nonaccrual \nstatus. \nThe accrual of interest on all loans is discounted if the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well-secured \nand in process of collection. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on \nnonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. \nAll interest accrued, but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off is reversed against \ninterest income and amortization of related deferred loan fees or costs is suspended. The interest on these loans is \naccounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. The cash-basis is used \nwhen a determination has been made that the principal and interest of the loan is collectible. If collectability of the \nprincipal and interest is in doubt, payments are applied to loan principal. The determination of ultimate collectability is \nsupported by a current, well documented credit evaluation of the borrower’s financial condition and prospects for \nrepayment, including consideration of the borrower’s sustained historical repayment performance and other relevant \nfactors. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought \ncurrent, the borrower has demonstrated a period of sustained performance, and future payments are reasonably assured. \nA sustained period of repayment performance generally would be a minimum of six months. \nAllowance for Loan Losses \nThe allowance for loan losses (the “allowance”) is an estimate of loan losses inherent in the Company’s loan \nportfolio. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the \nallowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after loan losses and loan growth. Loan losses \nare charged-off against the allowance when the Company determines all or a portion of the loan balance to be \nuncollectible. Cash received on previously charged-off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance. \nThe allowance consists of three primary components, general reserves, specific reserves related to impaired \nloans, and unallocated reserves. The general component covers nonimpaired loans and is based on historical losses \nadjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual \nloss history experienced by the Company over the most recent five years. This actual loss experience is adjusted for \neconomic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of \nthe following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; trends in volume and terms of loans; experience, \nability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions, \nincluding uncertainty related to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; industry conditions; COVID-19 pandemic related \nmodifications; and effects of change in credit concentrations. These factors are inherently subjective and are driven by \nthe repayment risk associated with each portfolio segment. \nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company \nwill be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of \nthe loan agreement. Loans determined to be impaired are individually evaluated for impairment. An impaired loan is \nmeasured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or, as a \npractical expedient, at the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. The fair value of \ncollateral, reduced by costs to sell on a discounted basis, is used if a loan is collateral dependent. A loan is collateral \ndependent if the repayment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral. \nAllowance allocations other than general and specific reserves are included in the unallocated portion. While \nallocations are made for loans and leases based upon historical loss analysis, the unallocated portion is designed to cover \nthe uncertainty of how current economic conditions and other uncertainties may impact the existing loan portfolio. \nFactors to consider include global, national and state economic conditions such as changes in unemployment rates and \nproductivity, geopolitical tensions, monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty, political gridlock, and real estate market"

The unallocated reserve addresses inherent probable losses not included elsewhere in the allowance for loan \nlosses. \nUnder certain circumstances, the Company will provide borrowers relief through loan restructurings. A \nrestructuring of debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons \nrelated to the borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. \nRestructured loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to \nthe original contractual terms. Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as \ndescribed above in the calendar year of the restructuring. In subsequent years, a restructured loan may cease being \nclassified as impaired if the loan was modified at a market rate and is performing according to the modified terms. TDR \nconcessions can include reduction of interest rates, extension of maturity dates, forgiveness of principal or interest due, \nor acceptance of other assets in full or partial satisfaction of the debt. Restructured loans can involve loans remaining on \nnonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances \nof the borrower. Nonaccrual restructured loans are included with other nonaccrual loans. \nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or, CARES Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020, \nincluded provisions that provide temporary relief from TDR accounting for certain types of modifications. Under these \nprovisions, modifications deemed to be COVID-19-related would not be considered a TDR if the loan was not more than \n30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 and the deferral was executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of 60 \ndays after the date of termination of the COVID-19 national emergency or December 31, 2020. The termination of these \nprovisions was extended, to the earlier of 60 days after the COVID-19 national emergency date or January 1, 2022, by \nthe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. The banking regulators issued similar guidance, which also clarified that a \nCOVID-19-related modification should not be considered a TDR if the borrower was current on payments at the time the \nunderlying loan modification program was implemented and if the modification was considered to be short-\nterm. Modifications are first evaluated for eligibility under the CARES Act, then the interagency guidance if they do not \nqualify for the CARES Act relief. Modifications that are not eligible for either program continue to follow the \nCompany’s established TDR policy. Additionally, loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 are not generally \nreported as past due or nonaccrual. \nThe Company assigns risk ratings to all loans and periodically performs detailed internal reviews of all such \nloans over a certain threshold to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio. These risk \nratings are also subject to examination by the Company’s regulators. During the internal reviews, management monitors \nand analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which the borrowers operate, \nand the fair values of collateral securing the loans. These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each \nindividual loan. The risk ratings can be grouped into five major categories defined as follows: \nPass: A pass loan is a credit with no known or existing potential weaknesses deserving of management’s close \nattention. \nWatch: Loans classified as watch have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left \nuncorrected, this potential weakness may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the \nCompany’s credit position at some future date. Watch loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company \nto sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. \nSubstandard: Loans classified as substandard are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying \ncapacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined \nweakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt. Well defined weaknesses include a borrower’s lack \nof marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time, or the failure to \nfulfill economic expectations. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain loss if the \ndeficiencies are not corrected."

These portfolio \nsegments include commercial, Paycheck Protection Program, construction and land development, 1-4 family mortgage, \nmultifamily, CRE owner occupied, CRE nonowner occupied, and consumer and other with risk characteristics described \nas follows: \nCommercial: Commercial loans generally are loans to sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, and \nother business enterprises to finance accounts receivable or inventory, capital assets, or for other business related \npurposes. Commercial lending is not without risk as this asset class has generally exhibited higher loss rates compared to \nother loan types. The primary repayment sources for commercial and industrial loans are the existing cash flows of \noperating businesses which can be adversely affected by company, industry and economic business cycles. Economic \ntrends influenced by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of \nthese loans. The liquidation of collateral, typically accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, or other business assets, is \nthe primary source of principal repayment if the borrower defaults. The value of these assets can be uncertain in a \nliquidation scenario. \nPaycheck Protection Program: The Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, loan segment was added by the \nCompany starting in the second quarter of 2020. PPP loans are loans to businesses, sole proprietorships, independent \ncontractors and self-employed individuals who meet certain criteria and eligibility requirements through a loan program \nestablished by the CARES Act and administered through the Small Business Administration, or SBA. PPP loans \ngenerally have two or five year terms and earn interest at 1%. The Company believes that the primary source of \nrepayment will be forgiveness granted by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. Credit risk in these \nloans is limited due to a full guarantee by the U.S. Government. The Company does not assign risk ratings to loans in \nthis segment and will continue to monitor segment performance as circumstances evolve. \nConstruction and Land Development: Construction and land development loans generally possess a higher \ninherent risk of loss and have experienced the highest loss rates of any loan category based on statistics published by the \nFDIC. Risks associated with these loans often include the borrower’s ability to complete the project within specified \ncosts and timelines and the reliance on the sale of the completed project as the primary repayment source for the loan. \nTrends in the commercial and residential construction industries can significantly impact the credit quality of these loans \ndue to supply and demand imbalances. In addition, fluctuations in real estate values can significantly impact the credit \nquality of these loans, as property values may determine the economic viability of construction projects and adversely \nimpact the value of the collateral securing the loan. \n1-4 Family Mortgage: The degree of risk in residential mortgage lending involving owner occupied properties \ndepends primarily on the borrower’s ability to repay in an orderly fashion and the loan amount in relation to collateral \nvalue. Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to \nthe credit quality of these loans. Weak economic trends indicate that the borrower’s capacity to repay their obligations \nmay be deteriorating. Residential mortgage lending also includes the credits to finance nonowner occupied properties \nused as rentals. These loans can involve additional risks as the borrower’s ability to repay is based on the net operating \nincome from the property which can be impacted by occupancy levels, rental rates, and operating expenses. Declines in \nnet operating income can negatively impact the value of the property which increases the credit risk in the event of \ndefault. While 1-4 family mortgage loans have historically possessed a lower inherent risk of loss than other real estate \nportfolio segments, this loan class was significantly impacted during the last recession due in part to weak credit \nunderwriting and speculative lending practices which led to higher default rates and deterioration in residential real \nestate values."

Nonetheless, \neconomic factors such as unemployment, wage growth and home affordability can impact vacancy rates and property \ncash flow. In addition, an overbuilt supply of multifamily units can increase competition amongst properties and could \nhave an adverse effect on leasing rates and overall occupancy, which could result in higher default rates and possible \nloan losses. \nCRE Owner Occupied: Owner occupied commercial real estate loans are generally reliant on a single tenant \nas the repayment source for the loan. The underlying business can be affected by changes in industry and economic \nbusiness cycles, unemployment and other key economic indicators, which could impact the cash flows of the business \nand their ability to make rental payments. Certain types of businesses also may require specialized facilities that can \nincrease costs and may not be economically feasible to an alternative user, which could adversely impact the market \nvalue of the collateral. \nCRE Nonowner Occupied: Nonowner occupied commercial real estate loans can possess a higher inherent \nrisk of loss as the primary repayment source for these loans is based on the net operating income from the underlying \nproperty. Changes in economic and market conditions can affect different segments of commercial real estate by \nimpacting overall leasing rates, absorption timelines, vacancy rates, and operating expenses. Banks which are \nconcentrated in commercial real estate lending are subject to additional regulatory scrutiny and must employ enhanced \nrisk management practices. \nConsumer and Other: The consumer and other loan portfolio is usually comprised of a large number of small \nloans scheduled to be amortized over a specific period. Most loans are made directly for consumer purchases. Economic \ntrends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality \nof these loans. Weak economic trends indicate the borrowers’ capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating. \nAlthough management believes the allowance to be adequate, ultimate losses may vary from its estimates. At \nleast quarterly, the Board of Directors reviews the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relevant \nrisks in the portfolio, current economic conditions, and other factors. If the Board of Directors and management \ndetermine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted. In addition, the Company’s \nregulators assess the adequacy of the allowance from time to time. The regulatory agencies may require adjustments to \nthe allowance based on their judgment about information available at the time of their review and examinations. \nOff-Balance Sheet Instruments \nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into off-balance sheet instruments including \ncommitments to extend credit and unfunded commitments under lines of credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial \nletters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become \npayable. The Company maintains a separate allowance for off-balance sheet commitments. Management estimates \nanticipated losses using historical data and utilization assumptions. The allowance for off-balance sheet commitments is \nincluded in other liabilities. \nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock \nThe Bank is a member of FHLB Des Moines. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on \nthe level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. Restricted stock is carried at cost and \nperiodically evaluated for impairment. Because this stock is viewed as a long-term investment, impairment is based on \nultimate recovery at par value.

Gains and losses on dispositions are included in current operations. \nForeclosed Assets \nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value \nless estimated selling cost at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis.

This evaluation is inherently subjective and requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more \ninformation becomes available.  \nImpairment losses on assets to be held and used are measured at the amount by which the carrying amount of a \nproperty exceeds its fair value. Costs relating to holding and improving assets are expensed. Revenues and expenses \nfrom operations are included in other noninterest income and expense on the income statement. \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \nIntangible assets attributed to the value of core deposits and favorable lease terms are stated at cost less \naccumulated amortization and reported in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Intangible assets are \namortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lives of the assets. \nThe excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill and is not amortized. \nThe Company evaluates whether goodwill and other intangible assets may be impaired at least annually and \nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit or \nasset is less than its carrying amount. \nLeases \nLeases are classified as operating or finance leases at the lease commencement date. Lease expense for \noperating leases and short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease team. The Company includes \nlease extension and termination options in the lease term if, after considering relevant economic factors, it is reasonably \ncertain the Company will exercise the extension or termination option. \nRight-of-use (ROU) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease \nliabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease \nliabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of the lease payments \nover the lease term. The Company's ROU asset is included in other assets and its lease liability is included in other \nliabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease \ncommencement to calculate the present value of lease payments when the rate implicit in a lease is not known. The \nCompany's incremental borrowing rate is based on the FHLB amortizing advance rate, adjusted for the lease term and \nother factors. The Company has elected not to recognize leases with original terms of 12 months or less on the \nconsolidated balance sheet.  \nBank-Owned Life Insurance \nThe Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives. Bank owned life insurance is \nrecorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash \nsurrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement."

Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered \nwhen (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that \nconstrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does \nnot maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before maturity. \nThe transfer of a participating interest in an entire financial asset must also meet the definition of a participating \ninterest. A participating interest in a financial asset has all of the following characteristics: (1) from the date of transfer, \nit must represent a proportionate (pro rata) ownership interest in the financial asset, (2) from the date of transfer, all cash \nflows received, except any cash flows allocated as any compensation for servicing or other services performed, must be \ndivided proportionately among participating interest holders in the amount equal to their share ownership, (3) the rights \nof each participating interest holder must have the same priority, and (4) no party has the right to pledge or exchange the \nentire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree to do so. \nAdvertising \nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. \nIncome Taxes \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary \ndifferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax \nbasis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the \nyears in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and \nliabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. \nThese calculations are based on many factors including estimates of the timing of reversals of temporary \ndifferences, the interpretation of federal and state income tax laws, and a determination of the differences between the \ntax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates \nand interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities. \nUnder GAAP, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is “more likely than not” that the deferred \ntax asset will not be realized. The determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and \ndependent upon judgment concerning management’s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, the forecasts of \nfuture income, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of the current and future economic and business \nconditions. \nIn preparation of the income tax returns, tax positions are taken based on interpretation of federal and state \nincome tax laws. Management periodically reviews and evaluates the status of uncertain tax positions and makes \nestimates of amounts ultimately due or owed. The Company can recognize in financial statements the impact of a tax \nposition taken, or expected to be taken, if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit based on \nthe technical merit of the position. The Company recognizes both interest and penalties as a component of other \nnoninterest expense. \nThe amount of the uncertain tax positions was not deemed to be material. It is not expected that the \nunrecognized tax benefit will be material within the next 12 months. The Company did not recognize any interest or \npenalties for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \nThe Company is no longer subject to federal or state tax examination by tax authorities for years ending before \nDecember 31, 2019."

These investments are included in other assets on the balance sheet, \nwith any unfunded commitments included within other liabilities. The qualified affordable housing projects are \naccounted for under the proportional amortization method. Under the proportional amortization method, the initial cost \nof the investment is recognized over the period that the Company expects to receive the tax credits, with the expense \nincluded within income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income. The historic tax credits are accounted for \nunder the equity method, with the expense included within noninterest expense on the consolidated statements of \nincome. Management analyzes these investments for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances \nindicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of the investment will not be realized. An impairment \nloss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its fair value. \nComprehensive Income  \nRecognized revenue, expenses, gains, and losses are included in net income. Certain changes in assets and \nliabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and changes in the fair value of derivative \ninstruments designated as a cash flow hedge, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the \nconsolidated balance sheets, such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income. \nDerivative Financial Instruments \nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments, which consist of interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, \nto assist in its interest rate risk management. All derivatives are measured and reported at fair value on the Company’s \nconsolidated balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or \nlosses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging \nrelationship. If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative \ninstrument are recognized in earnings, specifically in noninterest income.  \nThe Company enters into interest rate swaps to facilitate client transactions and meet their financing needs. \nUpon entering into these instruments to meet client needs, the Company enters into offsetting positions with large U.S. \nand international financial institutions in order to minimize the risk to the Company. These swaps are derivatives, but are \nnot designated as hedging instruments.  \nCash flow hedges represent a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or \npaid related to a recognized asset or liability. The Company prepares written hedge documentation for all derivatives \nwhich are designed as hedges. The written hedge documentation includes identification of, among other items, the risk \nmanagement objective, hedging instrument, hedged item and methodologies for assessing and measuring hedge \neffectiveness and ineffectiveness, along with support for management's assertion that the hedge will be highly effective. \nAssessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of hedge ineffectiveness are performed at least quarterly. For a \ncash flow hedge that is effective, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component in other comprehensive \nincome (loss) and is reclassified into earnings in the same periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. \nThe changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not highly effective in hedging the changes in expected cash flows of \nthe hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings. To determine fair value, the Company uses third party \npricing models that incorporate assumptions about market conditions and risks that are current at the reporting date. The \nCompany does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. \nNet cash settlements on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in interest income or interest \nexpense, based on the item being hedged. Net cash settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting \nare reported in noninterest income."

When hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the \nderivative are recorded as noninterest income.  When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or \nforecasted transaction is still expected to occur, changes in value that were accumulated in other comprehensive income \nare amortized or accreted into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will affect earnings. \n Stock-based Compensation \nThe Company’s stock-based compensation plans provide for awards of stock options, restricted stock awards \nand restricted stock units to the Company’s directors, officers and employees. The cost of employee services received in \nexchange for awards of equity instruments is based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. Compensation cost is \nrecognized over the requisite service period as a component of compensation expense. Compensation cost is recognized \non a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. \nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market price of the \nCompany’s common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. \nCompensating Balances \nThe Bank is required to maintain average balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. The Bank has implemented \na deposit reclassification program which allows the Bank to reclassify a portion of transaction accounts to nontransaction \naccounts for reserve purposes. The deposit reclassification program was provided by a third-party vendor, and has been \napproved by the Federal Reserve Bank. Generally, the Company is required to maintain average reserve balances with \nthe Federal Reserve Bank based upon outstanding balances of deposit transaction accounts. However, as announced on \nMarch 15, 2020, The Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent, effective March 26, \n2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no reserve requirements \nwith the Federal Reserve Bank.   \nEarnings per Share \nBasic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by \nthe weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings common per share are \ncalculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock \ncompensation using the treasury stock method. \nSegment Reporting \nAll of the Company’s operations are considered by management to be one operating segment. \nReclassifications \nCertain reclassifications have been made to the 2021 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2022 \nclassifications. \nImpact of Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance \nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Among other things, ASU 2016-02 \nrequires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet, thus increasing reported assets and liabilities. Lessor \naccounting remains substantially similar to historical GAAP. The FASB has issued incremental guidance to Topic 842 \nstandard through ASU No. 2018-10, 2018-11, and 2021-05. The Company has elected to use the additional transition \nmethod approach as provided in ASU 2018-11, which permits the Company to use January 1, 2022 as both the \napplication date and the adoption date. The Company also elected certain relief options offered within the new standard, \nwhich include the package of practical expedients, the option not to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability that arise"

The Company has several lease agreements \nfor its bank branches and corporate office space, which are considered operating leases, and therefore, were not \npreviously recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. As of January 1, 2022, the Company recorded a \nROU asset and corresponding lease liability for all applicable operating leases. While the guidance increased the \nCompany’s gross assets and liabilities, the adoption of ASU 2016-02 did not have a material impact on the Company's \nconsolidated financial statements. See “Note 8 –Leases” for more information. \n \nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects \nof Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying \ngenerally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the \nLondon Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, or another reference rate expected to be discontinued, if certain criteria are \nmet. The standard was elective and provided optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, \nhedging relationships, or other transactions that reference LIBOR, or another reference rate expected to be \ndiscontinued. The amendments in the update were effective for all entities between March 12, 2020 and December 31, \n2022. The Company has discontinued the use of new LIBOR-based loans and interest rate derivatives, according to \nregulatory guidelines. LIBOR is used as an index rate for the Company’s interest-rate swaps, various investment \nsecurities, and approximately 1.1% of the Company’s loans as of December 31, 2022. The Company adopted ASU \n2020-04 on January 1, 2022. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial \nstatements. In December 2022, The FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the \nSunset Date of Topic 848. This ASU extends the period of time preparers can utilize the reference rate reform relief \nguidance provided by ASU 2020-04. This ASU, which was effective upon issuance, defers the sunset date of this prior \nguidance from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the \nrelief guidance in Topic 848. The adoption of ASU 2022-06 did not have a material impact on the Company’s \nconsolidated financial statements. \n \nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards \nThe following ASUs have been issued by FASB and may impact the Company’s consolidated financial \nstatements in future reporting periods. \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (modified by ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to \nTopic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial \nInstruments Credit Losses, ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments Credit Losses – Targeted Transition Relief, and ASU \n2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses). The amendments in this \nASU affect all entities that measure credit losses on financial instruments including loans, debt securities, trade \nreceivables, net investments in leases, off-balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other \nfinancial asset that has a contractual right to receive cash that is not specifically excluded. The main objective of this \nASU is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on \nfinancial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To \nachieve this objective, the amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology required in \ncurrent GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses that requires consideration of a broader range of \nreasonable and supportable information to estimate credit losses. The amendments in this ASU will affect entities to \nvarying degrees depending on the credit quality of the assets held by the entity, the duration of the assets held, and how \nthe entity applies the current incurred loss methodology. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial \nInstruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (815), and Leases (Topic 842) – Effective Dates. \nThis ASU amended the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for smaller reporting companies and non-SEC reporting entities. \nThe amendment delays the effective date to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods \nwithin those fiscal years. As an emerging growth company, the Company has taken advantage of this delay."

The implementation process included establishing a \ncross function committee to oversee the adoption of the ASU and contracting with a third party to develop a model to \ncomply with the CECL requirements. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company will finalize all internal processes \nrelated to the adoption of CECL. Upon finalization of internal processes, the Company will recognize a one-time \ncumulative effect adjustment to equity, using the modified retrospective transition method. The Company expects the \ninitial increase to the allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, will not have a \nmaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements. The initial increase to the allowance for credit losses is \nexpected to be substantially attributable to the allowance for unfunded commitments.

At December 31, 2021, 199 debt securities had unrealized losses with \naggregate depreciation of approximately 2.1% from the Company’s amortized cost basis. These unrealized losses related \nprincipally to changes in interest rates and were not due to changes in the financial condition of the issuer, the quality of \nany underlying assets, or applicable credit enhancements. In analyzing whether unrealized losses on debt securities are \nother than temporary, management considers whether the securities are issued by a government body or agency, whether \na rating agency has downgraded the securities, industry analysts’ reports, the financial condition and performance of the \nissuer, and the quality of any underlying assets or credit enhancements. Since management has the ability and intent to \nhold these debt securities for the foreseeable future, no declines were deemed to be other than temporary as of \nDecember 31, 2022. \nThe following table presents a summary of amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities by the \nlesser of expected call date or contractual maturity as of December 31, 2022. Call date is used when a call of the debt \nsecurity is expected, determined by the Company when the security has a market value above its amortized cost."

These leases were not previously recognized on the Company's consolidated \nfinancial statements. With the adoption of ASU 2016-02, operating lease agreements were required to be recognized on \nthe consolidated balance sheets as a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability. The Company’s lease agreements \noften include one or more options to renew at the Company’s discretion. If at lease inception, the Company considers the \nexercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of \nthe ROU asset and lease liability.  \nOperating lease ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset during the lease term and \noperating lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets \nand operating lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of the remaining lease \npayments using the rate implicit in the lease. As the rate implicit in the lease is rarely determinable, the Company uses its \nincremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to calculate the present value of lease payments. The Company's \nincremental borrowing rate is based on the FHLB amortizing advance rate, adjusted for the lease term and other factors. \nFor operating leases existing prior to January 1, 2022, the rate for the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2022 was \nused. \nAs the Company elected not to separate lease and non-lease components and instead to account for them as a \nsingle lease component, the variable lease cost primarily represents variable payments such as common area \nmaintenance, property taxes and other costs associated with the lease. These variable payments are not included in the \nlease liability and are expensed as incurred. \nThe following table presents the components of lease expense and cash flow information related to operating \nleases as of the period indicated: \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 31,  \n(dollars in thousands) \n \n2022 \nOperating Lease Cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n $ \n 538 \nVariable Lease Cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n  \n 253 \nTotal Lease Cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n $ \n 791 \n \nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, rent expense, net of rental income, including common area maintenance \npertaining to banking premises totaled $52,000 and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020."

The notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. \nThe amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual \nagreements. Derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value in other assets or other liabilities. The accounting \nfor changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging \nrelationship. For derivatives not designated as hedges, the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings. \nNon-hedge Derivatives \nThe Company enters into interest rate swaps to facilitate client transactions and meet their financing needs. \nUpon entering into these instruments to meet client needs, the Company enters into offsetting positions with large U.S. \nfinancial institutions in order to minimize the risk to the Company. These swaps are derivatives, but are not designated \nas hedging instruments.  \nInterest rate swap contracts involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet contractual \nterms. When the fair value of a derivative instrument contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counter party \nor client owes the Company, and results in credit risk to the Company. When the fair value of a derivative instrument \ncontract is negative, the Company owes the client or counterparty and therefore, the Company has no credit risk.  \nThe following table presents a summary of the Company’s interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions \nas of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 31, 2022 \n \nDecember 31, 2021 \n \n \nNotional \n \nEstimated \n \nNotional \n \nEstimated \n(dollars in thousands) \n \nAmount \n \nFair Value  \nAmount \n \nFair Value \nInterest rate swap agreements: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAssets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   \n$ \n 65,315  \n$ \n 8,240  \n$ \n 49,101  \n$ \n 641 \nLiabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   \n  \n 65,315  \n  \n (8,240) \n  \n 49,101  \n  \n (641)\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   \n$ \n 130,630  \n$ \n —  \n$ \n 98,202  \n$ \n — \n \nCash Flow Hedging Derivatives \nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the aggregate fair value of the \nderivative instrument is recorded in other assets or other liabilities with any gain or loss related to changes in fair value \nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The gain or loss is reclassified into earnings in \nthe same period during which the hedged asset or liability affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement \nline item as the earnings effect of the hedged asset or liability. The Company utilizes cash flow hedges to manage \ninterest rate risk. During the next 12 months, the Company estimates that $5.2 million will be reclassified to interest \nexpense, as a reduction of the expense."

These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in \nexcess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. \nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual, or notional, amount of these \ncommitments. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet \ninstruments. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon and some of the \ncommitments may not be drawn upon to the total extent of the commitment, the notional amount of these commitments \ndoes not necessarily represent future cash requirements."

Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other \ntermination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is \nbased on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable; \ninventory; property, plant, and equipment; real estate; and stocks and bonds. Unfunded commitments under commercial \nlines of credit, home equity lines of credit, and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future \nextensions of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit may or may not require collateral and may or may not \ncontain a specific maturity date. \nStandby letters of credit are conditional lending commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the \nperformance of a customer to a third party. Generally, all standby letters of credit issued have expiration dates within \ntwo years. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in \nextending loan facilities to customers. The Company generally holds collateral supporting these commitments. \nThe Company had outstanding letters of credit with the FHLB in total amounts of $78.4 million and $36.5 \nmillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on behalf of customers and to secure public deposits. \nLegal Contingencies \nVarious legal claims arise from time to time in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, \nany liability resulting from such proceedings would not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. \n \nNote 17: Stock Options and Restricted Stock  \nThe Company established the Bridgewater Bancshares, Inc. 2012 Combined Incentive and Non-Statutory Stock \nOption Plan (the “2012 Plan”) under which the Company may grant options to its directors, officers, and employees for \nup to 750,000 shares of common stock. Both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options could be granted \nunder the 2012 Plan. The exercise price of each option equals the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the date \nof grant and the maximum term of each outstanding option is ten years. All outstanding options have been granted with \nvesting periods of four or five years. The 2012 Plan expired in March 2022, and awards are no longer able to be granted \nunder the 2012 Plan.  \nIn 2017, the Company adopted the Bridgewater Bancshares, Inc. 2017 Combined Incentive and Non-Statutory \nStock Option Plan (the “2017 Plan”). Under the 2017 Plan, the Company may grant options to its directors, officers, and \nemployees and consultants for up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock. Both incentive stock options and nonqualified \nstock options may be granted under the 2017 Plan. The exercise price of each option equals the fair market value of the \nCompany’s stock on the date of grant and the maximum term of each outstanding option is ten years. All outstanding \noptions have been granted with vesting periods of four or five years. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were \n44,700 and 294,700 shares, respectively, of the Company’s common stock reserved for future option grants under the \n2017 Plan.  \nIn 2019, the Company adopted the Bridgewater Bancshares, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 EIP”). \nThe types of awards which may be granted under the 2019 EIP include incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock \nappreciation rights, stock awards, restricted stock units, restricted stock and cash incentive awards.

The exercise price of each option equals the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the date of \ngrant and the maximum term of each award is ten years. All outstanding awards have been granted with vesting periods \nof four years.

Expected volatilities are based on an industry \nindex as described below. The expected term of options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of \ntime that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes into account that the options are not transferable. \nThe risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the \ntime of the grant. Historically, the Company has not paid a dividend on its common stock and does not expect to do so in \nthe near future. \nThe Company used the S&P 600 CM Bank Index as its historical volatility index. The S&P 600 CM Bank \nIndex is an index of publicly traded small capitalization, regional, commercial banks located throughout the United \nStates. There were 51 banks in the index ranging in market capitalization from $500 million up to $4.0 billion. \nThe weighted average assumptions used in the model for valuing stock option grants in 2022 is as follows: \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 31,  \n \n \n     \n2022 \n     \nDividend Yield . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    \n — %   \nExpected Life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    \n 7 Years \nExpected Volatility . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    \n 24.71 %   \nRisk-Free Interest Rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    \n 1.70 %   \n \nThe following table presents a summary of the status of the Company’s outstanding stock options for the years \nended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 31, 2022 \n \nDecember 31, 2021 \n \n    \n     \n    \nWeighted     \n     \n     Weighted \n \n \n \n \nAverage \n \n \n \nAverage \n \n \nShares \n Exercise Price \nShares \n Exercise Price\nOutstanding at Beginning of Year . . . . . .     1,768,745  $ \n 7.67    1,914,250  $ \n 7.29 \nGranted . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    \n 290,000    \n 17.50   \n 20,500   \n 16.88 \nExercised . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Company contributions to the plan vest on the fourth \nanniversary of the last day of the calendar year for which the contribution was made to the plan and accrue interest at a \nrate equal to the Bank’s return on average equity for the immediately preceding calendar year, or an alternative rate set \nby the Company’s board of directors. Distribution of amounts contributed under the plan, including accrued interest, is \nmade in a lump sum cash payment within 75 days following the date such amounts become vested. As of December 31, \n2022 and 2021, the Company had a liability of $1.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively, recorded on the consolidated \nbalance sheets. There were no new contributions made to the plan during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n \nNote 20: Preferred Stock \nOn August 17, 2021, the Company announced the closing of its underwritten public offering of 2,400,000 \ndepositary shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of the Company’s 5.875% Non-Cumulative Perpetual \nPreferred Stock, Series A, $0.01 par value per share (“Series A Preferred Stock”). On August 20, 2021, the underwriters \nof the offering exercised in full their option to purchase 360,000 additional depositary shares to cover over-allotments. \nAs a result, the gross proceeds from the offering totaled $69.0 million. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will be \nnon-cumulative and, if declared, accrue and are payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate of 5.875% per annum. The \nSeries A Preferred Stock qualifies as additional Tier 1 capital for the purposes of the regulatory capital calculations. The \nnet proceeds from the issuance and sale of the depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in our \nSeries A Preferred Stock, after deducting $2.5 million of issuance costs, including the underwriting discount and \nprofessional service fees, were $66.5 million. \n \nNote 21: Regulatory Capital \nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory requirements administered by federal banking \nagencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional \ndiscretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial \nstatements. Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that \ninvolve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory \naccounting practices. The Bank must also meet certain specific capital guidelines under the regulatory framework for \nprompt corrective action. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the \nregulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. \nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and Bank to \nmaintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted \nassets and of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (referred to as the “leverage ratio”), as defined under the \napplicable regulatory capital rules."

The fair value hierarchy gives the \nhighest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to \nunobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used in the determination of the fair value measurement fall within different \nlevels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value"

Assets and liabilities valued at fair value are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as \nfollows: \nLevel 1 – Inputs that utilized quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that \nthe Company has the ability to access. \nLevel 2 – Inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are \nobservable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial \ninstruments. Fair values for these instruments are estimated using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar \ncharacteristics, or discounted cash flows. \nLevel 3 – Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own \nassumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. \nSubsequent to initial recognition, the Company may re-measure the carrying value of assets and liabilities \nmeasured on a nonrecurring basis to fair value. Adjustments to fair value usually result when certain assets are impaired. \nSuch assets are written down from their carrying amounts to their fair value. \nProfessional standards allow entities the irrevocable option to elect to measure certain financial instruments and \nother items at fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The Company \nadopted the policy to value certain financial instruments at fair value. The Company has not elected to measure any \nexisting financial instruments at fair value; however, it may elect to measure newly acquired financial instruments at fair \nvalue in the future. \nRecurring Basis \nThe Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and \nto determine fair value disclosures.

These models are primarily industry-standard models that \nconsider various assumptions, including time value, yield curve, volatility factors, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss \nseverity, current market, and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as other relevant \neconomic measures. Substantially, all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace and can be derived from \nobservable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Fair values \nfrom these models are verified, where possible, against quoted market prices for recent trading activity of assets with \nsimilar characteristics to the security being valued. Such methods are generally classified as Level 2. However, when \nprices from independent sources vary, or cannot be obtained or corroborated, a security is generally classified as Level 3. \nInterest Rate Caps \nThe fair value of the caps are calculated by determining the total expected asset or liability exposure of the \nderivatives. Total expected exposure incorporates both the current and potential future exposure of the derivative, \nderived from using observable inputs, such as yield curves and volatilities, and accordingly are valued using Level 2 \ninputs. \nInterest Rate Swaps \nInterest rate swaps are traded in over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. \nFor those interest rate swaps, fair value is determined using internally developed models of a third party that uses \nprimarily market observable inputs, such as yield curves and option volatilities, and accordingly are valued using Level 2 \ninputs. \nNonrecurring Basis \nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are not measured at fair value on \nan ongoing basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is \nevidence of impairment or a change in the amount of previously recognized impairment."

The fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value, market \nvalue of similar debt, or discounted cash flows. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for \nwhich the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceeds the recorded investments in such loans. Impaired \nloans for which an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral require classification in the fair value \nhierarchy. Collateral values are estimated using Level 2 inputs based on customized discounting criteria. \nImpairment amounts on impaired loans represent specific valuation allowance and write-downs during the \nperiod presented on impaired loans that were individually evaluated for impairment based on the estimated fair value of \nthe collateral less estimated selling costs, excluding impaired loans fully charged-off. \nFair Value \nDisclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate that \nvalue, is required whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. In cases where quoted market prices are \nnot available, fair values are based on estimates using present value of cash flow or other valuation techniques. Those \ntechniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimate of future cash \nflows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, \nin many cases could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. Certain financial instruments with a fair \nvalue that is not practicable to estimate and all non-financial instruments are excluded from the disclosure requirements. \nAccordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not necessarily represent the underlying value of the \nCompany. \nFair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information \nabout the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for \nsale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular instrument. Because no market exists for a significant \nportion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected \nloss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. \nThese estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters that could affect the estimates. Fair value \nestimates are based on existing on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of \nanticipated future business. Deposits with no stated maturities are defined as having a fair value equivalent to the amount"

      "text": "Bridgewater Bancshares, Inc. and Subsidiaries \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n(dollars in thousands, except share data) \n \n126 \nThe following methods and assumptions were used by the Company to estimate fair value of consolidated \nfinancial statements not previously discussed. \nCash and due from banks – The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates their fair value. \nBank-owned certificates of deposit – Fair values of bank-owned certificates of deposit are estimated using the \ndiscounted cash flow analysis based on current rates for similar types of deposits. \nFHLB stock – The carrying amount of FHLB stock approximates its fair value. \nLoans, Net – Fair values for loans are estimated based on discounted cash flows, using interest rates currently \nbeing offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers with similar credit quality. \nAccrued interest receivable – The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value \nsince it is short term in nature and does not present anticipated credit concerns. \nDeposits – The fair values disclosed for demand deposits without stated maturities (interest and noninterest \ntransaction, savings, and money market accounts) are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (their \ncarrying amounts). Fair values for the fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow \ncalculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly \nmaturities on time deposits. \nFederal Funds Purchased – The carrying amount of federal funds purchased approximates the fair value. \nNotes payable and subordinated debentures – The fair values of the Company’s notes payable and subordinated \ndebentures are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing \nrate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. \nFHLB advances – The fair values of the Company’s FHLB advances are estimated using discounted cash flow \nanalysis based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing agreements. \nAccrued interest payable – The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value since it \nis short term in nature. \nOff-balance sheet instruments – Fair values of the Company’s off-balance sheet instruments (lending \ncommitments and unused lines of credit) are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into \naccount the remaining terms of the agreements, the counterparties’ credit standing and discounted cash flow analysis. \nThe fair value of these off-balance sheet items approximates the recorded amounts of the related fees and was not \nmaterial at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \nLimitations – The fair value of a financial instrument is the current amount that would be exchanged between \nmarket participants, other than in a forced liquidation. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. \nHowever, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company’s various financial instruments. In cases \nwhere quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation \ntechniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and \nestimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of \nthe instrument. Consequently, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying \nfair value of the Company."

The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods \nor services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for \nthose goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. \nSubstantially all of the Company’s revenue is generated from financial instruments, including interest income \nrelated to loans and investment securities, letters of credit, and derivatives, which are not within the scope of Topic 606 \nas these activities are subject to other GAAP discussed elsewhere within the Company’s disclosures. The following is a \nsummary of revenue-generating activities that are within the scope of Topic 606, which are presented in the Company’s \nincome statements as components of noninterest income: \nService charges on deposit accounts. These represent general service fees for monthly account maintenance and \nactivity and transaction-based fees such as wire transfer fees, check cashing fees, check printing fees, stop payment fees \nand ATM and card replacement fees. Revenue is recognized when the Company’s performance obligation is completed, \nwhich is generally monthly for account maintenance services or when a transaction has been completed. Payments for \nthese performance obligations are generally received at the time the performance obligations are satisfied. The adoption \nof Topic 606 had no impact on the Company’s revenue recognition practice for these services. \nDebit card interchange fees. When a debit card issued by the Company is used to purchase goods or services \nfrom a merchant, the Company earns an interchange fee. The performance obligation is completed and the fees are \nrecognized as the service is provided (i.e., when the customer uses the debit card). The adoption of Topic 606 has no \nimpact on the Company’s revenue recognition related to debit card interchange fees. \nGain on sales of other real estate. ASU 2014-09 also created Topic 610-20, under which a gain on sale should \nbe recognized when a contract for sale exists and control of the asset has been transferred to the buyer. Topic 606 list \nseveral criteria which must exist to conclude that a contract for sale exists, including a determination that the institution \nwill collect substantially all of the consideration to which it is entitled."

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the \ndesign and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as that term is defined in \nRule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022, the end of \nthe fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and \nChief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company’s disclosure controls and \nprocedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or \nsubmits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in \nthe SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief \nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n \nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public \naccounting firm. As an emerging growth company, management’s report on internal control over financial reporting was \nnot subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with the JOBS \nAct.  \n \nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over \nfinancial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Company’s internal \ncontrol system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of \nDirectors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. \n \nInternal control over financial reporting of the Company includes those policies and procedures that pertain to \nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the Company; \nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being \nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and provide reasonable \nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s \nassets that could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. \n \nBecause of inherent limitations in any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, misstatements \ndue to error or fraud may occur and not be detected, including the possibility of the circumvention or overriding of \ncontrols. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance \nwith respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness \nmay vary over time. \n \nManagement assessed the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. This \nassessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the Committee of \nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework in 2013. Based on \nthis assessment, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer assert that the Company maintained effective \ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the specified criteria."
