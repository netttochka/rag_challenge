The Murchison Goldfields are host to a +35Moz gold endowment. Odyssey holds an 80% interest in the \nTuckanarra and Stakewell gold projects (together, the “Tuckanarra Project” or “Project”).  \nFive shallow oxide pits were mined on the Tuckanarra Project in the 1990’s producing 52.9koz at an average grade \nof 3.4g/t gold. Additionally, approximately 29koz were produced at an average grade of 5.5g/t gold from the only \nmodern underground mine on the Projects. The Project is located between Meekatharra and Mount Magnet, \nproximal to multiple gold processing plants, along the Great Northern Highway. \nPrevious resource development and open pit mining was focused on laterite and oxide mineralisation due to low \ngold prices. Odyssey has recognised the potential for significant strike and plunge extensions to the mineralisation. \nDrilling during 2021 demonstrated mineralisation along 1.6km of strike at the Cable Bollard Trend and more recently \na new structure at the Highway Zone. \nOdyssey’s strategy is to continue to rapidly define high grade shoots on the Highway Zone structure, in addition to \nthe 300m long shoot already identified, with reverse circulation (“RC”) and diamond core (“DD”) drilling. \n \nFigure 1 - Odyssey's land position."

The mineralisation is hosted in \nsheared laminated quartz veins or sulphides associated with banded iron formation (“BIF”) units, within mafic \nintrusives and metavolcanics, and highly silicified ultramafics. Infrequent felsic dykes crosscut the mineralisation. \nThe Cable-Bollard Trend extends for over 1.6km of strike with deepest drilling to a vertical depth of 150m. The \nproject has significant growth potential, with the favourable lithology and historic workings. Drilling along the Cable-\nBollard Trend has identified the 500m of strike length immediately below the 35m deep Cable Pit, and to the south \nto the south of the Cable Pit as one of several significant shoots on the Tuckanarra Project. Similarly, a high grade \nshoot was intersected in several holes beneath the Bollard Pit (Figure 7).

Additional shoots are likely to occur along strike to the \neast, or on parallel structures to the north and south of Bottle Dump. \nMaybelle and Lucknow Trends \nGold mineralisation at Maybelle is associated with steeply dipping sheared sediments that extend for over 1.5km \nalong a line of historical workings. A shallow oxide pit, on the southern 450m of sediment, was predominantly mined \nin the mid 1990’s. \nHistoric drilling at Maybelle was typically less than 60m in depth. Prior to the recent drilling campaign, only one hole \nwas drilled deeper than 100m below surface. Mining was to a maximum of 26m below surface. \nOre treated from mining at Maybelle up to 1904 is reported as ~554t @ 5.7g/t Au for 103oz produced. Subsequent \nopen pit mining to a depth of ~30m in the early 1990’s produced 52kt @ 3.6g/t Au for 6,020oz before mining was \nhalted as the ore started to transition to primary sulphides. Metallurgical test work completed in 1994 on composites \nfrom fresh sulphide mineralisation recovered over 98% of gold in fresh rock. \nRC drilling completed during the period demonstrated the continuity of multiple shoots down dip of shallow oxide \nmineralisation along 1.5km of strike of the Maybelle Trend. The RC program was completed on an 80x40m spacing \ndown plunge of the historic rotary air blast (“RAB”) and shallow RC drilling. A total of 28 RC holes for 3,645m was \ncompleted. The most notable is a result of 4m @ 53g/t Au. This hole confirms a steeper plunge of the mineralisation \nshoots, over 100m of vertical continuity of mineralisation (Figure 10), and the potential for higher grade \nmineralisation that can be considered for underground evaluation following additional positive drilling results."

Full compliance with these laws and regulations is regarded as a minimum standard for all operations \nto achieve. \nInstances of environmental non-compliance by an operation are identified either by external compliance audits or \ninspections by relevant government authorities. There have been no significant known breaches by the Group \nduring the financial year.  \nPrincipal Activities \nThe principal activities of the Group during the year consisted of the exploration and development of mineral \nresource projects in Western Australia. \nBusiness Strategies and Prospects for Future Financial Years \nThe objective of the Group is to create long-term shareholder value through the acquisition and development of \ntechnically and economically viable mineral deposits.  \nTo date, the Group has not commenced production of any minerals, nor has it identified a Mineral Resource in \naccordance with the JORC Code. To achieve its objective, the Group currently intends over the medium term to \nconduct further exploration activities including field work to follow up targets identified at the Tuckanarra and \nStakewell Gold Projects.  \nThese activities are inherently risky and the Board is unable to provide certainty of the expected results of these \nactivities, or that any or all of these likely developments will be achieved.  \nThe material business risks faced by the Group that could have an effect on the Group’s future prospects, and how \nthe Group manages these risks include: \n• \nThe Group’s exploration programmes may not identify an economic deposit - The Group’s Projects \nare at an early stage of exploration and current/potential investors should understand that mineral \nexploration, development and mining are high-risk enterprises, only occasionally providing high rewards. \nThe success of the Group depends, among other things, on successful exploration and/or acquisition of \nreserves, securing and maintaining title to tenements and consents, successful design, construction, \ncommissioning and operating of mining and processing facilities, successful development and production \nin accordance with forecasts and successful management of the operations. Exploration and mining \nactivities may also be hampered by force majeure circumstances, land claims and unforeseen mining \nproblems. There is no assurance that exploration and development of the mineral interests owned by the \nGroup, or any other projects that may be acquired in the future, will result in the discovery of mineral \ndeposits which are capable of being exploited economically. Even if an apparently viable deposit is \nidentified, there is no guarantee that it can be profitably exploited. If such commercial viability is never \nattained, the Group may seek to transfer its property interests or otherwise realise value, or the Group may \neven be required to abandon its business and fail as a “going concern”;"

      "text": "DIRECTORS' REPORT \n(Continued) \n \n16 \n \nOPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued) \nBusiness Strategies and Prospects for Future Financial Years (continued) \n• \nThe Group’s exploration activities being delayed due to lack of available equipment and services - \nThe exploration activities of the Group requires the involvement of a number of third parties, including \ndrilling contractors, assay laboratories, consultants, other contractors and suppliers. Demand for drilling \nequipment and exploration related services in Western Australia is currently very high and has resulted in \nhigher exploration costs, delays in completing the Group’s exploration activities, and delays in the \nassessment and reporting of the results. Should there continue to be high demand for exploration \nequipment and related services, there may be further delays in undertaking exploration activities, which \nmay result in increased exploration costs and/or increased working capital requirements for the Group and \nmay have a material impact on the Group’s operations and performance; \n• \nThe Group’s operations will require further capital – the exploration and any development of the \nGroup’s exploration properties will require substantial additional financing. Failure to obtain sufficient \nfinancing may result in delaying, or the indefinite postponement of, exploration and any development of \nthe Group’s properties or even a loss of property interest. There can be no assurance that additional capital \nor other types of financing will be available if needed or that, if available, the terms of such financing will \nbe favourable to the Group; \n• \nThe Group may be adversely affected by fluctuations in commodity prices – the price of commodities \nfluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the control of the Group. Future production, \nif any, from the Group’s mineral properties will be dependent upon the price of commodities being \nadequate to make these properties economic. The Group currently does not engage in any hedging or \nderivative transactions to manage commodity price risk. As the Group’s operations change, this policy will \nbe reviewed periodically going forward; and \n• \nGlobal financial conditions may adversely affect the Group’s growth and profitability – many \nindustries, including the mineral resource industry, are impacted by these market conditions.  Some of the \nkey impacts include contraction in credit markets resulting in a widening of credit risk, devaluations and \nhigh volatility in global equity, commodity, foreign exchange and precious metal markets, and a lack of \nmarket liquidity. Due to the current nature of the Group’s activities, a slowdown in the financial markets or \nother economic conditions may adversely affect the Group’s growth and ability to finance its activities."

The Board believes that \nthis remuneration policy is appropriate given the considerations discussed in the section above and is appropriate \nin aligning KMP objectives with shareholder and business objectives. \nFixed Remuneration \nFixed remuneration consists of base salary, as well as employer contributions to superannuation funds and other \nnon-cash benefits. \nFixed remuneration is reviewed annually by the Board (if applicable). The process consists of a review of company \nand individual performance, relevant comparative remuneration externally and internally and, where appropriate, \nexternal advice on policies and practices. \nPerformance Based Remuneration – Short Term Incentive (“STI”) \nSome executives may be entitled to an annual cash bonus upon achieving various key performance indicators \n(“KPI’s”), as set by the Board.  Having regard to the current size, nature and opportunities of the Group, the Board \nhas determined that these KPI’s will include measures such as:  \n• \nsuccessful exploration activities (e.g. completion of exploration programs within budgeted timeframes and \ncosts); \n• \nsuccessful development activities (e.g. completion of technical studies);  \n• \nsuccessful corporate activities (e.g. recruitment and management of key personnel and investor relations \nactivities); and  \n• \nsuccessful business development activities (e.g. corporate transactions and capital raisings)."

      "text": "DIRECTORS' REPORT \n(Continued) \n \n22 \n \nREMUNERATION REPORT – AUDITED (Continued) \nExecutive Remuneration (Continued) \nThese measures were chosen as the Board believes these represent the key drivers in the short and medium term \nsuccess of the Group’s development. On an annual basis, subsequent to year end, the Board assesses \nperformance against each individual executive’s KPI criteria and considers the position of the Group to be able to \naward STI cash bonuses. \nDuring the 2022 financial year, no STI cash bonuses were awarded to KMP (2021: nil).  \nPerformance Based Remuneration – Long Term Incentive Plan \nThe Group has a long-term equity incentive plan (“Incentive Plan”) comprising the grant of Performance Rights \nand/or Incentive Options to reward KMP and key employees and contractors for long-term performance. To achieve \nits corporate objectives, the Group needs to attract, incentivise, and retain its key employees and contractors. The \nBoard believes that grants of Performance Rights and/or Incentive Options to KMP will provide a useful tool to \nunderpin the Group's employment and engagement strategy. \n(i)  \nPerformance Rights \nThe Group has an Incentive Plan that provides for the issuance of unlisted performance share rights (“Performance \nRights”) which, upon satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions attached to the Performance Rights, will \nresult in the issue of an Ordinary Share for each Performance Right. Performance Rights are issued for no \nconsideration and no amount is payable upon conversion thereof. \nThe Incentive Plan enables the Group to: (a) recruit, incentivise and retain KMP and other key employees and \ncontractors needed to achieve the Group's business objectives; (b) link the reward of key staff with the achievement \nof strategic goals and the long-term performance of the Group; (c) align the financial interest of participants of the \nPlan with those of Shareholders; and (d) provide incentives to participants of the Incentive Plan to focus on superior \nperformance that creates Shareholder value. \nPerformance Rights granted under the Incentive Plan to eligible participants will be linked to the achievement by \nthe Group of certain performance conditions as determined by the Board from time to time. These performance \nconditions must be satisfied in order for the Performance Rights to vest. Upon Performance Rights vesting, Ordinary \nShares are automatically issued for no consideration. If a performance condition of a Performance Right is not \nachieved by the expiry date then the Performance Right will lapse. \nDuring the financial year ended 30 June 2022, 8,400,000 Performance Rights were granted to KMP (2021: nil). No \nPerformance Rights held by KMP lapsed during the financial year nor did any convert into ordinary shares.  \n(ii)  \nIncentive Options \nThe Group has an Incentive Plan that provides for the issuance of unlisted incentive options (“Incentive Options”) \nas part of remuneration and incentive arrangements in order to attract and retain services and to provide an \nincentive linked to the performance of the Group. The Board’s policy is to grant Incentive Options to KMP with \nexercise prices at or above market share price (at the time of agreement). As such, the Incentive Options granted \nto KMP are generally only of benefit if the KMP performs to the level whereby the value of the Group increases \nsufficiently to warrant exercising the Incentive Options granted. Other than service-based vesting conditions (if any) \nand the exercise price required to exercise the Incentive Options, there are no additional performance criteria on \nthe Incentive Options granted to KMP, as given the speculative nature of the Group’s activities and the small \nmanagement team responsible for its running, it is considered that the performance of the KMP and the performance \nand value of the Group are closely related. The Company’s Securities Trading Policy prohibits KMP’s from entering \ninto arrangements to limit their exposure to Incentive Securities granted as part of their remuneration package.  \nDuring the financial year ended 30 June 2022, 2,000,000 Incentive Options were granted to KMP (2021: \n27,000,000). No Incentive Options held by KMP expired during the financial year nor were any exercised into \nordinary shares."

      "text": "Odyssey Gold Limited    ANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n23 \nRemuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors \nThe Board’s policy is to remunerate Non-Executive Directors at market rates for comparable companies for time, \ncommitment and responsibilities. Given the current size, nature and risks of the Group, incentive securities have \nbeen used to attract and retain Non-Executive Directors.  The Board determines payments to the Non-Executive \nDirectors and reviews their remuneration annually, based on market practice, duties and accountability. \nIndependent external advice is sought when required.  \nThe maximum aggregate amount of fees that can be paid to Non-Executive Directors is subject to approval by \nshareholders at a General Meeting. Total directors' fees paid to all non-executive directors are not to exceed \n$150,000 per annum. Director's fees paid to Non-Executive Directors accrue on a daily basis. Fees for Non-\nExecutive Directors are not linked to the performance of the economic entity. However, to align Directors' interests \nwith shareholder interests, the Directors are encouraged to hold shares in the Company and Non-Executive \nDirectors may in limited circumstances receive incentive securities in order to secure their services. \nFees for the Chairman are presently $36,000 per annum (2021: $36,000) and fees for other Non-Executive Directors \nare presently $25,000 (2021: $20,000-$36,000). These fees cover main board activities only. Non-Executive \nDirectors may receive additional remuneration for other services provided to the Group, including but not limited to, \nmembership of committees.  \nRelationship between Remuneration of KMP and Shareholder Wealth \nDuring the Group’s project identification, acquisition, exploration and development phases of its business, the Board \nanticipates that the Group will retain earnings (if any) and other cash resources for the exploration and development \nof its resource projects. Accordingly the Group does not currently have a policy with respect to the payment of \ndividends and returns of capital. Therefore there is no relationship between the Board’s policy for determining the \nnature and amount of remuneration of KMP and dividends paid and returns of capital by the Group during the \ncurrent and previous four financial years. \nThe Board did not determine the nature and amount of remuneration of the KMP by reference to changes in the \nprice at which shares in the Group traded between the beginning and end of the current financial year. Discretionary \nannual cash bonuses, when applicable, will be based on achieving various non-financial key performance indicators \nto be determined by the Board.  However, as noted above, KMP’s may receive Incentive Securities which generally \nwill only be of value should the value of the Company’s shares increase sufficiently to warrant exercising the \nIncentive Securities. \nRelationship between Remuneration of KMP and Earnings \nAs discussed above, the Group is currently undertaking new project acquisition, exploration and development \nactivities, and does not expect to be undertaking profitable operations (other than by way of material asset sales, \nnone of which is currently planned) until sometime after the successful commercialisation, production and sales of \ncommodities from one or more of its projects. Accordingly the Board does not consider earnings during the current \nand previous four financial years when determining the nature and amount of remuneration of KMP."

      "text": "NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE \n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 \n \n34 \n \n1. \nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \nThe principal and significant accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial report of the Company, Odyssey \nGold Limited and its consolidated entities (“Group”) for the year ended 30 June 2022 are stated to assist in a general \nunderstanding of the financial report.  \nOdyssey Gold Limited is a company limited by shares incorporated in Australia whose shares are quoted on the \nAustralian Securities Exchange. The financial report of the Company for the year ended 30 June 2022 was \nauthorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 20 September 2022. \n(a) \nBasis of Preparation \nThe financial report is a general purpose financial report which has been prepared in accordance with Australian \nAccounting Standards (“AASBs”) and interpretations adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board \n(“AASB”) and the Corporations Act 2001. The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements \nof the Group. For the purposes of preparing the consolidated statements, the Company is a for-profit entity. The \nconsolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the continuity of \nnormal business activity and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of \nbusiness. The financial report has also been prepared on a historical cost basis. \nThe financial report is presented in Australian dollars. \n(b) \nGoing Concern \nThis consolidated financial report has been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes continuity of \nnormal business activities and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of \nbusiness.  \nThe Group has incurred a loss after tax of $9,538,268 (2021: $4,372,043) and had net cash outflows from operating \nand investing activities of $9,165,046 (2021: $7,611,009). The Group has no source of cash inflows other than \ninterest income and funds sourced through capital raising activities. At 30 June 2022, the Group has cash and cash \nequivalents totalling $3,480,120 (30 June 2021: $12,689,470) and net working capital (current assets less current \nliabilities) of $877,909 (30 June 2021: $11,282,642).  \nThe Group’s cashflow forecast for the period ending 30 September 2023 reflects that the Group will be required to \nraise additional working capital. The Directors consider the Group a going concern and acknowledge that \ndiscretionary expenditure will be monitored and managed in line with available funds until such time as additional \ncapital raising activities are completed.  \nAfter year end, the Company announced that it will undertake a non-renounceable entitlements offer (“Entitlements \nOffer”) to raise up to $4.6 million before costs. Under the Entitlements Offer, eligible shareholders will be offered \nthe opportunity to purchase one (1) new fully paid ordinary share in the Company (“New Shares”) for every four (4) \nfully paid ordinary shares held at the record date, at an issue price of $0.03 per New Share. The Directors and \nOfficers of the Company have agreed to take up their full entitlements under the Entitlement Offer and also agreed \nto partially underwrite the Entitlement Offer by applying for shortfall shares, up to a combined amount of \napproximately $0.9 million. \nAccordingly, the Directors believe that the Group will be able to obtain sufficient funding to enable it to continue as \na going concern and that it is appropriate to adopt that basis in the preparation of the financial report. However, \nthere is a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt as to whether it will be able to continue as a going \nconcern and therefore, whether it will realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities in the normal course of business \nand at the amounts stated in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not \ninclude any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or to the amounts \nand classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Group not continue as a going concern. \n(c) \nStatement of Compliance \nThe financial report complies with Australian Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards \n(“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.  \nIn the current financial year, the Group has adopted all of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued \nby the AASB that are relevant to its operations and effective for the current annual reporting period however these \nhave resulted in no impact on the financial statements of the Group for the financial year ended 30 June 2022."

Those which \nmay be relevant to the Group are set out in the table below, but these are not expected to have any significant \nimpact on the Group's financial statements: \n(e) \nPrinciples of Consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Odyssey Gold \nLimited (“Company” or “Parent Entity”) as at 30 June 2022 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended.  \nOdyssey Gold Limited and its subsidiaries together are referred to as the Group. \nControl is only achieved when the Group has the power over the investee (i.e. ability to direct relevant activities of \nthe investee), is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and when it has \nthe ability to use its power to affect its returns. When the Group has less than a majority of the voting rights of an \ninvestee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over the \ninvestee, including the size of the Group's holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of \nthe other vote holders, the potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties and any \nrights arising from other contractual arrangements. \nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are \nchanges to one or more of the elements of control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control \nis transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. Intercompany transactions \nand balances, income and expenses and profits and losses between Group companies, are eliminated. The \nfinancial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Parent Entity, using \nconsistent accounting policies. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure \nconsistency with the policies adopted by the Group.   \nProfit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company \nand to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the \nCompany and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit \nbalance. \nInvestments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment in the individual financial statements of the \nCompany. \n(f) \nEarnings per Share (EPS) \nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit/loss attributable to equity holders of the Company, \nexcluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary \nshares outstanding during the year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year. Diluted \nearnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account \nthe after tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the \nweighted average number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive \npotential ordinary shares. \n(g) \nCash and Cash Equivalents \n“Cash and cash equivalents” includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions and other short-\nterm highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an \ninsignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents \nconsist of cash and cash equivalents as defined.  \n \n \nStandard/Interpretation \nApplication Date \nof Standard \nApplication \nDate for Group \nAASB 2020-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Annual \nImprovements 2018–2020 and Other Amendments \n1 January 2022 \n1 July 2022 \nAASB 2020-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Classification of \nLiabilities as Current or Non-Current \n1 January 2023 \n1 July 2023 \n AASB 2020-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Classification of \nLiabilities as Current or Non-Current – Deferral of Effective Date \n1 January 2023 \n1 July 2023 \nAASB 2021-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Disclosure of \nAccounting Policies and Definition of Accounting Estimates \n1 January 2023 \n1 July 2023 \nAASB 2022-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Initial Application of \nAASB 17 and AASB 9 – Comparative Information \n1 January 2023 \n1 July 2023"

This includes start up operations which are yet to earn revenues. Management \nwill also consider other factors in determining operating segments such as the existence of a line manager and the \nlevel of segment information presented to the board of directors. \nOperating segments have been identified based on the information provided to the chief operating decision makers \n– being the Board of Directors. The group aggregates two or more operating segments when they have similar \neconomic characteristics, and the segments are similar in each of the following respects: \n• \nNature of the products and services, \n• \nNature of the production processes, \n• \nType or class of customer for the products and services, \n• \nMethods used to distribute the products or provide the services, and if applicable, \n• \nNature of the regulatory environment. \nOperating segments that meet the quantitative criteria as prescribed by AASB 8 are reported separately. However, \nan operating segment that does not meet the quantitative criteria is still reported separately where information about \nthe segment would be useful to users of the financial statements. Information about other business activities and \noperating segments that are below the quantitative criteria are combined and disclosed in a separate category for \n“all other segments”. \n(i) \nOther Income Recognition \nInterest income is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest method, which is the rate that \nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument) to the net \ncarrying value amount of the financial asset. \n(j) \nIncome Tax \nThe income tax expense for the year is the tax payable on the current year's taxable income based on the national \nincome tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to \ntemporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial \nstatements, and to unused tax losses. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to apply when \nthe assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates which are enacted or substantively \nenacted for each jurisdiction.  The relevant tax rates are applied to the cumulative amounts of deductible and taxable \ntemporary differences to measure the deferred tax asset or liability. An exception is made for certain temporary \ndifferences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability.  No deferred tax asset or liability is recognised \nin relation to these temporary differences if they arose on goodwill or in a transaction, other than a business \ncombination, that at the time of the transaction did not affect either accounting profit or taxable profit or loss. \nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and \ntax bases of investments in controlled entities where the Parent Entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of \nthe temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred \ntax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that \nfuture taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. The carrying amount of \ndeferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable \nthat sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. \nUnrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance date and are recognised to the extent \nthat it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. \nCurrent and deferred tax balances attributable to amounts recognised directly in equity are also recognised directly \nin equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off \ncurrent tax assets against tax liabilities and the deferred tax liabilities relate to the same taxable entity and the same \ntaxation authority. The Parent Entity and its wholly owned Australian controlled entity have implemented the tax \nconsolidation legislation. The head entity within the tax consolidated group is Odyssey Gold Limited. \n(k) \nDividends \nProvision is made for the amount of any dividend declared on or before the end of the year but not distributed at \nbalance date."

      "text": "Odyssey Gold Limited    ANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n37 \n(l) \nImpairment of Non-Financial Assets \nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any \nsuch indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of \nthe asset's recoverable amount.  An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal \nand its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that \nare largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and the asset's value in use cannot be \nestimated to be close to its fair value.  In such cases the asset is tested for impairment as part of the cash-generating \nunit to which it belongs.  When the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable \namount, the asset or cash-generating unit is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. \nIn assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax \ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.  \nImpairment losses relating to continuing operations are recognised in those expense categories consistent with the \nfunction of the impaired asset. An assessment is also made at each reporting date as to whether there is any \nindication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.  If such \nindication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.  A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if \nthere has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last \nimpairment loss was recognised.  If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable \namount.  That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of \ndepreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.  Such reversal is recognised in \nprofit or loss. After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future years to allocate the asset's revised \ncarrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. \n(m) \nProvisions \nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past \nevent, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the \nobligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Group expects some or \nall of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as \na separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.  The expense relating to any provision is \npresented in the profit and loss statement net of any reimbursement. \n(n) \nTrade and Other Payables \nTrade and other payables are recognised at amortised cost and represent liabilities for the goods and services \nprovided to the Group prior to the end of the financial period that are unpaid and arise when the Group becomes \nobliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services. The amounts are \nunsecured and are usually paid within 30 days. Where trade and other payables are to be deferred for a period \ngreater than 12 months, the Group discounts the amount to its present value based on the expected timing of the \npayment. \n(o) \nDeferred Consideration \nA liability for deferred consideration is recognised on the acquisition of an asset and is included in the acquisition \ncost of the asset.  \n(p) \nContingent Consideration \nThe Company has recognised an amount in relation to the Contingent Cash Consideration on the Tuckanarra \nProject being the consideration of $1,000,000 discounted to its present value based on the expected timing of the \npayment. The Company has recognised the amounts on the basis that the performance criteria on the Tuckanarra \nProject are more likely than not to be met within the required timeframe. This is on the basis that previous exploration \nactivities on the Tuckanarra Project were substantially advanced leading to an increased probability that a JORC \nresource will be declared. The Contingent Cash Consideration has been capitalised as an acquisition cost. \n(q) \nContributed Equity \nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Issued and paid up capital is recognised at the fair value of the \nconsideration received by the Company. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or \nincentive securities (classed as equity) are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds."

For financial assets, this is equivalent to the date that the Group commits itself to either the \npurchase or sale of the asset. Financial assets are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly \nattributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets (other than financial assets at fair value through profit or \nloss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on \ninitial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets at fair value through \nprofit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss. \n(i) \nClassification and subsequent measurement of financial assets \nFor the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets other than those designated and effective as hedging \ninstruments are classified into the following categories upon initial recognition: \n• \namortised cost  \n• \nfair value through profit or loss (FVPL)  \n• \nequity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)  \n• \ndebt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)  \nAll income and expenses relating to financial assets that are recognised in profit or loss are presented within other \nincome or expenses respectively.  \nClassifications of financial assets are determined by both the entities business model for managing the financial \nasset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. \n(ii) \nLoans and receivables \nLoans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment in \naccordance with (iv) Impairment of Financial Assets below. Interest is recognised by applying the effective interest \nrate.  \n(iii) \nFair Value Estimation \nThe fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for \ndisclosure purposes. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active is based on quoted market prices at the \nreporting date.  The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the \nappropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is the current ask price. Transaction costs that are directly \nattributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets (other than financial assets at fair value through profit or \nloss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets, as appropriate, on initial recognition. \nTransaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are \nrecognised immediately in profit or loss. \nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation \ntechniques.  The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions \nexisting at each balance date.  Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term \ndebt instruments held.  Other techniques, such as discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the \nremaining financial instruments.  \nThe nominal value less estimated credit adjustments of receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their \nfair values.  The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future \ncontractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial \ninstruments. \n(iv) \nImpairment of Financial Assets \nThe Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on receivables. The amount of expected credit \nlosses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective \nfinancial instrument. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix \nbased on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general \neconomic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the \nreporting date, including time value of money where appropriate.  \nFor all other financial instruments, the Group recognises lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase \nin credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased \nsignificantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an \namount equal to 12-month ECL.  \nLifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected \nlife of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to \nresult from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date."

      "text": "Odyssey Gold Limited    ANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n39 \n(v) \nDerecognition of financial assets \nThe Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, \nor when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to \nanother entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and \ncontinues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated \nliability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of \na transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a \ncollateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. \nOn derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum \nof the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other \ncomprehensive income and accumulated in equity is recognised in profit or loss. \nOn derecognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety (e.g. when the Group retains an option to repurchase \npart of a transferred asset), the Group allocates the previous carrying amount of the financial asset between the \npart it continues to recognise under continuing involvement, and the part it no longer recognises on the basis of the \nrelative fair values of those parts on the date of the transfer. The difference between the carrying amount allocated \nto the part that is no longer recognised and the sum of the consideration received for the part no longer recognised \nand any cumulative gain or loss allocated to it that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is \nrecognised in profit or loss. A cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is \nallocated between the part that continues to be recognised and the part that is no longer recognised on the basis \nof the relative fair values of those parts. \n(s) \nExploration and Evaluation Expenditure \nExpenditure on exploration and evaluation is accounted for in accordance with the 'area of interest' method. \nExploration and evaluation expenditure encompasses expenditures incurred by the Group in connection with the \nexploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of \nextracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. For each area of interest, expenditure incurred in the acquisition \nof rights to explore is capitalised, classified as tangible or intangible, and recognised as an exploration and \nevaluation asset.  Exploration and evaluation assets are measured at cost at recognition and are recorded as an \nasset if: \n• \nthe rights to tenure of the area of interest are current; and  \n• \nat least one of the following conditions is also met:  \no \nthe exploration and evaluation expenditures are expected to be recouped through successful \ndevelopment and exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale; and \no \nexploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not at the reporting date \nreached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of \neconomically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the \narea of interest are continuing.  \nExploration and evaluation expenditure incurred by the Group subsequent to the acquisition of the rights to explore \nwill be expensed as incurred, up until the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the project has been \ndemonstrated with a bankable feasibility study. \nCapitalised exploration costs are reviewed at each reporting date to establish whether an indication of impairment \nexists.  If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the capitalised exploration costs is estimated to \ndetermine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).  Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying \namount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the \nincreased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no \nimpairment loss been recognised for the asset in previous years. Where a decision is made to proceed with \ndevelopment, accumulated expenditure is tested for impairment and transferred to development properties, and \nthen amortised over the life of the reserves associated with the area of interest once mining operations have \ncommenced. \nRecoverability of the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation assets is dependent on successful \ndevelopment and commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the respective areas of interest. \n(t) \nPlant and Equipment \nAll classes of plant and equipment are measured at cost. Where it is expected that a liability for capital gains tax \nwill arise, this expected amount is disclosed by way of note. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis on all \nproperty, plant and equipment (useful lives between 2.5 to 6 years)."

The fair value \ndetermined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's \nestimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the \nnumber of equity instruments expected to vest.  The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is \nrecognised in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to the share based \npayments reserve. Equity-settled share-based payments may also be provided as consideration for the acquisition \nof assets. Where ordinary shares are issued and vest immediately, the transaction is recorded at fair value based \non the quoted price of the ordinary shares at the date of issue. The acquisition is then recorded as an asset or \nexpensed in accordance with accounting standards. \n(w) \nBusiness Combinations and Asset Acquisitions \nThe Directors may evaluate a group of assets that is acquired in a transaction is not a business combination in \naccordance with either the optional “concentration” or “substantive process” tests in AASB 3. In such cases where \na transaction is not a business combination, the cost of acquisition is allocated to the individual identifiable assets \n(including intangible assets that meet the definition of and recognition criteria for intangible assets in AASB 138) \nacquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their relative fair values at the date of acquisition. \n(x) \nJoint Operations \nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties have joint control of the arrangement and have rights \nto the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint control is contractually agreed \nsharing control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous \nconsent of the parties sharing control. When the entity undertakes its activities under joint operations, the Group as \na joint operator, recognises in relation to its interest in a joint operation: \n• \nIts assets, including its share of any assets held jointly; \n• \nIts liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly; \n• \nIts revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operations; \n• \nIts share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and \n• \nIts expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly. \nThe Group accounts for the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation in \naccordance with the AASBs applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. When the Group \ntransacts with the joint operation in which the entity is a joint operator, the Group is considered to be conducting \nthe transaction with the other parties of the joint operations, and gains and losses resulting from the transactions \nare recognised in the Group’s financial statements only to the extent of other parties’ interest in the joint operation.  \n \n(y) \nCritical Accounting Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements \nIn applying the Group's accounting policies, management continually evaluates judgements, estimates and \nassumptions based on experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that may have an \nimpact on the Group. All judgements, estimates and assumptions made are believed to be reasonable based on \nthe most current set of circumstances available to management. Actual results may differ from the judgements, \nestimates and assumptions. In particular, information about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that \nhave the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in the following \nnotes: \n• \nExploration and evaluation assets (Note 1(s));  \n• \nShare-based payments (Note 1(v)); and \n• \nContingent consideration (Note 1(p) and 9)."

The rights attaching to the Shares arise from a combination of the Company's \nConstitution, statute and general law.  Copies of the Company's Constitution are available for inspection during \nbusiness hours at its registered office.   \n(ii) \nReports and Notices \nShareholders are entitled to receive all notices, reports, accounts and other documents required to be furnished to \nshareholders under the Company's Constitution, the Corporations Act and the Listing Rules. \n(iii) \nVoting \nSubject to any rights or restrictions at the time being attached to any class or classes of shares, at a general meeting \nof the Company on a show of hands, every ordinary Shareholder present in person, or by proxy, attorney or \nrepresentative (in the case of a company) has one vote and upon a poll, every Shareholder present in person, or \nby proxy, attorney or representative (in the case of a company) has one vote for any Share held by the Shareholder. \nA poll may be demanded by the Chairperson of the meeting, any 5 Shareholders entitled to vote in person or by \nproxy, attorney or representative or by any one or more Shareholders holding not less than 5% of the total voting \nrights of all Shareholders having the right to vote. \n(iv) \nVariation of Shares and Rights Attaching to Shares \nShares may be converted or cancelled with member approval and the Company's share capital may be reduced in \naccordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act.  Class rights attaching to a particular class of shares \nmay be varied or cancelled with the consent in writing of holders of 75% of the shares in that class or by a special \nresolution of the holders of shares in that class. \n \n(v) \nUnmarketable Parcels \nThe Company may procure the disposal of Shares where the member holds less than a marketable parcel of Shares \nwithin the meaning of the Listing Rules (being a parcel of shares with a market value of less than $500). To invoke \nthis procedure, the Directors must first give notice to the relevant member holding less than a marketable parcel of \nShares, who may then elect not to have his or her Shares sold by notifying the Directors. \n \n(vi) \nChanges to the Constitution \nThe Company's Constitution can only be amended by a special resolution passed by at least three quarters of the \nmembers present and voting at a general meeting of the Company.

The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk and \ncredit risk. \nThis note presents information about the Group's exposure to the above risks, its objectives, policies and processes \nfor measuring and managing risk, and the management of capital.  Other than as disclosed, there have been no \nsignificant changes since the previous financial year to the exposure or management of these risks.  \nThe Group manages its exposure to key financial risks in accordance with the Group's financial risk management \npolicy.  Key risks are monitored and reviewed as circumstances change (e.g. acquisition of a new project) and \npolicies are revised as required.  The overall objective of the Group's financial risk management policy is to support \nthe delivery of the Group's financial targets whilst protecting future financial security. \nGiven the nature and size of the business and uncertainty as to the timing and amount of cash inflows and outflows, \nthe Group does not enter into derivative transactions to mitigate the financial risks.  In addition, the Group's policy \nis that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken for the purposes of making speculative gains.  As the \nGroup's operations change, the Directors will review this policy periodically going forward.   \nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management \nframework.  The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing the Group's financial risks as summarised below."

      "text": "Odyssey Gold Limited    ANNUAL REPORT 2022 \n53 \n(b) \nCredit Risk \nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company or Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument \nfails to meet its contractual obligations. This arises principally from cash and cash equivalents, and other \nreceivables. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The carrying amount of the \nGroup's financial assets represents the maximum credit risk exposure, as represented below: \n \n \nNotes \n2022 \n2021 \n \n \n$ \n$ \nCash and cash equivalents \n18(b) \n3,480,120 \n12,689,470 \nOther receivables \n4 \n23 \n8 \n \n \n3,480,143 \n12,689,478 \nThe Group does not have any significant customers and accordingly does not have any significant exposure to bad \nor doubtful debts.   \nOther receivables comprise interest accrued and other miscellaneous receivables. Where possible the Group \ntransacts only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an \nongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant. At 30 June 2022, none (2021: \nnone) of the Group's receivables are past due.   \nWith respect to credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, the Group's exposure to credit risk arises from \ndefault of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. \n(c) \nInterest Rate Risk \nThe Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the cash and short-term \ndeposits with a floating interest rate. These financial assets with variable rates expose the Group to cash flow \ninterest rate risk.  All other financial assets and liabilities, in the form of available-for-sale financial assets, \nreceivables and payables, are non-interest bearing.  \n(i) \nExposure to interest rate risk \nAt the reporting date, the interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments was: \n \n \n \n2022 \n2021 \n \n \n$ \n$ \nInterest-bearing financial instruments \n \n \n \nCash at bank and on hand \n(A) \n3,480,120 \n12,689,470 \n \n \n3,480,120 \n12,689,470 \n(A) \nThe weighted average interest rate of the total consolidated cash balance was 0.54% (2021: 0.36%). \nThe Group currently does not engage in any hedging or derivative transactions to manage interest rate risk. \n(ii) \nCash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments \nA sensitivity of 20% has been selected as this is considered reasonable given the current level of both short term \nand long term interest rates. A 20% movement in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased \n(decreased) equity and profit and loss by the amounts shown below.  This analysis assumes that all other variables, \nin particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

Given the stage of development of the Group, the Board's \nobjective is to minimise debt going forward and to raise funds as required through the issue of new shares. However, \nthe Board will undertake short term borrowings to provide temporary funding where appropriate. The Group is \ncurrently examining new business opportunities where acquisition/working capital requirements of a new project \nmay involve additional funding in some format (which may include debt, where appropriate).  \nThere were no changes in the Group's approach to capital management during the year. The Group is not subject \nto externally imposed capital requirements. \n(e) \nFair Value \nThe net fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their carrying value. The methods for \nestimating fair values are outlined in the relevant notes to the Financial Statements. \n(f) \nLiquidity Risk \nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company and Group will not be able to meet their financial obligations as they fall \ndue. The Board's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that the Company will always have \nsufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due.  This is monitored by the preparation of monthly cash flow reports, \nand regular forecasts as required but at least every six months.  \nThe contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments, are provided below.

The Group has no source of cash inflows other than interest \nincome and funds sourced through capital raising activities. At 30 June 2022, the Group has cash and cash \nequivalents totaling $3,480,120 (30 June 2021: $12,689,470) and net working capital (current assets less \ncurrent liabilities) of $877,909 (30 June 2021: $11,282,642). As stated in Note 1(b), these events or \nconditions, along with other matters set forth in Note 1(b), indicate that a material uncertainty exists that \nmay cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified \nin respect of this matter. \nKey Audit Matter \nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our \naudit of the financial report of the current year. This matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the \nfinancial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion \non this matter. In addition to the matter described in the Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern \nsection, we have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in \nour report. \nCARRYING VALUE OF EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION ASSETS \nArea of focus \nRefer also to Notes 1(s) and 5. \nHow our audit addressed it \nAs at 30 June 2022, the Group has $8,894,636 \n(30 June 2021: $8,794,300) of capitalised \nacquisition costs of tenements comprising the \nTuckanarra Gold Project and the Stakewell Gold \nProject located in the Murchison Goldfields of \nWestern Australia.  \nThe carrying value of these costs represents a \nsignificant asset of the Group. \nThis is a key audit matter due to the fact that \nsignificant judgement is applied in determining \nwhether the capitalised exploration costs continue \nto meet the recognition criteria of AASB 6 \nExploration for and Evaluation of Mineral \nResources. \nOur procedures focussed on evaluating \nmanagement’s assessment of whether the \nexploration assets meet the recognition criteria of \nAASB 6, including:  \n— Obtaining evidence that the Group has valid \nrights to explore the areas represented by the \ncapitalised exploration costs.  \n— Enquiring of management and reviewing the \ncashflow forecast to verify that substantive \nexpenditure on further exploration and \nevaluation of the mineral resources in the \nGroup’s areas of interest was planned. \n— Enquiring with management, reviewing \nannouncements made and reviewing minutes \nof director meetings to verify that the Group \nhad not decided to discontinue activities in any \nof its areas of interest. \nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the \nrelated disclosures in note 5 of the financial \nstatements."
