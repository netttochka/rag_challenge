For the definition of Adjusted \nEBITDA, refer to the Non-IFRS Measures section of this MD&A.  \nIn $000s except per share amounts  \n3 months ended December 31, \nYear ended December 31, \n(unaudited) \n \n2022 \n \n2021 \n \n2022 \n \n2021 \nRevenue \n$ \n 43,998  $ \n35,129 \n$ \n 176,935  $ \n125,076 \nGross Profit \n \n 5,759  \n \n4,389 \n \n 26,088  \n \n17,611 \nOperating income \n \n 2,792  \n \n1,517 \n \n 13,381  \n \n6,686 \nNet income (loss) \n \n (254) \n \n241 \n \n 2,387  \n \n496 \nAdjusted EBITDA1 \n \n 3,087  \n \n2,111 \n \n 16,659  \n \n10,533 \nNet income (loss) per share – basic2 \n$ \n (0.03) \n$ \n0.03 \n$ \n 0.26  $ \n0.05 \nNet income (loss) per share – diluted2 \n$ \n (0.03) \n$ \n0.03 \n$ \n 0.26  $ \n0.05 \n1  Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the ‘Non-IFRS Measures’ section of this MD&A and is a “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” as defined by CSA Staff Notice \n52-306. \n2  Per-share calculations are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted earnings per share take into \naccount shares that may be issued upon the exercise of warrants and RSUs. \nFinancial highlights \n \nRevenue for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, was $44.0 million and $176.9 million \nrespectively, which represents a 25% and 41% increase over the same periods in 2021. The increase is a \nresult of strong volume growth and higher green coffee prices. In addition, our Seaforth subsidiary \ncontinues to operate at record levels of activity.  \n \nGross profit for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, was $5.8 million and $26.1 million \nrespectively, which represents a 31% and 48% increase over the same periods in 2021. Gross profit \npercent for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 15%, which represents a 1% increase over the same \nperiod in 2021. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily driven by higher sales volume. In addition, \nwe benefited from a significantly higher green coffee differential margin.  The increase was partially offset \nby inflationary pressure on variable production costs and freight. \n \nOperating income for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, was $2.8 million and $13.4 million \nrespectively, which represents an 84% and 100% increase over the same periods in 2021. The increase is \na result of the improvements in gross profit from increased volumes and higher green coffee differential \nmargin, partially offset by increases in administration expenses.  The increased expenses were due to \ngeneral inflationary pressure, higher professional fees, increased headcount and salaries, and overall costs \nof running two facilities, including depreciation and rental expenses. \n \nIn Q4 2022, we performed an assessment of the salvageable assets associated with our Burnaby location \nin advance of the expiry of the lease, in June 2023. With the support of a third party engineering \nconsultancy, we considered the potential future use, cost and benefit, and related cash flows to salvage \nequipment from the Burnaby location and determined that only a portion of the equipment should be \nsalvaged for future use. As a result, a one-time $2.5 million impairment of plant and equipment was \nrecorded in Q4 2022. The impairment is a non-cash expense that, if removed, would have resulted in a \n$2.5 million increase in annual net income in 2022. There was no such impairment in 2021."

      "text": "SWISS WATER DECAFFEINATED COFFEE INC.  \nManagement Discussion and Analysis  \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 \n \n3 | P a g e  o f  t h e  M D & A  \n \nNet income for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, was a loss of $0.3 million and income of \n$2.4 million, respectively. The decrease in Q4 net income was mainly due to the impairment of plant and \nequipment associated with the Burnaby location. For the full year, the increase resulted from \nimprovements in operating income, materially offset by a one-time impairment of plant and equipment \nassociated with the Burnaby location. Increased losses on foreign exchange due to the strengthening of \nthe US dollar in Q3 2022, and increased losses on risk management activities due to mark-to-market \nrevaluations of commodity and foreign currency hedges were also deductions against 2022 net income. \n \nAdjusted EBITDA1 for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, was $3.1 million and $16.7 million \nrespectively, which represents a 46% and 58% increase over the same periods in 2021. The improvement \nin Adjusted EBITDA was mainly driven by the positive impact of increased sales volume and a higher green \ncoffee differential margin. \nOperational highlights \n \nTotal sales volumes for the year increased by 15% compared to 2021. Volume growth during the first half \nof the year was enhanced by the shipment of products to new out-of-home food service customers within \nNorth America. Over the second half of the year, our customers continued to see strong consumer \ndemand within most segments. Encouragingly, we recorded 19% and 10% volume growth in our North \nAmerica and Asia-Pacific regions respectively, during 2022. \n \nOur largest geographical market by volume during 2022 was the United States, followed by Canada and \ninternational markets. By dollar value, 48% of our sales were to customers in the United States, 26% were \nto Canadian customers, and the remaining 26% were to international customers. Our international \nbusiness continues to expand rapidly, and we anticipate demand from our Asia-Pacific and European \nmarkets to remain strong in 2023. \n \nOn November 7, 2022, Swiss Water announced the expansion of our credit facilities with our existing \ncreditors, resulting in $33.25 million of incremental capital availability.  This consists of $21.25 million of \nexpanded revolving credit capacity for working capital and $12.0 million of incremental senior-term \nfinancing for capital expansions.  The capital allocation is specifically to help finance our second production \nline in Delta, British Columbia (“Delta 2”) (see Press Release dated November 7, 2022). \nLooked at sequentially, we did see a slow down in the rate of volume growth during the second half of 2022, \nwhen compared to the strong double-digit growth we experienced in the first half of the year. However, \ndespite this, as well as inflationary pressures, we continue to see strong volume increases across the business. \nSales to customers in the United States increased by $11.9 million during the fourth quarter and by $32.1 \nmillion for the full year, when compared to the same periods in 2021.  Sales to customers in Canada increased \nby $3.4 million in the quarter and by $7.1 million for the full year.  Although we saw a decline in our \ninternational sales during the fourth quarter, this was largely due to timing issues.  For the full year, sales to \ninternational customers were strong, increasing by $12.7 million, or 39% over the 2021 level. Within the \ninternational business, 2022 sales volumes to Asia-Pacific customers were substantial, growing by a 10% \nincrease year-over-year. Generally, we continue to see robust organic growth with existing customers, as well \nas incremental volume from new customers switching to chemical free decaffeinated coffee. Ultimately, our \n                                                 \n1 Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the ‘Non-IFRS Measures’ section of the MD&A and is a “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” as defined by \nCSA Staff Notice 52-306."

This was evidenced by the 28% \nannual growth in business with our specialty roaster customers. As in recent quarters, we also continue to see \nnew volume associated with the addition of new customers and brands within our North American business. \nThroughout 2022, we have remained well positioned with green coffee inventory and can react to short-term \ndemand increases in most coffee origins. However, we continue to be affected by persistent disruptions in \ndeliveries of green coffee, particularly from Brazil, as supply chain bottlenecks and equipment shortages \npersist in many outbound ports, and container-ship service to the Port of Vancouver is still reduced.  This has \nled to significant increases in freight rates. While these costs are generally recoverable, they are nonetheless \ninflationary. We remain in daily contact with our customers and suppliers regarding the movement of coffee. \nHowever, many of them have remained cautious of the time it will take for supply chains to return to normal \noperating efficiency. This caution has caused participants throughout the coffee supply chain to increase their \ninventories despite a high New York Futures contract coffee commodity price, or NY’C. \nThe NY’C for Arabica coffee increased rapidly in the third quarter of 2021 and remained high until the third \nquarter of 2022. It is unusual for the NY’C to experience such an elevated level for a sustained period. A rare \ndouble frost occurred in July 2021, in Brazil, the world’s largest producer of coffee. This caused an immediate \nrun-up in the NY’C reaching a peak of US$2.58 that occurred during the first quarter of 2022.  The tight \navailability of exportable coffee due to crop shortages and ongoing logistical backlogs has kept the pressure \non the futures market and we have seen spot availability of coffees fall substantially as a result.  The NY’C for \nArabica coffee did decrease in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, the effects of this on the coffee market \nwill not be fully realized until later in 2023, and its impact depends on the futures market remaining at this \nlower level for a sustained period of time. \nWe also experienced and continue to feel inflationary pressures within other components of our variable cost \nstructure. These increases include higher costs for natural gas, packaging, shipping, and labour. The resulting \npressure on our profitability drove our decision to increase processing prices toward the end of the fourth \nquarter of 2021, to help maintain our margins. \nOn November 7, 2022, Justin Jacobs, Managing Director of Mill Road Capital LLC (“Mill Road”), was appointed \nto Swiss Water’s Board of Directors, pursuant to Mill Road's existing board nomination rights. Mr. Jacobs has \nbeen with Mill Road since the firm’s founding in 2005. Previously, he worked at LiveWire Capital, an \ninvestment and management group, and in the private equity group at The Blackstone Group. Mr. Jacobs has \nbeen a director at numerous public and private companies, including British Columbia’s based PRT Growing \nServices Ltd., a British Columbia based leader in the reforestation sector. In addition to the debenture with \nwarrants referred to in Note 17.3 of our audited consolidated financial statements, Mill Road currently holds \n608,500 shares of Swiss Water, representing approximately 6.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of the \nCompany. \nNON-IFRS MEASURES \nAdjusted EBITDA \nAdjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP measure that is often used by publicly traded companies as a measure of \ncash from operations, as it excludes financing costs, taxation, and non-cash items.

By considering Adjusted EBITDA in \ncombination with IFRS, we believe that readers are provided with additional and more useful information \nabout Swiss Water than readers would have if they simply considered IFRS measures alone. Reported \nAdjusted EBITDA is intended to assist readers with their own financial analysis. However, since this measure \ndoes not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, it is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures \npresented by other entities. \nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, depreciation, amortization, impairments, share-\nbased compensation, gains/losses on foreign exchange, gains/losses on disposal of property and equipment, \nfair value adjustments on embedded options, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, adjustment for the \nimpact of IFRS 16 - Leases, and provision for income taxes. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA also excludes \nunrealized gains and losses on the undesignated portion of foreign exchange forward contracts. \nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, was $3.1 million and $16.7 million \nrespectively, compared to $2.1 million and $10.5 million for the same periods in 2021. Operationally, the \nchange in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by increased processing volume, revenue growth, and higher green \ncoffee differentials. These gains were partially offset by an increase in green coffee costs and inflationary \npressures on our underlying cost structure. \nTo help readers better understand our financial results, the following table provides a reconciliation between \nAdjusted EBITDA and operating income, the most comparable IFRS measure for the periods as indicated: \n(In $000s)  \n3 months ended December 31, \nYear ended December 31, \n(unaudited) \n2022 \n \n2021 \n \n2022 \n \n2021 \nOperating income  \n$ \n 2,792  \n$ \n1,517 \n$ \n 13,381  $ \n6,686 \nDepreciation and amortization \n \n 1,686  \n \n1,095 \n \n 7,018  \n \n6,208 \nShare-based compensation \n \n 173  \n \n205 \n \n 552  \n \n690 \n(Gain) loss on risk management activities \n \n (65) \n \n179 \n \n (1,560) \n \n(323) \nUnrealized (gain) loss on foreign exchange forwards \n \n (796) \n \n(183) \n \n 44  \n \n80 \nImpact of IFRS 16 Leases \n \n (703) \n \n(702) \n \n (2,776) \n \n(2,808) \nAdjusted EBITDA  \n$ \n 3,087  \n$ \n2,111 \n$ \n 16,659  $ \n10,533 \nThe reconciliation of net income, an IFRS measure, to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows: \n(In $000s)  \n3 months ended December 31, \nYear ended December 31, \n(unaudited) \n2022 \n \n2021 \n \n2022 \n \n2021 \nIncome (loss) for the period \n$ \n (254) \n$ \n241 \n$ \n2,387  $ \n496 \nIncome taxes expense (recovery) \n \n (130) \n \n128 \n \n 819  \n \n509 \nIncome (loss) before tax \n$ \n(384) \n$ \n369 \n$ \n 3,206  $ \n1005 \n(Gain) loss on the embedded option \n \n(513)   \n \n- \n \n (513)   \n \n48 \n(Gain) loss on the extinguishment of debt \n \n(583)   \n \n(4) \n \n(583)   \n \n1,381 \nFinance income \n \n (174) \n \n(72) \n \n (509) \n \n(442) \nFinance expenses \n \n1,577  \n \n1,189 \n \n5,567  \n \n4,364 \nImpairment of plant and equipment \n \n 2,470  \n \n- \n \n 2,470  \n \n- \nLoss on foreign exchange \n \n 334  \n \n214 \n \n 2,183  \n \n7 \nDepreciation and amortization \n \n 1,686  \n \n1,095 \n \n 7,018  \n \n6,208 \nUnrealized loss (gain) on foreign exchange forwards \n \n (796) \n \n(183) \n \n 44  \n \n80 \nShare-based compensation \n \n 173  \n \n205 \n \n 552  \n \n690 \nImpact of IFRS 16 Leases \n \n (703) \n \n(702) \n \n (2,776) \n \n(2,808) \nAdjusted EBITDA \n$ \n 3,087  \n$ \n2,111 \n$ \n 16,659  $ \n10,533"

      "text": "SWISS WATER DECAFFEINATED COFFEE INC.  \nManagement Discussion and Analysis  \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 \n \n6 | P a g e  o f  t h e  M D & A  \nOUTLOOK \nSwiss Water delivered an exceptionally strong financial performance in 2022. Sustained volume growth over \nthe last two years has been a major driver of our strong results.  This momentum initially emerged during the \nearly stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when working remotely gained traction, resulting in a significant \nincrease in the at-home consumption of coffee.  As pandemic restrictions eased and, things began to return \nto normal through 2022, many businesses and organizations have now moved away from the modified work-\nfrom-home model.  This change slowed the growth of at-home consumption and, as a result, the volumes we \ndeliver to our large commercial customers who serve the grocery channel. However, at the same time, our \nsales to our specialty roaster segment grew significantly during 2022. Now, many of our specialty customers \nare ordering in-line or exceeding pre-pandemic levels of activity. \nWe continue to see increased demand from all our customers that serve the out-of-home market through \ncafes and restaurants. This has been particularly evident in North America where our food service customers \nhave generally returned to a normal operating environment. It is particularly encouraging that our sales \nvolumes in the Asia-Pacific region grew by 10% during 2022, while sales to our largest market, North America, \ngrew by 19% over the last twelve months. \nDespite the normalization of trading conditions, uncertainty persists. Inflationary pressures are becoming ever \nmore apparent and interest rates have risen rapidly across the globe.  We cannot reliably predict the ultimate \nimpact these factors will have on global supply chains and customer demand. If inflation rates continue \nthrough the first quarter of 2023, we may have to increase the process rates we charge our customers.  \nHowever, we are cautiously optimistic that our volume growth will offset some of this anticipated inflationary \npressure. \nOn a further cautionary note, the post-pandemic recovery of the global economy combined with the negative \nimpact of the conflict in Ukraine has placed additional stress on international supply chains and production \ncosts. These developments are actively undermining the efficient movement of coffee from some growing \nregions, and we are experiencing delays in the delivery of some coffees to our production facilities. \nFurthermore, although coffee prices have started to soften, high coffee prices can have a destabilizing impact \non the efficient movement of coffee inventories and will result in higher prices on retail grocery shelves. \nHistorically, sharp increases in retail pricing have resulted in demand destruction in the grocery channel, which \nhas the effect of decreasing Swiss Water’s volumes. We are paying close attention to these risks and will \nimplement necessary mitigation steps, as required, to ensure that our production schedules are not \ncompromised as we move through 2023. \nOperationally, Swiss Water ran both production lines at our legacy plant in Burnaby on a 24/7 basis during the \nfourth quarter of 2022. Since completing the first production run of commercial-grade coffee from our new \ndecaffeination line in Delta, in September 2020, we have been steadily transitioning a significant proportion \nof production volume to this new facility. Aside from scheduled maintenance, the Delta line has been running \non a 24/7 basis as we continue its optimization.  However, record demand in the last six quarters drove higher \nthan expected utilization of our legacy assets in Burnaby.  During this period, the capacity utilization rate \nacross all three of our current production lines regularly exceeded 80%, Operating at these elevated \nproduction levels would not have been possible without the investment we made in our first production line \nin Delta. Furthermore, it provides valuable insight into the value creation opportunity available when we \noperate at high-capacity utilization rates and supports our decision to invest in a second line in Delta. \nAs reported previously, in the second quarter of 2020, the landlord of our Burnaby manufacturing site \nprovided formal notice that our lease would not be extended beyond June 2023. This made clear the need for"

Last summer, we were issued the necessary building permits and began construction of the \nDelta expansion. The targeted completion date of this project is the third quarter of 2023. Based on \nengineering reports from a third-party engineering firm, when both are completed the two lines in Delta are \nexpected to have a targeted endpoint capacity at least 40% greater than the current existing capacity of the \ntwo lines at our Burnaby site.  This should provide sufficient capacity to satisfy current demand and projected \nintermediate term growth. \nDuring the fourth quarter, Swiss Water continued construction of a second production line at its facility in \nDelta, BC. The preliminary cost estimate of this project was approximately $45.0 million, plus commissioning \ncosts of approximately $2.0 million. During the second half of 2022, the impacts of global macroeconomic \npressures, including inflation, trades disruptions, and supply chain issues, became more acute in terms of \nproject budget and schedule. The Company currently projects a $53.0 million final cost as it approaches \nsubstantial completion, factoring in the vast majority of realized inflationary factors to date, and there is no \nchange to the commissioning budget. These estimates are preliminary and like all major design and \nconstruction projects, are highly dependent on local and global economic factors impacting construction. \nThese include, without limitation, changes in labour, commodity and materials pricing, trade policies, and \nsupply chain issues. In addition, the continuing impact of inflation is unknown and could impact the timing \nand costs of the project.  \nThe progress and estimated completion of Delta 2 has been closely monitored in light of the deadline to exit \nthe Burnaby site. We plan to utilize our Burnaby assets into the second quarter of 2023. However, given the \ntargeted completion date of Delta 2 is the third quarter of 2023, we recognize that there will be a period of \ntime when our production capacity will be reduced. As a result, we have been proactive in our \ncommunications with customers and suppliers regarding the production of coffee leading up to the Burnaby \nexit, during the estimated period of lower production capacity, and after Delta 2 begins producing a \ncommercially viable product. We are cautiously optimistic that this proactive response will minimize any \ndisruptions to our business and customers.  However, it will necessitate a front loaded working capital \ninvestment to cover elevated production volumes during Q1 2023, and may also temporarily compress net \nincome during Q3 2023 when our production capacity is constrained. \nDuring 2022, we engaged a third party engineering consultancy to help us to evaluate the exit cost and \ntransition plan associated with permanently shutting down our Burnaby location (“Exit Plan”). This evaluation, \nnot only considered the Exit Plan, but assessed the recoverability of existing production assets from the site. \nThis planning process recently concluded, and it has been determined that only a portion of existing assets \nshould be salvaged for future use. In reaching this decision, we considered the probability of near-term future \nuse, as well as the costs, potential benefits and related cash flow impacts of extracting the equipment from \nthe Burnaby location. \nThe preliminary cost estimate to execute this plan is $1.5 million.

The capital allocation is specifically to help finance our second production line in Delta, British \nColumbia (see Press Release dated November 7, 2022). As part of the refinancing, we amended our agreement \nwith Mill Road to increase our senior debt covenant to $123.25 million. \nBUSINESS OVERVIEW \nSwiss Water Decaffeinated Coffee Inc. is a premium green coffee decaffeinator located in Burnaby and in \nDelta, British Columbia. We employ the proprietary Swiss Water® Process to decaffeinate green coffee \nwithout the use of chemical solvents, leveraging science-based systems and controls to produce coffee that is \n99.9% caffeine free. Our process is certified organic by the Organic Crop Improvement Association and is the \nworld’s only consumer-branded decaffeination process. Decaffeinating premium green coffee without the use \nof harmful chemical solvents is our primary business. \nOur Seaforth subsidiary provides a complete range of green coffee logistics services including devanning \ncoffee received from their origin; inspecting, weighing, and sampling coffees; and storing, handling and \npreparing green coffee for outbound shipments. Seaforth provides all of Swiss Water’s local green coffee \nhandling and storage services. In addition, Seaforth handles and stores coffees for several other coffee \nimporters and brokers and is the main green coffee handling and storage company in Metro Vancouver. \nSeaforth is organically certified by Ecocert Canada. \nSwiss Water shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol ‘SWP’. As at the date of this report, \n9,165,815 shares were issued and outstanding. \nSwiss Water Decaffeinated Coffee’s Business \nWe carry an inventory of premium-grade Arabica coffees that we purchase from the specialty green coffee \ntrade, decaffeinate and then sell to our customers (our “Regular” or “Non-Toll” business). Revenue from our \nRegular business includes both processing revenue and green coffee cost recovery revenue. \nWe also decaffeinate coffee owned by our customers for a processing fee under toll arrangements (our “toll” \nbusiness). The value of the coffee processed under toll arrangements does not form part of our inventory, \nour revenue, or our cost of sales. Revenue from toll arrangements consists entirely of processing revenue. \nOur cost of sales is comprised primarily of the cost of green coffee purchased for our regular business, plant \nlabour and other processing costs directly associated with our production facility. This incorporates an \nallocation of fixed overhead costs, which includes depreciation of our production equipment and amortization \nof our proprietary process technology. For our regular business, we work with coffee importers to source \npremium-grade green coffees from coffee-producing countries located in Central and South America, Africa \nand Asia. The purchase price is based on the NY’C coffee futures price on the Intercontinental Exchange, plus \na quality differential. The NY’C component typically makes up more than 80% of the total cost of green coffee, \nwhile the quality differential typically accounts for less than 20%. Both the NY’C price and the quality \ndifferential fluctuate in response to fundamental commodity factors that affect supply and demand. \nCAPACITY TO DELIVER RESULTS \nThe following resources allow us to deliver on our business strategy: \n \nProprietary Chemical Free Production Lines – We have three decaffeination production lines which is \nprojected to be two lines by Q3 2023. This enables us to align our production capacity with changes in \ndemand throughout the year. We are able to better control our variable cost by operating a reduced"

In Q3 2020, we initiated \nproduction from our new processing facility in Delta, BC. In prior years we completed an efficiency \nenhancement project in Q2 2018 to increase capacity at our Burnaby operating facility, and in 2016, we \nexpanded the capacity of one of our production lines, which enabled us to meet near-term growth in \ndemand for our products. The construction of our second production line in Delta, which commenced in \n2021 will enable us to meet our intermediate term growth ambition. \n \nConsumer Branding as the Premium, 100% Chemical Free Method of Decaffeinating Green Coffee – We \nhave been successful in establishing our brand as a leading chemical free processor of green decaffeinated \ncoffee. Consumers and participants in the coffee trade are increasingly aware of the value of the chemical \nfree Swiss Water® Process due to its quality and taste. We believe that there is significant potential to \ncontinue to broaden consumer awareness of the benefits of the Swiss Water® Process. \n \nEstablished Customer Base – The Swiss Water® Process has an established customer base across North \nAmerica and in many international markets. Our customers include some of North America’s largest \nroasters, roaster-retailers and leading coffee brands. \n \nBroad Distribution Channels – Green coffee decaffeinated using the Swiss Water® Process is sold through \nthe coffee market’s key distribution channels: roaster retailers, commercial roasters and coffee importers.  \nThis diversity ensures that we access all key segments of the specialty coffee trade and consumer coffee \nmarkets. \n \nWorking Capital and Expansion Capital – In 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2022 we raised capital, which \nwas used to fund the construction of our first and second production lines in Delta. The first production \nline in Delta was commissioned in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, we raised capital through debt financing to \nfinance our second production line in Delta. We expect to utilize internally generated and external funds \nto finance the capital costs associated with the new production facility, and our future working capital \ninvestments. \n \nManagement Expertise – Swiss Water is highly regarded in the coffee industry for our senior management \nteam’s substantial experience, our close attention to consumer trends in the specialty coffee market, and \nour in-depth knowledge of green and roasted coffee.  In particular, our intense focus on premium product \nquality and commitment to science-driven insight is well recognized.  To maximize these strengths, we \nhave invested significant resources in enhancing our team’s industry-related skills and talents over the \npast few years. Going forward, we intend to leverage our exceptional experience with, and knowledge of, \nthe specialty coffee industry to continue to build our business. \nKEY PERFORMANCE DRIVERS \nThe following key performance drivers are critical to the successful implementation of our strategy and ability \nto improve profitability and cash from operations: \nInternal Factors \n \nSustainability and Environmental Responsibility – The Swiss Water® Process is a 100% chemical free \ndecaffeination process that enables us to consistently deliver high-quality coffee. Our approach to \nsustainability is to continually improve and innovate this process to be more efficient by actively managing \nresource usage in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. In addition to carefully managing our \noperations, we take steps to ensure a sustainable coffee supply by purchasing sustainably certified coffees \nand organic coffees. We promote social sustainability by participating in programs within the coffee"

Accordingly, our profitability and cash from \noperations will increase as processing volumes increase. Processing volume is a key performance indicator \n(“KPI”) that we monitor continuously. \n \nProcess Consistency – We manage our operations in order to reduce variability in production and drive \ncontinuous improvement. Production consistency results in improved product quality. We have \ndeveloped a number of KPIs designed to monitor process consistency and have set targets for continuous \nprocess improvement. \n \nProduct Quality – Quality control is a key part of our operations. We operate under the Food Safety \nSystems Certification (FSSC) 22000, which manages our food safety, as well as HACCP (Hazard Analysis \nCritical Control Points) and quality assurance programs. All green coffees delivered to our processing \nfacility are weighed and inspected and are subject to rigorous internal quality-control evaluations. Each \nlot of green coffee processed is monitored throughout the decaffeination process, and a certificate of \nanalysis is prepared for each lot. A sample from each production lot is also roasted, brewed and cupped \nto ensure quality. In addition, our focus on reducing the size of production lots and increasing inventory \nturnover results in fresher coffee being provided to our customers. Production batch size and inventory \nturns are two other KPIs that we monitor regularly. \n \nOrder Fulfillment – Our integrated supply chain management strategy includes maintaining inventories \nof finished goods at various coffee warehouses throughout North America, and of raw goods for improved \ninventory replenishment times. Our order fulfillment rates are monitored regularly. An improved order \nfulfillment rate contributes to our volume growth and improved customer service levels. \n \nEmployee Safety – We are focused on operating our business in a safe manner, and reducing the likelihood \nthat employees will be injured at work. We track employee safety metrics by department, and our safety \ncommittee proactively seeks ways to reduce the risks inherent in our operating environment. While we \ncannot completely eliminate the risk of workplace incidents or accidents, we have significantly reduced \nthe number of safety-related incidents over the past few years. We believe that ensuring employee safety \nleads to improved employee retention and morale, increased efficiency and lower operating costs. \nExternal Factors \n \nCoffee Futures Prices – We buy and sell coffees based on the NY’C plus the quality differentials for \nspecified coffees, both of which rise and fall in response to changes in supply and demand.  We manage \nour exposure to changes in the NY’C futures price on the value of our inventories through a commodity \nhedging program (discussed under ‘Hedge Accounting’ below) but cannot hedge our exposure to changes \nin quality differentials. In addition to the price risks associated with holding coffee inventories, our \nrevenue and cost of sales are affected by changes in the underlying commodity price. Commodity price \nincreases (decreases) raise (lower) the green coffee cost recovery revenue generated through our non-\ntoll business, as well as the costs of green coffee sold to customers to generate sales. \nChanges in the NY’C also affect our statement of financial position and the amount of working capital we \nuse in our business.

Our accounts receivable and our accounts payable also rise and fall \nwith the NY’C.  Finally, there is no open market to hedge the quality differential component of our green \ncoffee cost. We sell coffee at replacement quality differentials, and as such, in a period of falling (rising) \ndifferentials, we will generate differential cost recovery losses (gains), as green coffee revenues will be \nless than (exceed) green coffee costs.  \nThe chart below shows the movement in the NY’C for the last eight quarters: \n \nIn Q4 2022, the NY’C averaged US$1.77/lb compared to an average of US$2.20/lb in Q4 2021. In 2022, \nthe NY’C averaged US$2.13/lb compared to an average of US$1.68/lb in the same period in 2021. The rise \nand fall of the NY’C affects our volume of shipments, our revenues, our cost of sales, and our working \ncapital requirements. In an upward trending market, our customers tend to consume their inventories \nrather than build them. When the NY’C declines over a sustained period, our customers tend to add to \ntheir inventories.  \n \nUS$/C$ Exchange Rates – The majority of our (“C$”) revenues are generated in US dollars (“US$”), while \na significant portion of our costs are paid in Canadian dollars. We, therefore, have exposure to changes \nin the US$/C$ exchange rates. This is managed, in part, through derivative financial instruments. All other \nfactors being equal, our profitability and cash from operations will be higher when the US dollar \nappreciates relative to the Canadian dollar.

When the US$ depreciates \n(appreciates), it decreases (increases) our gross profit on green coffee revenues. \nOPERATING RESULTS \nRevenue \nWe categorize our customers by the nature of their business: either coffee importers or roasters. Coffee \nimporters act like grocery stores to roasters, sourcing and importing green coffee from various origins and \ncarrying a selection of different origins and quality levels for roasters to choose from. Importers buy from us \nto resell our coffees to roasters when and where they need them. Roasters are in the business of roasting and \npackaging coffee for sale to consumers in their own coffee shops, or for home or office use. Roasters either \nbuy directly from Swiss Water, or they buy from an importer. Roasters generally carry lower inventories, as \nthey tend to take delivery of green coffee shortly before roasting it. As such, when comparing period to period, \nshipments to roasters are more stable when compared to shipments to importers. \nWe also monitor and report our revenue in three categories. “Process revenue” represents the amount we \ncharge our customers for decaffeinating green coffee, and it generally increases as our processing volumes \nincrease. “Green coffee cost recovery revenue”, or “green revenue”, is the amount we charge our customers \nfor the green coffee we purchase for decaffeination. “Distribution revenue” consists of shipping, handling, \n$1.20\n$1.22\n$1.24\n$1.26\n$1.28\n$1.30\n$1.32\n$1.34\n$1.36\n$1.38\n$1.40\n31-Dec-20\n31-Jan-21\n28-Feb-21\n31-Mar-21\n30-Apr-21\n31-May-21\n30-Jun-21\n31-Jul-21\n31-Aug-21\n30-Sep-21\n31-Oct-21\n30-Nov-21\n31-Dec-21\n31-Jan-22\n28-Feb-22\n31-Mar-22\n30-Apr-22\n31-May-22\n30-Jun-22\n31-Jul-22\n31-Aug-22\n30-Sep-22\n31-Oct-22\n30-Nov-22\n31-Dec-22\nUS Dollars to Canadian Dollars \nBank of Canada Noon Rates\nDec 31, 2020 to Dec 31, 2022"

The increase was driven by volume demand from our customers, the impact of an increase in the New \nYork Arabica Futures market, and the appreciation of the US dollar. \nOur sales for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, by revenue category, are as follows: \n \nProcess revenue remained flat in Q4 and increased $6.5 million or 21% year to date. The increase \nreflects growth in our processing volumes, prices, and foreign exchange hedging activities. \n \nGreen revenue increased $7.8 million or 32% in Q4, and $41.9 million or 49% year to date. The \nincrease reflects higher green coffee sales volume and coffee futures price, NY’C, and appreciation of \nthe US dollar. \n \nDistribution revenue increased $1.1 million or 46% in Q4, and $3.5 million or 42% year to date. The \nincrease reflects higher shipment volumes, inflationary pressure on freight rates, and stronger than \nexpected capacity utilization rates in our Seaforth subsidiary. \nOur sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2022, by geographical segment, are as follows:  \n \nSales volume in North America increased 19%; \n \nSales volume in Asia-Pacific increased 10%. \nCost of Sales \nCost of sales includes the cost of green coffee purchased for our regular business, the plant labour and other \nprocessing costs directly associated with our production facility, customer-specific hedges and commodity \nhedges.

The improvement was primarily driven by higher sales volume. In addition, we benefited from a higher \ngreen coffee differential margin. \nAdministration Expenses \nAdministration includes general management, inbound and outbound logistics, finance and accounting, \nquality control and assurance, engineering, research and development, and other administrative or support \nfunctions. Administration expenses include compensation expenses, travel and other personnel-related \nexpenses for administrative staff, director fees, investor relations expenses, professional fees, depreciation \nof office-related equipment, and amortization of the brand asset. \nFor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, administration expenses totaled $1.8 million and $8.9 \nmillion respectively, a decrease of $0.3 million or 14% and an increase of $1.4 million or 19%, compared to \nthe same periods in 2021. The primary drivers of the overall increase were general inflationary pressure, \nincreased professional fees, increased headcount and salaries, and overall administrative costs associated \nwith operating two facilities, including depreciation and rental expenses. \nSales and Marketing Expenses \nSales and marketing expenses include compensation and other personnel-related expenses for sales and \nmarketing staff, consumer initiatives, trade advertising and promotion costs, as well as related travel \nexpenses. We invest in research regarding the behavior of decaffeinated coffee consumers. These insights \nenable us to create effective consumer advertising programs, and they form the foundation of the \nconsultative services we provide to our customers. We also aim to grow brand awareness with both the coffee \ntrade and consumers. We employ a range of marketing activities to achieve this, including digital and print \nadvertising, social media communications, sponsorship and exhibiting at key industry events. \nFor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, sales and marketing expenses totaled $1.2 million and \n$3.8 million respectively, an increase of $0.4 million or 47% and $0.3 million or 10%, compared to the same \nperiods in 2021.

Thus, any gain or loss on risk management activities includes only those gains and losses \non derivative financial instruments or portions of such instruments that are not designated as hedging \ninstruments. \nFor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a loss on risk management activities of $0.1 \nmillion and $1.6 million respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million and $1.2 million, compared to the same \nperiods in 2021. The main drivers for this are unrealized losses due to fluctuations in the Canadian versus US \ndollar and fluctuations in NY’C."

The overall increase primarily relates to a higher outstanding balance on our construction loans and \ncredit facility, higher variable interest rates, and higher interest rate on our debenture with warrants. \nOn July 20, 2021, we amended our convertible debenture agreement with Mill Road into a debenture with \nwarrants. Until the amendment, the interest on the 2016 convertible debenture agreement was expensed at \nan effective interest rate of 12.15% (a rate determined in accordance with IFRS), while the contractual interest \npaid on this loan was at a rate of 6.85%, causing the amortization of the bond discount to change over time. \nThe new agreement, effective July 20, 2021, with Mill Road had an effective interest rate of 16.2% and a \ncontractual interest paid rate of 9%. There is also an additional 1.5% interest calculated quarterly to be paid \nat the debt maturity date. Refer to Note 12.2 of the audited consolidated financial statements for more \ndetails. \nOn November 22, 2022, we amended our debenture with warrants with Mill Road. The new agreement had \nan effective interest rate of 18.3%. The contractual interest paid rate remained at 9% and there is still an \nadditional 1.5% interest calculated quarterly to be paid at the debt maturity date. Refer to Note 12.2 of the \naudited consolidated financial statements for more details. \nGains and Losses on Foreign Exchange \nWe realize gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies when they occur, and on assets \nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies when they are translated into Canadian dollars as at the \nfinancial statement date. \nFor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a loss on foreign exchange of $0.3 million \nand $2.2 million respectively, an increase of $0.1 million and $2.2 million, compared to the same periods in \n2021. The large swing in foreign exchange is due to fluctuation in the Canadian versus US dollar as the \nexchange rate averaged C$1.30 in 2022, compared to C$1.25 in 2021. The majority of the foreign exchange \nloss was recorded in Q3 2022. \nFair Value of Embedded Option \nBefore the agreement amendment on July 20, 2021, Swiss Water had a convertible debenture with Mill Road. \nUnder IFRS, this instrument was deemed to contain an embedded option, or derivative liability, that was \nrevalued at each balance sheet date. The fair value of the derivative liability was determined using the Black \nScholes Option Pricing Model. The variables and assumptions used in calculating the fair value are based on \nmanagement’s best estimate at each balance sheet date. \nIn 2021, Swiss Water extinguished the Mill Road convertible debenture and the embedded option was written \noff, as such there was no revaluation of the embedded option in Q4 2021. For the year 2021, there was a \nsmall loss of $0.05 million. In 2021 until extinguishment, the share price did not fluctuate as much, and as \nsuch the year to date figure was less significant."

The fair \nvalue of the derivative liability was determined using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The variables \nand assumptions used in computing the fair value are based on our best estimate at each balance sheet date. \nThe revaluation of this embedded option resulted in a gain of $0.5 million in Q4 2022.

Refer to Note 12.2 in the audited consolidated financial statements for more details on the \namended debt agreement with Mill Road. \nExtinguishment of Debt \nOn July 20, 2021, Swiss Water amended the convertible debenture agreement with Mill Road to a debenture \nwith warrants. Under IFRS 9, the accounting for the transaction depends on whether the debt restructuring \nis considered an extinguishment or an adjustment to the existing liability (“extinguishment accounting” vs \n“modification accounting”). \nGiven there is a 2.15% change in the interest rate and a replacement of the debt conversion to shares with \nwarrants, we determined that the terms within the convertible debenture and the terms within the debenture \nwith warrants are substantially different. As such, this debt restructuring transaction was accounted for using \nthe extinguishment method of accounting for debt reconstruction. During the year ended December 31, 2021, \nSwiss Water recognized a loss on extinguishment of the convertible debenture in the amount of $1.4 million. \nThe loss consists of a $0.2 million cash payment for professional fees, a loss of $1.6 million on the \nextinguishment of the liability component of the convertible debenture net of a gain of $0.4 million on the \nembedded derivative related to the conversion. \nEffective November 22, 2022, we amended our debenture with warrants with Mill Road. Under IFRS 9, the \naccounting for the transaction depends on whether the debt restructuring is considered an extinguishment \nor an adjustment to the existing liability (“extinguishment accounting” vs “modification accounting”). \nGiven the amendments included a cashless exercise option where the agreement no longer limits an exchange \nof a fixed amount of cash for a fixed amount of common shares (option allows a variable number of shares \nand no cash), this debenture with warrants restructuring transaction was accounted for using the \nextinguishment method of accounting for debt reconstruction. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, Swiss Water recognized a gain on extinguishment of the \ndebenture with warrants in the amount of $0.6 million. The gain consists of a $2.4 million gain on the \nembedded derivative related to the conversion, net of a $1.6 million loss on the extinguishment of the equity \ncomponent of the debenture with warrants and $0.2 million in professional fees. Refer to Note 12.2 in the \naudited consolidated financial statements for more details on the amended debt agreement with Mill Road. \nImpairment of Plant and Equipment \nIn 2022, Swiss Water performed an assessment of the salvageable assets associated with the Burnaby location \nfollowing the expiry of the lease, in June 2023. In accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, we identified \nindicators of impairment at the Burnaby location. While reviewing plans to dismantle the plant and \nequipment, we considered the cost and benefit and related cash flows to salvage equipment from the \nBurnaby location. It was determined that only a portion of the equipment should be salvaged for future use. \nWe also quantified the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit’s fair value less the cost of disposal"

It was determined that a $2.5 million impairment of plant and equipment \nwas required. There was no such impairment in 2021. \nIncome Before Taxes and Net Income \nNet income consists of income before tax less deferred and current income taxes. Swiss Water and its \nsubsidiaries are subject to tax in Canada, USA, and France. The current income tax expense arises as a \nreflection of increases and decreases in net income before taxes, adjusted for non-tax items. The deferred \nincome tax arises from temporary differences between the depreciation and amortization expenses deducted \nfor accounting purposes and related capital cost allowances deducted for tax purposes, timing differences on \nthe deductibility of derivatives, accruals such as asset retirement obligation, cash liabilities of the DSU and \nRSU, bond value warrants, leases, as well as changes in corporate income tax rates as adjusted for \nsubstantively enacted higher future tax rates. The latter is offset by the tax benefit of tax loss carry forwards. \nFor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a net loss before taxes of $ 0.4 million and \nnet income before tax of $3.2 million respectively, compared to a net income before taxes of $0.4 million and \n$1.0 million for the same periods in 2021. Overall, we recorded a net loss of $0.3 million and a net income of \n$2.4 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to net income of $0.2 \nmillion and $0.5 million for the same periods in 2021. \nOther Comprehensive Income \nGains or losses on our designated revenue hedges that will mature in future periods are recorded in other \ncomprehensive income, net of income tax expense. Other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, for the \nquarter and year ended December 31, 2022, was income of $0.8 million and a loss of $1.5 million respectively, \ncompared to a loss of $0.5 million and income of $0.1 million for the same periods in 2021. Increases and \ndecreases are related to fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar. \nBasic and Diluted Earnings per Share \nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the basic weighted average number of \nshares outstanding during the period. Similarly, diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net \nincome adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares, by the diluted weighted average \nnumber of shares outstanding. For the purposes of the calculation in 2022, under IFRS we are required to \nassume that the maximum number of shares issuable under the warrant agreement will be issued. \nFor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, all potential common shares issuable under the \nRSU Plan and debenture with warrants were anti-dilutive and excluded from the dilution calculation. \nThe calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are shown in the following table: \nIn 000s except for shares and per share data \n \n3 months ended December 31, \nYear ended December 31, \n(unaudited) \n \n \n2022 \n \n2021 \n \n2022 \n \n2021 \nBasic and diluted earnings per share \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNet income (loss) attributable to shareholders \n \n$ \n(254) \n$ \n241 \n$ \n2,387 \n$ \n496 \nWeighted average number of shares \n \n \n9,165,815 \n \n9,129,673 \n \n9,158,161 \n \n9,122,283 \n \n \n$ \n(0.03) \n$ \n0.03 \n$ \n0.26 \n$ \n0.05"

In both years, cash inflows from operations were mainly offset by cash outflows required for green \ninventory purchases. \nInvesting Activities \nFor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was $7.3 million and \n$24.6 million respectively, compared to net cash used of $3.0 million and $13.7 million for the same periods \nin 2021. In both years, this was driven by capital expenditures associated with the second production line in \nDelta. During the first half of 2022, we also recovered $1.3 million in cash from vendor reimbursements, which \nis related to equipment on the first production line in Delta (2021: nil). During the third quarter of 2022, we \nreceived a $0.1 million energy efficiency cash incentive from a gas utility company (2021: nil). \nFinancing Activities \nFor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, net cash generated from financing activities was $8.9 \nmillion and $25.2 million respectively, compared to net cash generated of $11.6 million and $21.6 million for \nthe same periods in 2021. In both years, this was driven by proceeds, net of repayment, from our credit facility \nand construction loans. \nDuring the year 2022, Swiss Water renegotiated its credit facilities, construction loan and debenture with \nwarrants with the purpose to expand on available funding for capital expansions in Delta, BC and to support \ngrowth and operations. Swiss Water has successfully completed the expansion of its credit facilities with its \nexisting senior lenders, resulting in $33.25 million of incremental capital availability, consisting of $21.25 \nmillion of expanded revolving credit capacity and $12.0 million of incremental senior term financing. Swiss \nWater incurred financing expenditures in the amount of $0.8 million of which $0.4 million was paid by \nDecember 31, 2022.  \nIn Q4 2021, Swiss Water renegotiated its Mill Road borrowings from convertible debenture to debenture with \nwarrants. The Company recognized an extinguishment of debt related to the convertible debenture, of which \n$1.2 million was a non-cash write-off of the convertible debenture bond value and the value of non-cash \nderivative related to the conversion option. Associated with this, Swiss Water paid $0.2 million in debt \nfinancing transaction costs. No cash was received for the $2.5 million of warrants issued for debenture with \nwarrants and financing costs to issue these warrants were $0.03 million.  \nInventory \nOur inventory increased by $24.9 million or 71% between December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2022. The \nincrease reflects a higher NY’C combined with a higher volume of coffee inventory on hand and a higher \nexchange rate. Inventory consists of coffee, hedges related to NY’C, and foreign exchange, as well as carbon \nused in production, and packaging. \nUnder hedge accounting, gains and losses on derivative instruments for coffee to be sold in future periods \nare recorded in inventory.

The majority of past due \namounts were collected shortly after quarter end. Accounts receivable consist of receivables from customers. \nCredit Facilities \nWe have arranged for two credit facilities, one with a major Canadian Bank and the other with Export \nDevelopment Canada (“EDC”). Our facilities are collateralized by general security agreements over all of the \nassets of Swiss Water and a floating hypothecation agreement over cash balances. As at December 31, 2022, \nthe balance due on the Credit facility with a Canadian bank is $38.1 million and the Swiss Water incurred $1.4 \nmillion in interest expense (2021: $23.3 million and $$0.4 million). Meanwhile, no funds were drawn from the \nEDC credit facility. \nWe have certain bank covenants that relate to the maintenance of specified financial ratios, and as of \nDecember 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants. \nCredit Facility with Canadian Bank \nIn 2019, Swiss Water entered into a revolving credit facility agreement (“Credit Facility”), with a major \nCanadian bank, for borrowings up to the lower of the Borrowing Base (defined below) and $30.0 million. \nEffective November 22, 2022, the available credit was increased from $30.0 million to $45.0 million with the \npurpose to support operations and growth. In tandem, this Credit facility lending provided additional lending \nof up to $6.25 million credit facility through EDC. The maturity date of October 18, 2022, was extended to the \nearlier of October 19, 2025, and the maturity of the debenture with warrants, October 31, 2024. \nSwiss Water is not required to repay any balance outstanding until maturity, as long as the outstanding \nbalance is not in excess of the Borrowing Base. \nThe Credit Facility’s Borrowing Base margins Swiss Water’s eligible inventories and accounts receivable, \ncommodity hedging account equity margin plus its market-to-market gains, which are netted against any \nlosses in the commodity account and foreign exchange contract facility.  Amounts can be drawn in either \nCanadian or in US dollars and can be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed to fund operations, capital \nexpansions, letters of credit, a security lien bond, and for general corporate purposes. \nThe Credit Facility has multiple interest rate options that are based on the Canadian Prime Rate, Base Rate, \nLIBO Rate, Bankers’ Acceptance Rate plus an acceptance fee, in addition to an Applicable Margin for each of \nthese rates.  Fees apply to outstanding letters of credit and the unused portion of the credit. \nAs part of the Credit Facility, Swiss Water has a US$8.0 million foreign exchange and commodity futures \ncontract facility, which allows Swiss Water to enter into spot, forward and other foreign exchange rate \ntransactions and commodity futures transactions with the bank with a maximum term of up to 60 months. \nCredit Facility with EDC \nEDC offers two services, a credit facility of up to $6.25 million and a $6.0 million foreign exchange guarantee. \nEffective November 22, 2022, Swiss Water entered into a revolving credit facility agreement with EDC (the \n“EDC Credit”) for borrowings of up to $6.25 million.

Amounts drawn on the EDC Credit bear interest at the Canadian Prime Rate \nplus 1.5% per annum.  The EDC Credit is subject to certain fees. The EDC Credit facility will terminate on the \nearliest of: (i) demand by the lender of the Credit Facility for repayment, (ii) the first anniversary of the \neffective date, and (iii) the maturity date under the Credit Facility. Bank may in its sole discretion, renew the \nEDC Credit for a maximum of five successive one-year periods after the first anniversary of the effective date. \nAs at December 31, 2022, no amounts were drawn on EDC Credit. \nOn June 1, 2020, Swiss Water entered into a foreign exchange facility guarantee with EDC to cover margin \nrequirements in relation to the foreign exchange facility. On August 4, 2020, the Company’s Credit Facility \nLender amended the credit agreement to recognize the foreign exchange facility guarantee provided by the \nthird party. The facility guarantees a maximum aggregate liability of up to $6.0 million and it is valid until May \n31, 2023. This guarantee provides additional borrowing capacity within the referenced credit facility. \nConstruction Loan with BDC and FCC \nIn Q4 2018, we completed a transaction with the Business Development Bank of Canada (“BDC”) for a term \nloan facility (“Term Loan”) of up to $20.0 million. The purpose of the Term Loan was to assist in the financing \nof new equipment for the first production line built in Delta, British Columbia. The interest rate for the Term \nLoan was 4.95% per annum over 12 years. Principal repayment was scheduled to begin on July 1, 2021 and \nmatures on June 1, 2033. \nOn June 3, 2021, we completed a financing transaction by increasing the existing term to $45.0 million from \nthe existing $20.0 million to provide funding for the planned construction of a second production line at the \nDelta location. The financing was provided by Business Development Corp (“BDC”) and Farm Credit Canada \n(“FCC”) in a Pari Passu structure. Each lender will fund 50% of the $45.0 million total loan value. The original \nborrowing with BDC will increase from $20.0 million to $22.5 million (“BDC Amended Term Loan”) and FCC \nwill also fund $22.5 million (“FCC Term Loan”). Upon closing of the transaction, Swiss Water’s outstanding \ndebt to each party, FCC and BDC, was $10 million. FCC paid $10.0 million to BDC on Swiss Water’s behalf to \nensure that existing borrowings were restructured on a Pari Passu basis. \nOnly interest will be paid on the outstanding balance on a monthly basis prior to July 1, 2024, for both the \nBDC Amended Term Loan and FCC Term Loan. Principal repayments for both loans commence on July 1, 2024 \nand will be repaid in monthly installments until both loans mature on June 1, 2034. \nThe FCC Term Loan consists of a fixed term loan and a variable loan. Until maturity, the fixed term loan bears \nan interest rate of 4.38% and the variable loan bears an interest rate of a variable rate minus 0.75%. \nThe BDC Amended Term Loan bears an interest rate of 4.45% until maturity. The new terms in the BDC \nAmended Term Loan supersede the terms on the previous agreement. \nBoth loans are secured by a general security agreement and a first security interest on all existing equipment \nand machinery plus new equipment and machinery financed with the BDC and FCC construction loans.  \nSeaforth has provided a guarantee for construction loans to FCC and BDC. As of December 31, 2022, the \nconstruction loan amount outstanding was $38.3 million. \nEffective November 22, 2022, Swiss Water entered into an amendment (the “Amended Senior Facility”) to \nthe existing senior debt facility with our two lenders, BDC and FCC, which will provide an additional $12.0 \nmillion of senior debt financing at a favourable payment, interest rate and amortization schedule by increasing \nthe senior debt facility from $45.0 million to $57.0 million.

Under the new terms of the agreement, the maturity date was \nextended by one year from October 11, 2023, to October 31, 2024. The other amended terms were: (i) the \ninterest rate increased from a maximum of 7.85% to 9%, (ii) a 1.5% additional interest “payment in kind” was \nadded, (iii) the debt to shares conversion feature was amended, and (iv) the senior debt covenant was \nincreased from $45.0 million to $60.0 million. The debt to shares conversion was amended by (a) cancelling \nthe existing conversion feature and (b) replacing the existing conversion feature with warrants to allow Mill \nRoad to purchase up to 2.25 million common shares at a price of $3.33 per share. The warrants expire on \nOctober 31, 2024. \nWe determined that this modification should be considered an extinguishment as the terms of the agreement \nwere substantially different given there was a 2.15% change in the interest rate and a replacement of the \nconversion shares with warrants and we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $1.4 \nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021.  \nThe warrants were recorded as a component of equity as they would be settled by the exchange of a fixed \namount of cash for a fixed number of Swiss Water’s equity and would not be subsequently remeasured. The \nwarrants were valued at $2.5 million using the Black Scholes model. \nEffective November 22, 2022, Swiss Water amended the debenture with warrants agreement to (i) expand \non the Senior Debt restricted covenant; (ii) allow Swiss Water a right to prepay the principal, and (iii) add \nsecondary security on the debenture (iv) increase the senior debt limit to $123.25 million. The original \nprincipal of $15.0 million and the maturity date of October 31, 2024 remain the same. Also, the interest on \nthe debenture remains unchanged, at 9% paid quarterly plus 1.5% interest in kind accrued quarterly. \nMeanwhile, the warrants agreement to issue 2.25 million warrants, with an exercise price of $3.33 was \namended (i) to extend the maturity date from October 31, 2024, to April 30, 2026; and (ii) to add a cashless \nexercise option whereby Mill Road may elect to receive, upon exercise, such number of shares that is equal \nto the difference between the $3.33 exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the time of \nexercise. \nFollowing the negotiations in 2022, Swiss Water extinguished the 2021 debenture with warrants with Mill \nRoad.  Given that amendments included a cashless exercise option where the agreement no longer limits an \nexchange of a fixed amount of cash for a fixed amount of common shares (subject to terms, the option allows \na variable number of shares being issued), this debenture with warrants restructuring transaction was \naccounted for using the extinguishment method of accounting for debt reconstruction. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, Swiss Water recognized a $0.5 million gain on the extinguishment \nof debt in net income and it includes financing transaction costs in the amount of $0.2 million."

These risks and how Swiss Water manages them are described in the AIF. The future effect of \nthese risks and uncertainties cannot be quantified or predicted. \nFollowing the emergence of conflict in Ukraine in late February 2022, many countries enacted sanctions \nagainst Russia and the supply of some commodities from Russia, such as natural gas, has been interrupted. \nPotential consequences of these sanctions and commodity interruptions that could impact our business are \nnot limited to: 1) demand for our products 2) delays in transportation to customers within Europe, 3) increase \nof costs in fertilizers or supply components, thus increasing the costs of our coffee inventory, 4) decaffeinating \ncoffee in Europe may become more expensive if traditional fuel sources are curtailed.  Some North American \ncustomers, currently sourcing from European suppliers, may consider switching to Swiss Water as it can be \nsourced closer to their market, and 5) overall supply chain interruptions. At this time there is uncertainty over \nthe full impact of the conflict in Europe, as such, we cannot provide assurance that this conflict will not affect \nour business and further expansions into the European market. \nSwiss Water’s operations may be negatively impacted in the event of a local or global outbreak of disease, \nsuch as the coronavirus, COVID-19 outbreak pandemic declared in March 2020. A pandemic may impact \ndemand for our products and services and the capability of our supply chains. It may also impact expected \ncredit losses on our amounts due from customers and whether the entity continues to meet the criteria for \nhedge accounting. For example, if a hedged forecast transaction is no longer highly probable to occur, hedge \naccounting would be discontinued. \nRisks are also discussed in detail in the ‘Financial Risk Management’ note in our audited consolidated financial \nstatements. Furthermore, in this management discussion and analysis, we discuss risk under the headings \n‘Hedge Accounting’ and ‘Financial Instruments’. \nENVIRONMENTAL RISKS \nThe Canadian Securities Administrators (“CSA”) identifies five categories of risks: litigation, physical, \nregulatory, reputational and business model, for which issuers are asked to identify material risks and if they \nare reasonably likely to affect financial statements in the future. \nEnvironmental matters relate to a broad range of issues, including those related to air, water, waste and land.  \nAs a small company with limited human and financial resources, we focus on only those risks that we believe \ncould have a materially adverse impact on our operations and/or financial results within our planning horizon, \nrather than seeking to identify all possible future risks.  Risk assessment involves judgment, uncertainty and \nestimates, which can provide only reasonable, rather than an absolute, assurance that all the applicable risks \nand their expected impacts on Swiss Water are considered. \nThe most pervasive environmental risks that we face relate to the fact that we buy, sell and store an \nagricultural commodity.  The supply of green coffee can be impacted by numerous environmental conditions \nsuch as frosts, drought, plant disease and insect damage, which can impact the quality and size of the coffee \ncrop.  In addition, certain environmental conditions, such as excessive rains, can hamper crop harvesting.  A \nshortage of coffee can impact our processing volumes and revenues.  We seek to mitigate the risks of coffee \nshortages by maintaining an extensive list of coffee suppliers; by dealing with importers who themselves have \nmultiple suppliers rather than contracting directly with farmers or coffee co-operative organizations; by \nmaintaining up to three months of coffee inventories at any time; by developing and modifying coffee blends"

In \naddition, the coffee commodity price is closely tied to available supplies of coffee globally.  We mitigate the \ncommodity price risk through our commodity price risk management policy. \nOur leased facilities are located in the Metro Vancouver area of British Columbia.  Vancouver is considered to \nbe at high risk of a major earthquake and flooding.  Any significant earthquake in the vicinity could have a \nmaterial impact on our operations for a period of time, depending on the extent of the damage to the \nfacilities, our equipment, and the transportation infrastructure in the region.  In short, a major earthquake \ncould have a material adverse impact on our revenues.  We carry property and business interruption \ninsurance, including earthquake coverage, which would help offset the cash flow impact of such an event.  In \naddition, we keep some finished goods inventory in third-party coffee warehouses in other regions, and we \nwould be able to sell these finished goods even if our production and distribution of coffee were temporarily \ninterrupted by an earthquake.  Nevertheless, the financial and operational impact of a major earthquake \ncannot be reasonably predicted. \nWe are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations related to our facilities in British Columbia, \nwhich mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality.  We routinely monitor our \ncompliance with these standards.  Based on our compliance record and our maintenance programs, as well \nas currently enacted laws and regulations, we do not believe that these regulatory risks are material. \nWe expect to incur increased costs for energy and water consumption over time.  If we cannot pass on such \nincreased costs to our customers, our profitability may be adversely impacted. \nWe believe that all known environmental obligations and provisions have been appropriately reflected in our \nfinancial statements.  We have not identified any material litigation, reputational, or business model risks \nrelated to environmental matters.  Nevertheless, we may be subject to potential unknown or unforeseeable \nenvironmental impacts arising from, or related to, our business.  Costs associated with such issues could be \nmaterial. \nWe believe that the trend toward increased environmental awareness creates an opportunity for us to grow \nour business, as consumers and coffee industry participants place greater emphasis on reducing their impact \non the environment.  As one of the few chemical free decaffeinators in the world, we believe that an increased \nfocus on environmental matters will allow us to win more business from decaffeinators that use chemicals \nsuch as methylene chloride to decaffeinate coffee. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES \nMeasurement of Uncertainty \nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires us to make estimates and \nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the \ndate of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting \nperiod.  Estimates are used when accounting for asset retirement obligations, useful lives of depreciable \nassets, share-based compensation, debenture with warrants with embedded derivatives, convertible debt \nwith embedded derivatives and income taxes.  Actual results may be different from these estimates. \nEffective January 1, 2019, we adopted IFRS 16 Leases in accounting for leases of our offices, warehouses, and \nequipment. Estimates and assumptions were made and applied, including the useful lives of right-of-use \nassets and the implicit borrowing rates. The useful lives of right-of-use assets are estimated to be the length"

The weighted average implicit borrowing rate is 4.92% \nper annum which was based on borrowing rates available to the Company. \nAn accounting estimate is deemed critical only if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that are \nhighly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and different estimates that we could have used \nin the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \nProperty, Plant, Equipment and Intangible Asset \nProperty, plant and equipment, and intangible assets with finite lives that are subject to depreciation or \namortization are tested for impairment indicators at the end of each reporting period. If any such indicator \nexists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment \nloss.  In 2022, Swiss Water performed an assessment of the salvageable assets associated with the Burnaby \nlocation following the expiry of the lease, in June 2023. In accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, Swiss \nWater identified qualitative and quantitative indicators of impairment at the Burnaby location. While \nreviewing plans to dismantle the plant and equipment, we worked with a third-party engineering consultancy \nand considered the probability of near term future use, cost, benefit and related cash flows to salvage \nequipment from the Burnaby location. It was determined that only a portion of the equipment should be \nsalvaged for future use. We also quantified the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit’s fair value \nless the cost of disposal using the “value in-use” method. It was determined that a $2.5 million impairment \nof plant and equipment was required, as shown in the non-operating section of the Consolidated Statements \nof Income. \nAfter recognizing the impairment, the amortization of the remaining salvaged assets is to be adjusted in future \nperiods to allocate the assets’ revised carrying amount on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. \nUseful lives of depreciable assets – change in accounting estimates \nThe Company reduced the estimated useful life of its production line machinery and equipment at the \nBurnaby location from 10 years to the expiry of the lease term (June 2023). This change in accounting estimate \nwas accounted for prospectively and results from the decision to cease the two production lines in Burnaby \nBC when the Company exits the lease in June 2023 and the impact of this change is de minimis in 2022. \nAsset Retirement Obligation \nThe future value of the asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) with respect to our leased decaffeination facilities \nis estimated at $6.2 million.  This estimate assumes that we relocate from the current locations upon expiry \nof the lease in Burnaby, in 2023, at an estimated cost of $1.5 million, and the expiry of lease before renewal \nin 2038 for the two lines in Delta, BC at an estimated cost of $4.7 million. Further, the estimate reflects the \nexpected costs of vacating the leased facility in 2023 and 2038 respectively, having regard for the contract \nlanguage in the lease, the expected useful lives of our plant and equipment, and the expected costs that \nwould be paid to a third party to remove equipment. \nIncome Taxes \nWe compute income taxes using the liability method, under which deferred income taxes are provided for \nthe temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities.  \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted and substantively enacted income tax rates \nthat are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected \nto be recovered or settled."

As at December 31, \n2022, Swiss Water and its subsidiaries had combined non-capital tax loss carryforwards totaling $19.8 million, \nwhich can be used to reduce income taxes payable in future years. \nThe financial reporting bases of our assets reflect the useful lives of depreciable assets, as well as the carrying \namounts of assets with indefinite useful lives.  Accordingly, management estimates that impact the carrying \namounts of depreciable and non-depreciable assets also have an impact on deferred income tax assets and \nliabilities. \nLeases and Right-of-Use Assets \nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that Swiss Water’s management make \nassumptions and estimates on its finance leases.

This embedded option is a financial liability and was recognized initially at $1.9 million effective on \nNovember 22, 2022, and is subsequently revaluated at each reporting date.

To \nminimize these risks, we follow our risk management program, which is carried out under two policies \napproved by the Board of Directors: The Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy and the Commodity Price \nRisk Management Policy.  With the use of derivative financial instruments, we hedge potential adverse effects \non our financial performance and cash flows. Under the risk management program, we enter into three types \nof hedges and each type is discussed below: \n1) Commodity price risk hedges on coffee purchase commitments and coffee inventory (“commodity \nhedges”); \n2) Currency risk hedges related to US$ denominated future process revenues (“revenue hedges”);  \n3) Currency risk hedges related to US$ denominated purchases of green coffee (“purchase hedges”); \n4) Currency risk hedges related to US$ denominated purchases of property, plant and equipment \n(“purchase hedges”). \nCommodity Hedges \nWhen we enter into a purchase commitment to buy green coffee, the contract specifies that the purchase \nprice will be based, in part, on the future (to-be-determined) coffee futures price, or NY’C. We agree on or \n‘fix’ the NY’C price with the vendor on or before receiving the coffee into inventory. When we bear the \neconomic risk of a change in the commodity price, we offset this risk by selling short a futures contract on the \nIntercontinental Exchange. When we later sell such coffee at a fixed price to a customer, we cover our short \nby going long on a futures contract on the Intercontinental Exchange. \nAt each period-end, commodity hedges are re-measured to their fair value. Under hedge accounting, gains \n/losses for hedged coffee purchase commitments and inventory are recorded in the statement of financial \nposition until such coffee is sold at which time the gains/losses on our commodity hedges are recognized in \ncost of sales. In this way, gains/losses on our commodity hedges are matched to our sales in the period. \nRevenue Hedges \nWe enter into forward contracts to sell US$ at future dates to hedge the foreign exchange cash flow variability \nof expected US$ processing fee revenue up to 60 months in advance.  The hedged process revenue includes \nboth process revenue from tolling arrangements (processing of customer-owned coffee) as well as the US$ \nprocessing fee layer of inventory sales agreements. This enables us to more reliably predict how much \nCanadian currency we will receive for our US$ process revenue. Cash flows in the immediate 12-month period \nare hedged at a higher percentage of expected future revenues than those farther out, reflecting greater \nuncertainty in the 13 to 60-month period. \nAt each period end, revenue hedges are re-measured to their fair value. Under hedge accounting, unrealized \ngains/losses for open revenue hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income. When a revenue hedge \nmatures, the realized gain/loss on that contract is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income \nto process revenue."

Similarly, on occasions, we enter into forward \ncontracts to buy US$ to be used to pay for purchases of equipment. To mitigate the exposure to margin \nchanges on these transactions arising from fluctuations in the US$/C$ exchange rate, we enter into US$ \nforward purchase contracts which economically lock in the US$/C$ exchange rate, and effectively locks in the \nC$ cost of inventory to be sold at the fixed C$ amount. \nThe hedge accounting allows for a matching of US$ purchases with the associated gains/losses on the forward \ncontracts used to economically hedge these items.  At each period-end, customer-specific hedges are re-\nmeasured to their fair value.  Under hedge accounting, the gains/losses on these hedges are deferred on the \nstatement of financial position until the inventory is sold, at which time the gains/losses are recorded in cost \nof sales on the income statement.  Similarly, hedges related to property plant and equipment are re-measured \nat each period end and once the hedges mature the gains and losses on these hedges are recorded in property \nplant and equipment. \nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \nWe use financial instruments to mitigate economic risks associated with our business. The three types of \nhedges we enter into, and the hedging instruments used, are discussed in more detail under ‘Hedge \nAccounting’ above. \nWe classify our financial assets and financial liabilities in the following measurement categories (i) those to \nbe measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income or through profit or \nloss); and (ii) those to be measured at amortized cost. We have implemented the following classifications for \nfinancial instruments other than derivatives: \n \nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as assets at fair value and any period \nchange in fair value is recorded through interest income in the consolidated statement of income, as \napplicable. \n \nAccounts receivable and other receivables are classified as assets at amortized cost using the effective \ninterest rate method. Interest income is recorded in the consolidated statement of income, as applicable. \n \nAccounts payable, credit facilities, the debt portion of the debenture with warrants/convertible \ndebenture and other liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities and are measured at amortized \ncost using the effective interest rate method.  Interest expense is recorded in the consolidated statement \nof income, as applicable. \nCommodity Price Risk \nCommodity price risk is the risk that the fair value of inventory will fluctuate as a result of changes in \ncommodity prices.  Swiss Water utilizes futures contracts to manage our commodity price exposure.  We buy \nand sells futures contracts for coffee on the Intercontinental Exchange in order to offset its inventory position \nand fix the input cost of green coffee.  As at December 31, 2022, Swiss Water had futures contracts to buy \n16.8 million lbs of green coffee with a notional value of US$27.1 million, and contracts to sell 26.8 million lbs \nof green coffee with a notional value of US$43.4 million. The furthest contract matures in September 2023 \n(2021: buy 1.7 million lbs of green coffee with a notional value of US$3.1 million, and contracts to sell 11.8 \nmillion lbs of green coffee with a notional value of US$25.1 million).

Swiss Water enters into forward foreign currency contracts to \nmanage our exposure to currency rate fluctuations and to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations \non business decisions. \nAs at December 31, 2022, Swiss Water had forward currency contracts to buy US$7.1 million and sell US$54.8 \nmillion (2021: buy US$8.0 million and sell US$47.7 million) from January 2023 through to September 2025 at \nvarious Canadian exchange rates ranging from $1.26 to $1.37. An estimated CAD 1 cent decrease in the value \nof US dollar would have resulted in an estimated gain of $0.5 million to the net income and other \ncomprehensive income before tax, and vice versa. \nAs at December 31, 2022, Swiss Water designated as hedging instruments nil in forward contracts to buy US \ndollars, with the purpose to purchase equipment for the new production line (2021: US$1.0 million). As at \nDecember 31, 2022, we designated as hedging instruments US$40.2 million in forward contracts to sell US \ndollars, which relate to highly probable forecasted sales revenue (2021: US$27.3 million). \nINTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING & DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND \nPROCEDURES \nThe Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of Swiss Water are responsible for \nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) to provide reasonable \nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for \nexternal purposes in accordance with IFRS.  Under the supervision and with the participation of management, \nwe conducted an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our ICFR as of December 31, 2022, based on \nthe updated framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission \n(“COSO 2013”). Based on this assessment, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, Swiss \nWater’s ICFR was effective. \nThe CEO and CFO are also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and \nprocedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to provide \nreasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in documents filed or submitted under \nsecurities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in \nsecurities legislation and includes controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to \nbe disclosed in documents filed or submitted under securities legislation is accumulated and communicated \nto Swiss Water’s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding \nrequired disclosure. \nThe CEO and CFO evaluated or caused to be evaluated under supervision, the effectiveness of our disclosure \ncontrols and procedures and based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, \n2022, Swiss Water’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There were no changes in our ICFR \nthat occurred during the period beginning on January 1, 2022, and ended on December 31, 2022, that have \nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Swiss Water’s ICFR."

As well, \nthe Company designates derivative financial \ninstruments as hedging instruments and the \nchange in fair value of designated purchase \ncommitments as hedged items in a fair value \nhedge relationship to manage the risk of changes \nin foreign exchange. At each period end, \nmanagement calculates the effective portion of the \nchanges in the fair value of the hedging \ninstruments and hedged items, which are \nrecorded in the consolidated statement of income \nand in inventory, and derivative assets/liabilities \nand hedged firm commitments. The Company’s \nhedging instruments designated in a fair value \nrelationship amounted to $3.3 million (derivative \nassets of $3.4 million and derivative liabilities of \n$0.1 million) as at December 31, 2022.  \nThe Company also designates derivative financial \ninstruments as hedging instruments and \ndesignates highly probable forecasted sales \nrevenue as hedged items in a cash flow hedge \nrelationship to manage the foreign exchange risk \nassociated with the cash flows of highly probable \nforecast transactions. The portion of the \ngains/losses on the hedging instruments \nOur approach to addressing the matter included \nthe following procedures, among others: \n\nObtained the Company’s documented risk \nmanagement objective and strategy for \nundertaking the hedge. \n\nAssessed the appropriateness of \nmanagement’s hedge documentation and \neligibility of hedge designation.  \n\nTested the operating effectiveness of relevant \ninternal controls related to management’s \nhedge designations.  \n\nAssessed the ongoing hedge effectiveness by \nevaluating if there are any changes in the \neconomic relationships between the hedged \nitem and hedging instrument.  \n\nEvaluated management’s assessment that the \nhedged forecasted sales revenue is highly \nprobable by comparing to historical results. \n\nTested the completeness, accuracy and \nexistence of underlying hedging instruments \nand hedged items outstanding as at year-end \nused in management’s calculations on a \nsample basis, which included confirming with \nthird parties and inspecting the underlying \ncontracts.  \n\nWith the assistance of professionals with \nspecialized skill and knowledge: \n\nrecalculated measurements of hedge \nineffectiveness as at December 31, 2022; \n\nrecalculated the fair value adjustments \nfrom the change in fair value of the \nhedging instruments and hedged items as \nat December 31, 2022; and  \n\nrecalculated the gains/losses on the cash \nflow hedging instruments. \n\nTraced the hedge accounting adjustments to \nthe related financial statement line items."

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a \nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards \nwill always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and \nare considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence \nthe economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, \nwhether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and \nobtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of \nnot detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, \nas fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of \ninternal control. \n\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control. \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management."

The adoption of these revised standards by the Company did not have a material \nimpact on its consolidated financial statements. \n \nIFRS 1 amended the exemption in IFRS 1.D16(a) to allow a subsidiary adopting IFRS at a later \ndate than its parent to also measure cumulative translation differences using the amounts \nreported by the parent based on the parent’s date of transition to IFRS. \n \nIFRS 3 – Reference to Conceptual Framework was amended to (i) replace references to the 2001 \nConceptual Framework for Financial Reporting to the 2018 Conceptual Framework for Financial \nReporting in order to determine what constitutes an asset or liability in a business combination, \n(ii) add a new exception for certain liabilities and contingent liabilities to refer to IAS 37 or IFRIC \n21 rather than the 2018 Conceptual Framework, and (iii) clarify that an acquirer should not \nrecognize contingent assets at the acquisition date. \n \nIFRS 9 was amended to address which fees should be included in the 10% test for derecognition \nof financial liability.  \n \nIFRS 16 amended illustrative example 13 to remove the illustration of payments from the lessor \nrelated to leasehold improvements. \n \nIAS 16 – Proceeds before intended use was amended to (i) prohibit an entity from deducting \nfrom the cost of an item of PP&E any proceeds received from selling items produced while the \nentity is preparing the asset for its intended use (for example, the proceeds from selling samples \nproduced when testing a machine to see if it is functioning properly), (ii) clarify that an entity is \n“testing whether the asset is functioning properly” when it assesses the technical and physical \nperformance of the asset and (iii) require certain related disclosures. \n \nIAS 37 – Onerous contracts – Cost of fulfilling a contract was amended to clarify (i) the meaning \nof “costs to fulfil a contract”, and (ii) that, before a separate provision for an onerous contract \nis established, an entity recognizes any impairment loss that has occurred on assets used in \nfulfilling the contract, rather than on assets dedicated to that contract. \n3.5 \nChanges in accounting standards not yet effective \nThese standards are effective for periods beginning after January 1, 2023 and the Company does not \nanticipate a material impact on its financial statements: \n \nIFRS 1 was amended to require companies to recognize deferred tax on particular transactions \nthat, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary \ndifferences. The consequential amendment to IFRS 1 is to add an exception to retrospective \napplication. \n \nIAS 1 has changes to accounting policy disclosures in changes in estimates vs accounting policies. \n \nIAS 1 was amended to clarify how to classify debt and other liabilities as either current or non-\ncurrent. This standard defers the effective date of previous amendments to IAS 1 to years \nbeginning after January 1, 2024. \n \nIAS 8 contains a narrow scope of amendments to improve accounting policy disclosures and to \ndistinguish changes in accounting estimates from changes in accounting policies. \n \nIAS 12 was amended to require companies to recognize deferred tax on transactions that, on \ninitial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences."

A business segment \nis a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and \nreturns that are different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment reflects the \nprovision of products or services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and \nreturns that are different from those of other economic environments. The Company’s sales are primarily \ngenerated in a single business segment of decaffeination of green coffee beans. The chief operating \ndecision makers examine the Company’s performance and operating activities of the single business \nsegment from a reported geographic perspective. \n3.7 \nForeign currency translation \nFunctional and presentation currency \nItems included in the consolidated financial statements of each of the Company’s subsidiaries are \nmeasured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates (“the \nfunctional currency”). The functional and presentation currency of Swiss Water is the Canadian dollar.  \nThe functional currencies of the USA and the European subsidiaries are the United States dollar and the \nEuro, respectively. \nForeign currency transactions \nForeign currency transactions and balances are translated as follows: (i) monetary assets and liabilities \ndenominated in foreign currencies are translated to Canadian dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at \nthe reporting date; (ii) non-monetary items which are measured using historical cost in a foreign currency \nare translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction; (iii) non-monetary items that are \nmeasured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the \nfair value was determined; and (iv) foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional \ncurrency of the entity at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.  Foreign exchange \ngains and losses are recognized in net income and presented in the consolidated statement of income in \naccordance with the nature of the transactions to which the foreign currency gains and losses relate, in \nthe period in which they occur. \nForeign operations \nForeign operations are translated from their functional currencies into Canadian dollars on consolidation \nas follows: (i) assets and liabilities for each consolidated statement of financial position presented are \ntranslated at the closing rate at the date of the consolidated statement of financial position; (ii) income \nand expenses for each statement of loss are translated at a quarterly average exchange rate (unless this \nrate is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction \ndates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); (iii) share capital \nfor each consolidated statement of financial position presented are translated at historical rate; and (iv) \nall resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income as cumulative \ntranslation adjustments. Exchange differences that arise relating to long-term intercompany balances that \nform part of the net investment in a foreign operation are also recognized in this separate component of \nequity through other comprehensive income."

Bank overdrafts are shown within \nborrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position. \n3.9 \nInventories \nRaw materials are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a specific identification basis, and net \nrealizable value, being the estimated selling price of finished goods less the estimated cost of completion \nof the finished goods. \nFinished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of finished goods includes all \nexpenses directly attributable to the manufacturing process like direct labour and direct materials, as well \nas suitable portions of related fixed and variable production overheads, based on normal operating \ncapacity.  Costs of ordinarily interchangeable items are assigned on a first-in first-out basis.  Net realizable \nvalue is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling \nexpenses. \n3.10 Property, plant and equipment \nThe Company leases facilities that house its production facilities, offices and warehouse facilities.  \nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at acquisition cost or manufacturing cost less depreciation and \nimpairment losses.  Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition \nof the items, costs related to interest on the lease liability and depreciation of right-of-use assets relating \nto leased properties.  Cost may also include asset retirement obligations and transfers from the equity of \nany gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and \nequipment. Subsequent costs are recognized in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate \nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will \nflow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.  All other repairs and maintenance \nexpenditures are recognized in the consolidated statement of income during the financial period in which \nthey are incurred. \nBorrowing costs directly attributed to the construction of any qualifying asset, are capitalized during the \nperiod of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. \nMajor renovations are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset or to the date of the \nnext major renovation, whichever is sooner. \nThe costs related to the property, plant and equipment in the course of construction are classified as \nconstruction-in-progress.  Such items are transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and \nequipment when they are completed and ready for use as intended. Depreciation of these assets \ncommences when the asset is available for use. \nDepreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis to allocate the cost or valuation of each asset to its \nresidual value over its estimated useful life commencing when the asset is ready for its intended use.  The \nestimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows: \nBuilding  \n \nto the expiry of the lease renewal option or lease term \nRight-of-use assets \nto the expiry of the lease renewal option or lease term"

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s \ncarrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are \ndetermined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts.  These are included in profit or loss. \nFor additional policies related to Right-of-use assets, refer to ‘Lease liabilities and right of use assets’. \n3.11 Intangible assets \nProprietary process technology (“PPT”) \nPPT represents intangible assets of Swiss Water with a finite life and is carried at cost less accumulated \namortization.  Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis to allocate the cost of PPT to its residual \nvalue over its estimated useful life of 14 years. \nBrand \nSwiss Water’s brand has a finite useful life and is carried at cost less accumulated amortization. \nAmortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of 14 years. \n3.12 Impairment of assets \nProperty, plant and equipment, and intangible assets with finite lives, that are subject to depreciation or \namortization, are tested for impairment indicators at the end of each reporting period.  If any such \nindicator exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the \nimpairment loss. \nAn impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or cash-\ngenerating unit (“CGU”) exceeds its recoverable amount. The Company has determined that it has two \nCGUs and that all assets relate to those CGUs.  To determine the recoverable amount, management \nestimates either the fair value less costs to sell, or the value-in-use based on the present value of expected \nfuture cash flows from the CGU. In estimating the value-in-use, management must determine the \nappropriate discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows, as well as make \ncertain assumptions about future profits which relate to future events and circumstances. Discount factors \nare determined individually for each asset, or CGU, and reflect their respective risk profiles as assessed by \nmanagement. \n3.13 Financial instruments \nIFRS 9 requires the classification and measurement of financial assets and for all recognized financial \nassets to be measured at amortized cost or fair value in subsequent accounting periods following initial \nrecognition. IFRS 9 also outlines the treatment of hedge accounting and introduces a single, forward-\nlooking expected credit loss impairment model."

There was no change to the measurement category for financial liabilities at \namortized cost. \nClassification \nThe Company classifies its financial assets and financial liabilities in the following measurement categories: \na) those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income or \nthrough profit or loss) and \nb) those to be measured at amortized cost. \nThe classification of financial assets depends on the business model for managing the financial assets and \nthe contractual terms of the cash flows.  Financial liabilities are classified as those to be measured at \namortized cost unless they are designated as those to be measured subsequently at fair value through \nprofit or loss (“FVPL”) (irrevocable election at the time of recognition). \nFor assets and liabilities measured at fair value, gains and losses are either recorded in profit or loss or \nother comprehensive income. The Company reclassifies financial assets when and only when its business \nmodel for managing those assets changes.  Financial liabilities are not reclassified. \nThe Company has implemented the following classifications for financial instruments, other than \nderivatives: \na) Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as assets at fair value and \nany period change in fair value is recorded through interest income in the consolidated statement \nof income, as applicable. \nb) Accounts receivable and other receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently \nare classified as assets at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, less loss \nallowance.  Interest income is recorded in the consolidated statement of income, as applicable. \nc) Accounts payable, credit facilities, the debt portion of the convertible debenture, the debt portion \nof the debenture with warrants, the construction loans, borrowings and other liabilities are \nclassified as other financial liabilities and are measured at amortized cost using the effective \ninterest rate method.  Interest expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of income, as \napplicable. \nWith the adoption of hedge accounting, “gains/losses on risk management activities” reflects the change \nin fair value of undesignated revenue hedges and gains or losses on designated hedging instruments that \nare not otherwise recorded in the income statement with the hedged item (revenue or cost of sales). \nAlso, with the adoption of hedge accounting, “gains/losses on fair value on the embedded option” are \ngains or losses on the embedded derivative in the convertible debenture debt instrument and the \ndebenture with warrants. \nThe full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining \nmaturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and it is classified as a current asset or liability when \nthe remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. \nRecognition and de-recognition \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities, including derivatives, are recognized on the consolidated \nstatement of financial position when the Company becomes a party to the financial instrument or"

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the \nfinancial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all \nthe risks and rewards of ownership. \nMeasurement \nAt initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value, plus, in the case of a financial \nasset or liability not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of \nthe financial asset or liability.  Transaction costs of financial assets and financial liabilities carried at FVPL \nare expensed in profit and loss.  Financial assets and financial liabilities with embedded derivatives are \nconsidered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal \nand interest. \nDebt instruments \nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company’s business model for managing \nthe asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into \nwhich the Company classifies its debt instruments: \na) Amortized cost: Assets that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash \nflows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost. Interest \nincome from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate \nmethod. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognized directly in profit or loss and \npresented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment \nlosses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss. \nb) FVOCI: Assets that are held for a collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial \nassets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are \nmeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”). Movements in the \ncarrying amount are taken through other comprehensive income (“OCI”), except for the \nrecognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses \nwhich are recognized in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognized, the cumulative \ngain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognized \nin other gains/(losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income \nusing the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other \ngains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of \nprofit or loss. \nc) FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A \ngain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognized in profit or \nloss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises. \nImpairment \nThe Company assesses all information available, including on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit \nlosses associated with its assets carried at amortized cost and FVOCI.  The impairment methodology \napplied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.  The Company’s only \nfinancial assets at amortized cost are accounts receivable and other receivables, for these the Company \napplies the simplified approach as permitted by IFRS 9 which requires expected lifetime credit losses to \nbe recognized from the initial recognition of the receivables."

The accounting for \nsubsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging \ninstrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged, and the type of hedge relationship designated. \nThe Company designates certain derivatives as either:  \na) hedges of the fair value of recognized assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedges),  \nb) hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognized assets and liabilities and \nhighly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges), or  \nc) hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedges). \nThe Company documents at the inception of the hedging transaction the economic relationship between \nhedging instruments and hedged items including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset \nchanges in cash flows of hedged items.  The Company documents its risk management objective and \nstrategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception of each hedging relationship. \nCash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting \nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash \nflow hedges is recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity until the hedged expected future \ncash flows affect profit or loss; at which time, the gains/losses are reclassified to the consolidated \nstatement of income.  The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in \nprofit or loss. When option contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, the group designates only \nthe intrinsic value of the options as the hedging instrument. \nGains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in the intrinsic value of the options are \nrecognized in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.  The changes in the time value of the options, \nthat relate to the hedged item (‘aligned time value’), are recognized within other comprehensive income \nin the costs of hedging reserve within equity. \nCommodity and Currency risk hedges \nThe Company applied hedge accounting to economic hedges entered into in accordance with its Foreign \nExchange Risk Management Policy (FX Policy) and the Commodity Price Risk Management Policy \n(Commodity Policy).  Economically, the specific hedging activities carried out under these policies by the \nCompany are as follows. \nThe Company designates derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments and the change in fair \nvalue of designated coffee inventory and hedged firm commitments as hedged items in a fair value \nrelationship to manage the risk of changes in benchmark commodity prices, as described under \n‘Commodity price risk hedges’. \nThe Company designates derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments and designates highly \nprobable forecasted sales revenue as hedged items in a cash flow hedge relationship to manage the \nforeign exchange risk associated with the cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions, as described \nunder ‘Currency risk hedges related to US$ denominated future process revenue’."

When the Company enters into a purchase commitment to purchase green coffee and \nfixes the New York ‘C’ (“NY’C”) price component (which it will later sell at a to-be-determined price \nbased on the NY’C’), the Company enters into an offsetting short position on the Intercontinental \nExchange.  The Company monitors, on a macro basis, the amount of purchase commitments and \namount of inventory on hand for which the ultimate sale price is variable and has not yet been \nfixed based on the NY’C’ and compares this to the amount of coffee covered by future net short \npositions to determine whether the net short position requires adjustment. \nAt each period end, commodity hedges are remeasured to their fair value.  Under hedge \naccounting, the effective portion of the gains (losses) for price fixed hedged coffee contracts and \ncoffee inventory will be held on the consolidated statement of financial position until inventory \nfor such contracts is received and subsequently sold, at which time the gains (losses) will flow to \ncost of sales on the consolidated statement of income. \nb) Currency risk hedges \nCurrency risk hedges related to US$ denominated future process revenue: \nThe Company enters into forward contracts to sell US$ at future dates to hedge the foreign \nexchange cash flow variability of expected US$ from processing fee revenue.  The hedged \nprocessing revenue includes both processing fee revenue from tolling arrangements (processing \nof customer owned coffee) as well as the US$ processing fee layer of inventory sales agreements. \nAt each period end, currency risk hedges on US$ future revenues are remeasured to their fair \nvalue. Under hedge accounting, unrealized gains (losses) for US$ forward contracts are \nreclassified so that the impact on the consolidated statement of income is deferred through other \ncomprehensive income, until the hedge instrument matures, at which time the realized gain (loss) \nis reflected in revenue on the consolidated statement of income. \nCurrency risk hedges related to US$ denominated purchases: \nThe Company enters into forward contracts to buy US dollars (US$) for significant purchase \ncommitments denominated in US$. Purchase commitments denominated in US$ include \nprocurements of equipment for Company use and purchases of green coffee inventory which, \nonce decaffeinated, is sold at a fixed Canadian dollar (C$) price.  To mitigate the exposure to \nchanging margin on these transactions arising from fluctuations in the US$/C$ exchange rate, the \nCompany enters into US$ forward purchase contracts which economically lock in the US$/C$ \nexchange rate and effectively locks in the C$ cost of equipment or inventory (inventory which is \nto be sold at the fixed C$ amount). \nAt each period end, currency risk hedges on US$ denominated purchases are remeasured to their \nfair value and:"

The fair \nvalue hierarchy has the following levels: \na) Level 1 – valuation based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or \nliabilities; \nb) Level 2 – valuation techniques based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for \nthe asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and \nc) Level 3 – valuation techniques using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on \nobservable market data (unobservable inputs). \nThe fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market inputs whenever such inputs exist.

A \ncontract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys that right of control of the use of an identified asset \nfor a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to \ncontrol the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) the contract involves the use of \nan identified asset; (ii) the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from \nthe use of the asset throughout the period, and; (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the \nasset. The Company has determined that contracts for its offices, warehouses, and select equipment \ncontain a lease. \nAt inception or on a reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Company allocates \nthe consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. \nHowever, for the leases of land and buildings, the Company has elected not to separate non-lease \ncomponents and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. \nThe Company presents right-of-use assets in ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and related liabilities in \n‘Lease liabilities’. \nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The \nright-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability \nadjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs \nincurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the \nunderlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. \nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the \ncommencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the \nlease term plus expected renewal options that are available to the Company. The estimated useful lives \nof right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. In \naddition, the right-of-use asset is reduced by impairment losses, if any are identified, and adjusted for \ncertain remeasurements of the lease liability. \nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the \ncommencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, and if that rate cannot be \nreadily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its \nincremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. \nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise of: (i) fixed payments; (ii) \nvariable lease payments that depend on an index rate, initially measured using the index as at the \ncommencement date; (iii) amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, and : (iv) \nthe exercise price under purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease \npayments in an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension \noption, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Company is reasonably certain not to \nterminate early. \nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured \nwhen there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a \nchange in the Company’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value"

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is \nmade to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount \nof the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. \nThe Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of \nmachinery that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Company \nrecognizes these lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \nThe Company recognizes a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease \nliabilities in the consolidated income statement. \nOn the statement of cash flows, the Company includes repayments of the principal portion of the lease \nliabilities under financing activities whereas before the implementation of IFRS 16, they were included in \ncash flows from operations. The interest portion of the lease continues to be classified within cash flows \nfrom operating activities. Lease payments for short-term leases and lease payments for leases of low-\nvalue assets that are not included in the measurement of the lease liability are classified as cash flows \nfrom operating activities. \n3.15 Current and deferred income taxes \nIncome tax expense or credit comprises current and deferred tax.  Income tax expense is recognized in \nthe consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to \nitems recognized either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. The income tax expense or \ncredit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the applicable \nincome tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable \nto temporary differences and to unused tax losses. \nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted \nat the reporting date, and any adjustments to taxes payable in respect of previous years. The Company \nperiodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax \nregulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts \nexpected to be paid to the tax authorities. \nDeferred income tax is recognized, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between \nthe tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.  \nHowever, if the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a \ntransaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither \naccounting nor taxable income or loss, it is not accounted for.  Deferred income tax is determined using \ntax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are \nexpected to apply when the related asset is realized, or the liability is settled. \nDeferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income \nwill be available against which temporary differences and non-capital loss carry forwards can be utilized. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax \nassets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current \ntax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends \neither to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously."

In this case, the tax is also recognized in \nother comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. \n3.16 Provisions \nProvisions are recognized when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of \na past event, it is probable that it will lead to an outflow of economic resources from the Company and \namounts can be estimated reliably, although timing or amount of the outflow may still be uncertain. \nProvisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required \nto settle the present obligation at the reporting date, including the risks and uncertainties associated with \nthe present obligation.  The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market \nassessments of the time value of money and the increases specific to the liability. \nAny reimbursement that the Company can be virtually certain to collect from a third party with respect to \nthe obligation is recognized as a separate asset.  However, this asset may not exceed the amount of the \nrelated provision. \nAll provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted or reversed to reflect \nmanagement’s current best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the \nend of the reporting period.  If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic \nbenefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.  Provisions are reduced by \nactual expenditures for which the provision was originally recognized. \nWhere discounting has been used, the carrying amount of a provision is accreted during the period to \nreflect the passage of time. \n3.17 Share capital \nCommon shares \nCommon shares are classified as equity and are recorded at the value of proceeds received. Issuance costs \ndirectly attributable to the issuances of new common shares are deducted against the share capital \naccount. Repurchases are removed from equity and no gain or loss is recognized in the Statement of \nIncome on the issue, sale, purchase, or cancellation of the Company’s shares. On share repurchases, any \nexcess between the purchase price and the cost per share is allocated to retained earnings. \nWarrants \nThe Company issues warrants subject to shareholders, regulatory body, and creditor approvals. Each \nwarrant allows the holder to obtain one share of Swiss Water in exchange for cash at a price per share \ndetermined at the time the warrants are issued.  Each warrant can be exercised at any time and not later \nthan the exercise date of the warrant.  The initial fair value of the warrants is measured at the grant date \nusing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. \nWhen the warrant holder holds a warrant where a fixed amount of shares are issued for a fixed amount \nof cash, the fair value of the warrants is initially recognized as a component of equity in the statement of \nequity and is not remeasured at each period end.  If the holder of warrants decides to exercise the \nwarrants, the fair value of the warrants will be de-recognized from the warrants reserve component of \nthe equity and recognized as a part of share capital.  No adjustment is made for warrants that expire."

If the \nholder of warrants decides to exercise the warrants, the fair value of the warrants will be de-recognized \nfrom the warrant's financial liability component of the Statement of Financial Position and recognized as \na part of share capital on the Statement of Changes in Equity.  Expired warrants and financing transactions \nrelated to financial liabilities are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9. Refer to accounting policies \nrelated to financial liabilities under the section ‘Summary of significant accounting policies’, sub-heading \n‘Financial instruments’. \nAs at each period end warrants are tested for potential dilution effect when calculating basic and diluted \nearnings per share. \nDividends \nDividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognized when dividends are approved for payment. \n3.18 Share-based compensation \nThe Company has a restricted share unit (“RSU”) plan for certain officers and employees and a deferred \nshare unit (“DSU”) plan for non-employee directors (collectively, “participants”). \nThe RSUs granted are compound financial instruments as they are expected to be settled using a \ncombination of cash and equity. \nThe equity-settled share-based compensation is measured at the fair value of the Company’s common \nshares as at the grant date using a volume weighted average share price in accordance with the terms of \nthe RSU plan.  The fair value determined at the grant date is charged to income on a straight-line basis \nover the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of RSUs that will eventually vest and be \nconverted to common shares, with a corresponding increase in equity (share-based compensation \nreserve).  As necessary, the Company revises its estimate if subsequent information indicates that the \nnumber of RSUs expected to vest differs from previous estimates.  On the vesting date, the Company \nrevises the estimate to equal the number of equity instruments that are ultimately vested.  The impact of \nthe revision of estimates, if any, is recognized in income or expense such that the cumulative expense \nreflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the share-based compensation reserve. \nFor cash-settled share-based compensation, a long-term liability is recognized, measured initially at the \nfair value of the long-term liability using a volume weighted average share price.  The amount of the \nliability is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the \nnumber of RSUs that will eventually vest and be settled in cash.  As necessary, the Company revises its \nestimate if subsequent information indicates that the number of RSUs expected to vest differs from \nprevious estimates.  On the vesting date, the Company revises the estimate to equal the number of RSUs \nthat ultimately vested and are settled in cash.  The impact of the revision of estimates, if any, is recognized \nin income or expenses such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a \ncorresponding adjustment to the long-term liability or current liability depends on the timing when the \nliability becomes due.  At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of \nsettlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured using a volume weighted average share price, with \nany change in fair value recognized in income or expense for the year."

DSUs are classified as cash-settled share-based payment transactions as participants receive \ncash following a redemption.  The DSUs do not contain any vesting conditions or forfeiture provisions, as \nthey are issued in exchange for deferred compensation.  The Company recognizes the expense and the \nliability to pay for the eventual redemption when the DSUs are issued.  Thereafter, the Company \nremeasures the liability at the end of each reporting date and the date of settlement, with the difference \nrecognized in income or expense for the period.  The fair value of DSUs is determined in accordance with \nthe DSU Plan, which uses the average closing price for Swiss Water shares for the five trading days \nimmediately preceding the relevant date. \n3.19 Revenue recognition \nIFRS 15 requires revenue recognition to follow a five-step model of identifying contracts, separating \nperformance obligations, determining and allocating the transaction price, and recognizing the revenue \nas each performance obligation is satisfied. \nThe Company’s primary sources of revenue are proceeds from sales of Swiss Water’s decaffeinated coffee \nand from services provided to decaffeinate customers’ owned coffee. \nSwiss Water’s revenue is measured based on consideration agreed on in contracts with customers and is \nrecognized when the Company transfers control over products and services to the customer either at a \npoint in time or over time. \nFor all revenue contracts, no significant judgements are made with respect to evaluating the timing of \nsatisfaction of performance obligations, transaction prices, and amounts allocated to performance \nobligations.  Consideration amounts are not variable.  Payment terms are typically between 30 and 60 \ndays, apart from select customers where payment terms are extended.  For contracts with extended \npayment terms, the Company charges customers an insignificant financing component.  Warranty, returns \nor refunds do not apply to the Company. \nRevenue is disaggregated based on the customer’s geographic region as described in the segmented \nreporting accounting policy.  Also, the revenue, from contracts with customers, is disaggregated by major \nproducts and services: decaffeinated coffee sales, decaffeination services, and distribution. \nDecaffeinated coffee sales  \nDecaffeinated coffee sales are the amounts that are charged to customers for the sale of decaffeinated \ncoffee.  The performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time when a customer obtains control of the \nproduct, which is when decaffeinated coffee is picked up by or delivered to the customer. \nDecaffeination services \nDecaffeination services represent the amount charged to customers for the service to decaffeinate \ncustomer-owned coffee.  The performance obligation is to provide the service, which is satisfied over time. \nDistribution \nDistribution revenue consists of shipping, handling and warehousing charges billed to customers.  The \nperformance obligation is satisfied over time as services are provided, which is at the same time as these \nservices are consumed."

The \nCompany contributes a percentage of earnings into an RRSP administered by an independent entity.  \nUltimately, each employee manages his or her own RRSP within the scope of the plan provided by the \nthird-party administrator.  The RRSP has no assurance of defined benefits to employees, and as such the \nCompany has no legal or constructive obligations to make further contributions. \nThe Company also pays contributions to government pension insurance plans. The contributions are \nrecognized as employee benefit expenses when they are due. \n3.21 Earning per share (“EPS”) \nThe Company presents basic and diluted EPS for its common shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing \nincome or loss attributable to shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common \nshares outstanding during the year.  Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing income or loss attributable to \nshareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted \nfor the effects of all dilutive potential common shares. \n4. \nMANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY \nJudgment is used by management in selecting accounting policies, the determination of functional \ncurrency, the identification of cash generating units (“CGUs”), and the identification of revenue streams.  \nIn addition, judgment is often required in applying accounting policies, and in respect of items where the \nchoice of a specific policy, accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect the \nreported results or net asset position of the Company should it later be determined that a different choice \nwould be more appropriate. \nManagement considers the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed below to be its critical \naccounting estimates and accordingly, provides an explanation of each below. Actual results could differ \nfrom those estimates and assumptions. \n4.1 \nUseful lives of depreciable assets \nChange in accounting estimates \nThe Company reduced the estimated useful life of its production line machinery and equipment at the \nBurnaby location from 10 years to the expiry of the lease term (June 2023). This change in accounting \nestimate was accounted for prospectively and results from the decision to cease the two production lines \nin Burnaby BC when the Company exits the lease in June 2023 and the impact of this change is de minimis \nin 2022. \n4.2 \nProvision for asset retirement obligations \nAnalysis and estimates are performed by the Company in order to determine the amount of restoration \ncosts to be recognized as a provision in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

When the final determination of such obligation amounts differs from the \nrecognized provisions, the Company’s financial statements will be impacted. \n4.3 \nIncome taxes \nThe Company computes income taxes using the liability method, under which deferred income taxes are \nprovided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the \nCompany’s assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted and \nsubstantively enacted income tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which \nthose temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. \nDeferred tax assets also reflect estimates of the recoverability of non-capital loss carry forwards. The \nCompany has recognized the benefit of loss carry forwards to the extent that it is probable that taxable \nincome will be available in the future against which the non-capital loss carry forwards can be utilized. \nThe financial reporting bases of the Company’s assets reflect the useful lives of depreciable assets, as well \nas the carrying amounts of assets with indefinite useful lives.  Accordingly, management estimates that \nimpact the carrying amounts of depreciable and non-depreciable assets also have an impact on deferred \nincome tax assets and liabilities. \n4.4 \nLeases and right of use assets \nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that the Company’s management makes \nassumptions and estimates on the classification of operating and finance leases. When assessing the \nclassification of a lease agreement, certain estimates and assumptions need to be made and applied, \nwhich include, but are not limited to, the determination of the expected lease term and minimum lease \npayments, the discount rate/implicit borrowing rate, the assessment of the likelihood of exercising \noptions, and estimation of the fair value of the leased property at lease inception. \n4.5 \nDebenture with warrants \nAt initial recognition, in the calculation of the fair value of the liability portion of the Debenture with \nwarrants, management estimated the interest rate on a similar instrument of comparable credit status \nproviding for substantially the same cash flows, on the same terms, but without the warrants exercise \noption. Management estimates the fair values of the Borrowings embedded option liability related to the \ndebenture with warrants at initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period using the Black-\nScholes option pricing model which requires management estimates. Pricing models require the input of \nhighly subjective assumptions including the expected share price volatility. Changes in the subjective input \nassumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and therefore the existing models do not \nnecessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company’s warrants. \n4.6 \nConvertible debenture \nManagement estimates the interest rate on a similar instrument of comparable credit status and provides \nfor substantially the same cash flows, on the same terms, but without the equity conversion option in the \ncalculation of the fair value of the liability portion of the convertible debenture upon initial recognition."

The Company manages its capital \nstructure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk \ncharacteristics of the underlying assets. The Company considers its capital structure to include \nshareholders’ equity and indebtedness.  In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company \nmay from time-to-time issue common shares, preferred shares, issue additional debt, adjust its capital \nspending, modify its dividend policy, and/or dispose of certain assets to manage current and projected \ndebt levels. \nThe Company manages its capital in order to meet its growth objectives and payments of quarterly \ndividends to its shareholders.  The dividend policy of Swiss Water is subject to the discretion of the Board \nof Directors, which reviews the level of dividends periodically on the basis of a number of factors including \nSwiss Water’s financial performance, future prospects, and the capital requirements of the business. \n6. \nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE \nAccounts receivable are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary \ncourse of business.  Information about the Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk \nand credit risk can be found in the ‘Financial risk management’ (Note 24).  The Company monitors lifetime \nexpected credit losses using the simplified approach which is determined based on historic and adjusted \nrelevant forward-looking information. The Company’s customers have a negligible default rate and the \nCompany’s experience both in frequency and amount of losses are not significant. As a result, the \nexpected credit losses provision as at December 31, 2022 is $0.1 million (2021: nil).  \n7. \nINVENTORIES \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the cost of inventories recognized in cost of sales was $143.1 \nmillion (2021: $102.4 million). The hedge accounting component represents the derivative adjustment \nrelated to designated hedges for inventory on hand as at each period.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the \nCompany reviewed the dismantling plan and restoration obligation for the two production lines housed \non the leased property (the cash-generating unit (“CGU”)), including the assessment of salvageable assets. \nIn accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, the Company identified indicators of impairment. \nManagement considered both the cost and benefit, including cash proceeds from the sale of extracted \nassets, cash required to salvage equipment, and the expected utilization of salvaged machinery. \nManagement determined the recoverable amount of the CGU using the “value-in-use” method.  The \ncarrying amount exceeded the estimated recoverable amount of $2.7 million, and the Company \nrecognized a $2.5 million impairment loss to plant and equipment, where $2.2 million was allocated to \nmachinery and equipment and $0.3 million was allocated to leasehold improvements (2021: $nil). \nThe value-in-use estimates used assumptions drawn from both internal and external sources related to \nfuture cash flows from the remaining life of Burnaby assets.  Management did not identify any significant \nassumptions. \nThe Company’s carrying amount of intangible assets of $0.1 million with definite useful lives is allocated \nacross the Delta and Burnaby CGUs.  The amount allocated to Burnaby CGU is not significant in comparison \nwith the entity's total carrying amount of intangible assets. \nAfter recognizing the impairment, the amortization of the remaining carrying value of Burnaby CGU will \nbe adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount on a systematic basis over its \nremaining useful life, the earlier of the cessation of production and June 2023, the month in which the \nCompany exits the Burnaby property. \n9.2 \nRight-of-use assets \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, right-of-use assets depreciation expense of $1.9 million (2021: \n$1.9 million) was charged to cost of sales and $0.2 million (2021: $0.3 million) was included in \nadministrative expenses. There was no impairment loss recognized for the years ended December 31, \n2022 and 2021."

The purpose of the Term Loan was to assist in \nthe financing of new equipment for the first production line built in Delta, British Columbia. The interest \nrate for the Term Loan was 4.95% per annum over 12 years. Principal repayments were to commence on \nJuly 1, 2021 until the Term Loan maturity date of June 1, 2033. \nOn June 3, 2021, the Company completed a financing transaction by increasing the existing term loan to \n$45.0 million to fund the planned construction of a second production line at the Delta location. The \nfinancing was provided by BDC, our existing creditor, and Farm Credit Canada (“FCC”) in a Pari Passu \nstructure. Each lender will fund 50% of the $45.0 million total loan value. The existing borrowing with BDC \nwill increase from $20.0 million to $22.5 million (“BDC Amended Term Loan”) and FCC will also fund the \n$22.5 million (“FCC Term Loan”). Upon closing of the transaction, the Company’s outstanding debt to each \nparty, FCC and BDC, was $10.0 million. FCC paid $10.0 million to BDC on the Company’s behalf to ensure \nthat existing borrowings were restructured on a Pari Passu basis. \nEffective November 22, 2022, as the Company continued constructing its second production line in Delta, \nBC, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Amended Senior Facility”) to the existing senior debt \nfacilities with BDC and FCC. Both lenders agreed to provide the Company with up to an additional $12.0 \nmillion, in total, of senior debt financing, available at variable rates, funded equally between lenders. \nAt December 31, 2022, the FCC Term Loans consist of a fixed term loan and a variable loan, where, until \nmaturity, the fixed term loan bears an interest rate of 4.38% and the variable loan bears an interest rate \nof a variable personal property rate minus 0.75%.  BDC Term Loans consist of a fixed term and a variable \nloan, where, until maturity, the fixed term loan bears an interest rate of 4.45%, while the variable loan \nbears an interest rate of variable BDC floating rate minus 1.5%. \nInterest only will be paid on the outstanding balance on a monthly basis prior to July 1, 2024 for both the \nBDC Amended Term Loan and FCC Term Loan. Principal repayments for both loans commence on July 1, \n2024 and will be repaid in monthly installments until June 1, 2034. Early principal repayment is available \nsubject to conditions. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred $0.3 million in financing transaction \ncosts to complete the Amended Senior Facility, while during the year ended December 31, 2021, a total \nof $0.2 million in financing transaction costs was incurred in connection with the Pari Passu agreements: \nBDC Amended Term Loan and FCC Term Loan.

In the year 2021, the loss on extinguishment of the original Term Loan \nwith BDC was de minimis. \n12.1 (v) BDC/FCC - Security \nThe construction loans are secured by a general security agreement and a first security interest on all \nexisting equipment and machinery plus new equipment and machinery financed with the construction \nloans for both BDC and FCC. Seaforth provided a guarantee for construction loans to both BDC and FCC. \n12.2 Debenture with warrants / Convertible debenture with Mill Road Capital LLC \nAs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the value of the debenture with warrants, which consists of a principal \namount due to Mill Road Capital LLC (“MRC”), a related party, net of valuation of conversion-to-shares-\noption, and net of valuation of warrants is as follows: \n \n12.2 (i) MRC – Agreements and transaction costs \nIn 2016, the Company issued an unsecured subordinated convertible debenture to MRC for gross proceeds \nof $15.0 million. The convertible debenture maturity date was on October 11, 2023. The Company paid \nfinancing costs of $0.5 million in respect of issuing the convertible debenture. Until the debt \nextinguishment on July 20, 2021, the Company used the residual value method to allocate the fair value \nof the convertible debenture between the liability component and the derivative liability. \nOn July 20, 2021, Swiss Water amended the convertible debenture agreement with MRC to a debenture \nwith warrants. Under the new terms of the agreement, the maturity date was extended by one year from \nOctober 11, 2023, to October 31, 2024. The other amended terms were: (i) the interest rate increased \nfrom a maximum of 7.85% to 9%, (ii) a 1.5% additional interest “payment in kind” was added, and (iii) the \ndebt to shares conversion feature was amended. The debt to shares conversion was amended by (a) \ncancelling the existing conversion feature and (b) replacing the existing conversion feature with warrants \nto allow MRC to purchase up to 2.25 million common shares at a price of $3.33 per share. The warrants \nexpire on October 31, 2024. This amendment triggered an extinguishment of the convertible debenture \nand a new debenture with warrants was established. \nEffective November 22, 2022, Swiss Water amended the debenture with warrants agreements to (i) \nexpand on Senior Debt restricted covenant; (ii) allow Swiss Water a right to prepay the principal, and (iii) \nadd security on the debenture.

Also, the interest on the debenture remains unchanged, at 9% paid quarterly \nplus 1.5% interest in kind accrued quarterly. Meanwhile, the warrants agreement to issue 2.25 million \nwarrants, with an exercise price of $3.33 was amended (i) to extend the maturity date from October 31, \n2024, to April 30, 2026; and (ii) to add a cashless exercise option whereby MRC may elect to receive, upon \nexercise, such number of shares that is equal to the difference between the $3.33 exercise price and the \nfair market value of the shares at the time of exercise. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred $0.2 million in financing transaction \ncosts with respect to amending the debenture with warrants, while during the year ended December 31, \n2021, the Company incurred $0.2 million to amend the agreements from convertible debenture to \ndebenture with warrants. These transaction costs are amortized until the debenture’s maturity date. \n12.2 (ii) MRC – Finance expense and interest paid \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, interest expensed and interest paid on debt due to MRC \nwas as follows: \n \nDebenture with Warrants \nThe debenture with warrants interest rate is 9% per annum, paid quarterly in arrears. The 9% is subject to \nreaching a specific covenant threshold, in excess of these, the interest rate increases to 12.5 % per annum. \nThe Company also incurs an additional 1.5% of interest “payment in kind”, which accrues quarterly and is \ndue at the maturity date. \nConvertible debenture \nPrior to the amendment on July 20, 2021, the convertible debenture’s interest rate was 6.85% per annum, \npaid quarterly in arrears.  The 6.85% interest rate was subject to reaching specific covenant thresholds, in \nexcess of these, the interest rate would have increased to 7.85% per annum. Under the terms of the \nagreement, Swiss Water had the option to pay interest-in-kind for the first two years. If elected, this option \nwould have increased the principal sum by the interest owing. The Company chose not to elect to pay \ninterest-in-kind and this option is now extinguished. \n12.2 (iii) MRC – Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt \nDuring the years 2022 and 2021, the Company renegotiated its debenture agreements with MRC and \nrecorded the following Gain (loss) on the extinguishment of debt. \nBalance, open\n$\n12,890\n                     \n$\n13,102\n                     \nInterest charged for convertible debenture\n-\n                               \n840\n                          \nInterest paid on convertible debenture\n-\n                               \n(510)\n                         \nJuly 20, 2021 convertible debenture\n12,890\n                     \n13,432\n                     \nExtinguishment of liability component of convertible debt\n-\n                               \n1,568\n                       \n12,890\n                     \n15,000\n                     \nLiability component of debenture with warrants, July 20, 2021\n-\n                               \n(2,468)\n                      \nRemeasurement of liability component of debenture with warrants\n(307)\n                         \n-\n                               \nInterest charged for debenture with warrants\n2,261\n                       \n1,022\n                       \nInterest paid on debenture with warrants\n(1,367)\n                      \n(664)\n                         \nBalance, end\n$\n13,477\n                     \n$\n12,890\n                     \nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2022"

Given that amendments included a cashless exercise option where the agreement no longer limits \nan exchange of a fixed amount of cash for a fixed amount of common shares (subject to terms, the option \nallows a variable number of shares being issued), this debenture with warrants restructuring transaction \nwas accounted for using the extinguishment method of accounting for debt reconstruction. \nRelated to the extinguishment of the 2021 debenture with warrants, during the year ended December 31, \n2022, the Company recognized a $0.5 million gain on the extinguishment of debt on the Statement of \nIncome. \nConvertible debenture \nIn the prior year, on July 20, 2021, the Company extinguished its convertible debenture with MRC. Given \nthat there was a 2.15% change in the interest rate and a replacement of the debt conversion to shares \nwith warrants, management determined that the terms within the convertible debenture and the terms \nwithin the debenture with warrants are substantially different. As such, this debt restructuring transaction \nwas accounted for using the extinguishment method of accounting for debt reconstruction. \nRelated to the extinguishment of the convertible debenture, during the year ended December 31, 2021, \nthe Company recognized a $1.4 million loss on the extinguishment of debt on the Statement of Income.  \n12.2 (iv) MRC – Liability component of the debenture with warrants/convertible debenture \nThe liability component of the debenture with warrants is a liability measured at amortized cost and it \nincludes the principal on the debenture, accrued interest and unamortized bond discount, which is a \ndiscounted combination of financing transaction costs plus a valuation of the embedded option, \nrecognized at the inception of debt. As at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the liability component of \ndebenture with warrants was $13.4 million and $12.9 million respectively. \nDebenture with Warrants \nOn November 22, 2022 the liability component of the debenture with warrants was initially measured at \na fair value of $13.4 million, which represented the present value of the contractually determined stream \nof cash flows discounted at the prevailing market interest rate at that time applicable to instruments of \ncomparable credit status and providing substantially the same cash flows, on the same terms, but without \nderivative components, of 18.3% per annum.

The lease can be renewed at the \nCompany’s option in five-year increments up to a total of 30 years.  The lease commenced in July \n2018.  Under the lease, the Company has multiple options to buy-out the lease starting at the end of \nthe second five-year term.  The buy-out value will be equal to the fair market value of the property as \ndetermined by an appraisal process, subject to specified maximum and minimum values. In 2022 the \nCompany exercised its first lease renewal option which will expire in July 2028. \n \nSwiss Water leases a facility in Burnaby that houses its decaffeination plant and offices.  The lease \nexpires in June 2023. There are no options to renew this lease. Refer to note ‘Property plant and \nequipment’ (Note 9) for additional information related to the expiry of this lease. \n \nSwiss Water leases various office equipment with expiring dates of October 2024 and January 2025. \n \nSeaforth leases a warehouse in Delta and the lease expires in June 2027. The Company has two options \nto renew the lease for an additional term of five years each. \n \nSeaforth leases a truck. The lease expires in April 2023. \n \nSWEU leases a sales office in France which expires in October 2027. \n \nSWUS leased premises in Seattle, Washington. The lease was set to expire on October 31, 2022. The \nCompany exited its Seattle office lease in January 2022 and recognized a negligible loss in the \nconsolidated statement of income.  \n15.2 Adjustments recognized on the adoption of IFRS 16 \nOn adoption of IFRS 16, the Company recognized $19.1 million in lease liabilities in relation to leases that \nhad previously been classified as operating leases under the principles of IAS 17 Leases. These liabilities \nwere measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments plus the anticipated exercise of \nrenewal options that are at the discretion of the Company, discounted using the incremental borrowing \nrate as of January 1, 2019. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities \nat inception was 4.92%. \n15.3 Amounts recognized in the statement of net income and statement of cash flows \nFrom the total of lease cash payments, the portion relating to finance expense is recognized in the \noperating activities while the principal portion of lease payments is recognized in the financing component \non the Statement of Cash Flows. \n \n \nLease liabilities, current\n$\n1,671\n                        \n$\n1,793\n                        \nLease liabilities, non-current\n18,256\n                     \n19,926\n                     \n$\n19,927\n                     \n$\n21,719\n                     \nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021"

Each warrant is exercisable for one \ncommon share of Swiss Water at a price of $3.33 per share, expiring on October 31, 2024.  \nEffective November 22, 2022 the debenture with warrants agreement was amended to extend the \nmaturity date of the warrants from October 31, 2024, to April 30, 2026, and it now provides for a cashless \nexercise feature whereby MRC may elect to receive upon exercise such number of shares that is equal to \nthe difference between the $3.33 exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the time of \nexercise. There was no change to the number of shares issuable under the amended agreement or the \nexercise price of warrants. \nPrior to the amendment on November 22, 2022, the warrant's initial value of $2.5 million was recorded \nas a component of equity as it was subject to an exchange of a fixed amount of cash for a fixed number of \nthe Company’s common shares and subsequently, the value of warrants was not remeasured. The fair \nvalue of warrants cannot be reliably measured, therefore, at the time of issuance in 2021, the valuation \nwas using the Black-Scholes option pricing models with assumptions as follows.  Pricing models require \nthe input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected share price volatility. Changes in the \nsubjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and therefore the existing \nmodels do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company’s warrants. \n \nEffective November 22, 2022, the agreement no longer limits an exchange where a fixed amount of cash \nis exchanged for a fixed amount of common shares, there is a cashless option that allows a variable \nnumber of shares and no cash. Therefore, the valuation of warrants was de-recognized from equity and is \nnow recognized as a financial liability ‘Borrowings – embedded option’. For further details, including \nrecorded Extinguishment of debt on the Statement of Income, refer to note ‘Borrowings – Debenture with \nwarrants/ Convertible debenture’ (Note 12.2). \nIn the year 2021, the Company incurred $0.03 million in transaction costs related to these warrants.

      "text": "SWISS WATER DECAFFEINATED COFFEE INC. \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \nFor the Year ended December 31, 2022 \n(Tabular amounts are in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts) \n \n4 7  | P a g e   \n17.4 Restricted share units \nThe Company has a restricted share unit plan (“RSU Plan”) which allows it to grant RSUs to officers, \nemployees and consultants of Swiss Water or its subsidiaries.  The RSU Plan is administered by the Board \nof Directors, which sets the terms of incentive awards under the RSU Plan.  On May 9, 2022, Swiss Water \nshareholders approved an increase in the number of common shares available for issuance under the 2011 \nRestricted Share Unit Plan as amended in June 2019 and in May 2022.  The increase is from a maximum \nof 815,509 common shares to a maximum of 1,115,509 common shares.  All RSU grants vest on the third \nanniversary of issuance provided the grant recipient is still employed by Swiss Water or one of its \nsubsidiaries as at the date of vesting.  Grants are forfeited if a recipient is no longer employed by Swiss \nWater or one of its subsidiaries.  Upon vesting, each RSU converts to one common share.  These grants \nallow participants to receive up to 50% of the market value of the award in cash (instead of shares) upon \nvesting, in order to facilitate payment of taxes owing on the awards.  Any RSUs paid in cash are returned \nto the pool and may be re-issued, subject to the maximum number of common shares available under \nRSU. \nPeriodically, the Company grants RSU awards.  Both, non-performance and performance based RSUs vest \nover time on the third anniversary of their grant, while performance based RSUs, are subject to meeting \nperformance objectives specified by the Board of Directors. \nEach award is increased by the value of dividends paid to shareholders during the vesting period, using a \nformula that uses the higher of the then-current share price and $3.20. The Company values the RSUs \nusing the volume based weighted average share price (“VWAP”).  VWAP is based on the Canadian dollar \ntrading price of the Company’s common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange for the five trading days \nimmediately preceding that relevant date, calculated by dividing the total value by the total volume of \ncommon shares traded, according to the RSU Plan. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company issued performance based and non-performance-\nbased RSUs.

The DSU Plan was \nadopted to allow participants the opportunity to defer compensation and encourage a sense of ownership \nin Swiss Water.  Under the DSU Plan, participants may elect to defer compensation and receive DSUs equal \nto the value of the deferred compensation. \nThe first DSUs were issued in April 2012.  The number of DSUs was determined by dividing the amount of \ndeferred compensation by the Fair Market Value (“FMV”).  The FMV of DSUs is defined in the DSU Plan as \nthe weighted average closing price of Swiss Water shares for the five business days immediately preceding \nthe relevant date. \nUpon the occurrence of a redemption event, the affected participant will be entitled to receive a lump \nsum cash payment, net of applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of the number of DSUs held \nby that participant and the FMV on the date of the redemption event.  The DSUs do not contain any vesting \nconditions or forfeiture provisions, as they are issued in exchange for deferred compensation. \nUnder the DSU Plan, outstanding DSUs as at the record date are increased by the dividend whenever \ndividends are paid to shareholders. \nThe movement in DSUs for the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, was as follows: \n \n18. \nREVENUE \n18.1 Disaggregation of revenue \nRevenue disaggregated by geographical markets is disclosed in the Note 23 under segment reporting.

For as long as the borrower remains an employee, the \nobligation to repay the principal is forgiven against current and future awards under the RSU Plan, by \nforfeiture of awards.  The loan is interest free other than in the event of default, in which case the \npromissory note would bear simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum.  As at December 31, 2022 the \nloan balance of $0.04 million was included in other non-current receivables (2021: $0.07 million). \n20.4 Debenture with warrants \nMRC is a shareholder of Swiss Water, and under the terms of the debenture with warrants agreement, \nMRC added their senior executive to Swiss Water’s board of directors. As a holder of the debenture with \nwarrants, MRC has the right to exercise the warrants and obtain an additional 2.25 million shares of Swiss \nWater. As such, MRC is considered a related party. Refer to the Borrowings (Note 12) under the \nsubheading ‘MRC – Debenture with warrants /Convertible debenture with Mill Road Capital LLC’ for this \nrelated party disclosure. \n21. \nBASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) \nThe Company presents basic and diluted EPS for its common shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing \nincome or loss attributable to shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common \nshares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing income or loss attributable to \nshareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted \nfor the effects of all dilutive potential common shares. The weighted average number of shares \noutstanding on a diluted basis takes into account the additional shares for the assumed exercise of RSUs \nand warrants, if dilutive. The number of additional shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding \nwarrants were exercised and that the proceeds from such exercises were used to acquire common stock \nat the average market price during the reporting period. When the effects of a potential issuance of shares \nunder warrants and RSUs would be anti-dilutive, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same. Basic \nand dilutive earnings per share are as follows: \n \nAccounts receivable\n$\n3\n                          \n$\n38\n                        \nAccounts payable\n$\n2,170\n                   \n$\n2\n                          \nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nBasic and diluted earnings per share\nNet income and diluted \n    net income attributable to shareholders\n$\n2,387\n                   \n$\n496\n                       \nWeighted average number of shares, basic and diluted\n9,158,161\n           \n9,122,283\n           \nBasic and diluted earnings per share\n$\n0.26\n                      \n$\n0.05\n                      \nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021"

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk \nexposures. Commodity and foreign exchange risk management is carried out under the Foreign Exchange \nRisk management Policy and the Commodity Price Risk Management Policy, both approved by the Board \nof Directors. In addition, the Company monitors other financial and other risks on a regular basis as \ndiscussed below. \n24.1 Commodity price risk hedges \nCommodity price risk hedges on purchase commitments and inventory \nCommodity price risk is the risk that the fair value of inventory will fluctuate as a result of changes in \ncommodity prices.  The Company utilizes futures contracts to manage its commodity price exposure.  The \nCompany buys and sells futures contracts for coffee on the Intercontinental Exchange in order to offset \nits inventory position and fix the input cost of green coffee.

Level 2 captures the Company’s foreign exchange forward \ncontracts, derivative financial liabilities, borrowings embedded option, construction loans, credit \nfacilities and other liabilities. \nc) Level 3 includes financial instruments where the valuation techniques use inputs for the asset or \nliability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
