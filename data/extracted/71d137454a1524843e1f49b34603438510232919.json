      "text": "2\nChairman’s Statement\nResults\nRevenue for the year at £291.9m (2021: £266.4m) is 9.6%\nahead of the comparative year.\nUnderlying operating profit is £51.1 million (2021:\n£51.3m) – 0.4 % below last year. The reported profit for\nthe year of £52.2m differed from this due to the one-off\neffect of insurance pay-outs in respect of the breakdown of\none of the major production lines at our Radcliffe\nmanufacturing plant in September 2019.\nAs I wrote in our trading update on 1 August 2022, the\nsecond half of the year has been, on the one hand, a period\nof full production for our factories in the UK but also with\nits challenges. The optimism at the start of the year on the\ndecline of Covid-19, related supply problems and greater\navailability of labour was offset by a myriad of\nshortages/cost increases following the invasion of the\nUkraine. Transport, fuel and energy increases were\nimmediately obvious and whilst a significant issue during\nthe spring/summer period, we have been mindful that the\nautumn/winter period may bring deeper problems. The\nmost obvious effect on our business has been our decision\nto increase stockholdings as we sought to mitigate the\nrisks associated with the potential inability to\nmanufacture. This, in our view, seemed judicious and\nhopefully is over-cautious. In the event that the crisis does\nnot escalate, then it is likely we will temporarily suspend\nsome production for a period to bring stock levels back to\nnormal. \nTrading margins during the year decreased but are\nacceptable given the flood of cost increases that we have\nin part passed on. As I noted in the last two years’ trading\nupdates, this period was again not normal. For example, in\nsome flooring projects that have been severely delayed, we\nhave honoured the prices originally quoted to preserve the\nvolume needed to feed our production lines. In other\ninstances, we have re-priced to find volume still goes\nelsewhere and in many cases we have re-priced again and\nretained the business. This is the nature of our industry\nwith over-capacity of supply and at least one global\ncompetitor has fallen into receivership on the back of\nfacing similar issues. Whilst some other industries have\npriced daily on the back of this difficult situation, we have\nwalked a more cautious path and I commend our teams\nthat collectively have been successful in managing the\nchallenges we face.\nThere have been some positives in the midst of a generally\ndifficult trading environment. The general boycott in\nRussian trade has eased the widespread shortage of\nshipping containers that has prevailed since Covid-19\ndisrupted normal shipping routes. Similarly, with Russian\nbound supplies of certain raw materials facing export\nrestrictions there was, at times, more availability to our\nfactories as these were diverted back into the European\nmarket. Overall it was a difficult period for manufacturing.\nThe company and our strategy\nJames Halstead is a group of companies involved in the\nmanufacture and supply of flooring for commercial and\ndomestic purposes, based in Bury UK. James Halstead plc\nhas been listed on the London Stock Exchange for nearly 75\nyears.\nThe group was established in 1914 and continues to\noperate out of the original premises in Bury. In its factories\nin Bury and Teesside it manufactures resilient flooring for\ndistribution in the UK and worldwide. \nThe company’s strategy is to constantly develop its brand\nidentity and its reputation for quality, product innovation,\ndurability and availability, thereby enhancing and\nmaintaining goodwill with the aim of achieving repeat\nbusiness. Our focus is to work with stockists who in turn\ndistribute those bulk deliveries whilst promoting and\nrepresenting the products to the end users and specifiers\nwho will purchase the stock from those stockists.\nThis approach is designed to increase and secure revenue\nstreams and drive profitability and cash flow which enables\nthe continuation of dividends thereby creating shareholder\nwealth. In the normal course of business one key element\nof the company ethos is having dedicated sales personnel\nto present our product to our customers’ clientele. \nOver many years our strategy has also included a policy of\ncontinual investment in both process improvement and in\nproduct development to improve output efficiency and\nproduct offering."

      "text": "3\nChairman’s Statement\ncontinued\nCorporate governance and corporate\nsocial responsibility and the\nenvironment\nThe board has over many years recognised its responsibility\ntowards good corporate governance. It is part of our\ncharacter and, I believe, contributes to our ability to deliver\nlong-term shareholder value. Increasingly companies are,\nquite rightly, tasked with demonstrating that their\nenvironmental credentials and supply chain management\nare supported by social and sustainability dimensions with\nappropriate stewardship. \nWe can say, with some pride, that almost 100% of our\nelectric usage is now derived from renewables. Our bi-\nannual Sustainability Report was published in 2021 and we\nhave this report independently audited to further under-\nline our credentials. (Available to download on our website).\nPVC polymer is one of our main raw materials and we\nbegan recycling waste into our processes in the 1950s and\nhave continued to use waste PVC as part of the process of\nmanufacturing in ever increasing volumes. For many years\nwe have funded waste collection with Recofloor – our UK\njoint venture that collects post installation waste PVC\nwithin our industry. We are also founder members of the\nEuropean PVC recycling venture, the AgPr, which funds the\nrecycling of post-consumer PVC waste and diverts waste\nfrom landfill back into the manufacturing process.\nAn important point to note about PVC is that it has evolved\nand it is no longer just derived from petrochemicals. It is\nincreasingly produced from bio-mass. Indeed, many of the\nby-products of PVC manufacturing are indispensable to the\nmedical and food industries. PVC manufacture has the\nlowest consumption of primary energy of any of the major\ncommodity plastics and our PVC flooring is made with over\n80% renewable materials. Our recycling initiatives further\nreduce our footprint on the environment.\nAs part of our focus on the future and the footprint of our\nindustry we are major partners in industry wide bodies. We\nare, for example, active members of the ERFMI (the\nEuropean Resilient Flooring Manufacturing Institute).\nERFMI activities range from involvement in the EU carbon\nneutral strategy through to funding new recycling\ninitiatives to extend the ability of PVC to be recovered and\nrecycled. \nThe UK may have left the European Union but our work on\nstandards, the circular economy, sustainability and\nmeaningful recycling is both Europe wide and globally\nfocused and is progressing at pace. In no way has “Brexit”\nlessened our involvement as Europeans in the flooring\nindustry.\nDividend\nOur cash balances stand at £52.1 million (2021: £83.3\nmillion) with the major reason for the reduction being,\nobviously, increased stock. The inventory at the year end is\n£112.3 million (2021: £60.7 million) which is about 85%\nhigher than the prior year comparative.\nAlso of note regarding the cash flow for the year is taxation\npaid of £9.9 million (2021: £9.9 million) – unchanged and\nequity dividends paid of £32.3 million (2021: £34.1 million)\n– down 5.3%.\nHaving this large investment in our stockholdings and with\nthe challenges facing our companies in terms of cash flow,\nthe Board do not propose to increase the final dividend\nwhich will remain at the level of last year and will be paid\nin December 2022.\nThe interim dividend of 2.25p (2021: 4.25p) was paid in\nJune 2022. \nAcknowledgements\nAs is customary, I would like to thank our staff for their\ncontinued efforts in achieving this year’s result.\nIn addition, I feel I must note the death of HM Queen\nElizabeth II. The brand ‘Polyflor’ was created in 1950, just\nprior to start of her reign. Her Majesty’s service over the\nyears since has no doubt been the rock on which the\nreputation of the United Kingdom has been built and helped\nin the growth of our exports over the last 70 years.\nOur thanks also to the UK Contract Flooring Association for\ntheir members’ accolades with Polyflor being awarded the\n2022 Manufacturer of the Year, as well as the Healthcare\nInstallation of the Year (Kitwood House Care Home in\nCheshire) and International Installation of the Year (Live\nSport Offices, Prague)."

Post\nyear end, prices have been increased and demand has\nremained strong. \nSales volume is higher and we have continued to pass on\ncost increases.

The fall in the value of sterling, most\nmarkedly against the US dollar, in recent days will no doubt\nhave implications to certain input costs but equally, given\nour level of exports, will have some positives. \nWe cannot forecast the effects of energy costs on the\nmyriad of materials and goods that are needed to\nundertake mass volume manufacture but with the vast\narray of skills, knowledge and entrepreneurs within our\ncollective, each challenge should be overcome. \nIn the light of current demand, with the accumulated\nindustry experience at our disposal, I, and the Board, remain\nconfident \nof \nprogress \nover \nthe \nmedium \nterm,\nnotwithstanding the short term challenges I have\nhighlighted in my statement.\nAnthony Wild\nChairman\n30 September 2022"

      "text": "5\nChief Executive’s Review \nAs noted by the Chairman, it has been a mixed year. For the\nlargest input costs to our manufacturing we have had to\naccept price increases. Be it energy or raw materials it has\nbeen a constant adverse situation. The simple idea that\nthese costs are passed on is complicated.\n(a)\nComplicated by the project related nature of\nquotations and the time from quotation to\nsupply of the stock, reality of losing business at\nhigh prices or maintaining it at a loss.\n(b)\nComplicated by the fact that at least two\ngenerations that have never seen inflation of\nthis scale and who are partly in denial as to its\nreality, duration and implications. \n(c)\nComplicated by the possibility that this may yet\naffect the continuous production we have\nenjoyed over many, many years. \nThese challenges are faced by many of our European\ncompetitors and inevitably there is a degree of margin\nerosion which manufacturers from all types of industry face. \nReviewing the businesses in more detail:\nObjectflor/Karndean and James\nHalstead France, our European\noperations\nIn Germany sales growth of near 12% came largely from\ncost surcharges and price increases as costs increased during\nthe year. In one of the most competitive markets for\nflooring, volumes were maintained. The year was one of two\nhalves with the earlier part facing stock shortages due to\nadverse shipping conditions. There were key product\nlaunches that were delayed by both the availability of\ncomplete stock ranges and difficulties in supply of\nmarketing materials to support launches. The stock situation\nimproved as the year progressed.\nIn France sales were increased by 18%, volumes also\nincreased though by a lesser percentage. Investments in\nregional sales teams were key to the sales growth. Stock\nlevels have grown, once again largely planned in the\nexpectation of supply problems.\nPolyflor Pacific – encompassing\nAustralia, New Zealand and Asia\nIn Australia, sales were some 6% ahead of the prior year\nwith increases in profitability that resulted from increased\nmargin due to favourable product mix and staff costs\nsavings compared to the prior year. The staff savings were\nthe result of difficulties in recruitment leaving vacancies for\nperiods of time. The favourable product mix was due to\nhigher margin domestic flooring sales having taken a larger\nproportion of sales than commercial flooring. This was, no\ndoubt, in part because Covid-19 restrictions were in place\nfor a long part of the first half financial year. Freight costs,\nas with all markets, were greater. Stock levels increased.\nIn New Zealand sales were lower than the comparative year.\nThis market had the longest Covid restrictions of our major\nmarkets. Operational restrictions impacted the economy\nand the building sector in particular. Supplying New Zealand\nwas challenging with shipments of flooring from the UK\ntaking up to 8 months from order due to sea freight\ncomplexities such as shortages of shipping containers in\nEurope and severe congestion in ports such as Singapore.\nThe supply of flooring into nationwide social housing\ncontracts continues to be an important source of revenue\nand will continue as backlogs in the roll-out programme\nalleviate. One negative was the supply of cushion vinyl from\nEuropean manufacturers which was severely disrupted.\nNevertheless, it is pleasing to report increased market share\nand customer satisfaction – largely due to our company\nhaving stock and offering service levels far better than\ncompetitors. Stock levels have been increased.\nThis was the first full year of our Malaysian business (which\nalso covers the South Eastern markets of Indonesia,\nSingapore, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines) and we\ncan be satisfied with the progress made to date. The start of\nthe year was again hampered by various lockdowns and\ntravel movements across the territories, but as the year\nprogressed, we saw the order book and sales grow, with sales\nacross the region 153% ahead of last year.\nThe order book remains healthy, and we have every\nexpectation that sales will continue to grow. At the end of\nthe financial year, we strengthened the sales team further\nby employing salespeople directly in Vietnam and Thailand\nto support the distributors, and similar plans are in place for\nthe Philippines before the end of 2022.\nPolyflor & Riverside Flooring, based in\nUK\nWe continue to see growth in the heterogeneous ranges\nmanufactured at Teesside, and a falloff in certain of the\n‘older’ ranges manufactured in Radcliffe. Overall volumes\nwere maintained. Output was increased as we returned to a\nsituation of being able to run all production lines, albeit with\ncontinued absenteeism levels that are above the “normal”\nlevels that existed prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe increase in energy and raw material costs have put\npressure on our margins and whilst we have a proportion of"

The recent\nannouncement by the government, whilst welcome, will\nonly limit the increase, not reduce it. Availability of raw\nmaterials has improved, but costs remain high. The impact\nof rising energy costs on the production costs has been a\nsignificant issue.\nWe have made several price increases during the year across\nour ranges and across all markets to pass on these increases.\nThis continues to be the case after the year end.\nStocks in the UK also increased, both in manufactured and\nmerchanted goods. Delays in product launches earlier in the\nyear compounded the issue as we waited for marketing\nmaterial, such as shade cards and display boards. This was\nanother fallout of the Ukraine war due to the lack of wood\npulp and related materials.\nPolyflor Nordic comprising Polyflor\nNorway based in Oslo and Falck\nDesign based in Sweden\nThe markets have been re-organised to bring both Norway\nand Sweden under one reporting structure. In Norway sales\nare 17% ahead of the prior year largely supported by price\nincreases. Net profit rose by just under 6%. Heterogeneous\nflooring (supplied by Riverside) grew and there has been\ninvestment in additional staff in internal sales and regional\nsales areas. In Sweden, sales increased 37% and the volume\nof product supplied from our UK factories increased by near\n50%. It must be noted that the prior year comparatives\nwere subdued by Covid-19 but nevertheless this is a good\nresult for both countries.\nPolyflor Canada, based in Toronto\nA record year for sales and a significant increase in net profit\nagainst a generally sluggish economy. Our market share is\nstill embryonic in this market but with the shadow of Covid-\n19 having crippled travel for much of the financial year this\nwas a creditable performance. Our Canadian business is very\nlargely project based and these have faced delays in funding\nand progress but the business is well placed for further\ngrowth.\nRest of the World\nOur products are sold in many markets across the globe and\nthe preceding sections cover some of the key markets where\nwe have a local presence and warehousing. These markets\nhave been long established for the sales of our flooring and\nthere has also been significant growth in several other\nmarkets when compared to last year. Spain was up 30%,\nSouth America up 48% and the Middle East up 59%. In\nsome instances the comparative for 2021 was affected by\nthe impact of the Covid-19 virus (most notably in Spain). It\nis pleasing to see these markets have recovered, this has\nbeen hard to achieve with the cost of international freight\nand equally as problematical have been delays and\ndifficulties in available shipping. The markets that did not\ngrow in the year were Africa and North Asia. \nThe North Asia markets have experienced a challenging year\ndue to the increase in Covid-19 cases and the “zero-Covid”\npolicy adopted across China. This meant our local\nwarehouse in China, which became operational last year\nsupplying smaller and local orders, as well as being able to\nsupport other Asian markets, could not despatch products.\nSeveral larger Asian projects, which are shipped direct, have\nbeen delayed. Latterly we have started to see some\nimprovement but sales for 2022 fell by 28% against the\nprevious year.\nIn conclusion\nGiven the circumstances we can only be pleased with the\nresults for the year. The hard work, dedication and\nexperience of our subsidiary directors and management has\nbeen a key factor in this achievement. \nHowever, the challenges have not lessened.\nMark Halstead\nChief Executive \n30 September 2022"

      "text": "7\nFinancial Director’s Review\nAs is usual, we have prepared these accounts by the\nconsistent application of accounting standards with due\nappraisal and judicious accrual for known probable liabilities\nwith as yet uncertain outcome at the year end. As in\nprevious years we, as a board, look to be prudent. \nThe group operates through separate legal entities in certain\nareas of the world and though these are discussed in the\nChief Executive’s Review we, as a board, have concluded\nthat these operations are one segment for the purposes of\nIFRS 8.\nSome key statistics:\nGroup turnover at £291.9 million (2021: £266.4\nmillion) was 9.6% higher than last year. \nProfit before tax was £52.1 million (2021: £51.3\nmillion) 1.6% higher than last year.\nSelling and distribution costs were 8.6% higher than\nlast year. Administration expenses were 19.2% lower\nthan last year\nTrade debtors increased to £46.7 million (2021: £39.3\nmillion). Trade creditors increased to £61.5 million\n(2021: £40.9 million). \nStock levels stand at £112.3 million (2021: £60.7\nmillion). \nCash stands at £52.1 million (2021: £83.3 million)\neven after the payment of £32.3 million in dividends,\n£9.9 million in tax and £3.2 million of capital\nexpenditure.\nKey performance indicators \nThe board considers growth in profit before tax and growth\nin dividend key targets in line with the task of delivering\nshareholder value. Control of working capital continues to\nbe important and the level of cash is monitored. Cash flow\nhas been a key performance measure. \nRather than focus on individual working capital targets or\nratios, the board are informed of all significant issues\ndirectly by subsidiary management by means of monthly\nreports on the key decisions and influences on working\ncapital. Our focus at subsidiary level is on stock availability\nand appropriate credit given to and received from\ncustomers and suppliers respectively. Obviously sales,\nmargin and profitability are monitored as well as cash,\nwhich is the final result of our economic activities.\nAppropriate summaries of these statistics are collated into\nmonthly group reports. These accounts contain analysis and\nmore importantly we require each director to undertake a\nwritten report on their area and often these include key\nindicators (obvious examples are level of absenteeism in the\nfactories, debtor days and margin by product line but these\nare backed up with detail of the key drivers of these ratios\nand the planned response).\nNo individual key performance indicator, or group thereof, is\nregarded as more important than informed, in-depth\nknowledge of the underlying businesses. Subsidiaries\npresent key performance indicators on debtor days, stock\nturn and creditor days but the consolidation of these for the\nwhole group offers no extra benefit as the component of\nmix can mask underlying effects. One such indicator that is\nunder close scrutiny is absenteeism. \nIn terms of non-financial KPIs brand awareness, reputation,\ncustomer satisfaction and market share are all important\nbut difficult to assess. We do not believe that surveys and\nmarket share data, to the extent that they are collated by\nvarious trade bodies, is complete and wholly accurate.\nConsequently little reliance is placed upon this data. We\nsubscribe to various third party reports on the flooring\nindustry which to an extent match and compare us to our\ncompetitors and whilst valid snap-shots of the sector they\nare limited. Customer satisfaction awards are always\nwelcome and we note these in our strategic report.\nPrincipal decisions\nThe strategic report notes our approach to our Section 172\nof the Companies Act 2006 and we have faced many\ndecisions in the year. We define principal decisions as those\nthat have a significant impact on the company and/or group\nand/or our stakeholders. Principal decisions that are\ncurrently confidential to the group are not included in the\nlist below. Any such decision would be included in future\nreport and accounts if and when confidentiality is no longer\na factor. \nThe potential impact of principal decisions on stakeholders is\nassessed in detail by the board. Obviously a significant\nnumber of decisions had to be made in the period of the\nlockdown and principally the level of manufacturing activity.\nThe executive directors kept the board appraised and these\nactions are described in the strategic review and in our\ninterim reporting. To the extent that these decisions affect\nemployees there is a bi-annual update on group performance.\nEach of the principal decisions has an effect on employment\nand hence employees as a whole so this high level update is\nimportant to provide context for the individuals.\nDuring the year the following were considered by the board.\nPayment of dividends \nThe board considered shareholder expectations in setting\nthese dividends, along with the cash position of the\ncompany.

The board had discussed with\nthe trustees the future accrual of benefits and the trustees\nmade clear that an equitable payment by members would\nsee an increase in member contributions of around 12-15%.\nThe view was that the members would not consider this\nappropriate and as a consequence the board tasked the\nexecutive directors with entering consultation with the\nemployees over the closure to future accrual of the final\nsalary pension scheme.\nPost Covid-19 immunisation manufacturing\nThe success of the initial vaccine rollout in the UK, the very\nhigh efficacy of this vaccine and the alteration to self-\nisolation rules provided the opportunity, in the early part of\nthe financial year, to return to more normal shift patterns\nand to increase output from our UK manufacturing sites.\nThe board, however, needed to consider the impact of the\nlesser efficacy of vaccines in the Far East, from which we\nalso source goods, and the ongoing lock-downs of a region\nthat continued to take a zero-tolerance approach to Covid-\n19 cases. In order to mitigate possible supply shortages\nstock levels were raised over a period of several months.\nApproval of group budget \nA key process is to each year agree budgets with our trading\nsubsidiaries and this is presented to the board towards the\nend of each trading year. Having regard to the\nunprecedented situation across our markets regarding\nongoing supply chain issues re the pandemic and the\nUkrainian conflict with the energy crisis a budgetary process\nthis year would be neither accurate nor a useful use of time.\nThe Board, therefore, has assessed progress against the prior\nyear comparative. This year a budget (i.e. for 2022/23)\nprocess has been followed but, again, the flow of trade is still\nfar from normal. In the normal course of budget preparation\nmanning levels and shift patterns are assessed and this\neffect of working hours disseminated to the various\ndepartmental employees. Our business, as with many\nothers, is still experiencing unprecedented levels of\nabsenteeism and huge increases in energy costs both of\nwhich present challenges to the manufacturing process.\nWarehouse expansion \nIn 2020 the board appraised the need for increased\nwarehouse capacity in the UK and plans are being finalised\nfor final approval. The board has agreed this in principle and\nthe cost of this expansion will be in excess of £15 million\n(excluding stock holdings).\nSome progress has been made on this project. The land\nidentified has been granted approval and environmental\nconsiderations are being addressed and the scale of the\nproject agreed.\nPrice increases \nThe increase in costs over many months has been widely\nreported and, we, in common with many other companies\nhave had to increase our prices and will undoubtedly have\nto do so again. The board has been, and remains, ever\nconscious of the effect of price increases on demand and it\nwas resolved that price increases should, to an extent, lag\ncost increases to mitigate this risk. As manufacturers we\nmake no holding gain on stock on hand subsequent to a\nprice increase. Many stockists make gains on the stock they\nhold, in effect increasing prices to their customers in\nadvance of the adverse margin effect and this can give us a\ndegree of knowledge of the effect of increases. The increases\nin cost and availability concerns that were constant through\nthe Covid-19 crisis did seem to alleviate in the autumn of\n2021 though the cost of international freight continued to\nclimb into early 2022. This situation significantly worsened\nsince February 2022 – when the Ukraine was invaded.\nPrice increases have been several during the year and\ncontinue to the time of writing. Flooring contracts can take\nseveral months from initial quotation to supply and it has\nbecome ever more difficult to hold to the initial quotations.\nTo the extent that we have tried to work with end users on\nthese projects margins have eroded.\nUkraine conflict\nSince February 2022 the fragility of global supply markets\nhas worsened as the implications of the Ukraine conflict\nbecame clearer. \nThe board resolved that we should cease to undertake sales\nof flooring to Russia and given the close involvement of\nBelarus to only supply the latter with healthcare related\nproducts (after a review by the board of individual projects).\nThe effects on UK energy costs have been widely reported\nbut the implications to UK manufacture go much deeper.\nCertainly the cost of our UK energy of both gas and\nelectricity has been significant but the effects on raw\nmaterial supplies have also been significant. The\ndependency of many industries in Europe on the large\nrefinery and chemical plants being fed oil and gas from\nRussia made it immediately apparent that the conflict\nwould lead to major disruptions in supply beyond the cost\nof energy. The Nord Stream 1 pipe line supplying gas is\nsignificant but more disruptive to our supply chain is the\nDruzhba oil pipe line. For these reasons the board resolved\nto try and increase stock levels. The resultant record level of\nyear end stock is a consequence."

      "text": "9\nFinancial Director’s Review\ncontinued\nPrincipal business risks and\nuncertainties \nThe ongoing pandemic continues to be an uncertainty,\nthough very much lower in our risk analysis given the\nvaccine roll outs across the globe. The actions we take will\nnecessarily evolve. We have detailed procedures to minimise\nrisk of transmission within our business. During the year\nwith employees self-isolating and shielding we have\nstruggled to run all of our production lines at once and there\nhas been overtime costs of employees covering for those\nabsent. Many governments have offered a range of financial\nsupport packages to help companies and these have been\ntaken advantage of where appropriate. There is little doubt\nthat whilst we offered secure employment there was among\na number of people a degree of resentment that other\npeople were paid to stay at home, not within the\norganisation but within the economy in general. \nThe situation regarding the UK leaving the EU (“Brexit”) is\nstill an ongoing uncertainty. The availability and free flow of\nraw materials has been disrupted and where the\ncomplexities of the pandemic have superimposed\nthemselves on the issue of border controls. The transport\nindustry has not seen a normal period of activity and in the\nmelee includes a mix of increased paperwork, employee\nshortages and excess demand. The increases in fuel and\nenergy costs, most particularly since February 2022, has\nadded to the uncertainties.\nThe Ukraine conflict has become a significant risk and\nuncertainty and the inter-dependencies of global markets\ngoes far beyond energy. Just one example is the effect on\nwood pulp and the manufacture of wood laminate flooring.\nThis is not a flooring that we manufacture or supply but it\nhas vastly increased in cost as a direct result of the Ukraine\ninvasion. Across Europe the production of urea has been\ndisrupted in Croatia, Spain, Italy and Germany which affects\nto availability of “ad-blue” which is essential to vehicle\ntransport. Just one example of the risks that indirectly\nimpact on our group. The point is reported in the key\ndecisions of the year.\nThe board constantly assesses risks and discusses business\nissues regularly. To the extent risk is insurable the board is\nrisk averse and the group is widely insured. A comprehensive\ninsurance appraisal takes place annually to mitigate\nexposure to risks, such as business interruption and fire but\nobviously key risks such as escalating raw material prices\nand energy costs fall outside any insurable event. Inevitably\nthe unexpected cannot be anticipated but given the depth\nof understanding of our principal business by the senior\nmanagement, and the board, risk is ameliorated but not\neliminated. \nOur goals are simple and we avoid over-stretching our\ncapabilities. During the year the unknowns associated with\nthe pandemic were a key unknown and consequently a key\nrisk. Our plans are not limited to a twelve month set of\nfigures, though budgets are prepared and monitored, and we\nlook to benefit from decisions over a longer time frame. A\nmajor mitigation of risk is a close understanding of our\npeople, their motivations, experience and limitations. In\ngeneral it is in the nature of the board to talk about and\nfocus on the problems of our business. This is the major way\nin which risk is not merely identified but mitigated. Excess\ncapacity exists in our businesses and across Europe.\nThe risks identified beyond insured events include foreign\nexchange risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and key management.\nThere are, additionally, key customers and key suppliers\nwhich create dependencies. Sales and purchasing policies\nare under regular review to assess these dependencies. In\nthe main, risk and control are measured and assessed from\na financial perspective, but this is not to the exclusion of\nnon-financial risks and uncertainties. It is clear that\nscenarios can be envisaged where the group’s activities may\nbe disrupted and little could be done to mitigate the\nnegative effects.\nIn terms of credit risk certain companies have insurance in\nplace and where there is no insurance we often require\nletters of credit or bills of exchange but fundamentally\ncredit control and market awareness are important. Our\ncash balances, and bank facilities combined with a robust\nbalance sheet are buffers against liquidity risk.\nIn respect of exchange risk, the group operates\ninternationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk on\nboth sales and purchases that are denominated in\ncurrencies other than sterling. Those giving rise to the most\nsignificant risk are US dollar, euro and Australian dollar. To\nmitigate risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations the\ngroup’s policy is to hedge known and forecast transactions.\nThis hedging is at least 25% and on occasion, albeit rarely,\nmore than 100% of the next year’s anticipated exposure.\nIFRS 7 dictates several disclosures on risk and we have\nundertaken a market risk sensitivity analysis on fluctuations\nin our major currency exposure and the effects on the\nfinancial assets and liabilities in the balance sheet (which is\nincluded in the notes to the accounts).\nSeveral external factors can be envisaged that would affect\noperating activities. These include technical failures, labour\ndisputes outside our businesses, availability of raw\nmaterials, and import or customs delays. Given the spread\nof our operating activities there is a reduced risk of any\nsingle event being catastrophic, but external factors are an\narea of risk that continues to be monitored. Certain\nsuppliers would be difficult to replace or their products to\nsubstitute and delays could be of several weeks duration,"

Given the length of service of many senior\nmanagers, succession planning becomes a risk and/or an\nuncertainty but again the open style of decision making and\ncollaboration mitigate the risk.\nThe activity and progress of our competitors is a significant\nrisk. Whether there is a new innovation or a gain in\ncompetitive advantage by a new process, or the loss of\nmarket share by any means, any effect on our volume\nthroughput will have an effect on profitability. The board\nlooks for market intelligence, and devotes significant time to\nunderstanding the strategy of our competitors. It is clear\nthat the success this business has achieved over the last\ntwenty years leads our competitors to scour all information\nwe publish for data on our activities. \nI would note that we have overseas subsidiaries with\nsignificant profit and assets which are translated at average\nexchange rates (in the case of profit and loss items) and at\nyear end rates (in the case of balance sheet items). The\neffect of this is shown annually in the Consolidated\nStatement of Comprehensive Income. Inevitably there is a\ntranslational exposure on these items and since they are not\nnecessarily cash flows (excepting dividend payments) the\nconsolidated net worth of the group varies over time. We do\nnot hedge this translational exposure though we have in the\npast hedged overseas assets with matching debt. At present\nthe cost and complexity in terms of arranging facilities and\ncomplying with local taxation rules would seem to\noutweigh the benefits.\nThe last five years of these exposures in terms of\nincrease/(decrease) in the value of our overseas assets are as\nfollows:\n£’000\n2022\n926\n2021\n(615)\n2020\n336\n2019\n(170)\n2018\n(759)\nAside from the strategic, operational and financial risks\ndescribed there are also compliance risks relating to the\nlegal and regulatory requirements of the various markets in\nwhich we operate. Directors and senior management are\ninvolved in health and safety, duty and customs clearance,\nwaste management and other such issues.\nDefined benefit pension scheme \nIn common with other long established businesses we have the\ncomplications and uncertainty associated with having a “final\nsalary” pension scheme. The scheme has been closed to new\nentrants since 2002 and was only offered to UK based\nemployees; of our UK based work force around 20% of\nemployees are members of this scheme. We are currently in\nconsultation with members over the closure of the scheme to\nongoing accrual and given the large changes in interest rates, gilt\nyields and the upswing in non Covid-19 related excess death we\nhave instigated another formal valuation of the scheme. It may\nwell be that the “deficit” identified at the last valuation has\nsignificantly dwindled or may be a “surplus”. \nAccounting for this defined benefit scheme is prescribed by IAS\n19 and the quantum of the deficit or surplus is ever more\nvolatile due to the nature of using current (higher – but still\nhistorically low) gilt yields and arguably over prudent\nassumptions as driven by the actuarial profession.  \nThe scheme comprises active members (existing employees),\ndeferred members (past employees not yet in retirement) and\npensioners. Under the current accounting standard for pensions\nthe current service costs of active members are dealt with in the\nincome statement with actuarial gains/losses on the accrued\nbenefits dealt with through the Consolidated Statement of\nComprehensive Income. This year there is a net actuarial gain of\n£7.1 million against a net actuarial gain in 2021 of £12.7 million.\nGordon Oliver\nFinance Director\n30 September 2022"

Many employees have worked their entire\ncareer for the group, and retaining an experienced workforce\nis important to our long term success. Our workforce\nretention rate is very high. Recruitment is biased to the local\narea, and we have a number of graduate recruits and offer\ninternships to support younger people looking to develop\ntheir employment skills. We look to pass on knowledge and\nwe are involved in skills training to the flooring industry,\ntechnical knowledge to the industry in general and\ninvolvement in the Chartered Institute of Human Resource\nManagement’s “Skills Ahead Mentoring Project”.

The committee\nmeets at least once a year, although usually more\nfrequently, to determine the remuneration packages of the\nexecutive directors of the group.\nThe remuneration policy for the non-executive directors is\ndetermined by the board as a whole by reference to market\nrates. They do not participate in the group bonus scheme,\npension scheme or share option scheme. No director can\nvote in regard to his own remuneration.\nRemuneration policy\nThe remuneration policy is to provide terms of employment\nsuch that the recruitment, motivation and retention of high\ncalibre personnel is achieved and maintained to the mutual\nbenefit of shareholders and employees. The committee is\nassisted from time to time by data supplied by independent\nprofessional remuneration consultants as to comparable\ncompanies, although identical circumstances are rarely\nfound.\nBasic salary and bonus payments\nThe directors’ salaries and fees for the year are disclosed in\nnote 14. Annual bonus schemes are in place which reward\nthe executive directors on achieving performance\nobjectives. Performance is determined by index-linked profit\nimprovements through a trend of earnings per share growth.\nUK based executives are eligible members of the employee\nshare scheme. Performance bonuses of £500,000 to each of\nthe group chief executive and group finance director were\npaid during the year. These related to the 2021 financial\nyear.\nShare option schemes\nThe remuneration committee believes that share option\nplans are an important long term incentive to executive\ndirectors and other senior employees. They are intended to\nlink the exercise of the option to a sustained and significant\nimprovement in the underlying financial performance of the\ngroup.\nThe share option plan is reviewed by the remuneration\ncommittee and is open to executive directors and selected\nemployees of the group. The option price per ordinary share\nwill not be less than the market value on the day of grant. A\nlimit of four times earnings has been placed on the value of\nthe aggregate price payable on the exercise of all options or\nrights to subscribe for ordinary shares granted to an\nindividual employee under the share option plan and under\nall other discretionary schemes.\nPensions\nThe company operates Inland Revenue Approved defined\nbenefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The\ngroup chief executive and group finance director are\nmembers of the defined benefit scheme. Pension\nentitlements are calculated on basic salary only.\nAll members of the schemes are required to contribute a\npercentage of their pensionable earnings. Increase in\npensionable salary is restricted to the increase in the\nconsumer price index.\nOther benefits within the schemes are death in service lump\nsums, spouse’s and dependant’s pensions following death in\nservice of the member and ill health early retirement where\nthe appropriate circumstances arise.\nService agreements\nThe chairman and the group chief executive do not have\nservice agreements. The group finance director has a service\nagreement which terminates within or is terminable by the\ncompany and the executive on not more than one year’s\nnotice. The remuneration committee has taken the view\nthat notice periods of one year are reasonable and in the\ninterests of both the company and its executive directors\nhaving regard to prevailing market conditions and current\npractice. Mr S D Hall, Mr M J Halstead and Mr R P Whiting\neach has a service contract for an initial term of two years\nfrom the date of his appointment, which can be terminated\nby either party by one month’s written notice.\nS D Hall\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee"

It is part of our\ncharacter and, I believe, contributes to our ability to deliver\nlong-term shareholder value. The Financial Reporting\nCouncil and the Quoted Company Alliance have both issued\nguidance on governance and having assessed these codes\nwe have aligned our approach to the latter. In many ways\nthis is a continuing process but in the following paragraphs\nwe outline how we effect this code and I trust our\nshareholders will take the time to review our comments.\nIt is my belief that good governance is accountability to\nshareholders as a whole over time rather than being swayed\nby current short term objectives of individual holders. For\nmany companies some shareholders are transient and focus\nshort term, looking for ambitious acquisitions or risky\nstrategies and yet quick to exit at the first sign of problems.\nManagement need to be focused on the medium to long\nterm goal as much as current issues. \nAnthony Wild\nChairman\nDirectors and committees\nThe company is controlled by the board of directors.

A key responsibility of the chairman is to lead the\nboard effectively and to oversee the adoption, delivery and\ncommunication of the company’s corporate governance\nmodel. The chairman as a non-executive director has\nadequate separation from the day-to-day business to be able\nto have an independent view. The chairman ensures that the\nboard receives accurate, timely and clear information and\nthere should be good information flows within the board and\nits committees as well as between the NEDs and senior\nmanagement.\nMr Mark Halstead – Chief Executive\nMr Halstead has over 30 years’ experience in the group\nholding senior management positions within Polyflor prior\nto his appointment as group chief executive in 2002.

Management of subsidiary\ncompanies integrate these objectives into their\nbusiness strategies for presentation to the group\nboard with supporting financial objectives;\nsubsidiary company budgets, containing financial and\noperating targets, capital expenditure proposals and\nperformance/profitability indicators, are presented to\nand reviewed by the group executive directors. The\nconsolidated group budget is approved by the group\nboard;\nthere is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating\nand managing the significant risks faced by the group.\nThese risks are appraised and evaluated by\nresponsible executives and endorsed by subsidiary\nand group management. This process has been in\nplace throughout the year and up to the date of\napproval of the annual accounts;\nas part of the regular monitoring and review, the\ngroup executive directors hold regular meetings with\nthe management of the subsidiary companies at\nwhich reports covering such areas as forecasts,\nbusiness development, strategic planning, risk\nexposure and performance against budget, are\npresented and discussed. These are then reported to\nthe group board, on a quarterly basis;\nthe group board reviews and considers any major\nproblem which may have occurred and assesses how\nthe risks have changed in the period under review;\nthere is a group-wide policy governing appraisal and\napproval of capital expenditure and asset disposals;\nto underpin the effectiveness of controls, it is the\ngroup’s policy to recruit management and staff of\nhigh calibre, integrity and appropriate disciplines.\nHigh standards of integrity, business ethics and\ncompliance with laws, regulations and internal\npolicies are demanded from staff at all levels;\nthe audit committee keeps under review the\neffectiveness of the system of internal control and\nreports its conclusions to the full board;\nthe board also conducts an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the internal control system.\nThis assessment consists of a review of all the\nsignificant areas of internal control, including risk\nassessment, the control environment, control\nactivities, information and communication, and\nmonitoring.\nThe Quoted Company Alliance Code\n(“QCA code”)\nThe directors recognise the importance of good corporate\ngovernance and have chosen to apply the QCA code as their\nframework to do so. The QCA code was developed by the\nQuoted Company Alliance in consultation with a number of\ninstitutional small company investors as an alternative code\napplicable to AIM companies. The QCA code was published\nin April 2018.\nThe QCA code sets out ten principles which seek to ensure\nthat the overall framework for corporate governance is\nrobust. The directors believe that this framework is\nappropriate to the size and operations of the business and\neach of the principles is commented on below. Many of the\ndisclosures relevant to the code are already made in our\nannual report and accounts. \nThe chairman has the responsibility for corporate\ngovernance and has taken a lead on this matter. The\nexecutive team are directed with day to day management\nand are accountable to the rest of the board. The chairman\nexpects and demands open discussion of issues facing the\nbusiness and in the application of this code has sought input\nfrom the auditors, the company’s advisors and a review by\nthe company lawyer. The board is tasked with continuing\nthe success of the business over time and through\nsuccessive generations of management and the importance\nof corporate governance is to oversee the division of\nownership and stewardship.

Where the business has generated funds in\nexcess of its medium-term requirements and no specific\ninvestment requirements exist the board has also\nencouraged the payment of special dividends over the years.\nMembers of the board talk regularly to both institutional\nand private investors and the financial press to ensure that\ncompany’s strategy and objectives are communicated. The\ngroup has a large number of shareholders and regular broker\nupdates are published. \nThe company regularly hosts institution and broker site\nvisits to update on progress and the executive directors are\nin ongoing contact with the nominated advisor who\ncommunicates more closely with the market.\nShareholders can contact the company secretary with\nquestions and may be referred to the directors.\nIn addition, the AGM acts as a forum for all shareholders to\nmeet with the board and raise any questions they may have.\n3.\nTake into account wider stakeholder and social\nresponsibilities and their implications for long-term\nsuccess.\nThe board recognises that the group has responsibilities to\nmany stakeholders other than its shareholders. This includes\nemployees, customers, suppliers and the wider societies in\nwhich we operate.\nIn terms of communications with stakeholders this is done\nin ways appropriate to the stakeholder and may take the\nform of formal announcements, individual meetings (for\nexample appraisals with employees) and negotiations with\nother stakeholders.\nThe environmental impact of our manufacturing and our\noutput is of significant importance to our medium term\nprospects not only to demonstrate our commitment to the\ncommunity at large but also to customers who increasingly,\nand rightly, look for suppliers with strong ethical values. \nAs a member of the communities in which we operate the\nboard takes seriously the impact the business has, positively\nin terms of being an employer and seeking continuous\nimprovement with respect to the impact on the\nenvironment and communities. This is illustrated by our\nannual “Sustainability Report” copies of which are available\non www.polyflor.com which outlines the impact of our\nmanufacturing operations on the wider environment and\nimprovements over time. Feedback from the local\ncommunity is received directly to the head office. This\nreport has been published for nearly two decades and is now\nan annual report.\nWe understand continuous development of our products\nalso contributes to our responsibilities as well as the success\nof the business. This is illustrated, for example, by\ndevelopment of “dementia friendly” flooring in recent years.\nThe operating businesses encourage feedback from\ncustomers through their relationship managers in the\nbusiness and customer service teams.\n4.\nEmbed effective risk management, considering both\nopportunities and threats, throughout the organisation.\nRisk management is reported annually in our Report and\nAccounts along with how those risks are mitigated and how\nthey change over time. \nThe board meets six times a year during which business and\nother risks are assessed. Key subsidiaries have their own\nmanagement boards which meet regularly and assess the\nrisks relevant to that specific business and relevant\nresponses. These are communicated to the main board\neither by direct representation or via group management\nstructures that are in place. There are also formal and\ninformal communication routes that allow for risks to be\ncommunicated to board members in a timely manner from\nall operational entities.\n5.\nMaintain the board as a well-functioning, balanced\nteam led by the chair.\nAnthony Wild, the non-executive chairman is responsible for\nthe running of the board and Mark Halstead as chief\nexecutive has responsibility for implementation of the\nboard’s direction."

We also\naddressed the risk of management override of internal\ncontrols, including assessing whether there was evidence of\nbias by the directors that may have represented a risk of\nmaterial misstatement.\nOur group audit scope focused on the group’s principal\noperating locations being the United Kingdom, Germany\nand Australia. The operations in the United Kingdom, which\nwere deemed to be significant components, were subject to\na full scope audit given the statutory audit requirements\nwhilst the significant components in Germany and Australia\nwere also subject to a full scope audit to component\nmateriality. The German component was audited by a non-\nBDO member firm. The Australian component was audited\nby a BDO member firm. The remaining components of the\ngroup were considered non-significant and these\ncomponents were principally subject to analytical review\nprocedures by the group engagement team.\nOur involvement with component auditors\nFor the work performed by component auditors, we\ndetermined the level of involvement needed in order to be\nable to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit\nevidence has been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the\ngroup financial statements as a whole. Our involvement\nwith component auditors included the following:\nThe German operations form a significant part of group\nturnover and profitability. As part of our audit strategy, the\nResponsible Individual and senior members of the group\naudit team were involved during the planning and risk\nassessment process of the German component in addition\nto during the completion of detailed audit procedures. We\nattended key meetings with component management and\nauditors, and reviewed component auditor work papers.\nThe Australian operations form a further significant part of\ngroup turnover and profits. Again the Responsible Individual\nand senior members of the group audit team were involved\nat all stages of the audit process, directing the planning and\nrisk assessment work performed through calls with the\ncomponent auditors and local management. Reviews of the\ncomponent auditor working papers were also completed.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional\njudgement, were of most significance in our audit of the\nfinancial statements of the current period and include the\nmost significant assessed risks of material misstatement\n(whether or not due to fraud) that we identified, including\nthose which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit\nstrategy, the allocation of resources in the audit, and\ndirecting the efforts of the engagement team. These matters\nwere addressed in the context of our audit of the financial\nstatements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon,\nand we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nKey audit matter – Inventory provisioning\nAs described in Note 2 (accounting policies) and Note 19\n(inventories), the group carries inventory at the lower of\ncost and net realisable value. \nProvision is made against slow moving, obsolete and\ndamaged inventories. As at 30 June 2022, the group held\ninventories of £112.3m (2021: £60.7m). \nThis area represented a key audit matter as significant\nmanagement judgement is required to assess the\nappropriate level of provisioning for items which may be\nsold below cost or written off as a result of a reduction in\nconsumer demand particularly in light of changing\nconsumer tastes and new products being developed. Such\njudgements include management’s expectations for future\nsales."

      "text": "26\nHow the scope of our audit addressed the key\naudit matter\nWe \nobtained \nevidence \nconcerning \nmanagement’s\nassumptions applied in calculating the value of inventory\nprovisions by:\nChallenging the group’s inventory provisioning policy\nwith specific consideration given to slow moving or\nobsolete stock lines. This involved a review of\nproduction and sales records for a sample of products\nto ascertain when they were last made or sold and\nwhether they had been appropriately provided for;\nassessing the appropriateness of the percentages\napplied within the provision by reviewing historic\nsales and the ageing of stock; and\ntesting of a sample of inventory to confirm it is held\nat the lower of cost and net realisable value, through\ncomparison to invoices for cost and sales prices.\nWe also audited the basis of stock provisioning applied by\nall group entities and considered whether these were being\napplied consistently and reflected the nature of the stock\nheld in each location.\nKey observation: Our work did not highlight evidence that\nthe method of inventory provision was inappropriate.\nKey audit matter – Pension scheme\nassumptions\nAs described in Note 2 (accounting policies) and Note 26\n(retirement benefit obligations), the group has a defined\nbenefit pension plan in the UK.\nAt 30 June 2022, the group recorded a net retirement\nbenefit of £6.1m (2021: £4.4m obligation), comprising\nscheme assets of £69.2m (2021: £77.3m) and scheme\nliabilities of £63.1m (2021: £81.6m).\nThe pension valuation is dependent on market conditions\nand key assumptions made by management, in particular\nrelating to investment markets, discount rate, inflation\nexpectations and life expectancy assumptions.\nThis area and the related disclosures represented a key audit\nmatter given that the setting of these assumptions is\ncomplex and requires the exercise of significant\nmanagement judgement with the support of third party\nactuaries.\nIn testing the pension valuation, with the help of external\npension actuarial experts, we reviewed the key actuarial\nassumptions used, both financial and demographic, and\nconsidered the appropriateness of the methodology utilised\nto derive these assumptions.\nWe benchmarked the scheme assumptions against other\nschemes of a similar size and profile. Specifically, we\nchallenged the discount rate, inflation and mortality\nassumptions applied in the calculation by using pension\nexperts to benchmark the assumptions applied against\ncomparable \nthird \nparty \ndata \nand \nassessed \nthe\nappropriateness of the assumptions in the context of the\ngroup’s own position. We have also performed sensitivity\nanalysis on the assumptions determined by the directors.\nWe have tested the accuracy of the scheme asset\nstatements by reference to service organisation control\nreports to gain assurance over the robustness of the\nprovider’s internal controls. Further, we have sample tested\nassets to third party sources in order to confirm ownership\nand valuation \nFurthermore, we have assessed the disclosure of the net\npension asset and the related assumptions and sensitivities\nin the financial statements against the relevant accounting\nframework.\nKey observation: We have not identified any evidence to\nsuggest that the methodology and assumptions applied in\nrelation to determining the pension valuation are not within\nan acceptable range. Furthermore, the disclosures made are\nin accordance with the relevant accounting framework.\nOur application of materiality\nWe apply the concept of materiality both in planning and\nperforming our audit, and in evaluating the effect of\nmisstatements. We consider materiality to be the\nmagnitude by which misstatements, including omissions,\ncould influence the economic decisions of reasonable users\nthat are taken on the basis of the financial statements. \nIn order to reduce to an appropriately low level the\nprobability that any misstatements exceed materiality, we\nuse a lower materiality level, performance materiality, to\ndetermine the extent of testing needed. Importantly,\nmisstatements below these levels will not necessarily be\nevaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the\nnature of identified misstatements, and the particular\ncircumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their\neffect on the financial statements as a whole."

The address of its registered office is Beechfield,\nHollinhurst Road, Radcliffe, Manchester, M26 1JN.\n2.\nAccounting policies\nBasis of preparation\nOn 31 December 2020, IFRS as adopted by the European Union at that date was brought into UK Law and became UK adopted\ninternational accounting standards, with future changes being subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. The group\ntransitioned to UK adopted international accounting standards in its consolidated financial statements on 1 July 2021. There was\nno impact or changes in accounting from the transition.\nThe group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards. The\ncompany financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure\nFramework, and are presented separately following the group financial statements.\nThe group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and on the historical cost basis as modified by the\nvaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities (being derivative instruments) at fair value.\nGoing concern\nThe directors have reviewed current performance and forecasts, combined with capital investment and expenditure commitments,\nand a range of trading scenarios. The group has no net borrowings and owns the freeholds on many of its premises (the most\nsignificant being four UK operating sites and two sites in Germany).\nAfter considering current trading and forward forecasts, the directors have the reasonable expectation that the group has adequate\nfinancial resources to continue in operation, including contractual and commercial commitments, for the foreseeable future.\nAs the global pandemic recedes, but with many markets now facing high energy costs and supply chain concerns, the directors have\nconsidered that there may be a weakening of demand for flooring products in arriving at the conclusion above.\nFluctuations in exchange rates have been a constant factor since sterling floated in 1971. Our hedging delays the effect of sharp\nchanges.\nWorking with our senior executives we have considered scenarios for the purpose of the statutory audit that involve layoffs and\ncessation of production in the winter months and, whilst we do not believe they are likely, have been considered to assess the going\nconcern concept. The cost and availability of international freight has continued to frustrate export sales and as part of the going\nconcern review we have factored in the scenario that this will continue for several months.\nBased on the above the directors are satisfied the group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for at least one\nyear from the date of approval of the financial statements.\nRecent accounting developments\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards and interpretations in\nforce at the reporting date. The group has not adopted any standards or interpretations in advance of the required implementation\ndates."

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control exists if all three of the following elements are present:\npower over the entity, exposure to variable returns from the entity, and the ability to affect those variable returns. Control is\nreassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control. Control is\nnormally achieved by a majority shareholding. The company, directly or through an intermediate subsidiary owned 100% of the\nshare capital of all of its subsidiaries. The results of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated from the date on which control passes to\nthe group. The results of disposed subsidiaries are consolidated up to the date on which control passes from the group. All intra-\ngroup transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.\nSegment reporting\nOperating segments are those segments for which results are reviewed by the group’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) to\nassess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated. The CODM is the group board which meets regularly\nthroughout the year to discuss the performance and results of the group as a whole. The business of the group is the manufacture\nand distribution of flooring products. The group operates through separate legal entities in certain areas of the world and in order\nto provide information in a structured manner to readers of the accounts who are unfamiliar with the internal management\nreporting of the group, these operations are discussed by the chief executive in his report. However, the directors consider that\nunder the definitions contained within IFRS 8 there is only one reportable segment, which is the group as a whole. This is consistent\nwith the core principle of IFRS 8, which is to disclose information to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature\nand financial effects of the business activities in which the group engages and the economic activities in which it operates.\nForeign currencies\nFunctional and presentation currency – the group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the\nfunctional currency of the parent company, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the parent company\noperates.\nTransactions and balances – transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance\nsheet date. Exchange differences on retranslating monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement except\nwhere they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges, in which case the exchange differences are deferred in equity.\nForeign subsidiaries – the results of foreign subsidiaries (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy), that have\na functional currency different from the group’s presentation currency, are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year.\nAssets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, that have a functional currency different from the group’s presentation currency, are\ntranslated at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising from the translation of the results\nof foreign subsidiaries and their opening net assets are recognised as a separate component of equity.\nWhen a foreign subsidiary is sold the cumulative exchange differences relating to the retranslation of the net investment in that\nforeign subsidiary are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. This applies only to exchange\ndifferences recorded in equity after 1 July 2006. Exchange differences arising prior to 1 July 2006 remain in equity on disposal as\npermitted by IFRS 1."

Goodwill is\nreviewed for impairment at least annually and when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For\nthe purpose of impairment review, goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash generating unit (CGU) within the group. An\nimpairment loss is recognised if the carrying value of the goodwill or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Any impairment\nloss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. On disposal of a subsidiary, the\nattributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal. Goodwill arising on acquisitions\nbefore the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the UK GAAP value as at that date having been reviewed for impairment\nat that date and subsequently at least annually.\nTaxation\nIncome tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except\nto the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income.\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to taxation authorities based\non tax rates and laws that are enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method,\non temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their corresponding book values as recorded in\nthe group’s financial statements with the following exceptions:\nwhere the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that\nis not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;\ndeferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against\nwhich the deductible temporary differences can be utilised;\ndeferred income tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries where there is no likelihood to remit the\nearnings.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on tax rates and laws that are substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\nShare-based payments\nThe group grants share options to certain of its employees.An expense in relation to such options based on their fair value at the\ndate of grant, is recognised over the vesting period. The group uses the Black Scholes model for the purpose of computing fair value.\nInventories\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a weighted average cost basis. Cost includes expenditure\nincurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of finished and partly\nfinished goods, cost represents the cost of raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads on bases\nconsistently applied from year to year. In all cases provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.\nFinancial assets and liabilities\nFinancial assets comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Financial liabilities comprise trade and other\npayables."

The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been\nmade. The amount charged to the income statement is the contribution payable in the year. Differences between contributions\npayable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as receivables or payables in the balance sheet.\nA defined benefit scheme is a scheme in which the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is\ndefined. For the defined benefit scheme, pension costs and the costs of providing other post retirement benefits are charged to the\nincome statement in accordance with the advice of qualified independent actuaries. Past service costs are recognised immediately\nin the income statement. The service cost is charged against operating profit and the net interest cost is charged as a finance cost.\nThe net interest cost is calculated using the discount rate at the beginning of the period. The retirement benefit obligations\nrecognised on the balance sheet represent the difference between the fair value of the scheme’s assets and the present value of\nthe scheme’s defined benefit obligations measured at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually\nby independent actuaries using the projected unit method. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit obligations are recognised\nin the period in which they arise in other comprehensive income.A net defined benefit obligations asset is recognised to the extent\nthat the group can realise an economic benefit from that asset.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment except for land which is shown at\ncost less any impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Depreciation is\ncalculated on the depreciable amount (being cost less the estimated residual value) on a straight line basis over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets as follows:\nFreehold land: Not depreciated\nFreehold buildings: 10 to 50 years\nPlant and equipment: 2 to 20 years\nResidual values and useful lives are reviewed at each group balance sheet date for continued appropriateness and indications of\nimpairment and adjusted if appropriate."

The discount rate used is the rate inherent in the lease if this can be determined, or the incremental borrowing rate.\nSubsequent to initial recognition, the right of use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term\nor the useful life of the asset. The lease liabilities are increased by the interest cost and reduced by the lease payments made. A\ndepreciation charge and an interest cost are recognised in the income statement.\nThe lease payments for low value and short term leases are expensed in the income statement on a straight line basis over the\nlease term.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue is from the sales of flooring products and is recognised at the point in time when control of the products has been\ntransferred to the customer. Sales are recognised on despatch of the goods to the customer. Control passes to the customer at the\npoint terms of despatch are met. Sales are invoiced at the time of despatch and payment terms are based on the invoice date.\nPayment terms vary by customer, but do not exceed six months. Revenue is stated after provision for trade discounts and rebates\ndue on the sales. Revenue excludes VAT and sales taxes.\nResearch and development\nExpenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and\nunderstanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.\nDevelopment expenditure not meeting all the criteria for capitalisation contained in IAS 38 – Intangible Assets, is recognised in the\nincome statement as an expense as incurred.\nGrants\nGrants that compensate for expenses are recognised in the income statement in the same period and category in which the\nexpenses are recognised.\nDividends\nInterim dividends are recognised when they are paid. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the shareholders.\nDerivative financial instruments and hedging\nThe group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency transactional risk. In accordance with its\ntreasury policy the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently\nremeasured at fair value at each group balance sheet date.\nThe method by which any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognised depends on whether the instrument is designated\nas a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The group recognises an instrument as a hedging\ninstrument by documenting at the inception of the transaction the relationship between the instrument and the hedged items and\nthe objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction. To be designated as a hedging instrument, an instrument must\nalso be assessed, at inception and on an ongoing basis, to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items."

These risks are managed, with the objective of\nlimiting adverse effects, from the group’s head office in accordance with policies determined by and decisions made by the group\nboard.\nThere have been no changes in financial risks from the previous year.\nMarket risks\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as currency exchange rates and interest rates will affect the group’s results.\nThe objective of market risk management is to control it within suitable parameters.\n(a)  Foreign exchange risk\nThe group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a\ncurrency other than the functional currency of the entity making the sale or purchase. There are a range of currencies giving rise to\nthis risk, but most significant is the euro. To mitigate risks associated with future exchange rate fluctuations, the group’s policy is\nto use forward exchange contracts to hedge its known and certain forecast transaction exposures based on historical experience\nand projections. The group hedges at least 25% but rarely more than 100% of the next twelve months’ anticipated exposure.\n(b)  Interest rate risk\nThe group does not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk. The main element of interest\nrate risk concerns sterling deposits which are made on floating market based rates and short-term overdrafts in foreign currencies\nwhich are also on floating rates."

      "text": "41\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\ncontinued\n3.\nFinancial risk management (continued)\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its\ncontractual obligations and arises principally from the group’s trade receivables from customers and monies on deposit with\nfinancial institutions.\nWith regard to trade receivables, the group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk. Exposure is spread across a large\nnumber of companies and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary across the world. Trade receivable exposures are\nmanaged locally in the individual operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate. Where\npracticable and deemed necessary the group endeavours to minimise credit risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as\nletters of credit and insurance.\nThe group controls credit risk in relation to counterparties to other financial instruments by dealing only with highly rated financial\ninstitutions.\nThe group’s maximum credit exposure on financial assets is represented by their book value.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The group’s approach to\nmanaging liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due.\nCapital risk\nThe group’s objectives in managing capital are to safeguard the ability of all entities within the group to continue as going concerns,\nwhilst maximising the overall return to shareholders over time. The capital structure of the group consists of equity attributable\nto equity holders of the parent company less cash and cash equivalents.\nThe group will only usually take on borrowings where those borrowings would be financed by the cash expected to be generated\nby the related investment opportunity and where the borrowing would not significantly increase the group’s exposure to risk.\nAt the year end the group had preference shares classified as debt of £200,000.\n4.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of certain\nestimates and associated assumptions that affect the application of policies, the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these\nestimates are based on management’s best assessments of amounts, events or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from\nthose estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis. There are no significant\njudgements.\nThe estimates that have had the most significant effect on the amounts included in these consolidated financial statements are as\nfollows:"

      "text": "42\n4.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)\nInventories\nFor financial reporting purposes the group evaluates its inventory to ensure it is carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.\nProvision is made against slow moving, obsolete and damaged inventories. Damaged inventories are identified and written down\nthrough the inventory counting procedures conducted within each business. Provision for slow moving and obsolete inventories is\nassessed by each business as part of their ongoing financial reporting. Obsolescence is assessed based on comparison of the level\nof inventory holding to the projected likely future sales. Future sales are assessed based on historical experience, and adjusted where\nthe market conditions are known to have changed. To the extent that future events impact the saleability of inventory these\nprovisions could vary significantly. For example, changes in specifications or regulations may render inventory, previously considered\nto have a realisable value in excess of cost, obsolete and require such inventory to be fully written off.\nExpected credit losses\nProvision is made against trade receivables for lifetime expected credit losses using the simplified approach in IFRS 9. Within each\nof the operating units, assessment is made locally of the recoverability of trade receivables based on a range of factors including\nthe age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and forward looking information. Determining the recoverability of\nan account involves estimation as to the likely financial condition of the customer and their ability to subsequently make payment.\nIf the group is cautious as to the financial condition of the customer the group may provide for accounts that are subsequently\nrecovered. Similarly, if the group is optimistic as to the financial condition of the customer, the group may not provide for an\naccount that is subsequently determined to be irrecoverable. In recent years the group has not experienced significant variation in\nthe amount charged to the income statement in respect of doubtful accounts, when compared to sales. Further details are provided\nin note 20.\nIncome taxes\nIn determining the group’s provisions for income tax and deferred tax it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of\nkey tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. To the extent that the final outcome differs from the\ntax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the\ndetermination is made.\nRetirement benefit obligations\nThe liability recognised in respect of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating\nto mortality, inflation, salary increases, and the rate at which liabilities are discounted. Any change in these assumptions would\nimpact the retirement benefit obligations recognised. Further details on these estimates are provided in note 26."

The CODM is the group board which meets regularly\nthroughout the year to discuss the performance and results of the group as a whole. The business of the group is focussed almost\nentirely on the manufacture and distribution of flooring products. The directors consider that under the definitions contained within\nIFRS 8 there is only one reportable segment, which is the group as a whole. This is consistent with the core principle of IFRS 8, which\nis to disclose information  to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business\nactivities in which the group engages and the economic activities in which it operates.

Retirement benefit obligations\nIn the UK the group operates a defined benefit pension scheme which was closed to new members in 2002. In addition some\nemployees both in the UK and overseas are provided with retirement benefits through defined contribution arrangements.\nExecutive directors Mr M Halstead and Mr G R Oliver are members of the defined benefit scheme and the employer pension\ncontributions for the year were £25,000 and £nil respectively. At 30 June 2022 the accrued pension for the highest paid\ndirector was £131,000 and the transfer value of this accrued benefit was £2,557,000.\nDisclosures relating to the defined benefits pension scheme are as follows: \nThe company sponsors the Halstead Group Pension Scheme, a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK. The scheme is\nadministered within a trust which is legally separate from the company. Trustees are appointed by both the company and the\nscheme’s membership and act in the interest of the scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the company.\nThe trustees are also responsible for the investment of the scheme’s assets.\nExisting members accrue an annual pension of 1/60th or 1/80th (depending on category) of final salary for each year of pensionable\nservice, increasing in line with inflation whilst in payment. On the death of an active member the scheme provides the widow(er)\na lump sum and a spouse’s pension. Members who leave service before retirement are entitled to a deferred pension.\nActive members of the scheme pay contributions at the rate of either 7.5% or 6% of salary depending on category and the\ncompany pays the balance of the cost as determined by regular actuarial valuations.\nThe scheme poses a number of risks to the company, for example, longevity risk, investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and\nsalary risk. The trustees are aware of these risks and use various techniques to control them. The trustees have a number of internal\ncontrol policies including a risk register, which are in place to manage and monitor the various risks they face."

      "text": "53\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\ncontinued\n26. Retirement benefit obligations (continued)\nThe scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every three years. These actuarial valuations are\ncarried out in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and so include margins for prudence. This contrasts with\nthese accounting disclosures, which are determined using best estimate assumptions.\nThe last formal actuarial valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2020. The results of that valuation have been projected forward to\n30 June 2022 by a qualified independent actuary. The figures in the following disclosure were measured using the Projected Unit\nMethod.\nOn 26 October 2018, the High Court reached a judgement in relation to Lloyds Banking Group’s defined benefit pension schemes\nwhich concluded that schemes should equalise pension benefits for men and women as regards guaranteed minimum pension\nbenefits. The impact of this judgement on the scheme has been estimated and included in the pension liability.\nAt the end of the reporting period the scheme was in surplus as measured under the principles of IAS19. Under the accounting\nstandard an entity is allowed to recognise a pension scheme surplus on its balance sheet to the extent that it is able to realise an\neconomic benefit from that surplus.\nThe directors have reviewed the rules of the scheme and have concluded that the company can gain full economic benefit from\nthe scheme on the basis that the rules provide it access to any surplus after the last member has no further benefits in the scheme\n(referred to in the standard as gradual settlement). Furthermore, the rules are such that the trustees are not able to take any actions\nthat would reduce the accounting surplus, such as benefit augmentations or triggering a scheme wind-up, without the company’s\naction or consent.\n2022\n2021\nPrincipal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date\nDiscount rate at end of year\n4.00%\n2.05%\nFuture salary increases\n2.45%\n2.55%\nFuture pension increases\n2.95%\n3.00%\nRate of inflation – RPI\n3.05%\n3.15%\n– CPI\n2.45%\n2.55%\nFuture expected lifetime of current pensioner at age 65:\nMale born in 1957\n21.0 years\n20.9 years\nFemale born in 1957\n23.4 years\n23.3 years\nFuture expected lifetime of future pensioner at age 65:\nMale born in 1977\n22.3 years\n22.3 years\nFemale born in 1977\n24.9 years\n24.8 years\nThe sensitivities of the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are as follows:\nAssumption\nChange in assumption\nImpact on scheme liabilities\nDiscount rate\nDecrease by 0.1%\nIncrease by £0.8m\nRate of inflation\nIncrease by 0.1%\nIncrease by £0.5m\nExpected lifetime\nIncrease by 1 year\nIncrease by £2.7m\nThe sensitivities may not be representative of the actual change in the present value of the scheme obligations, as it is unlikely that\nthe change in assumptions would occur in isolation of each other, as the assumptions may be linked.\n2022\n2021\nAmounts recognised in the balance sheet\n£’000\n£’000\nPresent value of funded obligations\n(63,092)\n(81,622)\nFair value of scheme assets\n69,236\n77,265\nNet asset/(liability) before deferred taxation\n6,144\n(4,357)\nRelated deferred tax (liability)/asset\n(1,536)\n828\nNet asset/(liability) after deferred taxation\n4,608\n(3,529)"

Derivative financial instruments\nThe group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the functional\ncurrency of the entity concerned. The currencies giving rise to this risk are various, but the most significant are the US Dollar and\nthe Euro. Forward exchange contracts are used to manage this exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The group buys\nor sells foreign currency at spot where necessary to address any short-term imbalances.\nThe group hedges, using forward exchange contracts, transactions denominated in a foreign currency which are not matched\nagainst other transactions in the same currency within the group.The forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one\nyear after the balance sheet date.\nThe group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair\nvalue. The hedged cash flows are expected to occur within one year after the balance sheet date.\nThe fair values have been calculated by applying (where relevant), for equivalent maturity profiles, the rate at which forward\ncurrency contracts with the same principal amounts could be acquired at the balance sheet date.\nChanges in the fair value of forward exchange contracts for which no hedge accounting is applied or where the hedge is considered\nineffective are recognised in the income statement.\nOther than the use of forward exchange contracts as detailed above, the group does not make use of derivative financial\ninstruments."

The group does not fix the interest rate receivable on its sterling balances, and based on balances held at the\nyear end, a 1% increase or decrease in sterling interest rates would lead to an increase or decrease in post-tax earnings of\n£239,000 (2021: £523,000). The table below details the notional impact of changes in the euro exchange rate against sterling on\nthe group’s post-tax profit and equity.

At a general\nmeeting at which the holders of preference shares are entitled to attend and vote, the preference shares shall entitle a holder\nthereof, or his proxy, to vote only for every preference share held by him.\n12.
