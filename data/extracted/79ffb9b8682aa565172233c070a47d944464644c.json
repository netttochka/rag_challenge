      "text": "Summary of Principal Risks Associated with Our Business\n  \n•\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history and no products approved for commercial sale. We have \nincurred significant losses since our inception, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, \nwhich, together with our limited operating history, makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\n•\nWe will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable \nterms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other \noperations. \n•\nWe are early in our development efforts. Our business is heavily dependent on the successful development, regulatory approval and \ncommercialization of our current and future product candidates. \n•\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain timelines and outcomes, and results of earlier studies and \ntrials may not be predictive of future trial results. If development of our product candidates is unsuccessful or delayed, we may be unable to \nobtain required regulatory approvals and we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. \n•\nWe face significant competition for our drug discovery and development efforts in an environment of rapid technological and scientific \nchange, and our product candidates, if approved, will face significant competition, which may prevent us from achieving significant market \npenetration. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and we may not be able to successfully compete.\n•\nOur development programs currently in or preparing to enter clinical development are focused on product candidates for the treatment of \nchronic myeloid leukemia, or CML, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, and obesity. For each of these programs, we may not be able to \ngain agreement with regulatory authorities regarding an acceptable development plan, the outcome of our clinical trials may not be favorable \nand, even if favorable, regulatory authorities may not find the results of our clinical trials to be sufficient for marketing approval. This makes \nit difficult to predict the timing and costs of the clinical development of our product candidates.\n•\nOur business has been and could continue to be adversely affected by the evolving and ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic or any future \nepidemic in regions where we or third parties on which we rely have significant manufacturing facilities, concentrations of clinical trial sites \nor other business operations. Such pandemics could adversely affect our operations, as well as the business or operations of our \nmanufacturers or other third parties with whom we conduct business.\n•\nWe rely completely on third parties to manufacture our clinical drug supplies and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial \nsupplies of any approved product candidate, and our commercialization of any of our product candidates could be stopped, delayed or made \nless profitable if those third parties fail to obtain approval of the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities, fail to provide us with sufficient \nquantities of drug product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\n•\nWe rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our preclinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out \ntheir contractual duties, meet rigorously enforced regulatory standards or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory \napproval for or commercialize any of our product candidates on a timely basis or at all. \n•\nIf we fail to attract and retain senior management and key scientific personnel or if we lose our personnel for health or other reasons, our \nbusiness may be materially and adversely affected.\n•\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating \nresults to fall below expectations.\niii"

      "text": "PART I\nItem 1. Business. \nCompany Overview \nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of small-molecule product candidates to address serious diseases, \nincluding oncology, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and obesity. Our programs are based on mechanisms of action that have achieved proof-of-\nconcept in clinical trials in indications with large unmet needs. The most advanced product candidates in our pipeline – TERN-701, TERN-501 and TERN-\n601– were internally discovered. TERN-701 is our allosteric BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is in clinical development in China for chronic \nmyeloid leukemia (CML), a form of cancer that starts in bone marrow. We expect our Phase 1 trial for TERN-701 to start in the second half of 2023, and \nintend to include sites from the United States, Europe and other countries. TERN-501 is our highly selective thyroid hormone receptor beta (THR-β) \nagonist for NASH in Phase 2a clinical development with top-line data expected in the third quarter of 2023. TERN-601 is our small-molecule glucagon-like \npeptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist for metabolic diseases such as obesity. Our goal is to initiate a first-in-human clinical trial for TERN-601 in the \nsecond half of 2023. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital \nexpenditure requirements into 2026 and be sufficient to generate at least three key clinical data readouts from our lead programs in CML, NASH and \nobesity. Additionally, we have an ongoing discovery effort for the TERN-800 series of small-molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide \nreceptor (GIPR) modulators for obesity, which have the potential to be combined with GLP-1 receptor agonists.\nTERN-701 is our proprietary, oral, potent, allosteric BCR-ABL TKI specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket for chronic myeloid leukemia. \nCML, a form of cancer that begins in the bone marrow and leads to the growth of leukemic cells, is classified as an orphan indication. The standard of care \n(SOC) for CML includes active-site TKIs including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib. However, an unmet medical need remains due to \n(1) an increasing number of patients becoming refractory or intolerant to the current SOC, (2) BCR-ABL mutations that are difficult for active-site TKIs to \ntreat (such as T315I), or (3) safety warnings for active-site TKIs used in CML patients who are resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy. Allosteric TKIs, \nwhich bind to the myristoyl-binding pocket, represent a new treatment class for CML and have the potential to address the shortcomings of active-site \nTKIs, including off-target activity and limited efficacy against active site resistance mutations. TERN-701 aims to address the limitations of active-site \nTKIs with the goal of achieving improved tumor suppression through a combination of (1) potent activity against BCR-ABL including a broad range of \nmutations and (2) improved safety and tolerability profiles. Survival rates and treatment durations for people living with CML continue to increase. As a \nresult, physicians are seeking additional efficacious therapies for people whose tolerability, co-morbidity and/or drug-drug interaction profiles change over \ntime, limiting their available treatment options, quality of life and the effectiveness of mainstay therapies. We expect our Phase 1 trial for TERN-701 to \nstart in the second half of 2023, and intend to include sites from the United States, Europe and other countries, with potential interim top-line readouts from \ninitial cohorts in 2024. We retain all worldwide development and commercialization rights for TERN-701 outside of greater China. In July 2020, Hansoh \nPharmaceuticals (Hansoh) in-licensed TERN-701 for development in the greater China region. TERN-701 is referred to by Hansoh as HS-10382. Hansoh is \nresponsible for all development costs in the greater China region, including for the ongoing Phase 1 trial that it is conducting in China. An enrollment \nprogress update for the ongoing China Phase 1 trial is anticipated as part of a trial-in-progress poster presentation that has been submitted to an upcoming \noncology conference in mid-2023.\n5"

      "text": "Our other clinical stage program is TERN-501, a THR-β agonist with high metabolic stability, enhanced liver distribution and greater selectivity for \nTHR-β compared to other THR-β agonists in development. In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-\n501 in healthy volunteers with mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. In the single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose \n(MAD) cohorts, TERN-501 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of adverse events (AEs) across all TERN-501 treatment groups and \nplacebo. All AEs were mild to moderate with no apparent dose relationship, with no treatment-emergent serious AEs and no discontinuations of study or \nstudy drug due to any AE. Notably, there were no cardiac safety signals, no incidence of diarrhea and no differences between TERN-501 dose groups and \nplacebo in change from baseline in heart rate, blood pressure or other vital signs. Based on this, we believe that TERN-501 has the potential to have a \ndifferentiated safety and tolerability profile compared to other THR-β agonists that have observed gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety findings in \nPhase 1 and Phase 2 trials. Significant increases in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), a key pharmacodynamic marker of THR-β engagement linked to \nNASH histologic efficacy, were observed following treatment with TERN-501. The SHBG increases observed within 14 days of TERN-501 treatment were \nsignificant, dose dependent and have been associated with robust reductions in magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and \nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Activity Score in a precedent late-stage clinical NASH trial of another THR-β agonist. Preliminary \npharmacokinetic results support the co-administration of TERN-501 and TERN-101 in NASH patients, with no apparent need for dose adjustment. We \ninitiated the Phase 2a DUET clinical trial in NASH patients including both monotherapy and combination arms of TERN-501 and TERN-101 in July 2022. \nEnrollment was completed in February 2023, and top-line data are expected in the third quarter of 2023. We are also engaging in activities to enable the \ninitiation of a Phase 2b/3 program, such as drug supply manufacturing and chronic toxicology studies, and plan to initiate our Phase 2b/3 program in 2024. \nWe are also discovering and developing oral small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists for the treatment of obesity. Our \nlead molecule, TERN-601, is a potent GLP-1R agonist biased towards cAMP generation. We are conducting investigational new drug application (IND)-\nenabling activities for TERN-601 with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial in the second half of 2023 and announcing top-line data in 2024.  \nWe expect that this Phase 1 clinical program for TERN-601 will include a single ascending dose (SAD) trial in healthy volunteers and a multiple ascending \ndose (MAD) proof-of-concept trial in healthy volunteers with elevated body mass index (BMI). The MAD trial is expected to assess changes in body \nweight and glycemic control parameters, such as HbA1c, over 28 days. Each of our GLP-1 candidate structures is believed to be suitable for oral \nadministration as a single agent or in combination with other drug candidates, such as small molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide \nreceptor (GIPR) modulators. In addition to TERN-601, efforts are currently underway to nominate and develop structurally distinct second-generation \nsmall molecule GLP-1R agonists.\nCML, a form of cancer that begins in the bone marrow and leads to growth of leukemic cells, is classified as an orphan indication. CML accounts \nfor approximately 15% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemia in adults. In the United States, the prevalence of CML is approximately 90,000 and is \nexpected to reach 180,000 cases by 2030. In 2023, approximately 9,000 new cases of CML are expected to be diagnosed in the United States, with an \nexpected mortality rate of 1,300 patients. The SOC for CML includes active-site TKIs including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib. \nHowever, an unmet medical need remains due to (1) an increasing number of patients becoming refractory or intolerant to the current SOC, (2) BCR-ABL \nmutations that are difficult for active-site TKIs to treat (such as T315I), or (3) safety warnings for active-site TKIs used in CML patients who are resistant \nor intolerant to prior TKI therapy. Consensus analyst estimates of 2023 sales across active-site TKIs for CML totaled approximately $5 billion. \nNASH is a severe form of NAFLD that affects up to 20 million people in the United States, and up to 5% of the global population, and for which \nthere is currently no approved therapy in the United States or Europe. In a study published in Hepatology in 2018, lifetime costs of treating and managing \nNASH patients in the United States in 2017 were estimated to be over $220 billion, in the absence of approved therapies. NASH is a multifaceted disease \nthat involves three distinct pathogenic hepatic disease processes: accumulation of excess fat in the liver (steatosis), inflammation and fibrosis. In addition to \nthese three disease processes, NASH patients often exhibit elevated levels of glucose and atherogenic lipids, are overweight or obese and accumulate \nexcessive lipotoxic fat. Severe progression of NASH can lead to cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease and increased risk for hepatic carcinoma and liver-\nrelated mortality. \n6"

      "text": "Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 or greater (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and represents a leading cause\nof cardiometabolic diseases and mortality. Declared a global epidemic by the World Health Organization over 20 years ago, obesity has continued to rise \nsignificantly around the world. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, a third of U.S. adults 20 years of age and older are obese. Obesity has \nbeen shown to increase the risks of many diseases and conditions, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, \ngallbladder disease, arthritis, sleep apnea and some cancers (endometrial, breast, and colon). According to a recent study, obesity was associated with an \nestimated $260 billion in annual healthcare expenditures in the United States. GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have been shown to address insulin \nresistance, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, represent an emerging class of therapies used to achieve weight loss. Consensus analyst estimates forecast \nworldwide sales of GLP-1 therapeutics and its combinations to exceed $16 billion in 2021 and grow to over $30 billion by 2026.\n \nOur Pipeline Programs \nOur programs are based on mechanisms of action common to other therapies or drug candidates that have achieved proof-of-concept in clinical trials \nin indications with significant unmet medical needs and where we believe there is an opportunity for us to use rational drug design to meaningfully improve \nthe efficacy, safety and tolerability of these therapies or drug candidates.

Allosteric TKIs, which bind to the myristoyl-binding pocket, represent a new treatment class for CML and have the potential to \naddress the shortcomings of active-site TKIs, including off-target activity and limited efficacy against active site resistance mutations. \nAsciminib is the only allosteric TKI that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for use in third-line CML \npatients and is being evaluated in clinical trials for earlier lines of treatment. In a Phase 3 trial, asciminib was shown to be more than twice as \neffective as bosutinib, an active-site TKI, in achieving a major molecular response (MMR) in third-line CML patients after 96 weeks of \ntreatment (37.6% asciminib v. 15.8% bosutinib; p=0.001). The discontinuation rate after 96 weeks due to the lack of efficacy or adverse \nevents in patients on asciminib was nearly half of the rate of patients on bosutinib (31.2% asciminib v. 60.5% bosutinib). Similar to \nasciminib, TERN-701 aims to address the limitations of active-site TKIs with the goal of achieving improved tumor suppression through a \ncombination of (1) potent activity against BCR-ABL including a broad range of mutations, and (2) improved safety and tolerability profiles. \nSurvival rates and treatment durations for people living with CML continue to increase.

      "text": "Pipeline Candidates for Liver and Metabolic Diseases:    \n•\nTERN-501 is a THR-β agonist with high metabolic stability, enhanced liver distribution and greater selectivity for THR-β compared to other \nTHR-β agonists in development. Agonism of THR-β increases fatty acid metabolism via mitochondrial oxidation and affects cholesterol \nsynthesis and metabolism. As a result, THR-β stimulation has the potential to reduce hepatic steatosis, improve fibrosis and improve serum \nlipid parameters including LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. TERN-501 has high liver distribution and is 23-fold more selective for THR-β \nthan for THR-α activation, thereby minimizing the risk of cardiotoxicity and other off-target effects associated with non-selective THR \nstimulation. Finally, TERN-501 has been designed to be metabolically stable and is therefore expected to have little pharmacokinetic \nvariability and a low clinical dose, making it an attractive candidate for use in fixed-dose combinations for NASH treatment. In November \n2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers with mildly elevated LDL \ncholesterol. In the SAD and MAD cohorts, TERN-501 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of AEs across all TERN-501 \ntreatment groups and placebo. All AEs were mild to moderate with no apparent dose relationship, with no treatment-emergent serious AEs \nand no discontinuations of study or study drug due to any AE. Notably, there were no cardiac safety signals, no incidence of diarrhea and no \ndifferences between TERN-501 dose groups and placebo in change from baseline in heart rate, blood pressure or other vital signs. Based on\nthis, we believe that TERN-501 has the potential to have a differentiated safety and tolerability profile compared to other THR-β agonists that \nhave observed gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety findings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. Significant increases in SHBG, a key \npharmacodynamic marker of THR-β engagement linked to NASH histologic efficacy, were observed following treatment with TERN-501. \nThe SHBG increases observed with 14 days of TERN-501 treatment were significant, dose dependent and have been associated with robust \nreductions in MRI-PDFF and NAFLD Activity Score in a precedent late-stage clinical NASH trial. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results \nsupport the co-administration of TERN-501 and TERN-101 in NASH patients, with no apparent need for dose adjustment. The Phase 2a \nDUET trial, evaluating TERN-501 as a monotherapy and in combination with TERN-101, completed enrollment in February 2023 with top-\nline data expected in the third quarter of 2023. The primary endpoint is the relative change from baseline in liver fat content as measured by \nMRI-PDFF at Week 12 for TERN-501 monotherapy compared with placebo. Secondary endpoints include assessment of safety and \ntolerability, pharmacokinetics, changes in MRI-PDFF and MRI corrected T1 (cT1). DUET is the first trial assessing a THR-β agonist as \nmonotherapy and in combination with an FXR agonist in people with NASH. We are also engaging in activities to enable the initiation of a \nPhase 2b/3 program, such as drug supply manufacturing and chronic toxicology studies, and plan to initiate our Phase 2b/3 program in 2024.\n•\nTERN-601 is our small-molecule Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor, or GLP-1R, agonist program that is intended to be orally administered \nfor obesity, NASH and other metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. Obesity is a chronic disease that is increasing in prevalence in \nadults, adolescents and children and is often defined by having an elevated BMI of 30 or greater. Mechanisms that contribute to increased \nweight include sedentary lifestyles, increased calorie intake and medications such as insulins and antipsychotics. Insulin resistance, a \nhallmark of metabolic syndrome, also plays a key role in obesity. GLP-1 offers multiple benefits including increased insulin secretion to the \npancreas, reduced glucagon secretion in the liver, slowed gastric emptying into the gut, increased sense of satiety in the brain and reduced \ninflammation. Synthetic GLP-1 peptides have been approved for obesity and diabetes, which are conditions often accompanying NASH. \nHowever, approved synthetic GLP-1 peptides may require higher doses and frequent subcutaneous injections. This injectable route of \nadministration is likely to limit their use, particularly if efficacious oral treatments become available. Our lead GLP-1R agonist, TERN-601 \nwas designed through internal structure-based drug discovery efforts employing our proprietary three-dimensional QSAR model of the \nreceptor, which was used to identify new GLP-1 receptor agonist candidates. The ligands were further optimized based on in vitro activity, \nmetabolic stability, and pharmacokinetic parameters. Through this process, we discovered TERN-601, which is a potent GLP-1R agonist \nbiased towards cAMP generation, and nominated it for development in the fourth quarter of 2021. IND-enabling activities for TERN-601 \nremain on track with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial for obesity in the second half of 2023 with top-line data expected in \n2024. An abstract evaluating food-intake suppression in TERN-601 treated transgenic mice has been accepted for poster presentation at a \nmajor diabetes-focused scientific conference in 2023.\n9"

      "text": "•\nTERN-101 is a liver-distributed, non-bile acid Farnesoid X Receptor, or FXR, agonist that has demonstrated a differentiated tolerability \nprofile and improved target engagement due to its sustained FXR activation in the liver but only transient FXR activation in the intestine. \nFXR is a nuclear receptor primarily expressed in the liver, intestine and kidneys. FXR regulates hepatic expression of various genes involved \nin lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical trials of other FXR agonists have demonstrated significant histological NASH \nimprovements but have also resulted in pruritus and adverse lipid changes. These safety and tolerability issues have been observed in clinical \ntrials for other FXR agonists and have generally been regarded as dose-limiting toxicities, which are suboptimal for patients and can lead to \ntreatment discontinuation. In June 2021, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2a LIFT Study of TERN-101 in NASH patients. \nIn the LIFT Study, TERN-101 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of AEs across treatment groups. There were no \ntreatment-related serious adverse events, and no patient discontinued TERN-101 due to any adverse event, including pruritus. We believe \nTERN-101 is the first FXR agonist product candidate to show significant improvements in cT1, an imaging marker of liver inflammation and \nfibrosis linked to clinical outcomes, in a 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trial. In light of the positive results, our ongoing Phase 2a DUET \ntrial includes combination arms of TERN-501 and TERN-101. We are not currently focused on the development of TERN-101 as a \nmonotherapy. We received Fast Track designation from the FDA for TERN-101 for the treatment of NASH in October 2019. Fast Track\ndesignation does not guarantee an accelerated review by the FDA.\n \nDiscovery Program\nDiscovery efforts are ongoing for the TERN-800 series of small molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) modulators \nfor obesity. In combination with GLP-1R agonists, GIPR modulators, both agonists and antagonists, have demonstrated significant weight loss in recent \nclinical studies. GIPR antagonism may enhance GLP-1R activity via compensatory relationships between incretin receptors. In contrast, chronic GIPR \nagonism may desensitize and down regulate GIPR activity, mimicking GIPR antagonism. Both GIPR agonist and antagonist approaches, when paired with \nGLP-1R agonism, have yielded significant levels of body weight loss (approximately 15%-20%) in late-stage trials conducted by third parties. Our \ndiscovery efforts are underway for both GIPR antagonism and agonism approaches, which we believe have the potential for combination with GLP-1 \nreceptor agonists, such as TERN-601.\n \nOur Strategy \nOur goal is to develop and commercialize a portfolio of small-molecule product candidates to address serious diseases, including oncology, non-\nalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and obesity. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include: \n•\nDevelop improved drug candidates targeting clinically-validated mechanisms of action. We are developing a portfolio of small-molecule \ndrug candidates targeting clinically-validated mechanisms of action for the treatment of serious diseases including oncology, NASH and \nobesity. The mechanisms of action targeted by the current drug candidates in our pipeline portfolio are the same mechanisms of action \ntargeted by other drug candidates that have achieved proof-of-concept in clinical trials. However, these clinical trials have also highlighted an \nopportunity for us to meaningfully improve the efficacy, safety and tolerability of therapies utilizing these mechanisms. Based on this \npremise, we are advancing multiple drug candidates we believe have the potential to deliver better clinical outcomes in a high proportion of \npatients in the target indication as either single-agent or combination therapies. \n•\nAccelerate our CML development program by leveraging our collaborative partner’s ongoing Phase 1 trial in China. We have \nlicensed development and commercial rights to TERN-701 to our collaborative partner Hansoh in the Greater China region. In May 2022, \nHansoh initiated a Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial of TERN-701 (HS-10382) in China for CML patients. The Hansoh trial is a dose-\nescalation and dose-expansion trial (NCT05367700) evaluating the tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of TERN-701 (HS-10382) in \napproximately 100 patients with CML. We are entitled to pre-clinical and clinical data generated by Hansoh. We expect the design for our \nclinical trial of TERN-701 will be informed by data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial being conducted in China. We plan to continue to leverage \nadditional clinical developments from Hansoh’s program to inform and accelerate our TERN-701 program in territories outside of the Greater \nChina region.\n10"

For CML, we expect to measure major molecular response (MMR)\nthrough blood tests (such as polymerase chain reaction blood test) to measure clinical effect. Within NASH, we are looking to pioneer the use \nof non-invasive technologies (NIT) as potential novel surrogate endpoints, and are pursuing multiple avenues to achieve this outcome in \ncollaboration with the broader NASH community. Key markers we intend to utilize include MRI-PDFF and corrected T1 (cT1) for NASH.\nFor obesity treatment, we intend to measure body weight change.

The prevalence of CML is \napproximately 90,000 and is expected to reach 180,000 cases in the United States by 2030. In 2023, approximately 9,000 new cases of CML are expected \nto be diagnosed in the United States, with an expected mortality rate of 1,300 patients.\nCML is a form of cancer that begins in the bone marrow and leads to growth of leukemic cells. Bone marrow is a sponge-like tissue within most\nbones and is responsible for producing red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Leukemia occurs when cancerous blood cells form and overcrowd \nhealthy blood cells within the bone marrow. Leukemias may be defined as acute or chronic, which characterizes how rapidly the disease progresses without \ntreatment. Chronic leukemias progress slowly whereas acute forms tend to progress rapidly. CML develops slowly and involves the myeloid white blood \ncells of the bone marrow. Over time, the bone marrow produces too many white blood cells, causing excess cells to accumulate in the blood and/or bone \nmarrow. This type of leukemia is a fatal cancer and is caused by an error during the natural cell division process. One type of error is known as \ntranslocation, which takes place when one segment of a chromosome separates and attaches to another chromosome. The result of this translocation is \nknown as a fusion gene, an abnormal gene formed when two different genes become fused together. CML is caused by the spontaneous chromosomal \ntranslocation of chromosomes 9 and 22. The breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22 fuses with the proto-oncogene ABL1 kinase on \nchromosome 9, creating the BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene. The result is chromosome 9 being longer than normal and chromosome 22 being shorter than \nnormal. The abnormal chromosome 22 is known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. \nIn the chronic phase, leukemic cell proliferation is highly dependent on constitutively active BCR-ABL kinase activity that drives unregulated \ndivision of leukemic cells. CML cells crowd out the bone marrow’s heathy red blood, white blood and platelet cells and can cause weakness, fatigue, \nshortness of breath, fever, bone pain and weight loss, amongst other symptoms. Left untreated, CML can progress to become a potentially fatal disease. \nCML accounts for approximately 15% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemia in adults. The average age of diagnosis is approximately 64 years old, with \napproximately 50% of CML patients diagnosed at greater than 65 years old. CML is rarely seen in children.\n \n11"

      "text": "Treatment of CML\nCML treatment was transformed by the development and approval of active-site tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The first approved TKI for CML, \nimatinib, was approved in 2001. Approvals of additional active-site TKIs include dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib in 2006, 2007 and 2012, respectively. \nEach of these active-site TKIs are approved for newly diagnosed or refractory / intolerant patient populations. Ponatinib, which is approved for use in adult \npatients with the T315I mutation, also gained approval in 2012. Usage of these active-site TKIs have transformed CML from a fatal disease to a chronic \ncondition, where patients may live for decades following diagnosis. \nA novel class of TKIs, known as allosteric TKIs, target the myristoyl-binding pocket, locking BCR-ABL1 into the inactive state. Allosteric TKIs are \nhighly selective to the ABL1 myristoyl-binding pocket, and virtually inactive against other cellular kinases, avoiding the off-target effects of the active-site \nTKIs. Furthermore, mutations in the active-site pocket (such as T315I) may occur frequently, which may ultimately render active-site TKIs ineffective \nagainst CML. Allosteric TKIs are largely unaffected by many active-site resistance mutations. The first approved allosteric TKI, asciminib, was approved \nin 2021 and has demonstrated significantly improved clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability compared to an active-site TKI over 96 weeks. TERN-701 \nrepresents the potential second allosteric BCR-ABL poised for U.S. development for CML.\n \nTERN-701 – an allosteric BCR-ABL TKI for CML\n  \nDrug Candidate Summary\nTERN-701 is an internally discovered, small molecule, allosteric BCR-ABL TKI being developed for the treatment of CML. TERN-701 aims to \naddress the limitations of active-site TKIs with the goal of achieving improved tumor suppression through a combination of (1) potent activity against \nBCR-ABL including a broad range of mutations, and (2) improved safety and tolerability profiles. TERN-701 was designed to achieve similar potency \nagainst native BCR-ABL and common mutations as asciminib. In non-clinical ABL assays, TERN-701 was observed to have a similar BCR-ABL \ninhibition profile to asciminib. TERN-701 potency against wild type BCR-ABL was greater than asciminib, and comparable to asciminib in other mutations \noccurring in pre-treated patients (such as T315I).

      "text": "In July 2020, Hansoh in-licensed TERN-701 for development in the greater China region. TERN-701 is referred to by Hansoh as HS-10382. In May \n2022, Hansoh initiated an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion, first-in-human study in chronic or accelerated phase CML patients, who \nare resistant or intolerant to prior active-site BCR-ABL TKI treatment. Hansoh is responsible for all development costs in the greater China region, \nincluding the ongoing Phase 1 trial in China. We expect our Phase 1 trial for TERN-701 to start in the second half of 2023, and intend to include sites from \nthe United States, Europe and other countries, with potential interim top-line readouts from initial cohorts in 2024.  \n  \nBCR-ABL TKIs for CML \nImatinib represents the first approved active-site TKI, and transformed CML into a disease that can be survived with chronic therapy. Imatinib is \napproved for newly diagnosed adults and children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML in chronic phase and patients in chronic, accelerated \nor blast phase with Ph+ CML, after failure of interferon-alfa therapy. However, approximately half of patients treated with imatinib develop resistance or \nintolerance and may be progress onto alternative active-site TKIs. Dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib are approved for newly diagnosed adults with Ph+ \nCML in chronic phase and adults in chronic, accelerated or blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. Ponatinib is approved for \nadult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase CML for whom no other TKI is indicated and adults with the T315I mutation. These \nactive-site TKIs offer increased potency over imatinib but worse adverse event profiles and reduced tolerability. Due to resistance or side effect intolerance, \napproximately 30% to 40% of patients treated with these agents are switched to an alternative TKI therapy. Despite the largely overlapping efficacy and \nsafety profiles of the active-site TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib), these three TKIs cumulatively generated approximately $5 billion in 2022 sales, \ndespite the availability of generic imatinib. \nAcute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is another form of cancer that originates in the bone marrow, where an excess of immature lymphocytes (white \nblood cells) are produced. Approximately 25% of adults with ALL have a subtype known as Ph+ ALL. The leukemia cells of Ph+ ALL feature a similar \ntranslocation of parts of chromosomes 9 and 22 as observed with Ph+ CML, which creates the fusion oncogene BCR-ABL. This gene produces proteins \nknown as tyrosine kinases leading to unregulated division of leukemic/lymphocytic cells. Over time, these cells can infiltrate the blood stream, raising the \nnumber of immature white blood cells that do not protect against infection, while crowding out healthy red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. \nWhile Ph+ ALL has the potential to be treated by allosteric BCR-ABL TKIs such as TERN-701, due to innovation-limiting price controls for orphan drugs \napproved for more than one indication that was introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), we do not plan to pursue regulatory approval of \nTERN-701 for Ph+ ALL in the United States, but may pursue approval in countries outside of the United States.\n  \nClinical validation of BCR-ABL TKIs\nCML treatment response is measured through periodic assessments of blood and bone marrow tests. The three types of treatment response are \nmolecular, hematologic and cytogenic response.\nMolecular response (MR) is a decrease in the number of cells in the blood with the BCR-ABL gene. A quantitative PCR test is used to measure the \nnumber of blood cells containing the BCR-ABL gene and is quantified as a percentage. The initial molecular response to therapy is a significant predictor \nof outcomes. As a result, MR is the most sensitive method of monitoring BCR-ABL transcripts and is the most relevant in determining further treatment \noptions. Early molecular response (EMR) is achieved when the BCR-ABL1 level is 10% or less at 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. In EMR, \nleukemia cells have been reduced by 90% or more. Major molecular response (MMR) is achieved when the BCR-ABL1 level has decreased to 0.1%, \nsignaling that leukemia cells have been reduced by 99.9% or more. A deep molecular response (DMR) is achieved when the BCR-ABL1 level has \ndecreased to 0.01% or less. When BCR-ABL1 levels can no longer be detected, the patient has achieved Complete Molecular Response (CMR). \n13"

      "text": "Hematologic response can be categorized as either partial or complete, depending on the results of a complete blood count (CBC) test. This \nassessment measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in the blood. A partial hematologic response is achieved when the \nnumber of each blood cell type begins to revert to normal levels. A complete hematologic response is achieved when blood cell counts return to normal and \nmay be observed within one month of treatment initiation. Cytogenic response is assessed by measuring the percentage of cells in the bone marrow \ncontaining the Philadelphia chromosome (for example, Ph+ cells). Cytogenic evaluations of bone marrow cells are conducted at three-month intervals to \nassess a patient’s response to treatment. A minor cytogenic response is achieved when the Philadelphia chromosome is present in more than 35% of bone \nmarrow cells. A major cytogenic response is achieved when 35% or fewer cells have the Philadelphia chromosome. When no cells with the Philadelphia \nchromosome are detected in the bone marrow, a complete cytogenic response (CCyR) is achieved.\nIn pre-treated third-line patients, asciminib achieved an MMR in 25% of patients by 6 months, which was superior to and approximately two-fold \ngreater bosutinib’s MMR rate of 13%, which was adequate to gain accelerated approval in the third-line setting. When asciminib’s Phase 3 study progressed \nto 96 weeks, asciminib achieved MMR in 38% of pretreated third-line patients, more than doubling bosutinib’s 16% MMR response rate, resulting in a full \napproval in the third-line setting. The discontinuation rate after 96 weeks due to the lack of efficacy or adverse events in patients on asciminib was nearly \nhalf of the rate of patients on bosutinib (31.2% asciminib v. 60.5% bosutinib). \nAllosteric BCR-ABL inhibitors may have clinical benefit as initial CML treatment in addition to third line treatment. Novartis is conducting an \nongoing Phase 3 study, ASC4FIRST (NCT04971226), of asciminib against investigator-selected TKIs in newly diagnosed (front-line) CML patients, with \ndata expected in 2024.  At the 12-month timepoint in front-line patient populations, active-site TKIs nilotinib, bosutinib and dasatinib achieved MMRs in \n44%, 47% and 52% of patients, respectively, compared to imatinib’s MMR response rate of 22%-37%.\n  \nLimitations of active-site BCR-ABL TKIs\nUnmet medical needs in CML remain due to (1) an increasing number of patients becoming refractory or intolerant to the current SOC, (2) safety \nwarnings for active-site TKIs used in CML patients who are resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy, or (3) BCR-ABL mutations that are difficult for \nactive-site TKIs to treat (e.g., T315I).\nPeople with CML can expect to live life-spans nearly as long as healthy adults, and CML treatment is life-long for a high proportion of patients. As \na result, treatment is selected and modified throughout the often decades long treatment period to address the course of individual patients’ CML disease \nover time as well as patients’ individual needs as they age. A recent publication estimated that approximately 30% to 40% of people started on any TKI \nswitch to an alternative TKI. Physicians guide treatment decisions on molecular response to treatment as well as other individual patient needs including \ndrug tolerability, co-morbidity and drug-drug interaction profiles, which may evolve over time. For example, nilotinib-treated patients may be switched to \nimatinib and bosutinib which are preferred treatment options for patients experiencing cardiovascular or peripheral artery comorbidities, while nilotinib is \nless preferred. In contrast, nilotinib and dasatinib may be selected as replacement therapies for patients experiencing gastrointestinal or renal comorbidities \nin whom imatinib and bosutinib are less recommended. Survival rates and treatment durations for people living with CML continue to increase. As a result, \nphysicians are seeking additional novel therapies that are safe, efficacious and well tolerated to address their patients’ changing needs over time. \nIn later lines of CML treatment, patients may experience greater challenges with intolerance. For patients who have failed two or more TKIs, up to \n55% were intolerant to a previous TKI. Even low-grade, chronic TKI intolerance can impact a patient’s compliance with therapy, which in turn can lead to \npoorer outcomes. In a survey of people with CML, nearly half of responders skipped doses of their medication. In a study of 87 patients with chronic phase \nCML, 94% of patients who were more than 90% compliant with their treatment regimen achieved MMR, whereas just 14% of patients who were less than \n90% compliant achieved MMR.\nDuring treatment with agents that inhibit BCR-ABL kinase activity, leukemic cells may also develop resistance mutations, which can block the \nbinding of active-site TKIs and render them ineffective. Approximately 15% to 20% of patients develop BCR-ABL mutations or molecular abnormalities. \nT315I represents one variation of active-site mutation that renders most active-site TKIs ineffective. Ponatinib is the only active-site TKI approved for the \ntreatment of patients with the T315I mutation but carries black box warning for cardiovascular and other toxicity. Potential resistance in second- and third-\nline treatment can result in poorer efficacy outcomes and increased risk of discontinuation. \n14"

      "text": "Mutations within the BCR-ABL kinase domain may also affect the ability of the majority of active-site TKIs to bind and inhibit BCR-ABL. Recent \nstudies suggest that inhibiting BCR-ABL with an allosteric TKI may induce a conformational change in BCR-ABL that increases the binding affinity of \nactive-site TKIs, such as ponatinib. As a result, co-administering allosteric and active-site TKIs may lead to a synergistic effect of stabilizing the inactive \nconformation of BCR-ABL.\nAllosteric TKIs, which bind to the myristoyl-binding pocket, represent a new treatment class for CML and have the potential to address the \nshortcomings of active-site TKIs, including off-target activity and limited efficacy against active site resistance mutations. Asciminib, the first approved \nallosteric TKI, is also indicated for the treatment of CML in patients with the T315I mutation although at five times higher than the daily total dose used to \ntreat patients without T315I.  High dose asciminib is associated with safety and tolerability issues that may lead to lower adherence in CML patients with \nT315I.\n  \nOur solution for allosteric BCR-ABL TKIs\nTERN-701 aims to address the limitations of active-site TKIs with the goal of achieving improved tumor suppression through a combination of (1) \npotent activity against BCR-ABL including a broad range of mutations, and (2) improved safety and tolerability profiles. TERN-701 was designed with a \ntarget product profile to perform at least as well as asciminib. In non-clinical assays, TERN-701 demonstrated a similar profile to asciminib and is highly \npotent against wild type BCR-ABL and the most-common mutations occurring in patients treated with active-site TKIs. Based on results from preclinical \npharmacokinetic and CYP inhibition studies we conducted, we believe that TERN-701 could also have simplified dosing and fewer drug-drug interactions \ncompared to asciminib. We believe TERN-701 represents a potentially compelling treatment option as the second allosteric TKI under development in the \nUnited States. \nIn addition to use as a monotherapy, allosteric BCR-ABL TKIs such as TERN-701 may be combined with active-site TKIs to treat CML. In vitro \nnon-clinical studies have shown the potential for synergistic effects when allosteric TKIs are used in combination with active-site TKIs. When an active-site\nTKI, such as ponatinib and potentially other active site TKIs, are given in combination with an allosteric TKI, the dual TKI binding approach appears to \nhelp stabilize the BCR-ABL fusion oncoprotein in its inactive conformation, leading to potentially improved efficacy. \n  \n15"

When hepatic \nsteatosis results in liver inflammation and, in many cases, fibrosis, it results in NASH, a multifaceted disease that involves three distinct pathogenic hepatic \ndisease processes: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. In addition to these three disease processes, many NASH patients exhibit broader concomitant \nmetabolic issues such as insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity and excess lipotoxic fat. Severe progression of NASH leads to cirrhosis and \ndecompensated liver disease, with the associated risks for hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death. NASH was recently identified as the second \nleading etiologic indication for liver transplantation in the United States, and it is projected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the \ncoming years. \n16"

      "text": "NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, affecting 80 to 100 million individuals. Among persons with \nNAFLD, approximately 20% will progress to NASH, which is currently estimated to affect 20 million adults in the United States. Progression of liver \nfibrosis ultimately leads to cirrhosis in an estimated 20% of patients with NASH. With an aging population and the markedly increasing rates of obesity, \ndiabetes and dyslipidemia/metabolic syndrome worldwide, NAFLD and NASH have increased greatly in prevalence, posing a significant healthcare \nchallenge. Currently, no drug has been approved for the treatment of NASH in the United States or Europe. In a study published in Hepatology in 2018, \nlifetime costs of treating and managing NASH patients in the United States in 2017 were estimated to be over $220 billion, in the absence of approved \ntherapies. \n \nEtiology of NASH \nNAFLD and NASH are classified as progressive metabolic diseases, often correlated with chronic excess caloric intake, obesity and metabolic \nsyndrome. Physiologically, hepatocytes in the liver can act as a repository for excess energy stored by the body. As humans consume disproportionate \namounts of calories relative to those burned on a consistent basis, the body becomes overweight, and organs, including the liver, become burdened by fatty \ntissue. With the liver acting as the hub for excess energy and energy conversion, an imbalance develops with more delivery of fats and triglycerides to the \nliver, an increase in hepatic fatty acid synthesis and impaired hepatic fatty acid oxidation and removal of liver fat, resulting in NAFLD. \nInflammatory cascades in the liver activate hepatic stellate cells to excrete extracellular matrix resulting in liver fibrosis. Over time, fibrosis \nprogresses, increasingly replacing diseased and normal liver tissue with scar tissue. Eventually, most of the liver is replaced by fibrotic tissue, which \nhistologically is categorized as cirrhosis. While some cirrhotic patients have enough functional liver tissue to maintain hepatic activity, over time, the liver\nfails, resulting in decompensated liver disease and the need for liver transplantation to avoid liver related death. Furthermore, cirrhosis is a key risk factor \nfor hepatocellular carcinoma. \nNASH is currently diagnosed by histological findings on liver biopsy. In clinical trials, recommended scoring systems assess (i) liver fibrosis and (ii) \nsteatosis and inflammation using the NAFLD Activity Score, or NAS, a composite score that grades the degree of three non-fibrotic histologic features of \nNASH: steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning and lobular inflammation. Efficacious responses to treatment in NASH clinical trials are usually considered to be \neither an improvement in fibrosis score without worsening of the NAS, or an improvement of the NAS without worsening of fibrosis. \nWhile the definitive diagnosis of NASH remains linked to histology, non-invasive blood and imaging tests are increasingly being used in clinical \npractice to diagnose NASH, assess the likelihood of significant fibrosis, predict risk of disease progression and assess response to treatment. MRI-derived \nbiomarkers proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and iron-corrected T1 mapping (cT1) are gaining traction as emerging alternatives to biopsy for NASH. cT1 \nmeasures free-water content in liver tissue, which has shown a strong correlation with inflammation and fibrosis histology. An estimated difference of 88 \nmilliseconds in cT1 relaxation time has been related to a two-point difference in overall NAS. While MRI-PDFF and cT1 both correlate with NAS, only \ncT1 correlates with fibrosis. Further, liver cT1 has been shown to predict clinical outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease. Liver disease patients with \nan elevated cT1 relaxation time of 990 milliseconds or greater have been shown to have a high probability of developing a serious clinical event in the next \nfive years, whereas those with liver cT1 relaxation times of less than 840 milliseconds have been shown to be unlikely to develop such outcomes. As data \nfrom these non-invasive assessments continue to accumulate—for initial diagnosis of NASH, monitoring of disease progression over time, and monitoring \nresponse to treatment—these approaches may replace liver biopsy, both in clinical practice and clinical trials. In its December 2018 draft NASH guidance, \nthe FDA encouraged sponsors to include non-invasive biomarkers in clinical studies of experimental NASH treatments in order to accelerate development \nand supplant liver biopsy. At The Liver Meeting in November 2021, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) issued practice \nguidelines recommending blood and imaging-based non-invasive assessments to determine fibrosis staging prior to considering a liver biopsy. To accelerate \nthe usage of NITs as surrogate endpoints for NASH, we joined the steering committee of the NAIL-NIT Consortium, a multi-stakeholder effort to link non-\ninvasive testing directly to outcomes. NAIL-NIT’s preliminary planned activities include a prospective six-year study of NASH patients and, separately, a \nretrospective analysis of NASH patient cases to establish the best utilization of the growing array of non-invasive testing methods in the treatment, \ndiagnosis and monitoring of NASH patients. \n17"

      "text": "Treatment of NASH \nThere currently are no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of NASH, and available treatment options are limited to control of metabolic \ndysfunction, including weight loss, as well as lifestyle modifications such as exercise and dietary changes. However, many patients are unable to achieve or\nmaintain significant weight loss or comply long-term with the dietary and lifestyle changes required to reverse NASH. In order to optimally treat NASH \nand reduce the risk of liver cancer and liver-related mortality, the three distinct disease processes may each need to be addressed–steatosis, inflammation \nand fibrosis. In addition to these three disease processes, we believe an ideal NASH therapy will also aim to improve the overall metabolic profile of NASH \npatients such as improvements in glycemic control, atherogenic lipid improvement, weight loss and/or reduction of lipotoxic fat. Single agents focusing on \nspecific mechanisms contributing to one of these three processes, each involving multiple pathways, have demonstrated only modest results to date. As \nsuch, combination therapies, such as our THR-b agonist in combination with our FXR agonist, have the potential to better address the multitude of desired \nproperties for the treatment of NASH.\n  \nOur Clinical Stage Programs in NASH\nWe are developing a portfolio of small-molecules that address the multiple hepatic disease processes of NASH in order to drive meaningful clinical \nbenefits. Our most advanced clinical stage program is TERN-501, a THR-β agonist with high metabolic stability, enhanced liver distribution and greater \nselectivity for THR-β compared to other THR-β agonists in development. In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical \ntrial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers with mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol. We also have TERN-101, a liver-distributed, \nnon-bile acid FXR agonist that has demonstrated sustained liver FXR activation, as well as a favorable tolerability profile across multiple clinical trials. We \nannounced positive top-line data from our Phase 2a LIFT clinical trial of TERN-101 in NASH in June 2021. Our Phase 2a DUET trial, evaluating TERN-\n501 as a monotherapy and in combination with TERN-101, completed enrollment in February 2023, with top-line data expected in the third quarter of \n2023. We believe developing combination therapies that target multiple mechanistic pathways and improve the overall metabolic profile of NASH patients \nwill drive improved outcomes for NASH patients while mitigating potential tolerability concerns associated with other drugs in development. \n \nTERN-501 – a selective THR-β agonist with enhanced metabolic stability and liver distribution \n \nDrug candidate summary \nTERN-501 is a selective THR-β agonist with enhanced metabolic stability and liver distribution, characteristics that are intended to improve safety \nand efficacy in NASH patients. THR-β is the major form of thyroid hormone receptor in the liver and regulates key aspects of energy metabolism, \nincluding fatty acid and lipid synthesis and removal of liver fat through induction of fatty acid oxidation. THR-β stimulation has been identified as a target \nfor NASH on the basis of its potential to reduce hepatic steatosis, improve fibrosis and improve serum lipid parameters in NASH patients. For any THR \nagonist, a key concern is toxicity from excess systemic THR-α stimulation. TERN-501 is 23-fold more selective for THR-β than for THR-α activation, \nthereby minimizing the risk of cardiotoxicity through THR-α stimulation. TERN-501 has high metabolic stability and a low projected clinical dose, which \nwe believe makes it an attractive candidate for fixed-dose combination co-formulations. In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a \nPhase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers. We received Fast Track designation from the FDA for TERN-501 for the treatment of NASH in \nJune 2021. Fast Track designation does not guarantee an accelerated review by the FDA.\n \nTHR-β agonists for NASH \nThyroid hormone plays a central role in regulating metabolism, through its actions in multiple tissues, including fat, skeletal muscle, pancreas and \nliver. THR-α and THR-β are nuclear receptors widely expressed in the body, but the two different isoforms are differentially expressed in different tissue \ntypes. THR-β is the major form of thyroid hormone receptor in the liver and regulates key aspects of energy metabolism, including fatty acid and lipid \nsynthesis and removal of liver fat through induction of fatty acid oxidation. THR-α is the major form of thyroid hormone receptor in cardiac muscle,\nskeletal muscle and bone. Selective agonism of THR-β in the liver has been identified as a target for NASH and validated in clinical trials on the basis of its \npotential to improve hepatic steatosis, liver fibrosis and lipid profiles in NASH patients. \n \n18"

      "text": "Clinical validation of THR-β agonism \nData from other NASH clinical studies validate the potential of THR-β agonism as a NASH treatment (the data from other NASH clinical studies \ndescribed in this paragraph are from Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials of resmetirom (MGL-3196). In December 2022, Madrigal \nannounced positive Phase 3 top-line results, in which resmetirom achieved significant improvements on two histological endpoints that are currently \nbelieved to be reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit: (1) NASH resolution with a two-point or greater NAS reduction with no worsening of fibrosis \nand (2) fibrosis improvement by at least one stage with no worsening of NAS. In a Phase 2 clinical trial, resmetirom showed significant reductions in liver \nfat measured by MRI-PDFF, as well as reduction in lipid levels in serum, which may offer additional benefits to NASH patients who are at high risk of \ncardiovascular comorbidities. In this same clinical trial, resmetirom showed increases in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), a key pharmacodynamic \nmarker of THR-β engagement, which is correlated with significant reductions in MRI-PDFF and NAS reduction. These types of histological responses may \nbe suitable for accelerated approval under current draft guidance from the FDA titled “Noncirrhotic Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis With Liver Fibrosis: \nDeveloping Drugs for Treatment Guidance for Industry.” \n \nTHR-β regulates key aspects of energy metabolism (e.g., fatty acid & lipid synthesis, liver fat removal through fatty acid oxidation)\n  \n \n \nLimitations of THR-β targeting \nFor THR agonists, a key safety concern is the potential for adverse effects from off-target thyroid hormone receptor stimulation that may stem from \neither lack of selectivity for THR-β or high variations in pharmacokinetics due to the lack of metabolic stability. Selectivity for THR-β over THR-α is key \nto modulating the metabolic activities in the liver without triggering the unwanted effects of THR-α activation outside of the liver. Stimulation of THR-α \ncan adversely affect the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system through increases in heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias, muscle wasting and reduced bone \nmineral density. Therefore, the identification of a selective THR-β agonist particularly with enhanced liver distribution, would have the potential to improve \nhepatic steatosis, improve fibrosis and serum lipid profiles while potentially avoiding adverse effects of THR-α activation. However, the use of a liver-\ntargeted pro-drug approach to overcome THR selectivity has not completely avoided cardiac adverse events in clinical trials. \nIn addition to THR-β selectivity, metabolic stability and predictable pharmacokinetics are important considerations in the development of thyroid \nhormone activators. In a Phase 2 clinical trial of another selective THR-β agonist, lack of metabolic stability resulted in significant inter-patient variability \nin drug exposure that required PK monitoring and dose adjustments. Dose adjustments in widespread clinical practice present potential challenges in terms \nof patient compliance, safety monitoring and additional burden on the healthcare system. Additionally, highly variable pharmacokinetics and unpredictable \ndrug concentrations would hinder the potential for combination treatment in NASH patients. \n19"

CYP metabolism is the origin of \nmany drug-drug interactions either due to inhibition, induction or competition for enzymatic paths which are commonly used by different drugs, potentially \nleading to unpredictable drug effects. Other THR-β agonists in late-stage development are known to be metabolized by CYP P450. \nIn prior trials of THR-β agonists, cardiovascular, central thyroid and/or gastrointestinal adverse events have been observed over 12-weeks or less of \ntreatment. Gastrointestinal adverse events included diarrhea (33%) and nausea (14%) in the active arms of the Phase 2 study of resmetirom. In another \nPhase 2 study of VK2809, cardiovascular events included ventricular run, chest pressure, palpitations and supraventricular tachycardia, amongst others. In a \nPhase 1 multiple ascending dose study of ALG-055009, mean values of Total/Free T4 and Total T3 were outside the normal range for the 1mg dose.

      "text": "Non-clinical tissue distribution studies show that TERN-501 demonstrates enhanced liver distribution relative to plasma and other organs. From \nnon-clinical studies, TERN-501 is projected to have a predictable human PK profile due to its improved metabolic stability. Due to its metabolic stability, \nwe believe that TERN-501 is unlikely to require PK monitoring and individualized clinical dose adjustment in NASH patients, as was done in a certain \nclinical trial of another THR-β agonist in development that lacks metabolic stability and has variable PK in humans. As a result, TERN-501 may not have \nthe potential challenges associated with monitoring and dose adjustment in clinical practice, including patient compliance, safety monitoring and additional \nburden on the healthcare system. Further, TERN-501 is projected to have a low clinically efficacious dose range which, along with its metabolic stability \nand lack of metabolism by CYP, makes it attractive for long-term NASH treatment and for co-formulation as part of a fixed-dose combination. \n \nClinical development of TERN-501 \nIn November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers with mildly elevated LDL \ncholesterol.\nThe Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 included SAD, MAD and drug-drug interaction, or DDI, cohorts evaluating the safety, tolerability, \npharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TERN-501. Healthy volunteers with mildly elevated LDL cholesterol were randomized to placebo \n(n=2) or TERN-501 (n=6) in each cohort. Volunteers randomized to TERN-501 received single doses of 3, 10, 30 or 60 mg of TERN-501 in the SAD \nportion of the study or multiple doses of 1, 3, 6 or 10 mg of TERN-501 once daily for 14 days in the MAD portion of the study. In the DDI portion of the \nstudy, volunteers received open label TERN-501 co-administered with TERN-101, our liver-distributed FXR agonist also in development for the treatment \nof NASH.\nIn the SAD and MAD cohorts, single and multiple doses of TERN-501 were generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of AEs across all \nTERN-501 treatment groups and placebo. All AEs were mild to moderate with no apparent dose relationship, with no treatment-emergent serious AEs and \nno discontinuations of study or study drug due to any AE. There were no cardiac safety signals, no incidence of diarrhea and no differences between \nTERN-501 groups and placebo in change from baseline in heart rate, blood pressure or other vital signs. Thyroid function test results were consistent with \nTHR-β agonists currently in clinical development, and there were no findings of clinical hyper- or hypo-thyroidism. There were no differences between \nplacebo and any TERN-501 dose group in liver function abnormalities or mean change from baseline in liver transaminases at Day 15 in the MAD cohorts. \nTERN-501 demonstrated a predictable pharmacokinetic profile with low variability: study drug plasma exposures were linear and approximately \ndose-proportional with no overlap between dose strengths. There was no significant accumulation of drug over 14 days of dosing. TERN-501 plasma half-\nlife was greater than 13 hours in all single and repeat dose cohorts, supporting once-daily dosing. The overall PK profile indicates TERN-501 is well-suited \nfor co-formulation with other small-molecule NASH agents as an oral, once-daily fixed dose combination.\nSignificant effects on sex hormone binding globulin, or SHBG, a key PD marker of THR-β engagement linked to NASH histologic efficacy, were \nobserved following treatment with TERN-501. As further described in the table below, SHBG increases observed with 14 days of TERN-501 treatment \nwere significant, dose dependent and have been associated with robust reductions in MRI-PDFF and NAFLD Activity Score in a precedent late-stage \nclinical NASH trial of another THR-β agonist.\nIn addition, significant reductions were observed in atherogenic lipids including LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, or Apo-B, comparable to or \ngreater than those observed in Phase 1 studies of other THR-β agonists being studied in late-stage clinical trials. All TERN-501 dose groups demonstrated \nsignificant decreases in LDL cholesterol compared to placebo during the dosing period. The maximum mean LDL cholesterol decreases over the treatment \nperiod were -13%, -22%, -28% and -27% for 1, 3, 6 and 10 mg doses, respectively, compared to placebo (-8%).\n21"

FXR is a nuclear receptor primarily \nexpressed in the liver, intestine and kidneys. FXR regulates hepatic expression of various genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. \nClinical studies of other FXR agonists have demonstrated significant histological NASH improvements but have also resulted in pruritus and adverse lipid \nchanges. These tolerability issues have generally been observed in Phase 1 clinical trials as well as later phase studies of other FXR agonists in \ndevelopment and have been regarded as dose-limiting toxicities, which are suboptimal for patients and can lead to treatment discontinuation. \nIn June 2021, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2a LIFT Study of TERN-101 in NASH patients. In the LIFT Study, TERN-101 \nwas generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of adverse events, or AEs, across treatment groups.

We believe developing combination therapies that target multiple mechanistic pathways and \nimprove the overall metabolic profile of NASH patients will drive improved outcomes for NASH patients while mitigating potential tolerability concerns \nand improving compliance as compared with monotherapy regimens. We are focused on developing combination therapies with clinically-validated \nmechanisms of action to address the multifaceted nature of NASH, while improving the overall metabolic profile of patients. We believe that therapies \ntargeting steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in tandem, have the potential to provide greater resolution of NASH and improvement in related clinical \noutcomes. In April 2022, an IND application was cleared to support the Phase 2a DUET clinical trial of TERN-501 in combination with TERN-101, as well \nas future studies of other combination therapy regimens in NASH. \n \nPreclinical data for combination therapies \nWe believe that a combination of TERN-501 and TERN-101 has the potential for improved therapeutic benefit for NASH patients. TERN-501 is a \nTHR-β agonist that is expected to potently and rapidly reduce hepatic steatosis and normalize plasma lipid parameters through the modulation of metabolic \npathways that are distinct from those modulated by liver FXR activation. As a liver-distributed FXR agonist, TERN-101 is expected to have effects on \nmultiple facets of NASH, including potential improvements in steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. A combination of TERN-501 and TERN-101 would \ntherefore be expected to significantly reduce steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in NASH patients through their complementary effects without the need to \nuse maximal dose levels of either agent. The combination may also result in a positive serum lipid profile since TERN-501 is expected to reduce LDL \ncholesterol and triglyceride levels in NASH patients where FXR agonists have generally not demonstrated potentially therapeutic decreases in plasma \ncholesterol or triglycerides. \nAs seen in the charts below, the combination of the THR-β agonist TERN-501 and the FXR agonist TERN-101 showed robust efficacy in an in vivo \nmouse model of NASH by profoundly reducing steatosis and significantly improving fibrosis, serum triglycerides, serum total cholesterol and ALT. The \ncombination treatment of TERN-501 and TERN-101 also resulted in the expression of more than 800 additional distinct genes as compared to either agent \nalone, supporting our hypothesis that additional biological processes are activated by combination treatment. Together these results suggest that the \ncombination of the THR-β agonist TERN-501 and the FXR agonist TERN-101 may provide additional benefits for NASH patients than either treatment \nalone. \n25"

We believe this approach maximizes the chance of achieving \nhigher NASH response rates compared to treatment approaches that rely exclusively on single-agent therapeutics and creates efficiencies through the \nevaluation of our individual monotherapies and combination treatments, allowing us to proceed to marketing authorization applications for those single-\nagent drug candidates and combination therapies that offer the clearest advantages to patients.\n \nBackground on Obesity\nObesity is a chronic disease that is increasing in prevalence in adults, adolescents and children and is defined as a body mass index of 30 or greater \n(calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Mechanisms that contribute to obesity include sedentary lifestyles, increased \ncalorie intake and medications such as insulins and antipsychotics. Insulin resistance, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, also plays a key role in obesity. \nObesity is major health epidemic that has been declared a disease by the American Medical Association and affects populations worldwide. The \nObesity Action Coalition (OAC) estimates that nearly 93 million Americans struggle with obesity, and it is predicted to increase to 120 million Americans \nwithin the next five years. In addition, the U.S. Center for Disease Control, or CDC, estimates that 42 percent of adults over the age of 20 years old are \nobese.\n27"

      "text": "According to the OAC, there are over 40 medical conditions associated with obesity. The most prevalent obesity-related diseases include heart \ndisease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, gallbladder disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, some forms of cancer, sleep apnea or respiratory problems and a \nvariety of other conditions. According to the Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy, the aggregate medical cost due to obesity among adults in \nthe United States was $260.0 billion in 2016. A prior study examining the future health care costs attributable to obesity projected these annual \nexpenditures to double every decade to approximately $780 billion by 2030, representing 14% of total United States health care costs. As a result, public \nand private stakeholders worldwide are taking steps to address obesity.\nDespite the rising obesity rate, increased public awareness of the obesity epidemic and significant pharmacoeconomic costs associated with obesity, \nthere remains an unmet need for safe and effective pharmacological interventions. While nearly half of Americans meet the criteria for medical obesity \npharmacotherapy, only 2% of adults receive medications for weight loss. Barriers to adequately prescribing weight loss medications may include \ninadequate prescriber training regarding use of such medications, misconceptions that excess body weight is due to lack of willpower, or that obesity is not \na disease that should be treated with medications and surgery, even when indicated. We believe that the obesity epidemic continues to be a significant cause \nof morbidity, mortality and rising health care costs in the United States and represents an underserved therapeutic category for obesity patients.\n  \nTreatment for Obesity\nTreatments for obesity include lifestyle modification (diet and exercise), pharmaceutical therapies, surgery and device implantation. Modifications to \ndiet and exercise are currently the preferred initial treatment for obesity. However, demands of sustained lifestyle modification for long periods of time \ntends to lead to attrition, often resulting in regained weight. When lifestyle modification alone has failed, pharmacotherapies are generally recommended. \nThe global pharmaceutical market for obesity was approximately $1 billion in 2020. With the recent launch of semaglutide for the treatment of \nobesity in 2021, the obesity market is expected to grow beyond $5 billion by 2025.  Longer term estimates forecast the worldwide obesity market to exceed \n$27 billion by 2031, with the anticipated launches of tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor dual agonist \nand other novel injectable compounds. Several older approved agents, including amphetamine-like compounds such as naltrexone-bupropion and \nphentermine-topiramate, are indicated for short-term administration and not expected to contribute significantly to the obesity market.\n  \nTERN-601 – a pre-clinical oral GLP-1 for obesity and NASH\n  \nDrug Candidate Summary\nTERN-601 is an oral, small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist. Internal discovery of TERN-601 was driven by \ncomputational interaction mapping, chemical synthesis and in vitro characterization of approximately 100 GLP-1R agonist compounds. In the fourth \nquarter of 2021, we nominated TERN-601 as our GLP-1R agonist development candidate for obesity and NASH. IND-enabling activities for TERN-601 \nremain ongoing, with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial in second half of 2023. \n \nGLP-1 receptor agonists for obesity and NASH \nGLP-1R agonists are intended to address metabolic processes involved in the pathogenesis of obesity, NAFLD, NASH and other metabolic \nindications. Mechanisms that contribute to increased weight include sedentary lifestyles, increased calorie intake and medications such as insulins and \nantipsychotics. Insulin resistance, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, also plays a key role in obesity. The natural endogenous ligand GLP-1 promotes \ninsulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells in a glucose-dependent-manner following food ingestion. GLP-1 has also been shown to reduce glucagon secretion \nin the liver, slow gastric emptying in the gut, create a sense of satiety in the brain, reduce inflammation and improve cardiac function. As a result, synthetic \nGLP-1 peptides have been approved for obesity and diabetes, which are conditions often accompanying NASH.\n  \n28"

      "text": "Clinical validation of GLP-1 receptor agonists\nThe recently approved once-weekly injection of semaglutide for chronic weight management demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately \n15% at 68 weeks when used with a reduced calorie meal plan and increased physical activity. Study participants also experienced improvements in blood \npressure, cholesterol and blood sugar. Semaglutide also had positive effects on LDL and total cholesterol levels, although benefits were limited primarily to \ntriglyceride reductions.\nProof-of-concept for weight loss with GLP-1 receptor agonists has been demonstrated in clinical trials as short as one month. For example, 120 mg \nof orally administered danuglipron (PF-06882961) administered twice per day (BID) achieved a placebo-adjusted mean body weight loss of 5.5 kilograms \n(5.4%) in 28 days. In a Phase 2 study, 200 mg BID of danuglipron achieved a 5.2% placebo-adjusted weight loss over 12 weeks. Other oral GLP-1 receptor \nagonists under development have demonstrated range of weight loss results at various time points: at 6 weeks, 180 mg QD of lotiglipron (PF-07081532) \ndemonstrated 3.3% placebo-adjusted weight loss in a diabetic population while at 12 weeks, 15 mg of LY-3502970 demonstrated 7.1% placebo-adjusted \nweight loss. The oral formulation of semaglutide, by contrast, achieved a 3% placebo-adjusted weight loss over 26 weeks at the 14 mg high dose.\nThe development landscape for GLP-1 compounds is varied, including single agonists, multi-agonists, an agonist-antagonist combination and can be \ngenerally grouped by route of administration. Injectable candidates under development may target GLP-1 and glucagon (ALT-801, BI 456906, cotadutide \nand efinopegdutide), GLP-1 and GIP (tirzepatide), GLP-1 agonism and GIP antagonism (AMG 133) or GLP, GIP and glucagon (LY3437943), amongst \nothers. Oral development candidates singly targeting GLP-1 and include LY3502970, danuglipron, lotiglipron (PF-07081532), GSBR-1290 and \nsemaglutide tablets, amongst others.\n \nDiscovery of and approaches to GLP-1 receptor agonists\nOur GLP-1 scaffolds are designed using structure-based drug discovery efforts employing Terns' proprietary three-dimensional quantitative structure \nactivity relationship (3D QSAR) model of the GLP-1 receptor. Using reference data from GLP-1 molecules with known EC50 (half maximal effective \nconcentration) data and active site binding properties, Terns' 3D QSAR model is able to predict new GLP-1 receptor agonist molecular activity with greater \naccuracy than traditional physics-based evaluations. Terns has screened over 20,000 molecular permutations to identify suitable small-molecule scaffolds \nwith potentially improved properties relative to other GLP-1 based approaches. These candidates were further optimized based on in vitro activity, \nmetabolic stability and pharmacokinetic parameters. \n Signaling pathways downstream of GLP-1, specifically β-arrestin signaling, have been hypothesized to result in reduced therapeutic durability and \ngastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea. As a result, the biased agonism approach is being investigated by other drug developers. However, the \nadvantages of mitigating β-arrestin signaling to enhance G-protein cAMP signaling and improve the side effect profile of a small molecule GLP-1R \nagonists remains unproven. Notably, a biased GLP-1 agonist avoiding β-arrestin signaling was efficacious in preclinical models (demonstrating glucose \nlowering and hypophagic effects in non-human primates), yet elicited vomiting, nausea, and headache in subsequent third-party clinical trials. Through our \nongoing medicinal chemistry efforts, we have synthesized multiple compounds targeting GLP-1R that exhibit varying degrees of ligand bias towards G-\nprotein cAMP and β-arrestin.\n  \nLimitations of GLP-1 receptor agonists\nApproved agents are synthetic peptides and potentially require higher doses administered by frequent subcutaneous injections for the potential \ntreatment of obesity and NASH. The injectable route of administration is likely to limit their use in obesity and NASH patients, particularly if efficacious \noral treatments become available. Although an oral GLP-1 peptide formulation is available for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, it requires high doses, is \nassociated with adverse effects and lacks NASH efficacy data. A non-peptidic small-molecule oral GLP-1 receptor agonist may offer advantages over \ncurrently available peptide GLP-1R agonists that have been studied for the treatment of obesity and NASH.\n  \n29"

Through our ongoing \nmedicinal chemistry efforts, we have synthesized multiple compounds targeting GLP-1R that exhibit varying degrees of ligand bias towards G-protein \ncAMP and β-arrestin. \nOur lead molecule, TERN-601, is a potent GLP-1R agonist biased towards cAMP generation. The target product profile for TERN-601 is a potent, \nsafe and effective small-molecule (non-peptide) with oral once-daily dosing, that may be suitable for combination or co-formulation and have applicability \nto obesity, NASH and other indications. We are conducting investigational new drug application (IND)-enabling activities for TERN-601 for obesity with \nthe goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial in the second half of 2023 and announcing top-line data in 2024.  We expect that this Phase 1 clinical \nprogram for TERN-601 will include a single ascending dose (SAD) trial in healthy volunteers and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) proof-of-concept trial \nin healthy volunteers with elevated BMI. The MAD trial is expected to assess changes in body weight and glycemic control parameters, such as HbA1c, \nover 28 days. Each of our GLP-1 candidate structures are believed to be suitable for oral administration as a single agent or in combination with other drug \ncandidates, such as small molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) modulators. \nIn addition to TERN-601, efforts are currently underway to nominate and develop structurally distinct second-generation small molecule GLP-1R \nagonists. Each of our GLP-1 candidate structures are believed to be suitable for oral administration as a single agent or in combination with other drug \ncandidates, such as small molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) modulators.\n  \nGlucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) Receptor Modulators\nAs part of our ongoing discovery efforts for the treatment of obesity, we initiated a small-molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide \nreceptor (GIPR) modulator program, designated as the TERN-800 series. GIP is secreted in response to nutrient ingestion to enhance meal-stimulated \ninsulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner by activating its cognate GIPR in pancreatic beta cells and other cells in various tissues. In preclinical \nstudies, GIPR activation appears to reduce food intake and promote weight loss when combined with its incretin partner GLP-1. The overlapping body \nweight-lowering actions of both GIP and GLP-1 suggests that combining the actions of these two peptide hormones may bolster glucose-lowering and \nappetite-suppressing effects beyond those observed with individual agents.\nIn a preclinical study, two weeks of simultaneous administration of equimolar amounts of a GLP-1R agonist and a GIPR agonist reduced food \nintake, body weight and fat mass in mice to a greater extent than either agent alone. A late-stage clinical trial of injectable dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist \ntirzepatide (Lilly) demonstrated approximately 20% mean weight loss over 72 weeks of treatment. Notably, a human monoclonal antibody against the GIP \nreceptor decreased food consumption and supported body weight loss alone and in combination with GLP-1R agonist dulaglutide in obese non-human \nprimates. \n30"

      "text": "A monomolecular combination of a GIPR antagonist/GLP-1R agonist, AMG 133 (Amgen), enhanced the observed weight loss in animal obesity \nmodels. In a Phase 1 clinical study of AMG 133, a single high dose resulted in approximately 8 kilograms of weight loss. In the MAD portion of the study, \nAMG 133 was administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks (Days 1, 29 and 57). The high-dose cohort of 420 mg demonstrated a mean body weight \nreduction that remained substantial (10%-15%) through approximately Day 150 of the study. Patients achieved a peak 14.5% mean decrease in body weight \nat Day 85 after finishing treatment on Day 57. At Day 207, without additional doses of AMG 133, body weight reduction remained approximately at 10% \nfor the high-dose cohort. These early results suggest strong durability of effect for the GIPR antagonist/GLP1-R agonist approach.\nSimilar to our discovery process for GLP-1, we have synthesized small molecule ligands targeting the GIP receptor and are currently assessing their \nactivity. We plan to combine GIPR modulators with oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as TERN-601, for the treatment of obesity and \nmetabolic diseases. We believe our small molecules have the advantage of oral bioavailability and the ability to dose adjust to achieve an optimal response. \nCombining GIPR modulators with GLP-1 represents a promising strategy under investigation for the treatment of obesity.\n \nOther Product Candidates\nAs we continue to focus resources on the most advanced product candidates in our pipeline, we intend to explore strategic and partnership options \nfor the development and commercialization of TERN-201, TERN-301, and TRN-000546.\nTERN-201 is an oral, highly-selective vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) inhibitor which has demonstrated sustained target engagement and \ncomplete, or near-complete (>98%), suppression of VAP-1 enzymatic activity in multiple clinical trials. Across approximately 100 subjects, TERN-201 was \nshown to be generally well-tolerated, without the off-target liabilities associated with other VAP-1 inhibitors in development.\nTERN-301 is a potent and selective orally bioavailable apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor shown to have slow metabolic \nturnover in preclinical species, with low clearance, good oral absorption, and a low likelihood of drug-drug interactions. ASK1 is a protein kinase that plays \na key role in mediating cell death signaling pathways. It is activated by various cellular stresses, such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and \npro-inflammatory cytokines. ASK1 inhibitors may prevent downstream signaling and protect cells from stress-induced cell death and inflammation. TERN-\n301 showed superior selectivity compared to selonsertib against a panel of 370 kinases and in the methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) model of \nNASH, TERN-301 showed improvements in NAFLD activity score and reduced expression of inflammatory related genes.\nTRN-000546 is a novel oral, liver directed, monophosphate prodrug of fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP), the potent anti-tumor metabolite of 5-\nfluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU, an antimetabolite and cell cycle-targeting chemotherapeutic drug, has been widely used to treat many cancers, including \nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TRN-000546 was designed to protect FdUMP from enzymatic deactivation in the plasma and improve its delivery into \nthe liver to increase efficacy while minimizing systemic drug exposures to reduce potential toxicity. TRN-000546 is more potent than 5-FU against a wide \nrange of tumor cell lines in cell proliferation assays in vitro and has demonstrated comparable or improved efficacy to standard-of-care treatment in \nmultiple in vivo models of liver, gastric, and colon cancers.\n \nManufacturing and supply \nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our drug candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own \nmanufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party contract manufacturers for \nmanufacturing all our drug candidates for preclinical research and clinical trials. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these third parties. \nIf any of our drug candidates are approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and \none or more back-up manufacturers for the commercial production of those drugs. Development and commercial quantities of any drugs that we develop \nwill need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions \nin which we are seeking approval. \n31"

Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended and \nthe amount of available extension to any extension-eligible patent which claims a product, a method of using a product or a method of manufacturing a \nproduct, depends on a variety of factors, including the date on which the patent issues and certain dates related to the regulatory review period. Provisions \nare available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our drugs \nreceive FDA or analogous foreign approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those drugs from the applicable authorities \nwhere patent term extension is available, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. There is no guarantee that the applicable \nauthorities, including the USPTO, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such \nextensions. \nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing \ntechnological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information \nof our business that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We take steps to protect our proprietary information, \nincluding trade secrets and unpatented know-how, by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and\ninventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. However, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly \nexecuted, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and unpatented know-\nhow, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade \nsecret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less\nwilling or unwilling to protect trade secrets. \nMoreover, third parties may still obtain this proprietary information or may come upon this or similar information independently, and we would have \nno right to prevent them from using that information to compete with us. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade \nsecrets and know how the value of this information may be greatly reduced, and our competitive position would be harmed. If we do not apply for patent \nprotection prior to such publication or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, \nthen our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized. \nThe patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our \ncommercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-\nparty patent or other intellectual property or other proprietary right would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or any of our drug \ncandidates or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary \nrights required to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications \nin the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO \nto determine priority of invention.

In November 2021, Hansoh exercised its \noption to in-license TERN-701 in accordance with the terms of the exclusive option and license agreement. We retain co-exclusive rights under certain \nknow-how licensed to Hansoh and all rights under the patent rights outside of the field of oncology and Hansoh Territory. We have entered into a \nmanufacturing and technology transfer agreement with Hansoh pursuant to which we receive technical assistance and support for the manufacturing of \nTERN-701. Pursuant to the terms of the option and license agreement, Hansoh must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a \nHansoh Product in the Hansoh Territory and Hansoh may not exploit any other product in the Hansoh Territory with the same primary mechanism of action \nas the Hansoh Products.\nAs consideration for the exclusive option, we received an upfront, refundable payment of $1 million, which became non-refundable upon Hansoh’s \nexercise of its option in November 2021. Under the license, Hansoh has agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of $67.0 million upon the achievement of pre-\nspecified clinical, regulatory and sales milestones with respect to the Hansoh Products. No such milestones have been achieved to date under this option \nand license agreement. Hansoh must also pay us royalties of a mid-single digit percentage on net sales of all Hansoh Products. The royalty rate is subject to \ncustomary reductions, including reductions based on generic competition to the Hansoh Products and royalties paid to any third party under a license to \nsuch third party’s rights necessary to commercialize a Hansoh Product. The royalty term will terminate on a Hansoh Product-by-Hansoh Product and \ncountry-by-country basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights covering such Hansoh Product in such \ncountry, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity for such Hansoh Product in such country and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such \nHansoh Product in such country.  \nIntellectual property developed out of the activities under this option and license agreement, and that is necessary or useful to exploit TERN-701 or \nHansoh Products, solely developed by one party shall be owned by that party, and jointly-developed intellectual property shall be jointly-owned. Hansoh \nwill have the first right to prosecute, maintain, defend and enforce the licensed patent rights in the Hansoh Territory.  \nThe option and license agreement shall expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the Hansoh Products in the Hansoh Territory. \nUpon expiration of the option and license agreement, the license under our know-how granted to Hansoh shall be considered fully paid-up, perpetual and \nco-exclusive. Either we or Hansoh may terminate the option and license agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement and fails \nto cure that breach within 90 days after written notice is provided, or in the event of insolvency of the other party. Hansoh may terminate the option and \nlicense agreement upon 180 days’ prior written notice. Hansoh may also terminate the option and license agreement upon 60 days’ prior written notice if \nwe undergo certain change of control events. If Hansoh terminates the option and license agreement upon such change of control events, we must negotiate \nwith Hansoh the terms of an assignment of our entire right, title and interest in and to TERN-701 and the Hansoh Products, including all intellectual \nproperty rights therein, in the Hansoh Territory and Hansoh shall provide us the fair market value of such assignment. \n  \n36"

These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, \nquality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and \nreporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates. Any drug candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may \nbe legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in those foreign countries. \nGenerally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although \nthere can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the European Union, or EU, are addressed in a centralized way, \nbut country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. \n \nU.S. Drug Development Process \nIn the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. \nA company, institution, or organization which takes responsibility for the initiation and management of a clinical development program for such \nproducts is referred to as a sponsor. A sponsor seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically secure the \nfollowing: \n•\ncompletion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practice \nrequirements and other applicable regulations; \n38"

An IND is a request for \nauthorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general \ninvestigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND also includes \nresults of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; \nchemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. These \nstudies are generally referred to as IND-enabling studies. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically \nbecomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed \nclinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions \nbefore the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. \n39"

      "text": "Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in\naccordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. \nClinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and \nthe effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during \nproduct development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial \nmust review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study \nuntil completed. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals \nparticipating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that \nmust be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, \nthe IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an \nunacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified \nexperts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may \nmove forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an \nunacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. \nHuman clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:\n•\nPhase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These \nstudies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the \nside effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe \nor life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy \nvolunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. \n•\nPhase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the \npreliminary efficacy, optimal dosages, dose tolerance and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. \nMultiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. \n•\nPhase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically \nsignificant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These \nclinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product \napproval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. \nPost-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain \nadditional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, such as with accelerated approval drugs, \nFDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of \napproval of an NDA. \nIn December 2022, with the passage of Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, Congress required sponsors to develop and submit a \ndiversity action plan for each phase 3 clinical trial or any other “pivotal study” of a new drug or biological product. These plans are meant to encourage the \nenrollment of more diverse patient populations in late-stage clinical trials of FDA-regulated products. Specifically, actions plans must include the sponsor’s \ngoals for enrollment, the underlying rationale for those goals, and an explanation of how the sponsor intends to meet them. In addition to these \nrequirements, the legislation directs the FDA to issue new guidance on diversity action plans.\nDuring the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to \nsubmission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an \nopportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach \nagreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and \npresent plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. \n40"

      "text": "Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the \nchemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP \nrequirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the \nmanufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be \nselected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its \nshelf life. \nWhile the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress \nreport, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and \ninvestigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same \nor similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a \nserious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. \nSponsors of clinical trials are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by \nthe U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH. In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and \ninvestigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Although the FDA has historically not \nenforced these reporting requirements due to the long delay by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, in issuing final implementing \nregulations, the FDA has issued several Notices of Noncompliance to manufacturers since April 2021. The failure to submit required clinical trial \ninformation to clinicaltrials.gov is a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each \nday the violation continues.\n  \nPediatric Studies\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety \nand effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each \npediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the FDASIA in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study \nplans (if required under PREA), before the date on which the sponsor submits the required assessments or investigation and no later than either 60 calendar \ndays after the date of the end-of-phase 2 meeting or such other time as agreed upon between FDA and the sponsor. Those plans must contain an outline of \nthe proposed pediatric study or studies the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other \ninformation required by regulation. The sponsor, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult \nwith each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the sponsor may request an amendment to the plan at any time.\nThe FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of \nthe product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a \nfinding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or \neffectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric trials begin. Pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, \nor FDASIA, the FDA must send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, \nhave failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation. FDASIA further \nrequires the FDA to publicly post the PREA Non-Compliance letter and sponsor’s response.\n \n41"

      "text": "U.S. Review and Approval Process \nAssuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product \ndevelopment, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted \non the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market \nthe product. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of \nalternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity \nto establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the \npayment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on \nNDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. \nThe FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine \nwhether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA’s regulations state that an application “shall not be considered as filed until \nall pertinent information and data have been received.”  In the event that FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a \nRefuse to File, or RTF, determination to the applicant. The FDA may also request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, \nthe NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. \nThe FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its \nmanufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or \nPDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to \nreview and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has \napproximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The actual review time may be significantly longer, depending \non the complexity of the review, FDA requests for additional information and the sponsor’s submission of additional information.\nThe FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including \nclinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under \nwhat conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making \ndecisions. \nBefore approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an \napplication unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production \nof the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure \ncompliance with GCPs. With passage of FDORA, Congress clarified FDA’s authority to conduct inspections by expressly permitting inspection of facilities \ninvolved in the preparation, conduct, or analysis of clinical and non-clinical studies submitted to FDA as well as other persons holding study records or \ninvolved in the study process.\nAfter the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial \nmarketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the \napplication will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require \nadditional clinical data, such as an additional clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies \nor manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the \napplication. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. \n42"

For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to \nensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine \nand to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician \ncommunication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA \nalso may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once \napproved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur \nafter the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and \nmonitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-\nmarketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies \nmay change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs. \n \nExpedited Development and Review Programs \nThe FDA has a number of programs intended to expedite the development or review of products that meet certain criteria. For example, new drugs \nare eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address \nunmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for \nwhich it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during \nproduct development, and the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the \nsponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule \nis acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. \nThe FDA may also designate a product candidate as a “Breakthrough Therapy” if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with \none or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may \ndemonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed \nearly in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance \nbeginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement \nof senior managers.\nAny product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation or Breakthrough Therapy designation, \nmay also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An \nNDA for a product candidate is eligible for priority review if the product candidate has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no \nsatisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. \nThe FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. \nThe FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of \nnew molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals. \nIn addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or \nconditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably \nlikely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to \npredict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and \nthe availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval \nperform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other \nclinical endpoints, and to begin such a study prior to accelerated approval, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures if the sponsor \nfails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires \npre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the \nproduct. \n43"

      "text": "Further, with passage of the FDORA in December 2022, Congress modified certain provisions governing accelerated approval of drug and biologic \nproducts. Specifically, the new legislation authorized the FDA to: require a sponsor to have its confirmatory clinical trial underway before accelerated \napproval is awarded, require a sponsor of a product granted accelerated approval to submit progress reports on its post-approval studies to FDA every six \nmonths (until the study is completed; and use expedited procedures to withdraw accelerated approval of an NDA or BLA after the confirmatory trial fails to \nverify the product’s clinical benefit. FDORA also requires the agency to publish on its website “the rationale for why a post-approval study is not \nappropriate or necessary” whenever it decides not to require such a study upon granting accelerated approval.\nFast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but \nmay expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that \nthe product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We \nmay explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. \n \nPost-approval Requirements \nAny products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, \namong other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution and \nadvertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, \nare subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their \nsubcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by \nthe FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-\nparty manufacturers. The PREVENT Pandemics Act, which was enacted in December 2022, clarifies that foreign drug manufacturing establishments are \nsubject to registration and listing requirements even if a drug or biologic undergoes further manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or \nprocessing at a separate establishment outside the United States prior to being imported or offered for import into the United States.\nChanges to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval \nbefore being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements \nupon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. \nAccordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance \nwith cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. \n44"

      "text": "The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product \nreaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or \nwith manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety \ninformation; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions \nunder a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: \n•\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; \n•\nfines, warning letters or untitled letters; \n•\nclinical holds on clinical studies; \n•\nrefusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license \napprovals; \n•\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; \n•\nconsent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; \n•\nmandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; \n•\nthe issuance of safety alerts, “dear doctor” letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information \nabout the product; or \n•\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. \nThe FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. \nDiscovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, \nincluding adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with \ndoctors and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s \napproved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management \nmeasures. \nThe FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to \nsafety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other \nagencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, \namong other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their \nindependent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those \ntested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. \nThe FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. \nIt may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication \nregarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information.  Moreover, with passage of the Pre-Approval Information \nExchange Act, or PIE Act, in December 2022, sponsors of products that have not been approved may proactively communicate to payors certain \ninformation about products in development to help expedite patient access upon product approval. Previously, such communications were permitted under \nFDA guidance but the new legislation explicitly provides protection to sponsors who convey certain information about products in development to payors, \nincluding unapproved uses of approved products.\nThe FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied \nlarge civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label \npromotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which \nspecified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent \nwith a product’s FDA-approved labeling. \n45"

      "text": "In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates \nthe distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the \nstates. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure \naccountability in distribution. \n \nRegulatory Exclusivity \nRegulatory exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The \nFDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a \nnew chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which \nis the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review \nan abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for \nanother drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for \nanother indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be \nsubmitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator \nNDA holder. \nThe FDCA alternatively provides three years of regulatory exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, \nother than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the \napplication, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the \ndrug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs \ncontaining the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of \na full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and \nadequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. \nIn the United States, the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, as amended, provides incentives for the development of drugs for rare diseases or conditions that \naffect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States (or for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the \ndrug in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the drug in the United States). Certain of the incentives turn on the \ndrug first being designated as an orphan drug. To be eligible for designation as an orphan drug (Orphan Drug Designation), the drug must have the potential \nto treat such rare disease or condition as described above. In addition, the FDA must not have previously approved a drug considered the “same drug,” as \ndefined in the FDA’s orphan drug regulations, for the same orphan-designated indication or the sponsor of the subsequent drug must provide a plausible \nhypothesis of clinical superiority over the previously approved same drug. Upon receipt of Orphan Drug Designation, the sponsor is eligible for tax credits \nof up to 25% for qualified clinical trial expenses and waiver of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act application fee. In addition, upon marketing approval, an \norphan-designated drug could be eligible for seven years of market exclusivity if no drug considered the same drug was previously approved for the same \norphan condition (or if the subsequent drug is demonstrated to be clinically superior to any such previously approved same drug). Such orphan drug \nexclusivity, if awarded, would only block the approval of any drug considered the same drug for the same orphan indication. Moreover, a subsequent same \ndrug could break an approved drug’s orphan exclusivity through a demonstration of clinical superiority over the previously approved drug.  \nA recent Eleventh Circuit decision in Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vs. FDA regarding interpretation of the Orphan Drug Act exclusivity provisions \nas applied to drugs approved for orphan indications narrower than the drug’s orphan designation has the potential to adversely impact whether certain label \nexpansions would qualify for orphan exclusivity. Although there have been legislative proposals to overrule this decision, they have not been enacted into \nlaw. On January 23, 2023, FDA announced that, in matters beyond the scope of that court order, FDA will continue to apply its existing regulations tying \norphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which the orphan drug was approved.\n46"

      "text": "Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six \nmonths of regulatory exclusivity to the term of any existing unexpired patent or regulatory exclusivity, including orphan drug exclusivity. This six-month \nexclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data about the active \nmoiety in the product. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to \nfairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA \nwithin the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. \nThis is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.\n \nForeign Government Regulation \nOur product candidates will be subject to similar laws and regulations imposed by jurisdictions outside of the United States, and, in particular, the \nEuropean Union, or EU, which may include, for instance, applicable clinical trial, marketing authorization and post-marketing requirements, including \nsafety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value \nto healthcare professionals. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable \nforeign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign jurisdictions. The time required to obtain \napproval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country \nor jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may \nnegatively impact the regulatory process in others.\n \nRegulations Governing Marketing Authorization of Medicinal Products in the EU \n \nNon-clinical studies and clinical trials\n Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.\nNon-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new biological substances. Non-clinical studies must be \nconducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice, or GLP, as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical \nstudies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which \ndefine a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect \nthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.\nClinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference\non Harmonisation, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, as set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/556, EU \nRegulation (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR, as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of \nHelsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must \ntake out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU member states, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured \nin the clinical trial.\nThe regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation, or CTR, which \nwas adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly \napplicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the \nassessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal \nand database. \n47"

      "text": "While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application, or CTA, to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent \nnational health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only \nrequires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the \ncompetent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other \nthings, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the \nmedicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member \nstates concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. \nEach member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may \nproceed. \nThe CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For \nclinical trials whose CTA was made under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a \ntransitional basis for three years. Additionally, sponsors were able to choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until \nJanuary 31, 2023 and, if authorized, those will be governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will \nbecome subject to the provisions of the CTR.  \nParties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the United States, post clinical trial information in the European Union at the EudraCT website: \nhttps://eudract.ema.europa.eu.\nMedicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice, or GMP, as set out in EU Commission \nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2017/1569. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.\n \nMarketing Authorization\nIn order to market our future product candidates in the EU and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More \nconcretely, in the EU, medicinal product candidates can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. To obtain regulatory \napproval of a product candidate in the EU, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The process for doing this depends, among \nother things, on the nature of the medicinal product. There are two types of MAs: \n•\n“centralized MAs,” which are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee \nfor Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and are valid throughout the EU. The \ncentralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of product candidates, such as (i) medicinal products derived from biotechnological \nprocesses,  (ii) designated orphan medicinal products, (iii) advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, such as gene therapy, somatic \ncell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicinal products and (iv) medicinal products indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, \nneurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune or other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional \nfor any products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, \nscientific or technical innovation or for which the granting of a MA would be in the interest of public health in the EU; and \n•\n“national MAs,” which are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states, only cover their respective territory, and are \navailable for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for \nmarketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If \nthe product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various \nmember states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent \nauthorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.\nUnder the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU member states make an assessment \nof the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. \n48"

      "text": "MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a \nreevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.\nThe European Commission is expected to publish new proposed legislation in March 2023 which, if adopted by the European Parliament and the \nCouncil of Ministers, will introduce significant number of changes to the regulatory procedures described above.\n \nAdaptive pathways\nThe EMA has adaptive pathways programs which allow for early and progressive patient access to a medicine. The adaptive pathways concept is an \napproach to medicines approval that aims to improve patients’ access to medicines which have potential to address unmet medical needs. To achieve this \ngoal, several approaches are envisaged: identifying small populations with severe disease where a medicine’s benefit-risk balance could be favorable; \nmaking more use of real-world data where appropriate to support clinical trial data; and involving health technology assessment bodies early in \ndevelopment to increase the chance that medicines will be recommended for payment and ultimately covered by national healthcare systems. The adaptive \npathways concept applies primarily to treatments in areas of high medical need where it is difficult to collect data via traditional routes and where large \nclinical trials would unnecessarily expose patients who are unlikely to benefit from the medicine. The approach builds on regulatory processes already in \nplace within the existing EU legal framework. These include: scientific advice; compassionate use; the conditional approval mechanism (for medicines \naddressing seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases or rare diseases); patient registries and other pharmacovigilance tools that allow collection of \nreal-life data and development of a risk-management plan for each medicine. \nThe adaptive pathways program does not change the standards for the evaluation of benefits and risks or the requirement to demonstrate a positive \nbenefit-risk balance to obtain MA. \n \nPRIME scheme\nIn July 2016, the EMA launched the PRIME scheme. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of \nmedicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to \noptimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME \ndesignation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is however not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation includes the \nappointment of a rapporteur from the Committee for Medicinal Product candidates for Human Use before submission of an MAA, early dialogue and \nscientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify product candidates for accelerated review earlier in the application process. \n \nData and marketing exclusivity \nThe EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving MA, or reference medicinal products qualify for eight years of data \nexclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying \non the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a \nperiod of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful \ngeneric or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference \nproduct in the EU. The overall 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 \nyears, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their \nauthorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be \nconsidered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.\nIn March 2023, the European Commission is expected to publish new proposed legislation. If adopted by the European Parliament and the Council \nof Ministers, this legislation will introduce new data and market exclusivity periods which are likely to include additional requirements and modulation \nmechanisms.\n49"

      "text": "Post-approval requirements\nSimilar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the \nEMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a \npharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key \nobligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.\nAll new MAA must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and \ndocumenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a \ncondition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent \nsubmission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.  \nThe advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with \nphysicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be \nconsistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of\nprescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established \nunder EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another. A new legislative proposal by \nthe European Commission expected to be published in March 2023 is likely to contain new proposed rules restricting comparative advertising of medicinal \nproducts in the EU.\nFailure to comply with the aforementioned EU and member state laws may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could \ninclude delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, suspension of the conduct of clinical trials, rejection of clinical trial data, or refusal to \ngrant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal, revocation or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of \nproduction, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.\nThe aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus \nNorway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.\n \nBrexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom \nThe United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union took place on January 31, 2020. The European Union and the United Kingdom. \nreached an agreement on their new partnership in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the Agreement, which was applied provisionally beginning on \nJanuary 1, 2021 and which entered into force on May 1, 2021. The Agreement focuses primarily on free trade by ensuring no tariffs or quotas on trade in \ngoods, including healthcare products such as medicinal products. Thereafter, the European Union and the United Kingdom will form two separate markets \ngoverned by two distinct regulatory and legal regimes. As such, the Agreement seeks to minimize barriers to trade in goods while accepting that border \nchecks will become inevitable as a consequence that the United Kingdom is no longer part of the single market. \nAs of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, became responsible for supervising medicines and \nmedical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law whereas Northern Ireland continues to be subject to \nEuropean Union rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended), \nor the HMR, as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law the body of EU law instruments governing medicinal \nproducts that pre-existed prior to the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU. The MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the \napproval of a new marketing authorization via the centralized procedure until December 31, 2023.\n \n50"

If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to \npenalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, the \ncurtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment. \n \nCoverage and Reimbursement \nSales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign \ngovernment healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-\nparty payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party \npayors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign \ngovernments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and \nrequirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in \njurisdictions with existing controls, inflationary rebates and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for \nany product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a \nmaterial adverse effect on sales. \nOutside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control in many countries. In the EU, pricing and \nreimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has \nbeen agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently\navailable therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies \nto fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control \nprices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. \nHistorically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.\n \nGovernment Drug Price Reporting\nThe Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the 340B drug pricing program, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule program, \nand other governmental drug pricing programs require participating manufacturers to report certain product and pricing data to the government. Pricing \ncalculations vary among products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies \nand the courts, which can change and evolve over time. Manufacturers may be held liable for errors associated with submission of data under these \nprograms, including potential civil monetary penalties per item of falsely reported or misrepresented drug pricing information. Such failure also could be \ngrounds for other sanctions, such as termination from the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Further, a growing number of states have enacted drug price \ntransparency laws requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information to certain state agencies and other parties. Many of these laws provide for \ncivil monetary penalties and other enforcement mechanisms if manufacturers are found to have violated requirements. \n \n51"

      "text": "Healthcare Reform\nIn the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In \nMarch 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, \nwas signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of \nexample, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required \ncollection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or \nimporters who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates \nowed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; \nexpanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and \nconduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test \ninnovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. \nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be \nadditional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, the ACA has been challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court multiple times since \nits enactment. While in 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling \non the constitutionality of the ACA, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA. \nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare \npayments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which will remain in effect through 2032 absent additional congressional action, with the exception of a \ntemporary suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 (with a 1% payment reduction from April 1 to June 30,\n2022). Additionally, under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (Statutory PAYGO), the Administration is required to issue a sequestration order \n(capped at 4% for Medicare payments) if the PAYGO scorecard shows a net cost at the end of a Congressional session. Although Statutory PAYGO was \nexpected to be triggered at the end of the 2021 Congressional session, subsequent legislation has delayed a Statutory PAYGO sequestration order until after \n2024. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, \nwhich has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to \nproduct pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies \nfor pharmaceutical products.\nFor example, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted. The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D, which is a \nprogram available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option of paying a monthly premium \nfor outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with \nMedicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize \nprice increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program \n(beginning in 2025).  The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions \nthrough guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years.\nSpecifically, with respect to price negotiations, Congress authorized Medicare to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-source drug and \nbiologic products that do not have competing generics or biosimilars and are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D.  CMS may negotiate prices for \nten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in 2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or\nPart D drugs in 2029 and beyond. This provision applies to drug products that have been approved for at least 9 years and biologics that have been licensed \nfor 13 years, but it does not apply to drugs and biologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition.  Further, the legislation subjects \ndrug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or \nless than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also requires manufacturers \nto pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an \nestimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at 2,000 a year.  \n52"

      "text": "In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control \npharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost \ndisclosure and other transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. \nFurthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts \nand list prices. \n \nData Privacy and Security Laws \nNumerous state, federal and foreign laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related \ninformation. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy laws \nand federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act), govern the collection, \nuse, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information, and could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. The \nFTC, in particular, has especially been focused on the use and disclosure of health information in its recent enforcement actions, which could increase the \nrisk related to our business. At the state level, five states to date—California (CCPA/CPRA), Colorado (CPA), Connecticut (CTDPA), Utah (UDPA) and \nVirginia (VCDPA)—have enacted omnibus consumer privacy laws, each of which provides special provisions regarding the privacy of health-related \ninformation, and each of which provides for civil enforcement, including the levying of fines for violations. Moreover, the CPRA imposes consumer \nprivacy obligations on businesses with respect to their California-based employees and business contacts. Additionally, California’s Confidentiality of \nMedical Information Act (H. R. 8152)—which provides for both civil enforcement and a private right of action—imposes specific obligations on \npharmaceutical companies with respect to the privacy of medical information.  Each of these state laws could apply to our operations or the operations of \nour partners. We note, too, that a draft federal omnibus privacy law—the American Data Privacy and Protection Act (H. R. 8152)—is currently pending in \nCongress and may impose additional obligations and risks if enacted. \n53"

      "text": "In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the GDPR imposes \nstrict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance \nobligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 \nmillion or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to \ncomply with the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. \nThe UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security \nlaws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in \ninvestigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. The GDPR prohibits the \ntransfer of personal data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to countries outside of the EEA unless made to a country deemed to have adequate \ndata privacy laws by the European Commission or a data transfer mechanism has been put in place. The EU-US Privacy Shield was such a transfer \nmechanism put in place by the EU and the United States, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated for international transfers of personal data in July 2020 by \nthe Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU. A replacement of the Privacy Shield is currently being developed. On 13 December 2022, following \nthe signature of a US Executive Order by President Biden on 7 October 2022, the European Commission issued a draft adequacy decision which, if adopted \nand not successfully challenged in court, is intended to address the concerns expressed by CJEU in their 2016 ruling and allow transfer of personal data \nfrom the EEA to companies in the US which commit to comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. At the moment it is unclear if the adequacy \ndecision will be adopted at EU level and whether the anticipated legal challenges against this decision, which may similar to the challenge that led to the \ninvalidation of the Privacy Shield, would be successful. In June 2021, the European Commission adopted new SCCs that are designed to be a mechanism \nby which entities can transfer personal information out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate \nlevel of protection. The SCCs require parties that rely upon that legal mechanism to comply with additional obligations, such as conducting transfer impact \nassessments to determine whether additional security measures are necessary to protect the transferred personal information. The competent authorities and \ncourts in a number of EU Member States increasingly scrutinize and question the GDPR compliance of processing of personal data by US-based entities or \nentities with links to US-based entities, independently of whether personal data is actually transferred outside the EEA. In June 2021, the CJEU issued a \nruling that expanded the scope of the “one stop shop” under the GDPR. According to the ruling, the competent authorities of EU Member States may, under \ncertain strict conditions, bring claims to their national courts against a company for breaches of the GDPR, including unlawful cross-border processing \nactivities, even such company does not have an establishment in the EU member state in question and the competent authority bringing the claim is not the \nlead supervisory authority. \n  \nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 46 employees, all of whom were full-time, all of whom are engaged in research and development activities, \noperations, or finance and administration. 13 of our employees hold doctorate degrees (Ph.D., M.D. or Pharm.D.). None of our employees is subject to a \ncollective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. \nOur key human capital management objectives include, among others: (i) attracting, developing and retaining a diverse and talented workforce; (ii) \nproviding opportunities for learning, development, career growth and movement within our company; (iii) evaluating compensation and benefits and \nrewarding performance; (iv) investing in physical, emotional and financial health of team members; (v) obtaining team member feedback; (vi) maintaining \nand enhancing our culture and mission; and (vii) communicating with our board of directors on a routine basis on key topics.

You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other \ninformation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Item 7. “Management’s \nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any \nof the events or developments described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \nIn such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties \nnot presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and the market value of our common stock. You \nshould consider all of the risk factors described when evaluating our business.\nRisks Related to Our Limited Operating History, Financial Condition and Capital Requirements \nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history and no products approved for commercial sale. We have incurred \nsignificant losses since our inception, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, which, together with \nour limited operating history, makes it difficult to assess our future viability. \nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, and we have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and \nprospects. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We have no products \napproved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from sales of our product candidates and have incurred losses in each year since our \ninception in December 2016. We have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. In addition, we have not \nyet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving \nfields, particularly in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. We expect that it will be a number of years, if ever, before we \nhave a product candidate ready for commercialization.\nWe have had significant operating losses since our inception. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, \n2022 and 2021 was approximately $60.3 million and $50.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $242.4 \nmillion. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general \nand administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will \nincrease as we continue to develop our product candidates, conduct clinical trials and pursue research and development activities. Even if we achieve \nprofitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have \nhad and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders’ equity and working capital. \nWe will require substantial additional funding to finance our operations and achieve our goals. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on\nacceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other \noperations. \nSince our inception, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in research and development activities. Our product \ncandidates will require additional clinical development, and we intend to conduct additional research and development activities to discover and develop \nnew product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, all of which will require substantial additional funds. We will continue \nto expend significant resources for the foreseeable future in connection with these activities. These expenditures will include costs associated with \nconducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and supply, as well as marketing and selling any drugs \napproved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of any preclinical study or clinical trial is highly uncertain, we \ncannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or any \nfuture product candidates. \n56"

However, \ndue to the significant resources required for the development of our product candidates, we must focus on specific diseases and disease pathways and \ndecide which product candidates to pursue and the amount of resources to allocate to each such product candidate. For example, in May 2022, following a \nstrategic review of our pipeline we announced a decision to focus our resources on advancing the development of TERN-701, TERN-501 (as a single agent \nand in combination with TERN-101), and TERN-601 in lieu of allocating additional resources to development of TERN-201 in NASH and, as a single \nagent, TERN-101 for NASH.

Further, some patients may not be able or willing to comply with \nclinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupts healthcare services. \nWe are unable to predict with confidence the duration of any such patient enrollment delays and difficulties. If patient enrollment is delayed for an \nextended period of time, our clinical trials could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. Similarly, our ability to recruit and retain principal \ninvestigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19, may be adversely impacted. \nIn addition, ongoing or planned clinical trials may also be impacted by interruptions or delays in the operations of the FDA and comparable foreign \nregulatory authorities. We have also made certain adjustments to the operation of our trials in an effort to ensure the monitoring and safety of patients and \nminimize risks to trial integrity during the pandemic in accordance with the guidance issued by the FDA, and may need to make further adjustments in the \nfuture. For example, we have initiated our clinical trial protocols to enable remote visits to mitigate any potential impacts as a result of the COVID-19 \npandemic.  \nOn January 30, 2023, the Biden Administration announced that it will end the public health emergency declarations related to COVID-19 on May \n11, 2023. On March 13, 2023, the FDA announced that it will end 22 COVID-19 related policies when the public health emergency ends May 11 and allow \n22 to continue for an additional 180 days. The FDA plans to retain 24 COVID-19 related policies with appropriate changes and four whose duration is not \ntied to the end of the public health emergency. At this point, it is unclear how, if at all, these developments will impact our efforts to develop and \ncommercialize our product candidates.\nIn addition, in the event of a future spike in COVID-19 or other infectious diseases, we may encounter a shortage in supplies of, or in delays in \nshipping, our study drug or other components of the clinical trial vital for successful conduct of the trial. Further, the successful conduct of our clinical trials \ndepends on retrieving laboratory, imaging and other data from patients. Any failure by the vendors we work with to send us such data could impair the \nprogress of such clinical trials. These events could delay our clinical trials, increase the cost of completing our clinical trials and negatively impact the \nintegrity, reliability or robustness of the data from our clinical trials. \nIn addition, quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the \nconduct of business operations could occur, related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases could impact personnel at our study sites or third-party \nmanufacturing facilities upon which we rely, or the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt the supply chain for our product candidates or \nother goods or services used in our clinical trials. To the extent our suppliers and service providers are unable to comply with their obligations under our \nagreements with them or they are otherwise unable to deliver or are delayed in delivering goods and services to us due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our \nability to continue meeting clinical supply demand for our product candidates or otherwise advancing development of our product candidates may become \nimpaired. \nThe spread of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases and actions taken to reduce its spread may also materially affect us economically. While the \npotential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic has been and will continue to be difficult to assess or predict, there \ncould be a significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity \nand financial position. In addition, the trading prices for other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile and could be increased as a result of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. This volatility may result in difficulties raising capital through sales of our common stock or such sales may be on unfavorable \nterms, if at all. \n60"

The extent to which COVID-19 may impede the development of \nour product candidates, reduce the productivity of our employees, disrupt our supply chains, delay our clinical trials, reduce our access to capital or limit \nour business development activities, will depend on future developments and future mutations of COVID-19 or any other currently unknown infectious \ndisease, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. \nIn addition, to the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and results of operations, it may also have the effect of \nheightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this Item 1A. “Risk Factors” section. \nRisks related to the discovery and development of our product candidates \nWe are early in our development efforts. Our business is heavily dependent on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization \nof our current and future product candidates. \nWe have no drugs or combination therapies approved for sale, and our most advanced development programs are in early stages of clinical \ndevelopment or preparing to enter clinical development. The success of our business, including our ability to finance our company and generate revenue in \nthe future, will primarily depend on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates and, in particular, \nprogressing our most advanced development programs. Given our stage of development, it may be many years, if we succeed at all, before we have \ndemonstrated the safety and efficacy of a product candidate sufficient to warrant approval for commercialization. We cannot be certain that our product \ncandidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized even if we receive regulatory approval.\nWe have not previously submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or similar approval filings \nto a comparable foreign regulatory authority, for any product candidate. An NDA or other relevant regulatory filing must include extensive preclinical and \nclinical data and supporting information to establish that the product candidate is safe and effective for each desired indication. The NDA or other relevant \nregulatory filing must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. We cannot be certain that\nour current or future product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, even if they are successful in clinical \ntrials, our current or future product candidates may not receive regulatory approval. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for current or future product \ncandidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our revenue \nwill depend, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights, as well as the \navailability of competitive products, whether there is sufficient third-party reimbursement and adoption by physicians. \nWe may plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates in the United States and in select foreign countries. While the \nscope of regulatory approval generally is similar in other countries, in order to obtain separate regulatory approval in other countries, we must comply with \nnumerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy. Other countries also have their own regulations governing, \namong other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, as well as pricing and distribution of drugs, and we may be required to expend significant \nresources to obtain regulatory approval and to comply with ongoing regulations in these jurisdictions. \nIn the future, we may also become dependent on other product candidates that we may develop or acquire. The clinical and commercial success of \nour product candidates and future product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following: \n•\ntimely completion of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which may be significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate \nand will depend substantially upon the performance of third-party contractors; \n•\nsufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials; \n•\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in clinical site closures, delays to patient enrollment, patients discontinuing their treatment or \nfollow-up visits or changes to trial protocols; \n•\nour ability to raise any additional required capital on acceptable terms, or at all; \n61"

      "text": "These factors, many of which are beyond our control, could cause us to experience significant delays or an inability to obtain regulatory approvals or \ncommercialize our product candidates. Even if regulatory approvals are obtained, we may never be able to successfully commercialize any of our product \ncandidates. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of our product candidates or any \nfuture product candidates to continue our business or achieve profitability. \nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain timelines and outcomes, and results of earlier studies and trials may \nnot be predictive of future trial results. If development of our product candidates is unsuccessful or delayed, we may be unable to obtain required \nregulatory approvals and we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. \nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure or delay can occur at any time \nduring the clinical trial process. Success in nonclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. A number \nof companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after promising \nresults in earlier nonclinical or clinical studies. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, nonclinical findings made while clinical studies \nwere underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical studies, including previously unreported adverse events. The results of preclinical, \nnonclinical and early clinical studies of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Likewise, interim or \npreliminary results from a clinical trial may not be predictive of final results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired \nsafety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical and initial clinical trials. Notwithstanding any potential promising results in earlier \nstudies, we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even if our clinical trials are completed, the results may not be sufficient to obtain \nregulatory approval for our product candidates.\nWe may experience delays in initiating our clinical trials and we cannot be certain that the trials or any other future clinical trials for our product \ncandidates will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can \nbe delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure related to: \n•\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials; \n•\nthe size of the study population for further analysis of the study’s primary endpoints; \n•\nthe acceptance by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities on the use of any of the non-invasive or other novel diagnostics or \nendpoints we incorporate into our clinical development to obtain initial market authorization; \n•\nobtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial; \n•\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which \ncan be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites; \n•\nobtaining institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee approval at each site; \n•\nrecruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial; \n•\nhaving patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up; \n•\nclinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial; \n•\naddressing patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial; \n•\naddressing any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations; \n•\nadding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; or \n•\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical trials. \n63"

      "text": "In addition, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 or any future pandemic may increase the likelihood that we encounter such difficulties or delays in \ninitiating, enrolling, conducting, or completing our planned and ongoing clinical trials. We could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or \nterminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions at which such trials are being conducted, by a data monitoring committee, or DMC, for such trial or by the \nFDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the \nclinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other \nregulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from \nusing a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. \nMoreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive \ncompensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA or \ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a \nprincipal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected the interpretation of the trial. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory \nauthority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be \njeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, refusal to accept or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or comparable foreign \nregulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of our product candidates. \nIf we experience delays in the completion of any clinical trial of our product candidates or the termination of any such clinical trial, the commercial \nprospects of our product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate drug revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed or not \nrealized at all. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval \nprocess and jeopardize our ability to commence drug sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial \ncondition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also \nultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. \nIn addition, the FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies with respect to clinical trials may change and additional government regulations \nmay be enacted. For example, in December 2022, with the passage of Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, Congress required sponsors to \ndevelop and submit a diversity action plan for each Phase 3 clinical trial or any other “pivotal study” of a new drug or biological product. These plans are \nmeant to encourage the enrollment of more diverse patient populations in late-stage clinical trials of FDA-regulated products. Specifically, actions plans \nmust include the sponsor’s goals for enrollment, the underlying rationale for those goals and an explanation of how the sponsor intends to meet them. In \naddition to these requirements, the legislation directs the FDA to issue new guidance on diversity action plans. Furthermore, the FDA Oncology Center of \nExcellence (OCE) has initiated Project Optimus to address dose optimization and selection in oncology drug development, with the goal of earlier \ncharacterization of dosing in molecularly targeted therapies. This initiative will likely require meetings with FDA to discuss dose-finding and dose \noptimization and may result in the need to develop additional early data to support product dosing before conducting trials intended for registration.\n64"

      "text": "The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU also has recently evolved. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation, or CTR, which was \nadopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. While the Clinical Trials Directive required a \nseparate clinical trial application, or CTA, to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics \ncommittee, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR \nallows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per \nmember state. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a \nseparate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s \ndecision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed. The CTR \nforesees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose \nCTA was made under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for\nthree years. Additionally, sponsors were able to choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if \nauthorized, those will be governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the \nprovisions of the CTR. \nIf we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies governing clinical trials, our \ndevelopment plans may be impacted.\nOur development programs may target indications for which there is currently no approved therapy in the United States or Europe, such as NASH. For \nindications where there is no approved therapy, there is a heightened risk that we will not be able to gain agreement with regulatory authorities \nregarding an acceptable development plan, that the outcome of our clinical trials will not be favorable or that, even if favorable, regulatory authorities \nmay not find the results of our clinical trials to be sufficient for marketing approval. This may make it difficult to predict the timing and costs of the \nclinical development of our product candidates. \nWe are developing TERN-501 both as a single agent and as a part of a combination therapy regimen for the treatment of NASH, an indication for \nwhich there is currently no approved therapy in the United States or Europe. The regulatory approval process for novel drug candidates can be more \nexpensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied drug candidates. As other companies are in later stages of clinical trials for \ntheir potential NASH therapies, we expect that the path for regulatory approval for NASH therapies may continue to evolve as these other companies refine \ntheir regulatory approval strategies and interact with regulatory authorities. Such evolution may impact our future clinical trial designs, including trial size \nand approval endpoints, in ways that we cannot predict today. \n65"

      "text": "In the United States, the FDA generally requires two adequate and well-controlled pivotal clinical trials to approve an NDA. Furthermore, for full \napproval of an NDA, the FDA requires a demonstration of efficacy based on a clinical benefit endpoint. The FDA may grant accelerated approval based on \na surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Even though our pivotal clinical trials for a specific indication may achieve their primary \nendpoints and are reasonably believed by us to be likely to predict clinical benefit, the FDA may not accept the results of such trials or approve our product \ncandidates on an accelerated basis, or at all. It is also possible that the FDA may refuse to accept for filing and review any regulatory application we submit \nfor regulatory approval in the United States. Even if our regulatory application is accepted for review, there may be delays in the FDA’s review process and \nthe FDA may determine that such regulatory application does not contain adequate clinical or other data or support the approval of the product candidate. \nIn such a case, the FDA may issue a complete response letter that may require that we conduct and/or complete additional clinical trials and preclinical \nstudies or provide additional information or data before it will reconsider an application for approval. Any such requirements may be substantial, expensive \nand time-consuming, and there is no guarantee that we will continue to pursue such application or that the FDA will ultimately decide that any such\napplication supports the approval of the product candidate. As an example, the FDA returned a complete response to an NDA submitted by Intercept \nPharmaceuticals, Inc. for the drug candidate obeticholic acid, or OCA, for the treatment of NASH. The efficacy of OCA for the treatment of NASH was \nbased on the surrogate histologic endpoint of improvement of fibrosis as shown by liver biopsy with no worsening of NASH in lieu of clinical outcomes in \nthe NASH patients enrolled in the trial, such as overall survival and time to liver transplant. Such decisions may impact our future NASH clinical trial \ndesigns, including trial size and approval endpoints, in ways that we cannot predict today. Furthermore, the FDA may also refer any regulatory application \nto an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether, and under what conditions, the application should be approved. While the FDA is \nnot bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Delay or failure to \nobtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate \nsufficient revenue to maintain our business. Similar risks may apply in foreign jurisdictions.\nEven if we receive accelerated approval for any of our product candidates, we anticipate we will be required to conduct or complete a post-approval \nclinical outcomes trial to confirm the clinical benefit of such product candidates by demonstrating the correlation of the surrogate endpoint therapeutic \nresponse in patients with a significant reduction in adverse clinical outcomes over time. There can be no assurance that the clinical outcomes trial will \nconfirm that the surrogate endpoint used as the basis of the regulatory submissions we make will eventually show an adequate correlation with clinical \noutcomes. \nFurther, to the extent that we seek accelerated approval, we will need to comply with new provisions governing that route to approval.  For example,\nwith the passage of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, in December 2022, Congress modified certain provisions governing accelerated \napproval of drug and biologic products. Specifically, the new legislation authorized the FDA to: require a sponsor to have its confirmatory clinical trial \nunderway before accelerated approval is awarded, require a sponsor of a product granted accelerated approval to submit progress reports on its post-\napproval studies to FDA every six months (until the study is completed); and use expedited procedures to withdraw accelerated approval of an NDA or \nBLA after the confirmatory trial fails to verify the product’s clinical benefit.  Further, FDORA requires the agency to publish on its website “the rationale \nfor why a post-approval study is not appropriate or necessary” whenever it decides not to require such a study upon granting accelerated approval.\nOur anticipated development costs would likely increase if development of any current or future product candidate is delayed because we are \nrequired by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities to perform studies or trials in addition to, or different from, those that we currently conduct or \nanticipate. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to predict the timing or \namount of any increase in our anticipated development costs. \nWe also may evaluate our product candidates in combination with one or more therapies that have not yet been approved for marketing by the FDA \nor similar foreign regulatory authorities. We may not be able to market and sell any product candidate we develop in combination with an unapproved \ntherapy if that unapproved therapy does not ultimately obtain marketing approval. In addition, unapproved therapies face the same risks described with \nrespect to our product candidates currently in development, including the potential for serious adverse effects, delay in their clinical trials and lack of FDA \nor European Commission approval. If the FDA, the European Commission or similar foreign regulatory authorities do not approve these other therapies or \nrevoke their approval of, or if safety, efficacy, manufacturing, or supply issues arise with, the therapies we choose to evaluate in combination with our \nproduct candidates, we may be unable to obtain approval of or market any such product candidate. \n66"

For such indications, we may face similar challenges as the ones described above for our NASH drug \ncandidates.\nIf we encounter difficulties or delays enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely \naffected. \nWe may not be able to initiate or continue our planned clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to identify and enroll a sufficient \nnumber of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority. Patient enrollment, a significant \nfactor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical \nsites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the \npotential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the \nindications we are investigating. \nThe timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number \nof patients who remain in the study until its conclusion. We may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. \nThe enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including: \n•\nthe patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol; \n•\nthe size of the patient population required for analysis of the clinical trial’s primary endpoints; \n•\nthe proximity of patients to clinical sites; \n•\nthe design of the clinical trial; \n•\nour ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience; \n•\nclinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available \ntherapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating; \n•\nour ability to obtain and maintain patient informed consents; and \n•\nthe risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion. \nIn addition, our clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product \ncandidates, and this competition will reduce the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our \ntrials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. \nDelays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials, which could prevent \ncompletion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates. \nWe face significant competition for our drug discovery and development efforts in an environment of rapid technological and scientific change, and our \nproduct candidates, if approved, will face significant competition, which may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration. Many of our \ncompetitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and we may not be able to successfully compete.\nThe pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in particular are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense \ncompetition and a strong emphasis on developing proprietary therapeutics. Numerous companies are engaged in the development, patenting, manufacturing \nand marketing of healthcare products competitive with those that we are developing.

      "text": "Many of our competitors have greater financial resources, marketing capabilities, sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, research and development \ncapabilities, clinical trial expertise, intellectual property portfolios, experience in obtaining patents and regulatory approvals for drug candidates and other \nresources than we do. Some of the companies also have a broad range of other product offerings, large direct sales forces and long-term customer \nrelationships with our target physicians, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, \nbiopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller \nor early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established \ncompanies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial \nsites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. \nCertain alternative treatments that may be approved and offered by competitors in the future may be available at lower prices and may offer greater \nefficacy or better safety profiles. Furthermore, currently approved products could be discovered to have application for the intended indication of our \nproduct candidates, which could give such products significant regulatory and market timing advantages over any of our product candidates. Our \ncompetitors also may obtain FDA or other foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours and may obtain \norphan product exclusivity from the FDA for indications our product candidates are targeting, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong \nmarket position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party\npayors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. There are generic products currently on the market for certain of the indications that we are \npursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates are approved, we \nexpect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. For additional information regarding our competition, see the \nsection of this Annual Report on Form 10-K captioned Item 1. “Business—Competition.” \nThe lack of widely-accepted non-invasive methods for the diagnosis may present a major challenge to the market penetration of some of our product \ncandidates. \nHistorically, liver biopsy has been the standard approach for the diagnosis of inflammation and fibrosis associated with NASH. However, the \nprocedure-related morbidity and, in rare cases, mortality, sample errors, costs, patient discomfort and thus lack of patient interest in undergoing the \nprocedure limit its use. As such, only patients with a high risk of NASH, which includes patients with metabolic syndrome and an indication of non-\nalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, are generally referred for liver biopsy. Because NASH tends to be asymptomatic until the disease progresses, many \nindividuals with NASH remain undiagnosed until the disease has reached its late stages. The lack of widely-accepted non-invasive methods for the \ndiagnosis of NASH is likely to present a major challenge to the market penetration of our product candidates for the treatment of NASH, if ever \ncommercialized, as many practitioners and patients may not be aware that a patient suffers from NASH and requires treatment. As such, use of our product \ncandidates for the treatment of NASH might not be as wide-spread as our actual target market and this may limit the commercial potential of such product \ncandidates. \nA further challenge to the market penetration for our NASH product candidates is that currently a liver biopsy is the standard approach for \nmeasuring improvement in NASH patients. Because it would be impractical to subject all patients that take our product candidates, if approved, to regular \nand repeated liver biopsies, it will be difficult to demonstrate effectiveness to practitioners and patients unless and until widely-accepted non-invasive \nmethods for the diagnosis and monitoring of NASH become available in clinical practice and clinical trials, as to which there can be no assurance. \nWhile non-invasive diagnostic approaches are being advanced, their use in the diagnosis of NASH and monitoring of response to treatment has not \nbeen broadly recommended in professional treatment guidelines. While we plan to engage with the FDA on using non-invasive methods in our NASH \ndevelopment, the FDA may require liver biopsy to be the primary endpoint for our future trials in NASH. Moreover, some diagnostics in development have \nnot yet been clinically-validated, have uncertain timetables for clinical validation, and may also be subject to regulation by FDA or other regulatory \nauthorities as medical devices and may require premarket clearance, approval or certification.\nIf we pursue the development of other product candidates in indications without a widely-accepted non-invasive method for diagnosis or monitoring \ntreatment response, those product candidates may be subject to similar risks as described above in relation to our NASH program.\n69"

      "text": "Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, cause us to \nsuspend or discontinue clinical trials, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following \nmarketing approval, if any. \nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could \nresult in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Results of our \nclinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects or unexpected characteristics. While our clinical stage single-\nagent product candidates have been generally well-tolerated, we have observed adverse events and laboratory abnormalities in the clinical trials for each of \nour single-agent candidates. For example, in our Phase 2a LIFT Trial of TERN-101 in NASH patients, we observed mild-to-moderate pruritus in the \nTERN-101 dose groups and statistically significant increases in low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol in the 15 mg dose group as compared to \nplacebo. Drugs with similar mechanism of actions to those we are developing have shown tolerability issues, including pruritus and adverse lipid changes \nin other FXR agonists, potential cardiac toxicity in other THR-β agonists, and changes in hematologic parameters or musculoskeletal pain in other allosteric \nBCR-ABL inhibitors. It is possible that our drug candidates will display similar, more pronounced or previously unobserved safety and tolerability issues \nand adverse events when evaluated in longer clinical trials in larger patient populations despite the results we have observed in our clinical trials to date. \nIf unacceptable side effects arise in the development of our product candidates, we, the IRBs at the institutions in which our studies are conducted or \nthe DMC could recommend suspension or termination of our clinical trials or the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease \nclinical trials or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Treatment-related side effects could also affect patient \nrecruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. In addition, these side effects may not be \nappropriately recognized or managed by the treating medical staff. Furthermore, we may be required to expend time and incur costs to train medical \npersonnel using our product candidates to understand the side effect profiles for our clinical trials and upon any commercialization of any of our product \ncandidates. Inadequate training in recognizing or managing the potential side effects of our product candidates could result in patient injury or death. Any \nof these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. \nIn addition, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such \ndrugs, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including: \n•\nwe may be forced to suspend marketing of that product candidate, or decide to remove the product candidate from the marketplace; \n•\nregulatory authorities may withdraw or change their approvals of that product candidate; \n•\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or limit access of that product candidate to selective specialized centers \nwith additional safety reporting and with requirements that patients be geographically close to these centers for all or part of their treatment; \n•\nwe may be required to send “dear doctor” letters to treatment providers or create a medication guide outlining the risks of the product \ncandidate for patients, or to conduct post-marketing studies; \n•\nwe may be required to change the way the product candidate is administered; \n•\nwe could be subject to fines, injunctions, or the imposition of criminal or civil penalties, or be sued and held liable for harm caused to \nsubjects or patients; and \n•\nthe product candidate may become less competitive, and our reputation may suffer.\nAny of the foregoing events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and \nresult in the loss of significant revenues to us, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and business. \n70"

If the interim, top-line or preliminary data \nthat we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval \nfor and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition. \nThe regulatory approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates \nunder applicable regulatory requirements. The denial or delay of any such approval would delay commercialization of our product candidates and \nadversely impact our ability to generate revenue, our business and our results of operations. \nThe development, research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing, promotion and distribution of drug \nproducts are subject to extensive and evolving regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States, principally the FDA and \nby foreign regulatory authorities, which regulations differ from country to country. Neither we nor any future collaborator is permitted to market any of our \nproduct candidates in the United States until we receive regulatory approval of an NDA from the FDA. \nObtaining regulatory approval of an NDA or similar applications required in foreign jurisdictions can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. \nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the United States or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial\nevidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities, that such product candidates are safe \nand effective for their intended uses. The number of nonclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for regulatory approval varies depending on \nthe product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular product \ncandidate. \nResults from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for our \nproduct candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Administering product \ncandidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and result in the FDA or other regulatory \nauthorities denying approval of a product candidate for any or all indications. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may also require us to conduct \nadditional studies or trials for our product candidates either prior to or post-approval, such as additional clinical pharmacology studies or safety or efficacy \nstudies or trials, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program such as the primary endpoints or the number of subjects in our clinical \ntrials.\n71"

We may not receive such designation, and even for those product \ncandidates for which we do, it may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and will not increase the likelihood that \nproduct candidates will receive marketing approval. \nWe have received Fast Track designation from the FDA for TERN-501 and TERN-101 for the treatment of NASH, and we may seek Fast Track \ndesignation for some of our other product candidates, including combination therapy candidates. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-\nthreatening condition or disease, and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need, the drug may qualify for FDA \nFast Track designation, for which sponsors must apply. The sponsor of a Fast Track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with \nthe applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a NDA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A \nFast Track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before \nthe complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections \nof the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. \nThe FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation. Thus, even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this \ndesignation, the FDA may decide not to grant it. Moreover, even if we do receive Fast Track designation, we or our collaborators may not experience a \nfaster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation if it \nbelieves that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. \nA Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA, even if granted for any of our product candidates, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory \nreview or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. \nWe may seek a Breakthrough Therapy designation for one or more of our product candidates if the clinical data support such a designation for one or \nmore product candidates. A Breakthrough Therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a \nserious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over \nexisting therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drug \ncandidates that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to \nidentify the most efficient path for clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation also provides the sponsor with the same benefits as Fast Track \ndesignation, including potential for rolling review of an NDA submission.\nDesignation as a Breakthrough Therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the \ncriteria for designation as a Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of \na Breakthrough Therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drug \ncandidates considered for approval under non-expedited FDA review procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one\nor more of our product candidates qualify as Breakthrough Therapies, the FDA may later decide that the single-agent or combination therapy no longer \nmeets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. \n74"

      "text": "We may seek PRIME Designation in the European Union, but we might not receive such designations, and even if we do, such designation may not \nlead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nIn the European Union, we may seek PRIME designation for some of our product candidates in the future. PRIME is a voluntary program aimed at \nenhancing the EMA’s role to reinforce scientific and regulatory support in order to optimize development and enable accelerated assessment of new \nmedicines that are of major public health interest with the potential to address unmet medical needs. The program focuses on medicines that target \nconditions for which there exists no satisfactory method of treatment in the European Union or even if such a method exists, it may offer a major \ntherapeutic advantage over existing treatments. PRIME is limited to medicines under development and not authorized in the European Union and the \napplicant intends to apply for an initial marketing authorization application through the centralized procedure. To be accepted for PRIME, a product \ncandidate must meet the eligibility criteria in respect of its major public health interest and therapeutic innovation based on information that is capable of \nsubstantiating the claims. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use rapporteur \nto provide continued support and help to build knowledge ahead of a marketing authorization application, early dialogue and scientific advice at key \ndevelopment milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review, meaning reduction in the review time for an opinion on approvability \nto be issued earlier in the application process. PRIME enables an applicant to request parallel EMA scientific advice and health technology assessment \nadvice to facilitate timely market access. Even if we receive PRIME designation for any of our product candidates, the designation may not result in a \nmaterially faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional EMA procedures. Further, obtaining PRIME designation does not \nassure or increase the likelihood of EMA’s grant of a marketing authorization.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining \nregulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions. \nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or \nmaintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative \neffect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory \nauthorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval \nprocedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United \nStates, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials as clinical studies conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory \nauthorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be \napproved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our drugs is also subject to approval. \nObtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs \nfor us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our drugs in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international \nmarkets and/or receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product \ncandidates will be harmed. \nAdditionally, we could face heightened risks with respect to seeking marketing approval in the United Kingdom as a result of the withdrawal of the \nUnited Kingdom from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. The U.K.'s withdrawal from the EU took place on January 31, 2020. \nAs of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, became responsible for supervising medicines and \nmedical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law whereas Northern Ireland continues to be subject to EU \nrules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended), or the HMR, as \nthe basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law, the body of EU law instruments governing medicinal products that \npre-existed prior to the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU. \n75"

The FDA may also require us to adopt a REMS, and foreign regulatory authorities may require us to adopt similar risk \nmanagement measures, to ensure that the benefits of treatment with such product candidate outweigh the risks for each potential patient, which may \ninclude, among other things, a communication plan to health care practitioners, patient education, extensive patient monitoring or distribution systems and \nprocesses that are highly controlled, restrictive and more costly than what is typical for the industry. We or our collaborators may also be required to adopt a \nREMS or engage in similar actions, such as patient education, certification of health care professionals or specific monitoring, if we or others later identify \nundesirable side effects caused by any drug that we develop alone or with collaborators. \nIn addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves a product candidate, the manufacturing, quality control, labeling, \npackaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for the approved drug will be subject to \nextensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities also require submissions of safety and other post-marketing \ninformation and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP and similar foreign requirements and good clinical practice, or GCPs, for \nany clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product candidate, including adverse events of \nunanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, \nmay result in, among other things: \n•\nissue warning letters or untitled letters; \n•\nmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners, or require other \nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of such drugs; \n•\nrequire us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due \ndates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance; \n•\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; \n•\nsuspend, withdraw or modify regulatory approval; \n•\nsuspend or modify any ongoing clinical trials; \n•\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us; \n•\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n•\nseize or detain drugs, refuse to permit the import or export of drugs or require us to initiate a product recall. \n76"

      "text": "Any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate \nnegative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and \ngenerate revenue from our drugs. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating \nresults will be adversely affected. \nAdvertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the United States will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the U.S. \nFederal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, state attorneys \ngeneral, members of the U.S. Congress and the public. Additionally, advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval outside of \nthe United States will be heavily scrutinized by comparable foreign entities and stakeholders. Violations, including actual or alleged promotion of drugs for \nunapproved or off-label uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations and civil and criminal sanctions by the FDA or comparable \nforeign bodies. Any actual or alleged failure to comply with labeling and promotion requirements may result in fines, warning letters, mandates to \ncorrective information to healthcare practitioners, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties. \nThe FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or \ndelay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future \nlegislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, the policies advanced by the Biden Administration and the FDA \nCommissioner may impact our business and industry and the regulation of our products. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing \nrequirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement \naction and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. \nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire and \nretain key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, \nwhich could negatively impact our business. \nThe ability of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including \ngovernment budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees and statutory, regulatory and policy \nchanges. Average review times at the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of \nother government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. \nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies, such as the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, following its relocation to Amsterdam and resulting \nstaff changes, may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely \naffect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the \nFDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact \nthe ability of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse \neffect on our business. \nSeparately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, a number of companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to \nthe FDA’s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. In May 2021, the FDA noted it was continuing to ensure timely reviews of \napplications for medical products during the pandemic in line with its user fee performance goals and conducting mission critical domestic and foreign \ninspections to ensure compliance of manufacturing facilities with FDA quality standards. However, the FDA may not be able to continue its current pace \nand review timelines could be extended, thus the FDA may be unable to complete such required inspections during the review period. Regulatory \nauthorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may experience \ndelays in their regulatory activities. \nIf a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from \nconducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory \nauthorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n77"

      "text": "The FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. If we are found or alleged \nto have improperly promoted off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. \nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drugs, as our product \ncandidates would be, if approved. In particular, a drug may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as \nreflected in the drug’s approved labeling. Physicians may nevertheless prescribe such drugs to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the \napproved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. \nIt may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication \nregarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information.  Moreover, with passage of the Pre-Approval Information \nExchange Act, or PIE Act, in December 2022, sponsors of products that have not been approved may proactively communicate to payors certain \ninformation about products in development to help expedite patient access upon product approval.  Previously, such communications were permitted under \nFDA guidance but the new legislation explicitly provides protection to sponsors who convey certain information about products in development to payors, \nincluding unapproved uses of approved products.\nThe federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several \ncompanies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under \nwhich specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of our product candidates, if approved, we \ncould become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. \nRisks related to our reliance on third parties \nWe rely completely on third parties to manufacture our clinical drug supplies and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of \nany approved product candidate, and our commercialization of any of our product candidates could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if those \nthird parties fail to obtain approval of the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities, fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of drug product or fail \nto do so at acceptable quality levels or prices. \nWe do not currently have nor do we plan to acquire the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our clinical drug supplies for use in the \nconduct of our clinical trials, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. \nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory \nauthorities pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDA to the FDA or comparable applications to those foreign authorities. We \ndo not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMPs or similar \nforeign requirements for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully \nmanufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or \nmaintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain \nadequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these \nfacilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing \nfacilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. \nAny replacement of our manufacturers could require significant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified \nreplacements. In some cases, the technology required to manufacture our product candidates may be unique to the original manufacturer and we may have \ndifficulty transferring such skills or technology to another third party. The process of changing manufacturers is extensive and time consuming and could \ncause delays or interruptions in our drug development. Further, if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that \nthe new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays \nassociated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within \nbudget. \n78"

We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers. \nMoreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Although we generally do not begin a clinical \ntrial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the clinical trial, any significant delay in the supply of a product \ncandidate, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably \ndelay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to \npurchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates \nwould be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates. \nWe, or our manufacturing partners, may be unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely \nor cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition, quality issues may arise during scale-up activities. If we or our manufacturing partners are unable to \nsuccessfully scale up the manufacture of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, the development, testing and clinical trials of that product \ncandidate may be delayed or become infeasible, and marketing approval or commercial launch of any resulting product may be delayed or not obtained, \nwhich could significantly harm our business. \nWe expect to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. We have not entered into long-term agreements \nwith our current contract manufacturers or with any alternate fill/finish suppliers, and though we intend to do so prior to commercial launch in order to \nensure that we maintain adequate supplies of finished drug product, we may be unable to enter into such an agreement or do so on commercially reasonable \nterms, which could have a material adverse impact upon our business. We currently obtain our supplies of finished drug product through individual \npurchase orders. \nWe rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our preclinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their \ncontractual duties, meet rigorously enforced regulatory standards or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or \ncommercialize any of our product candidates on a timely basis or at all. \nWe currently do not have the ability to independently conduct preclinical studies that comply with the regulatory requirements known as good \nlaboratory practice, or GLP, requirements. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions require us to comply with GCP requirements for \nconducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, in order to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and \naccurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. We rely on medical institutions, clinical \ninvestigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs, to conduct GLP-compliant nonclinical studies and GCP-compliant clinical trials \non our product candidates properly and on time. While we will have agreements governing their activities, we control only certain aspects of their activities \nand have limited influence over their actual performance. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our GLP nonclinical studies and our \nGCP clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of these studies and trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. These third parties are \nnot our employees and, except for restrictions imposed by our contracts with such third parties, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of \nresources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct GLP-compliant preclinical and nonclinical studies and GCP-\ncompliant clinical trials for our product candidates, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our GLP preclinical studies and clinical trials is \nconducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and applicable laws and regulations, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of \nour regulatory responsibilities. \n79"

This could be difficult, costly or impossible, and our preclinical studies or clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed, terminated or \nrepeated. As a result we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely fashion, or at all, for the applicable product candidate, our financial \nresults and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be \ndelayed. \nWe depend on collaborations with third parties for the development of certain of our drug candidates, and we may depend on additional collaborations \nin the future for the development and commercialization of these or other potential candidates. If our collaborations are not successful, our ability to\ndevelop and commercialize our product candidates could be adversely affected. \nWe are currently collaborating with third parties to develop certain of our potential drug candidates. For example, we are collaborating with Hansoh \n(Shanghai) Healthtech Co., Ltd. and Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Company Ltd. with respect to certain aspects of TERN-701, our small-\nmolecule allosteric inhibitor of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. In the future, we may seek collaboration arrangements for the commercialization, or potentially \nfor the development, of certain of our other product candidates depending on the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves as compared to \nentering into collaboration arrangements. For example, certain of the disease areas that we believe our product candidates address require large, costly and \nlater-stage clinical trials, which a collaboration partner may be better positioned to finance and/or conduct. In addition, a component of our strategy is to \nmaximize the commercial value of our current and future product candidates, which may also strategically align with partnering commercial rights with \npartners that have large and established sales organizations. To the extent that we decide to enter into collaboration agreements, we may face significant \ncompetition for appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate, document, implement and \nmaintain and challenging to manage. We may not be successful in our efforts to enter into collaboration agreements. The terms of collaborations or other \narrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us. \nThe success of our current and future collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. \nCollaborations are subject to numerous risks, which may include risks that: \n•\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to collaborations; \n•\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew \ndevelopment or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to their acquisition of \ncompetitive products or their internal development of competitive products, availability of funding or other external factors, such as a \nbusiness combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities; \n•\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product \ncandidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing; \n•\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, drugs that compete directly or indirectly with our product \ncandidates; \n•\ncollaborators with marketing, manufacturing and distribution rights to one or more drugs may not commit sufficient resources to or otherwise \nnot perform satisfactorily in carrying out these activities; \n•\nwe could grant exclusive rights to our collaborators that would prevent us from collaborating with others; \n80"

Current or future collaborators or strategic partners may develop, either alone or with others, products in related fields that are \ncompetitive with the products or potential products that are the subject of these collaborations. \nOur current or future collaborators or strategic partners may preclude us from entering into collaborations with their competitors, fail to obtain \ntimely regulatory approvals, terminate their agreements with us prematurely or fail to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercialization \nof products.

Any of these developments could harm our \nproduct development efforts. \nRisks related to commercialization of our product candidates \nThe successful commercialization of our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities and health insurers \nestablish adequate coverage, reimbursement levels and pricing policies. Failure to obtain or maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our \nproduct candidates, if approved, could limit our ability to market those drugs and decrease our ability to generate revenue. \nThe availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health \ninsurers and other third-party payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford prescription medications such as our product candidates, assuming \nFDA approval. Our ability to achieve acceptable levels of coverage and reimbursement for products by governmental authorities, private health insurers \nand other organizations will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Assuming we obtain coverage for our \nproduct candidates by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find \nunacceptably high. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement in the United States, the European Economic Area, or EEA, or elsewhere will be \navailable for our product candidates or any product that we may develop, and any reimbursement that may become available may be decreased or \neliminated. \n81"

      "text": "Third-party payors increasingly are challenging prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services, and many third-party payors may refuse to \nprovide coverage and reimbursement for particular drugs or biologics when an equivalent generic drug, biosimilar or a less expensive therapy is available. \nIt is possible that a third-party payor may consider our product candidates as substitutable and only offer to reimburse patients for the less expensive drug. \nEven if we show improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration with our product candidates, pricing of existing third-party therapeutics \nmay limit the amount we will be able to charge for our product candidates. These payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of a given product \nor establish prices for new or existing marketed products at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in our \nproduct candidates. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be even more \nchallenging given third party payor price sensitivity to high-cost therapeutics (including oncology and other specialty medicines). Additionally, separate \nreimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician \nutilization. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates, \nand may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on our product candidates. \nNo uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and \nreimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and \ncostly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance \nthat coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding \nreimbursement change frequently, in some cases on short notice, and such changes also may significantly impact the coverage and reimbursement levels for \nour products. \nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and \nwe believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and other countries have and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and \nusage of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national \nhealth systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products, and instead monitor and control company profits. Additional \nforeign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in \nmarkets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our product candidates may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient \nto generate commercially-reasonable revenue and profits. \nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause \nsuch organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide \nadequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our product candidates due to the \ntrend toward managed health care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure \non healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and biologics and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become and remains intense. \nAs a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. \nEven if our current or future product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may fail to achieve the broad degree of physician and patient\nadoption and use necessary for commercial success. \nEven if one or more of our product candidates receive FDA or other regulatory approvals, the commercial success of any of our current or future \nproduct candidates will depend significantly on the broad adoption and use of the resulting product by physicians and patients for approved indications. \nGiven the number of drugs commercially available or in development for the treatment of CML, NASH, obesity, and other indications we may pursue, if \nwe are unsuccessful in achieving a differentiated profile with our product candidates based on efficacy, safety and tolerability, dosing and administration, \nmarket acceptance may be limited. Our product candidates may not be commercially successful for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, \ncompetitive factors, pricing or physician preference, reimbursement by insurers, the degree and rate of physician and patient adoption of our current or \nfuture product candidates.

      "text": "Enacted and future healthcare legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product \ncandidates and may affect the prices we may set. \nIn the United States, the EEA and other jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and \nregulatory changes and proposed changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and \ncontinue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of healthcare. For \nexample, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively \nthe ACA, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the \nACA, those of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries include the following: \n•\nan annual, non-deductible fee payable by any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents \n(other than those designated as orphan drugs), which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain \ngovernment healthcare programs; \n•\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated \nprices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient \ndrugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; \n•\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the \naverage manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively; \n•\na new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are \ninhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; \n•\nextension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care \norganizations; and \n•\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain \nindividuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate \nliability. \nSince its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court \ndismissed a judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will \nremain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special \nenrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021. \nThe executive order instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, \nincluding among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements and policies that create \nunnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. \nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget \nControl Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, \ndue to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 (with a 1% payment reduction from April 1 to June 30, 2022), unless additional action is \ntaken by Congress. Additionally, under Statutory PAYGO, the Administration is required to issue a sequestration order (capped at 4% for Medicare \npayments) if the PAYGO scorecard shows a net cost at the end of a Congressional session. Although Statutory PAYGO was expected to be triggered at the \nend of the 2021 Congressional session, subsequent legislation has delayed a Statutory PAYGO sequestration order until after 2024. In January 2013, the \nAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, \nincluding hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover \noverpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws or any other similar laws introduced in the future may result in additional reductions in \nMedicare and other health care funding, which could negatively affect our future customers and accordingly, our financial operations. Indeed, under current \nlegislation, the actual reductions in Medicare payments may vary up to 4%.\n87"

      "text": "The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent \nCongressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to \npharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare \nand Medicaid. In 2020 President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these \norders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that \nwould tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, \neffective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to \nincorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries’ access to evidence-based care.\nIn addition, in October 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other \nentities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is \ncurrently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico and New Hampshire) have passed laws \nallowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, \nHHS finalized a regulation that would eliminate the current safe harbor for Medicare drug rebates and create new safe harbors for beneficiary point-of-sale \ndiscounts and pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM, service fees. It originally was set to go into effect on January 1, 2022, but with passage of the Inflation \nReduction Act has been delayed by Congress to January 1, 2032.\nIn September 2021, acting pursuant to an executive order signed by President Biden, HHS released its plan to reduce pharmaceutical prices. The key \nfeatures of that plan are to: (a) make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers and throughout the health care system by \nsupporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with manufacturers; (b) improve and promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical \nindustry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs and increase transparency; and (c) foster \nscientific innovation to promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives \npromote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments.\nMore recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law by President Biden.  The new legislation has \nimplications for Medicare Part D, which is a program available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give \nthem the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain \ndrugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under \nMedicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount \nprogram with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025).  The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through \nguidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years.\nSpecifically, with respect to price negotiations, Congress authorized Medicare to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-source drug and \nbiologic products that do not have competing generics or biosimilars and are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D.  CMS may negotiate prices for \nten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in 2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028 and 20 Part B or \nPart D drugs in 2029 and beyond.  This provision applies to drug products that have been approved for at least 9 years and biologics that have been licensed \nfor 13 years, but it does not apply to drugs and biologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition.  Nonetheless, since CMS may\nestablish a maximum price for these products in price negotiations, we would be fully at risk of government action if our products are the subject of \nMedicare price negotiations.  Moreover, given the risk that could be the case, these provisions of the IRA may also further heighten the risk that we would \nnot be able to achieve the expected return on our drug products or full value of our patents protecting our products if prices are set after such products have \nbeen on the market for nine years.   \n88"

      "text": "Further, the legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by \noffering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The \nlegislation also requires manufacturers to pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps Medicare \nout-of-pocket drug costs at an estimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at $2,000 a year.  In addition, the IRA potentially raises \nlegal risks with respect to individuals participating in a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan who may experience a gap in coverage if they required \ncoverage above their initial annual coverage limit before they reached the higher threshold, or “catastrophic period” of the plan. Individuals requiring \nservices exceeding the initial annual coverage limit and below the catastrophic period, must pay 100% of the cost of their prescriptions until they reach the \ncatastrophic period. Among other things, the IRA contains many provisions aimed at reducing this financial burden on individuals by reducing the co-\ninsurance and co-payment costs, expanding eligibility for lower income subsidy plans and price caps on annual out-of-pocket expenses, each of which \ncould have potential pricing and reporting implications.\nAccordingly, while it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated, we cannot predict with certainty what impact any federal or state health \nreforms will have on us, but such changes could impose new or more stringent regulatory requirements on our activities or result in reduced reimbursement \nfor our products, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIndividual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control \npharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and \nmarketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. \nLegally-mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial \ncondition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what \npharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate \ndemand for our product candidates or put pressure on our product pricing. \nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action in the \nUnited States or any other jurisdiction. If we or any third parties we may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the \nadoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our product candidates may lose any \nregulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. \nIf the market opportunities for any product candidate that we or our strategic collaborators develop are smaller than we believe they are, our revenue \nmay be adversely affected and our business may suffer. \nWe intend to initially focus our product candidate development on therapies for the treatment of serious diseases such as CML, NASH and obesity. \nOur projections of addressable patient populations that have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates are based on estimates. \nThese estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations or market research, \nand may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients may turn \nout to be lower than expected. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for our product candidates may not ultimately be amenable to \ntreatment with our product candidates. Our market opportunity may also be limited by future competitor treatments that enter the market. If any of our \nestimates are inaccurate, the market opportunities for any of our product candidates could be significantly diminished and have an adverse material impact \non our business. \n89"

If any third-\nparty patents or other intellectual property rights are found to cover our product candidates or their compositions, methods of use or manufacturing, we may \nbe required to pay damages, which could be substantial, and we would not be free to manufacture or market our product candidates or to do so without \nobtaining a license, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Regardless of merits, intellectual property disputes can be \ncostly to defend, time-consuming and may cause our business, operating results and financial condition to suffer. \nWe operate in an industry with extensive intellectual property litigation. As the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries \nexpand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that there may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our products and technology of which \nwe are not aware or that we may need to challenge to continue our operations as currently contemplated. \nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to intellectual property with respect to our product candidates \nand technologies we use in our business. We may face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property \nrights of third parties, including patents held by our competitors or by non-practicing entities. Litigation may make it necessary to defend ourselves by \ndetermining the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary rights. Interference or derivation \nproceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, may be necessary to \ndetermine the priority of inventions or establish proprietary rights with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. Regardless of \nwhether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have merit, the claims can be time consuming, divert management \nattention and financial resources and are costly to evaluate and defend. Results of any such litigation are difficult to predict and may require us to cease \ndeveloping, manufacturing, or commercializing the infringing product candidate, stop treating certain conditions, obtain licenses or modify our drugs or \ncombination therapies and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes, or may result in significant settlement costs. For example, litigation can \ninvolve substantial damages for infringement, and if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the \npatent owner’s attorneys’ fees. We may also be prohibited from selling or licensing our product candidates unless the third party licenses rights to us, which \nit is not required to do at a commercially reasonable price or at all. If a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or \nupfront fees or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our product candidates. \nAlthough we have reviewed certain third-party patents and patent applications that we believe may be relevant to certain of our product candidates, \nwe have not conducted a freedom-to-operate search or analysis for all of our product candidates. As such, we may not be aware of patents or pending or \nfuture patent applications that, if issued, would block us from commercializing our product candidates. Thus, we cannot guarantee that our product \ncandidates, or our commercialization thereof, do not and will not infringe any third party’s intellectual property. \n90"

      "text": "In addition, patent applications in the United States and many international jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after the filing of \ncertain priority documents (or, in some cases, are not published until they issue as patents) and publications in the scientific literature often lag behind \nactual discoveries. Claims in patent applications can also be revised before issuance. Therefore, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent \napplications or made public disclosures relating to our technology or our contemplated technology. A third party may have filed, and may in the future file, \npatent applications covering our product candidates or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent \napplications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent \napplication on inventions similar to ours, depending on whether the timing of the filing date falls under certain patent laws, we may have to participate in a \npriority contest (such as an interference proceeding) declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of patent \nlitigation and other proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if it is determined that the other party had \nindependently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such \ninvention. \nThe coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we were sued for patent \ninfringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent \nclaims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be successful in doing so. Proving invalidity or unenforceability is difficult. For example, in the United \nStates, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if \nwe believe third-party intellectual property claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, \nvalidity, or enforceability. \nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can. Even if resolved in our favor, \nlitigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and \nmanagement personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other \ninterim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on \nthe price of our common stock. Any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our \nability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. \nThere can be no assurance with respect to the outcome of any future litigation brought by or against us, and the outcome of any such litigation could \nhave a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and outcomes are \nuncertain. Further, as the costs and outcome of these types of claims and proceedings can vary significantly, it is difficult to estimate potential losses that \nmay occur. Such claims and proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or \nany future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings \nadequately. Accordingly, we are unable at this time to estimate the effects of these potential future lawsuits on our financial condition, operations or cash \nflows. \n91"

In addition, such agreements may not be self-executing such that the intellectual property subject to such agreements may not be \nassigned to us without additional assignments being executed, and we may fail to obtain such assignments. In addition, such agreements may be breached. \nAccordingly, we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us to determine the ownership of what we \nregard as our intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable \nintellectual property. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a \ndistraction to our senior management and scientific personnel, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of \noperations and prospects. \nIf we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection directed to our current and any future technologies that we develop, \nothers may be able to make, use or sell products substantially the same as ours, which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market. \nThe market for pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Our success depends, in \npart, upon our ability to maintain a competitive position in the development and protection of technologies and any future product candidates for use in \nthese fields and upon our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights. We seek to obtain and maintain patents and other \nintellectual property rights to restrict the ability of others to market products that misappropriate our technology and/or infringe our intellectual property to \nunfairly and illegally compete with any of our product candidates. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our \ncompetitive position and our business could be harmed, as third parties may be able to make, use or sell products that are substantially the same as any \nproduct candidates we may sell without incurring the sizeable development and, in some cases, licensing costs that we have incurred, which would \nadversely affect our ability to compete in the market. We use a combination of patents, trademarks, know-how, confidentiality procedures and contractual \nprovisions to protect our proprietary technology and that of our licensors. However, these protections may not be adequate and may not provide us with any \ncompetitive advantage. For example, patents may not issue from any of our or our licensors’ currently pending or any future patent applications, and our or \nour licensors’ issued patents and any future patents that may issue may not survive legal challenges to their scope, validity or enforceability or provide \nsignificant protection for us. \nTo protect our proprietary position, we generally file patent applications in the United States and in certain foreign countries related to our product \ncandidates that we consider important to our business. The patent application and approval process is expensive, time-consuming and complex. We may not \nbe able to file, prosecute and maintain all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions. It is \nalso possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. \nMoreover, depending on the terms of any future license or collaboration agreements to which we may become a party, we may not have the right to control \nthe preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology licensed from third parties. Therefore, these \npatents and patent applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. \nFurthermore, the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain. No consistent policy regarding the \nbreadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States or in many foreign jurisdictions. The \nstandards applied by the USPTO and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. In addition, the \ndetermination of patent rights with respect to biological and pharmaceutical products commonly involves complex legal and factual questions, which have \nin recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are \nhighly uncertain. Thus, we cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patents, whether any issued patents \nwill be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties or whether any issued patents will effectively prevent others from \ncommercializing competing technologies and product candidates. \n92"

Like patents, trademarks also may be successfully opposed or \nchallenged. \nWe cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or unauthorized reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover,\nthird parties may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours and such competitive technologies may or may not infringe our \nintellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on the success of any legal actions we may take against these \ninfringers in the respective country or forum, but these actions may not be successful.

There may be prior public disclosures or other art that could be \ndeemed to invalidate one or more of our patent claims. Further, we may not develop additional proprietary technologies in the future, and, if we do, they \nmay not be patentable. \nWe may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses in relation to obtaining intellectual property, enforcing intellectual \nproperty and/or defending intellectual property, which could affect operating expenses.

      "text": "We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and \nunsuccessful. Further, our issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court. \nCompetitors may infringe our intellectual property rights or those of our licensors. To prevent infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required \nto file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one or \nmore patent of ours or any of our current licensors or future licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, in whole or in part, or may refuse to stop the other \nparty from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our or our licensors’ patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any \nlitigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our or our licensors’ patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, which may \ncurtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products, and could put our or our licensors’ patent \napplications at risk of not issuing. If we or any of our potential future collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a \npatent directed at our products, the defendant could counterclaim that our or our licensors’ patent is invalid and/or unenforceable in whole or in part. In \npatent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity \nchallenge include an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for \nan unenforceability assertion could also include an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the \nUSPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar validity claims before the USPTO in post-grant \nproceedings such as ex parte reexaminations, inter partes review or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar proceedings outside the United States, in \nparallel with litigation or even outside the context of litigation. \nIf a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability of our or our licensors’ patents covering one of our product \ncandidates, we could lose a part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection covering such candidate. Competing products may also be sold in other countries \nin which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit, alleging our infringement of a competitor’s patents, we \ncould be prevented from marketing our products in one or more foreign countries. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business \nposition, business prospects and financial condition. \nThe outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable, and prior art could render our patents or those of our \nlicensors invalid. Similar mechanisms for challenging the validity and enforceability of a patent exist in ex-U.S. patent offices and may result in the\nrevocation, cancellation, or amendment of any ex-U.S. patents we hold in the future. For the patents and patent applications that we may license in the \nfuture, we may have limited or no right to participate in the defense of any licensed patents against challenge by a third party. If a defendant were to prevail \non a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product candidate. \nSuch a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nEven if we establish infringement, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only \nmonetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with \nintellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. \nThere could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or \ninvestors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. \nWe may not be able to prevent, alone or with our potential licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries \nwhere the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. \nOur defense of litigation or interference or other intellectual property proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs \nand distract our management and other employees. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license \nrights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms or \nat all, or if a non-exclusive license is offered and our competitors gain access to the same technology. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license \nnecessary technology from third parties or enter into development or manufacturing partnerships that would help us bring our products to market. \n94"

Certain countries require the consent of all joint owners to license jointly owned patents, \nand if we are unable to obtain such consent from the joint owner, we may not be able to license our rights under these patents and patent applications. In \ncertain other countries, including the United States, the joint owner could license its rights under these patents and patent applications to another party \nwithout our consent and without any duty of accounting to us. \n95"

Any exercise of such rights, including with respect to any such required sublicense of these \nlicenses could result in the loss of significant rights and could harm our ability to commercialize licensed products. \nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property. \nWe may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property \nas an inventor or co-inventor or owner. The failure to name the proper inventors on a patent application can result in the patents issuing thereon being \nunenforceable.

Many of these consultants, and many of our employees, were previously employed at, or may have previously \nprovided or may be currently providing consulting services to, universities or other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies including our competitors \nor potential competitors. These employees and consultants may have executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or \nsimilar agreements, in connection with such other current or previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not \nuse the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us and seek assurances that they will not, we may become subject to claims that \nwe, our employees or a consultant inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other information proprietary to their former employers or \ntheir former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in successfully defending any such claims, in addition \nto paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business. Such intellectual property could \nbe awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or drugs and combination \ntherapies. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management \nteam. Any of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. \nWe have a number of patents and patent applications in foreign countries, and expect to continue to pursue patent protection in many of the \nsignificant markets in which we intend to do business. However, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout \nthe world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal \nand state laws in the United States. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly in developing countries. In addition, any \nfuture intellectual property license agreements may not always include worldwide rights. Consequently, we have not pursued or maintained, and may not \npursue or maintain in the future, patent protection for our product candidates in every country or territory in which we may sell our drugs and combination \ntherapies and we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or \nimporting products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions \nwhere we have not obtained or maintained patent protection to develop their own products, and may export otherwise infringing products to territories \nwhere we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States and where our ability to enforce our patents to stop infringing\nactivities may be inadequate. These products may compete with any current or future product candidates we may sell, and our patents or other intellectual \nproperty rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. \nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal \nsystems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protections, \nparticularly those relating to pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the \nmarketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. \n97"

Additionally, the laws of some countries outside of the United States and Europe do not afford intellectual property \nprotection to the same extent as the laws of the United States and Europe. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and \ndefending intellectual property and proprietary rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, including, for example, India, the \nPeople’s Republic of China, which we refer to as China or PRC, and other developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other \nintellectual property or proprietary rights, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the \ninfringement, misappropriation or other violation of our patents or other intellectual property or proprietary rights. For example, many foreign countries \nhave compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties \nfrom practicing our inventions in certain countries outside the United States and Europe. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents \nagainst government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish \nthe value of such patent. If we are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may \nbe impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected. \nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other \naspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could \nprovoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, \nmay not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a \nsignificant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. \nWe may not identify relevant third-party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a third-party patent, which might \nadversely affect our ability to develop and market our single-agent and combination therapies. \nWe cannot guarantee that any of our patent searches or analyses, including the identification of relevant patents or patent applications, the scope of \npatent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough, nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every third-party patent \nand pending patent application in the United States and abroad that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates in any \njurisdiction. The scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent’s prosecution history. \nOur interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending patent application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to\nmarket our product candidates. We may incorrectly determine that our product candidates are not covered by a third-party patent or may incorrectly predict \nwhether a third-party’s pending patent application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the \nUnited States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidates. \nOur failure to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents or patent applications may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product \ncandidates. \nOne aspect of the determination of patentability of our inventions depends on the scope and content of the “prior art,” information that was or is\ndeemed available to a person of skill in the relevant art prior to the priority date of the claimed invention. There may be prior art of which we are not aware \nthat may affect the patentability of our patent claims or, if issued, affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim. Further, we may not be aware of all \nthird-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates or their intended uses, and as a result the impact of such third-party \nintellectual property rights upon the patentability of our own patents and patent applications, as well as the impact of such third-party intellectual property \nupon our freedom to operate, is highly uncertain. Because patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for typically a \nperiod of 18 months after filing, or may not be published at all, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our \nproduct candidates. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Furthermore, for \nU.S. applications in which all claims are entitled to a priority date before March 2013, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party or \ninstituted by the USPTO to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. For U.S. \npatents and patent applications containing a claim not entitled to priority before March 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law in view \nof the passage of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the AIA, which brought into effect significant changes to the U.S. patent laws, including new \nprocedures for challenging pending patent applications and issued patents. \n98"

      "text": "Patent terms may be inadequate to establish our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time. \nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years \nfrom its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Patent terms may be shortened or lengthened by, for example, terminal disclaimers, patent term \nadjustments, supplemental protection certificates and patent term extensions, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Non-payment \nor delay in payment of patent fees, maintenance fees or annuities, delay in patent filings or delay in extension filings (including any patent term extension \nor adjustment filings), whether intentional or unintentional, may result in the loss of patent rights important to our business. Even if patents covering our \nproduct candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product candidate, we may be open to competition from competitive medications, \nincluding generic versions. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents \ndirected towards such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and \nlicensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing product candidates similar or identical to ours for \na meaningful amount of time, or at all. \nDepending upon the timing, duration and conditions of any FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our owned or \nlicensed U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or \nHatch-Waxman Act and similar legislation in the EU and certain other jurisdictions. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits, in certain cases, a patent term \nextension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the \nFDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review \nprocess, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. \nMoreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. Only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension cannot extend the \ntotal patent term beyond 14 years from approval, and the amount of available extension to any extension-eligible patent which claims a product, a method \nof using a product or a method of manufacturing a product, depends on a variety of factors, including the date on which the patent issues and certain dates \nrelated to the regulatory review period. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period \nduring which we can enforce our patent rights for the applicable product candidate will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market \ncompeting products sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage \nof our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and nonclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the \ncase, and our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed. \nFurther, there are detailed rules and requirements regarding the patents that may be submitted to the FDA for listing in the Orange Book. We may be \nunable to obtain patents covering our product candidates that contain one or more claims that satisfy the requirements for listing in the Orange Book. Even\nif we submit a patent for listing in the Orange Book, the FDA may decline to list the patent, or a manufacturer of generic drugs may challenge the listing. If \none of our product candidates is approved and a patent covering that product candidate is not listed in the Orange Book, a manufacturer of generic drugs \nwould not have to provide advance notice to us of any abbreviated new drug application filed with the FDA to obtain permission to sell a generic version of \nsuch product candidate. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \n99"

      "text": "Obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other \nrequirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these \nrequirements. \nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and \nother provisions during the patent process. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or \npatent applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the \nlifetime of the patents and/or patent applications. We employ reputable professionals and rely on such third parties to help us comply with these \nrequirements and effect payment of these fees with respect to the patents and patent applications that we own, and we may have to rely upon our licensors\nto comply with these requirements and effect payment of these fees with respect to any patents and patent applications that we license. In many cases, an \ninadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which \nnoncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant \njurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case. \nChanges in patent law in the United States or in other countries could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect \nour product candidates. \nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and \nenforcing patents in the pharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly, time consuming and inherently \nuncertain. Our patent rights may be affected by developments or uncertainty in U.S. or ex-U.S. patent statutes, patent case laws in USPTO rules and \nregulations or in the rules and regulations of ex-U.S. patent offices. There are a number of changes to the U.S. patent laws that may have a significant \nimpact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, in September 2011, the AIA, was signed into law. \nThe AIA includes provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and affect patent litigation. In particular, under the AIA, the United \nStates transitioned in March 2013 to a “first to file” system in which the first inventor to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. Third parties are \nallowed to submit prior art before the issuance of a patent by the USPTO, and may become involved in post-grant proceedings including opposition, \nderivation, reexamination, inter partes review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse \ndetermination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope or enforceability of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could \nadversely affect our competitive position. This could have a negative impact on some of our intellectual property and could increase uncertainties \nsurrounding obtaining and enforcement or defense of our issued patents. \nIn addition, Congress may pass patent reform legislation that is unfavorable to us. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in \nrecent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain \nsituations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty \nwith respect to the value of patents once obtained. Depending on decisions by Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations \ngoverning patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents we \nmight obtain in the future. Similarly, statutory or judicial changes to the patent laws of other countries may increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding \nthe prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent \nlaws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by U.S. and international legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect the patents \nand patent applications of our licensors, our existing or future patents and patent applications and our ability to obtain additional patents in the future. \nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage. \nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may \nnot adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example: \n•\nothers may be able to make product candidates that are similar to ours but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or \nhave exclusively licensed; \n100"

In the event that Mr. Sundaram is no longer able to perform his duties as chief \nexecutive officer, we will be required to identify, recruit, hire and integrate a new chief executive officer. While our board of directors has reviewed and \ncontinues to review potential interim and longer-term contingency plans that could be activated as needed to minimize business disruption and to ensure the \ncontinued execution of our business priorities, the recruitment of a new chief executive officer can be and is often lengthy and distracting. In addition, we \nmay be required to implement temporary or interim executive management to support the leadership of our company during a transition period. A change in \nthe leadership of the company is a significant event and may result in additional volatility in our stock price.\nCompetition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology field is intense due to the limited number of \nindividuals who possess the knowledge, skills and experience required by our industry. We will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our clinical \ndevelopment and, if we initiate commercial activities, establish newly created roles at the leadership and operational levels. We may not be able to attract \nand retain quality personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations \nthat they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their \nresearch output. \nWe will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth. \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 46 full-time employees. We will need to continue to expand our managerial, operational, finance and other \nresources in order to manage our operations and clinical trials, continue our development activities and, if approved, commercialize our preclinical and \nclinical-stage product candidates or any future product candidates. Our management and personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be \nadequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively execute our growth strategy requires that we: \n•\nmanage our preclinical studies and clinical trials effectively; \n•\nidentify, recruit, retain, incentivize, train and integrate additional employees, including additional clinical development and sales personnel; \n•\nmanage our internal development and operational efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to third parties; and \n•\ncontinue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reports systems and procedures. \nIf we are not successful in identifying, developing and/or commercializing product candidates in CML, NASH, obesity, and other serious diseases, our \nability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired. \nAlthough the development and commercialization of our existing pipeline of product candidates in CML, NASH, and obesity are currently our \nprimary focus, as part of our longer-term growth strategy, we plan to evaluate the development and commercialization of our product candidates to address \nserious diseases beyond those. The success of this strategy depends primarily upon our ability to identify and validate new applications for our existing \npipeline and new therapeutic candidates in therapeutic areas of interest, and to identify, develop and commercialize new drugs and biologics. Our research \nefforts may initially show promise in discovering potential new therapeutic areas or new drugs and biologics, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical \ndevelopment for a number of reasons, including: \n•\nwe may need to rely on third parties to generate molecules for some of our product candidate programs; \n•\nwe may encounter drug manufacturing difficulties that limit yield or produce undesirable characteristics that increase the cost of \nmanufacturing our product candidates, cause delays or make our product candidates unmarketable; \n•\nour product candidates may cause adverse effects in patients or subjects, even after successful initial toxicology studies, which may make the \nproduct candidates unmarketable; \n•\nour product candidates may not demonstrate a meaningful benefit to patients or subjects; and \n102"

Future research programs to identify new \napplications for our existing pipeline or to identify new product candidates in therapeutic areas of interest may require substantial technical, financial and \nhuman resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential therapeutic areas, programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be \nunsuccessful. \nOur product candidates may require additional, time-consuming development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical studies, clinical \ntrials and approval by the FDA and/or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to the risks of failure that are inherent in \npharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval \nby regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure you that any such products that are approved will be manufactured or produced economically, be \nsuccessfully commercialized, be widely accepted in the marketplace, or be more effective than other commercially available alternatives. \nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our current or \nfuture product candidates. \nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we \ncommercialize any single-agent or combination therapies. For example, we may be sued if any drug we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be \notherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in \nmanufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and breach of warranty. Claims could also \nbe asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial \nliabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and \nmanagement resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: \n•\ndecreased demand for our current or future product candidates; \n•\ninjury to our reputation; \n•\ndelay or termination of clinical trials; \n•\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants; \n•\ncosts to defend the related litigation; \n•\ndiversion of management’s time and our resources; \n•\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; \n•\nregulatory investigations, product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; \n•\nloss of revenue; and \n•\nthe inability to commercialize our current or any future product candidates, if approved. \n103"

We and any third-party manufacturers and \nsuppliers are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, including those \ngoverning laboratory procedures; the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous and regulated materials and wastes; the \nemission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air and water; and employee health and safety. Our operations and those or our third-party \nmanufacturers and CROs involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. Our \noperations and those of our third-party manufacturers and CROs also produce hazardous waste. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various \nwastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers’ and CROs’ facilities pending their use and disposal. We generally contract with \nthird parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our \ncommercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations and environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities \nunder applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. \nWe cannot guarantee that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers and CROs for handling and disposing of these materials \ncomply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, nor can we eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these \nmaterials. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our current or past facilities and at \nthird-party facilities. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources, and state or federal or \nother applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and \nregulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain \nof our future compliance. \nCompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations change regularly and may be expensive and difficult to execute effectively, and \ncurrent or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research and product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the \nrisk of accidental injury or contamination from hazardous materials or wastes. Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs \nand expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate \ncoverage against potential liabilities. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property, casualty and general \nliability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. \nAccordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, \nand our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and \nfinancial condition. \n105"

      "text": "Actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could \nadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \nThe global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we and our partners and vendors are or may become subject to various federal, state \nand foreign laws, regulations and requirements governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention and security of personal information, such as information \nthat we may collect in connection with clinical trials. Implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable \nfuture, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, standards, or perception of their requirements may have on our business. This \nevolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal \ninformation, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of \ncompliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with \nfederal, state or foreign laws or regulations, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing our processing of personal information could \nresult in negative publicity, government investigations and enforcement actions, claims by third parties and damage to our reputation, any of which could \nhave a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business. \nIn the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy laws and \nfederal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal \ninformation could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, most healthcare providers, including research institutions from \nwhich we obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under HIPAA, as amended by the Health \nInformation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009. Under HIPAA, we could potentially face substantial criminal or civil penalties if \nwe knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered healthcare provider or research institution that has not satisfied \nHIPAA’s requirements for disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or otherwise violate applicable HIPAA requirements related to the \nprotection of such information. Even when HIPAA does not apply, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may \nconstitute a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. \nIn addition, we may maintain sensitive personally identifiable information, including health information, that we receive throughout the clinical trial \nprocess, in the course of our research collaborations and directly from individuals (or their healthcare providers) who enroll in our patient assistance \nprograms. As such, we may be subject to state laws requiring notification of affected individuals and state regulators in the event of a breach of personal \ninformation. In 2018 California passed into law the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020, and imposed many \nrequirements on businesses that process the personal information of California residents. Many of the CCPA’s requirements are similar to those found in the \nGeneral Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, including requiring businesses to provide notice to data subjects regarding the information collected \nabout them and how such information is used and shared, and providing data subjects the right to request access to such personal information and, in certain \ncases, request the erasure of such personal information. The CCPA also affords California residents the right to opt-out of “sales” of their personal \ninformation. The CCPA contains significant penalties for companies that violate its requirements. In November 2020 California voters passed a ballot \ninitiative for the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, which went into effect on January 1, 2023, and significantly expanded the CCPA to \nincorporate additional GDPR-like provisions including requiring that the use, retention, and sharing of personal information of California residents be \nreasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes of collection or processing, granting additional protections for sensitive personal information, and \nrequiring greater disclosures related to notice to residents regarding retention of information. The CPRA also created a new enforcement agency – the \nCalifornia Privacy Protection Agency – whose sole responsibility is to enforce the CPRA, which will further increase compliance risk. The provisions in \nthe CPRA may apply to some of our business activities. In addition, other states, including Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut, already have passed \nstate privacy laws. Virginia’s privacy law also went into effect on January 1, 2023, and the laws in the other three states will go into effect later in the year. \nOther states will be considering these laws in the future, and Congress has also been debating passing a federal privacy law. These laws may impact our \nbusiness activities, including our identification of research subjects, relationships with business partners and ultimately the marketing and distribution of \nour products.\n106"

      "text": "Any clinical trial programs and research collaborations, among other activities, that we engage in outside the United States may implicate \ninternational data protection laws, including, in the EEA, the GDPR, which became effective in 2018. The GDPR imposes stringent operational \nrequirements for processors and controllers of personal data. Among other things, the GDPR requires covered companies to provide detailed notices and to \nabide by consent requirements for clinical trial subjects and other data subjects, to follow procedures regarding the security of personal data and notification \nof data processing obligations or security incidents to appropriate data protection authorities or data subjects, and to honor and provide certain privacy \nrights to individuals within the EEA, including the right to access, correct and delete their personal data. If our privacy or data security measures fail to \ncomply with the requirements of the GDPR or other applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement \nnotices and/or enforcement actions requiring us to change the way we use personal data and/or fines. In addition to statutory enforcement, a personal data \nbreach can lead to negative publicity and a potential loss of business. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations \nand risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of \nthe annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, we have had to comply with the GDPR and \nthe United Kingdom GDPR, or UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK\nGDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e. fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the \nUnited Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data\nprotection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the \nUnited Kingdom, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the United Kingdom without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy \ndecision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews or extends that decision. \nAmong other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide \nadequate protection to such personal data, including the United States; in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, invalidated the \nEU-US Privacy Shield Framework, or Privacy Shield for purposes of international transfers and imposed further restrictions on the use of standard \ncontractual clauses, or SCCs. The European Commission issued revised SCCs on June 4, 2021 to account for the decision of the CJEU and \nrecommendations made by the European Data Protection Board. The revised SCCs must be used for relevant new data transfers from September 27, 2021. \nThere is also some uncertainty around whether the revised clauses can be used for all types of data transfers, particularly whether they can be relied on for \ndata transfers to non-EEA entities subject to the GDPR. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including \ncircumstances where the SCCs cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory \ninvestigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could \naffect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely \naffect our financial results. \nThe new SCCs apply only to the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA and not the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has its own \nguidance for data transfers to other jurisdictions that are not covered by an “adequacy” decision (which includes the United States) and recently adopted the \ninternational data transfer agreement, which can serve as a basis for companies to lawfully transfer outside of the United Kingdom.\nAdditionally, in October 2022 President Biden signed an executive order to implement the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, which would serve as \na replacement to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The European Commission initiated the process to adopt an adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy\nFramework in December 2022. It is unclear if and when the framework will be finalized and whether it will be challenged in court. The uncertainty around \nthis issue may further impact our business operations and activities in the European Union (and potentially the United Kingdom and Switzerland, if they \nalso become subject to a similar data transfer framework).\n107"

We will likely be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure \nongoing compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights, failed to comply with \napplicable laws or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend, and could result \nin adverse publicity that could harm our business. Moreover, even if we take all necessary action to comply with regulatory requirements, we could be \nsubject to a hack or data breach, which could subject us to fines and penalties, as well as reputational damage. \nIf we or our partners or vendors fail to comply with applicable federal, state, or local regulatory requirements, we could be subject to a range of \nregulatory actions that could affect our or any collaborators’ ability to seek to commercialize our clinical candidates. Any threatened or actual government \nenforcement action could also generate adverse publicity and require that we devote substantial resources that could otherwise be used in other aspects of \nour business. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters, and our business continuity and \ndisaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. \nOur corporate headquarters and other facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has experienced both severe earthquakes and the \neffects of wildfires.

Earthquakes, wildfires or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and could \nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \nIf a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that damaged critical infrastructure or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be \ndifficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans \nwe have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial \nexpenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of \nearthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business. \nFurthermore, integral parties in our supply chain are similarly vulnerable to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events. \nIf such an event were to affect our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. \nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems, breaches of data security and other incidents could materially adversely affect our business, \nresults of operations and financial condition. \nWe collect and maintain information in digital and other forms that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent on \ninformation technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit large \namounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. It is critical that we do so \nin a secure manner to maintain the privacy, security, confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We have established physical, electronic \nand organizational measures designed to safeguard and secure our systems to prevent a data compromise, and rely on commercially available systems, \nsoftware, tools and monitoring to provide security for our information technology systems and the processing, transmission and storage of digital \ninformation. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result a number of third-party vendors may have \naccess to our confidential information. Our internal information technology systems and infrastructure, and those of any future collaborators and our \ncontractors, consultants, vendors and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage or unauthorized access or use resulting from computer \nviruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, denial or \ndegradation of service attacks, ransomware, hacking, phishing and other social engineering attacks, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization \nor persons with access to systems inside our organization. \n108"

The prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information also increases the risk of lost or \nstolen devices, security incidents and data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information or other intellectual property. As a \nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may face increased risks of a security breach or disruption due to our reliance on internet technology and the number \nof our employees who worked remotely and are continuing to work remotely, may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit \nvulnerabilities. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and often are not \nrecognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also \nexperience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. \nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are \nvulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. Although we do not believe that we have experienced any material system failure or \nsecurity breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations or those of our third-party CROs, vendors and other \ncontractors and consultants, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of \nclinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to \nrecover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on our third-party research institution collaborators for research and development of our product \ncandidates and other third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and to conduct clinical trials and similar events relating to their computer \nsystems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage \nto, our data or applications, or those of our third-party CROs, vendors and other contractors and consultants, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or \nproprietary information or patient information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could \nbe delayed. \nWe cannot assure you that our data protection efforts and our investment in information technology will prevent significant breakdowns, data \nleakages, breaches in our systems, or those of our third-party CROs, vendors and other contractors and consultants, or other cyber incidents that could have \na material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations or financial condition. Any security incident or disruption event that leads to \nunauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our clinical trial subjects or employees, could \nharm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective \naction and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could result in \nsignificant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. The costs related to \nsignificant security breaches or disruptions could also be material and exceed the limits of any applicable insurance we may maintain against such risks. If \nthe information technology systems of our third-party CROs, vendors and other contractors and consultants become subject to disruptions or security \nbreaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third parties and we may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an \nevent, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring.\nIn addition, we have and will enter into collaboration, license, contract research and/or manufacturing relationships with contract organizations that \noperate in certain countries that are at heightened risk of theft of technology, data and intellectual property through direct intrusion by private parties or \nforeign actors, including those affiliated with or controlled by state actors. Accordingly, our efforts to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights \naround the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license, and we may be \nat heightened risk of losing our proprietary intellectual property rights around the world, including outside of such countries, to the extent such theft or \nintrusion destroy the proprietary nature of our intellectual property. \n \n109"

Any failure of our technology or systems could result in an adverse \nimpact on our business. \nWe are subject to United States and foreign anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with \nsuch laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the United States domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the United States Travel Act, the USA \nPATRIOT Act and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws \nare interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, third-party intermediaries, joint venture partners and collaborators from \nauthorizing, promising, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We may have \ndirect or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. \nIn addition, we may engage third party intermediaries to promote our clinical research activities abroad and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses and \nother regulatory approvals. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, \nrepresentatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities.\nNoncompliance with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions,\nsettlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, \nsuspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other \ncollateral consequences. If any subpoenas, investigations or other enforcement actions are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if \nwe do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In\naddition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense \nand compliance costs and other professional fees. In certain cases, enforcement authorities may even cause us to appoint an independent compliance \nmonitor which can result in added costs and administrative burdens.\n110"

Further, the \nprovision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order, or use of \nmedicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery \nlaws of European Union Member States and the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010.

Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, \npublic reprimands, administrative penalties, fines, or imprisonment.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nAdverse changes in the geopolitical relationship between the United States and China could have an adverse effect on business conditions.\nBecause our manufacturing operations and research and development relating to our manufacturing operations are primarily conducted in China, \nadverse changes in economic and political policies relating to China could have an adverse effect on our business. An escalation of trade and geopolitical \ntensions between the United States and China has resulted in trade restrictions and could further result in policies or conflict that impede harm our ability to \noperate efficiently in China. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade and political \ntensions between the United States and its trading partners, especially China, could result in a global economic slowdown and a disadvantageous research \nand manufacturing environment in China, particularly for U.S.-based companies, including retaliatory restrictions that hinder or potentially inhibit our \nability to operate in China. \nAny actions and policies adopted by the government of the PRC, particularly with regard to intellectual property rights and biotechnological \ndevelopment for non-Chinese businesses, or any prolonged slowdown in China’s economy, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, other future pandemics, or \notherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Accordingly, our ability to continue to use China as a \nmanufacturing or research and development location depends on our ability to implement and maintain structures that are acceptable under PRC laws. Our \nfailure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n111"

Accordingly, our business, results of operations, financial \ncondition and prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by economic, political, legal and social conditions in China as well as China’s economic, \npolitical, legal and social conditions in relation to the rest of the world. China’s economy differs from the economies of developed countries in many \nrespects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of \nresources. While China’s economy has experienced significant growth over the past 40 years, growth has been uneven across different regions and among \nvarious economic sectors of China. China’s government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of \nresources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall economy in China, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition \nand results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are currently \napplicable to us. In addition, in the past, China’s government implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of \neconomic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and results of operation. \nMore generally, if the business environment in China deteriorates from the perspective of domestic or international investment, our business in China may \nalso be adversely affected. \nThe pharmaceutical industry in China is highly regulated and such regulations are subject to change which may affect approval and commercialization \nof our product candidates. \nSome of our research and development operations and manufacturing facilities are in China. The pharmaceutical industry in China is subject to \ncomprehensive government regulation and supervision, encompassing the approval, registration, manufacturing, packaging, licensing and marketing of new \ndrugs. In recent years, the regulatory framework in China regarding the pharmaceutical industry has undergone significant changes, and we expect that it \nwill continue to undergo significant changes. Any such changes or amendments may result in increased compliance costs on our business or cause delays in \nor prevent the successful development of our product candidates in China and reduce the current benefits we believe are available to us from developing \nand manufacturing drugs in China. PRC authorities have become increasingly vigilant in enforcing laws in the pharmaceutical industry and any failure by \nus or our partners to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations or obtain and maintain required licenses and permits may result in the \nsuspension or termination of our business activities in China. We believe our strategy and approach are aligned with the PRC government’s regulatory \npolicies, but we cannot ensure that our strategy and approach will continue to be aligned. \nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of China, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs \nthat could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business. \nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the \nhandling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our manufacturing operations primarily occur in China and involve the \nuse of hazardous materials, including chemical materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We are therefore subject to PRC laws and \nregulations concerning the discharge of waste water, gaseous waste and solid waste during our processes of research and development of our product \ncandidates. We engage competent third-party contractors for the transfer and disposal of these materials and wastes. Despite our intention to do so, we may \nnot comply fully with environmental regulations at all times. Any violation of these regulations may result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, \nrevocations of operating permits, shutdown of our facilities and obligations to take corrective measures. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of \ncontamination or injury from these materials and wastes. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or discharge of hazardous materials, \nwe could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil, \nadministrative or criminal fines and penalties. \n112"

Furthermore, China may take steps towards the adoption of more stringent environmental regulations. Due to the possibility of \nunanticipated regulatory or other developments, the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently \nanticipated. If there is any unanticipated change in the environmental regulations, we may need to incur substantial capital expenditures to install, replace, \nupgrade or supplement our manufacturing facility and equipment or make operational changes to limit any adverse impact or potential adverse impact on \nthe environment in order to comply with new environmental protection laws and regulations. If such costs become prohibitively expensive, we may be \nforced to cease certain aspects of our business operations. \nFailure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee stock ownership plans or equity incentive plans may \nsubject the PRC plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions. \nUnder the applicable regulations and State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the People’s Republic of China, or SAFE, rules, PRC citizens \nwho participate in an employee stock ownership plan or a stock option plan in an overseas publicly listed company are required to register with SAFE and \ncomplete certain other procedures. In February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for \nDomestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly Listed Companies, or the Stock Option Rules, which replaced the \nApplication Procedures of Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Ownership Plan or Stock Option \nPlans of Overseas Publicly Listed Companies issued by SAFE in March 2007. Pursuant to the Stock Option Rules, if a PRC resident participates in any \nstock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company, a qualified PRC domestic agent must, among other things, file on behalf of such participant an \napplication with SAFE to conduct the SAFE registration with respect to such stock incentive plan and obtain approval for an annual allowance with respect \nto the purchase of foreign exchange in connection with the exercise or sale of stock options or stock such participant holds. Such participating PRC \nresidents’ foreign exchange income received from the sale of stock and dividends distributed by the overseas publicly listed company must be fully \nremitted into a PRC collective foreign currency account opened and managed by the PRC agent before distribution to such participants. We and our PRC \nresident employees who have been granted stock options or other stock-based incentives of ours are subject to the Stock Option Rules. If we or our PRC \nresident participants fail to comply with these regulations, we and/or our PRC resident participants may be subject to fines and legal sanctions. \nRisks Related to Our Common Stock \nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to \nfall below expectations. \nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. These \nfluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including but not limited to: \n•\nthe timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research, development, pre-commercial and, if approved, commercialization activities \nrelating to our product candidates, which may change from time to time; \n•\nthe timing and status of enrollment for our clinical trials; \n•\nthe cost of manufacturing our product candidates, as well as building out our supply chain, which may vary depending on the quantity of \nproduction and the terms of our agreements with manufacturers; \n•\nexpenditures that we may incur to acquire, develop or commercialize additional product candidates and technologies; \n•\ntiming and amount of any milestone, royalty or other payments due under any collaboration or license agreement; \n•\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; \n113"

As a \nresult, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of \nour future performance. \nThis variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any \nperiod. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if \nany forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such \na stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue or earnings guidance we may provide. \nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert significant influence over matters subject \nto stockholder approval. \nBased upon the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of March 3, 2023, our executive officers, directors, affiliated holders of 5% or \nmore of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 30.5% of our outstanding voting stock. These stockholders will \nhave the ability to exert significant influence over our company through their ownership position. For example, these stockholders may be able to exercise \nsignificant influence over elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major \ncorporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best \ninterest as one of our stockholders.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. \nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally \ndefined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation’s \nability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development tax credits) to \noffset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes as\na result of our IPO and/or subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which are outside our control). In addition, under current tax law, federal \nNOLs generated in periods after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely but in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, may only\nbe used to offset 80% of our taxable income. As a result, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs and tax credits to offset future taxable income, if any, \ncould be subject to limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply. As a result, even if we attain profitability, we may be unable to use a \nmaterial portion of our NOLs and tax credits.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to \nentrenchment of management. \nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in \ncontrol or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include the following: \n•\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a \nmajority of our board of directors; \n114"

As a public \ncompany headquartered in California, under California Code Sections 301.3 and 301.4, we would have been required to have two or three women on our \nboard of directors by the end of 2022, depending on the size of our board of directors. We also would have been required to have at least two or three \ndirectors from an underrepresented community by the end of 2022. Although California Code Sections 301.3 and 301.4 were deemed unconstitutional by \nCalifornia courts, it is possible those decisions may be overturned on appeal, with the potential result of the laws being reinstated.  Although we currently \nhave three women and two directors from an underrepresented community on the board of directors, if California Code Section 301.3 and 301.4 become \neffective, we could need to recruit additional directors to be in compliance, depending on the size of our board. Recruiting and retaining board members \ncarries uncertainty, and failure to comply with this California requirement, if reinstated, will result in financial penalties.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is \nthe exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial \nforum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. \nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware \n(or, in the event that the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State \nof Delaware) is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty, \nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or \nour amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided that, the exclusive \nforum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts \nhave exclusive jurisdiction; and provided further that, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction, such action may be brought in another state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. Our amended and restated \ncertificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive \nforum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or agents and arising under the \nSecurities Act. Nothing in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims \nunder the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state or federal court, subject to applicable law. \nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any \nof our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not \nbe deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, the enforceability of similar \nchoice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could \nfind these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are \nfacially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions, and there can \nbe no assurance that such provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is \ncontained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we \nmay incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. \n116"

Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these \nrequirements. Moreover, the reporting requirements, rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more \ntime-consuming and costly. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with \nbeing a public company, also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or to \nserve as executive officers, or to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors’ and officers’ insurance, on acceptable terms. \nWe are subject to Section 404 and the related rules of the SEC, which generally require our management and independent registered public \naccounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

We will remain an emerging growth company until the \nearlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our IPO, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we \nhave total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, (3) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as \ndefined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common \nstock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year, or (4) the date on which we have \nissued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.  \nUnfavorable global economic or political conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. \nOur business is susceptible to general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A global financial crisis or a global or \nregional political disruption could cause extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, including a \nrecession or depression resulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic, or political disruption could result in a variety of risks to \nour business, including weakened demand for our current or future product candidates, if approved, and our ability to raise additional capital when needed \non acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy or political disruption could also strain our manufacturers or suppliers, possibly resulting in \nsupply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our potential drugs, if approved. Any of the foregoing could materially and \nadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the political or \neconomic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business. \nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our \nstock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. \nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our \nbusiness. We do not have any control over these analysts or what they publish, and we may have limited opportunity to communicate with them during \ncertain times of the year. There can be no assurance that analysts will continue to cover us, cover us accurately, or provide favorable coverage. In the event \nany of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion, or fail to correct an error in their reports or statements, about us, our business \nmodel, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock \nprice would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the \nfinancial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. \n119"

We have taken steps to \nprotect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and \ninventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. Despite these efforts, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have \nbeen duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may \nnot be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary \ninformation using commonly accepted physical and technological security measures. Even though we use commonly accepted security measures, the \ncriteria for protection of trade secrets can vary among different jurisdictions. Additionally, such security measures may not provide adequate protection for \nour proprietary information, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee, consultant, customer or third party with \nauthorized access. Recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to fully protect our interests. Monitoring unauthorized \nuses and disclosures is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective. \nUnauthorized parties may also attempt to copy or reverse engineer certain aspects of our product candidates that we consider proprietary. \nEnforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is \nunpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, third parties \nmay still obtain this information or may come upon this or similar information independently, and we would have no right to prevent them from using that \ntechnology or information to compete with us. Trade secrets will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the \npublication of journal articles and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from company to company or academic to industry scientific positions. \nThough our agreements with third parties typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, collaborators, licensors, suppliers, third-party contractors \nand consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets, our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. If any of our trade \nsecrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that\ntechnology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position. Because from time to time we expect to rely on third parties in \nthe development, manufacture and distribution of our product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. Despite employing the \ncontractual and other security precautions described above, the need to share trade secrets increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our \ncompetitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. If any of these events \noccurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets, the value of this information may be greatly reduced and our competitive position would be \nharmed. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary \ntechnology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized. \n120"

We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names, which \nwe need for name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive \nrejections of our applications by the USPTO or in other foreign jurisdictions. Although we would be given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we \nmay be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an \nopportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed \nagainst our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and \ntrade names, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. We may license our trademarks and trade names to \nthird parties, such as distributors. Though these license agreements may provide guidelines for how our trademarks and trade names may be used, a breach \nof these agreements or misuse of our trademarks and tradenames by our licensees may jeopardize our rights in or diminish the goodwill associated with our \ntrademarks and trade names. \nMoreover, any name we have proposed to use with our product candidates in the United States must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether \nwe have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. Similar requirements exist in Europe. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed \nproduct names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA (or an equivalent administrative body in a foreign \njurisdiction) objects to any of our proposed proprietary single-agent or combination therapy names, it may be required to expend significant additional \nresources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third \nparties and be acceptable to the FDA. Furthermore, in many countries, owning and maintaining a trademark registration may not provide an adequate \ndefense against a subsequent infringement claim asserted by the owner of a senior trademark. At times, competitors or other third parties may adopt trade \nnames or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could \nbe potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our \nregistered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. If we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted \nare invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this \ncase, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks. \nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock could and would likely result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders \nand could cause our share price to fall. \nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock. As a result, \nour stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount. In addition, as \nopportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred \nstock or common stock. If we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock, our common stockholders would experience additional \ndilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline. \nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert our management’s attention. \nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. \nWe may be the target of this type of litigation in the future.

      "text": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated \nfinancial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, this \ndiscussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ \nmaterially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Special Note \nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our fiscal year ends on December 31 \neach year.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of small-molecule product candidates to address serious diseases, \nincluding oncology and metabolic diseases such as NASH, and obesity. Our programs are based on mechanisms of action that have achieved proof-of-\nconcept in clinical trials in indications with large unmet needs. The most advanced product candidates in our pipeline – TERN-701, TERN-501 and TERN-\n601– were internally discovered. TERN-701 is our allosteric BCR-ABL TKI that is in clinical development in China for CML, a form of cancer that starts \nin bone marrow. We intend to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for TERN-701 in the United States in the second half of 2023. TERN-501 is our highly \nselective THR-β agonist for NASH in Phase 2a development with top-line data expected in the third quarter of 2023. TERN-601 is our small-molecule \nGLP-1R agonist for metabolic diseases such as obesity, with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial in the second half of 2023. Additionally, we \nhave an ongoing discovery effort for the TERN-800 series of small-molecule GIPR modulators for obesity, which have the potential for combination with \nGLP-1 receptor agonists.\nTERN-701 is our proprietary, oral, potent, allosteric BCR-ABL TKI specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket for chronic myeloid leukemia. \nCML, a form of cancer that begins in the bone marrow and leads to growth of leukemic cells, is classified as an orphan indication. The SOC for CML \nincludes active-site TKIs including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib. However, an unmet medical need remains due to (1) an \nincreasing number of patients becoming refractory or intolerant to the current SOC, (2) BCR-ABL mutations that are difficult for active-site TKIs to treat \n(e.g., T315I), or (3) safety warnings for active-site TKIs used in CML patients who are resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy. Allosteric TKIs, which \nbind to the myristoyl-binding pocket, represent a new treatment class for CML and have the potential to address active-site TKI shortcomings, including \noff-target activity and limited efficacy against active site resistance mutations. TERN-701 aims to address the limitations of active-site TKIs with the goal \nof achieving improved tumor suppression through a combination of (1) potent activity against BCR-ABL including a broad range of mutations, and (2) \nimproved safety and tolerability profiles. Survival rates and treatment durations for people living with CML continue to increase. As a result, physicians are \nseeking additional efficacious therapies for people whose tolerability, co-morbidity and/or drug-drug interaction profiles change over time, limiting their \navailable treatment options, quality of life and the effectiveness of mainstay therapies. In July 2020, Hansoh in-licensed TERN-701 for development in the \ngreater China region. TERN-701 is referred to by Hansoh as HS-10382. Hansoh is responsible for all development costs in the greater China region, \nincluding the ongoing Phase 1 trial. We retain all worldwide development and commercialization rights for TERN-701 outside of greater China. We expect \nour Phase 1 trial for TERN-701 to start in the second half of 2023, and intend to include sites from the United States, Europe and other countries, with \npotential interim top-line readouts from initial cohorts in 2024. An enrollment progress update for the ongoing China Phase 1 trial is anticipated as part of a \ntrial-in-progress poster presentation that has been submitted to an upcoming oncology conference in mid-2023. \n124"

      "text": "Our second clinical stage program is TERN-501, a Thyroid Hormone Receptor beta, or THR-β, agonist with high metabolic stability, enhanced liver \ndistribution and greater selectivity for THR-β compared to other THR-β agonists in development. In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data \nfrom a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers with mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol. This Phase 1 trial \nincluded SAD, MAD and drug-drug interaction (DDI) cohorts evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of TERN-501. \nIn the SAD and MAD cohorts, single and multiple doses of TERN-501 were generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of AEs across all TERN-501 \ntreatment groups and placebo. All AEs were mild to moderate with no apparent dose relationship, with no treatment-emergent serious AEs and no \ndiscontinuations of study or study drug due to any AE. There were no cardiac safety signals, no incidence of diarrhea and no differences between TERN-\n501 groups and placebo in change from baseline in heart rate, blood pressure or other vital signs. Based on this, we believe that TERN-501 has the potential \nto have a differentiated safety and tolerability profile compared to other THR-β agonists that have observed gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety \nfindings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. Thyroid function test results were consistent with THR-β agonists currently in clinical development, and there were \nno findings of clinical hyper- or hypo-thyroidism. There were no differences between placebo and any TERN-501 dose group in liver function \nabnormalities or mean change from baseline in liver transaminases at Day 15 in the MAD cohorts. TERN-501 demonstrated a predictable pharmacokinetic \nprofile with low variability: study drug plasma exposures were linear and approximately dose-proportional with no overlap between dose strengths. \nSignificant effects on sex hormone binding globulin, or SHBG, a key pharmacodynamic marker of THR-β engagement linked to NASH histologic efficacy, \nwere observed following treatment with TERN-501. The SHBG increases observed with 14 days of TERN-501 treatment were significant, dose dependent \nand have been associated with robust reductions in magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction, or MRI-PDFF, and NAFLD Activity Score in a \nprecedent late-stage clinical NASH trial. The overall pharmacokinetic profile from this trial indicates that TERN-501 is well-suited for co-formulation with \nother small-molecule NASH agents as an oral, once-daily fixed dose combination. In the DDI cohort, the combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501 was \nwell-tolerated. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results support the co-administration of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in NASH patients, with no apparent need \nfor dose adjustment. We initiated the Phase 2a DUET clinical trial in NASH patients including both monotherapy and combination arms of TERN-501 and \nTERN-101 in in July 2022. Enrollment was completed in February 2023, and top-line data are expected in the third quarter of 2023.\nWe are also discovering and developing oral small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists for the treatment of obesity. Our \nlead molecule, TERN-601, is a potent GLP-1R agonist biased towards cAMP generation. We are conducting investigational new drug application (IND)-\nenabling activities for TERN-601 with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial in the second half of 2023 and announcing top-line data in 2024. \nWe expect that this Phase 1 clinical program for TERN-601 will include a SAD trial in healthy volunteers and a MAD proof-of-concept trial in healthy \nvolunteers with elevated BMI. The MAD trial is expected to assess changes in body weight and glycemic control parameters, such as HbA1c, over 28 days. \nEach of our GLP-1 candidate structures is believed to be suitable for oral administration as a single agent or in combination with other drug candidates, \nsuch as small molecule GIPR modulators. In addition to TERN-601, efforts are currently underway to nominate and develop structurally distinct second-\ngeneration small molecule GLP-1R agonists.\nSince the commencement of our operations, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development activities, organizing \nand staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, conducting preclinical studies \nand clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for these operations.\nIn February 2021, we completed our initial public offering pursuant to which we issued 8,625,000 shares of our common stock at a price per share of \n$17.00 for total net proceeds of $133.0 million. In August 2022, we issued 12,250,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $2.42 per share and, to \ncertain investors in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 14,630,000 shares of common stock at a price of $2.4199 per pre-funded \nwarrant for total net proceeds of $60.7 million. In December 2022, we issued 11,902,500 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $7.25 for total \nnet proceeds of $80.8 million. \n125"

We may generate \nrevenue from pre-specified clinical, regulatory and sales milestones as part of an exclusive option and license agreement for TERN-701 in greater China \nwith Hansoh Healthtech Co., Ltd. and Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Company Ltd. (collectively, Hansoh).\nThe decrease in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, was due to Hansoh exercising its exclusive \noption in 2021 pursuant to the exclusive option and license agreement which resulted in our recognition of $1.0 million of revenue. \nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and consist primarily of external and internal \nexpenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. To date, our research and development expenses have \nrelated primarily to discovery efforts, preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Research and development expenses are recognized as \nincurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are \nreceived. Costs for certain activities, such as manufacturing and preclinical studies and clinical trials, are generally recognized based on an evaluation of the \nprogress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and collaborators.\nExternal expenses include:\n•\nexpenses incurred in connection with the discovery, preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including those incurred \nunder agreements with third parties, such as consultants and CROs;\n•\nthe cost of manufacturing products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including payments to contract manufacturing \norganizations, or CMOs, and consultants;\n•\nthe costs of funding research performed by third-party vendors for performing preclinical testing on our behalf;\n•\nthe costs of purchasing lab supplies and non-capital equipment used in designing, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and \nclinical trial materials;\n127"

Technology acquisitions are \nexpensed or capitalized based upon the asset achieving technological feasibility in accordance with management’s assessment regarding the ultimate \nrecoverability of the amounts paid and the potential for alternative future use.\nInternal expenses include employee and personnel-related costs and expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for \nemployees and personnel engaged in research and development functions. We use internal resources primarily to oversee the research and discovery as well \nas for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities.\nOur direct research and development expenses consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to outside consultants, CROs and CMOs in \nconnection with our preclinical development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Our direct research and development expenses also \ninclude fees incurred under our license agreements.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we advance our product \ncandidates or any other future product candidates we may develop into and through preclinical studies and clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval of \nour product candidates. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. The actual \nprobability of success for our product candidates or any other future product candidate that we may develop may be affected by a variety of factors \nincluding: the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical program, the ability of collaborators to \nsuccessfully develop our licensed product candidates, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving \nregulatory approval for our product candidates. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion \ncosts of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product \ncandidates or any other future product candidates we may develop. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials and development \nof our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors.\nThe increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, was primarily due \nto a $4.6 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to higher headcount and a $3.6 million increase related to clinical and pre-clinical program \nexpenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses \nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation \nexpense, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business development, legal, human resources and other administrative functions. General and \nadministrative expenses also include corporate facility costs, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for rent and \nmaintenance of facilities and insurance, not otherwise included in research and development expenses, as well as professional fees for legal, patent, \nconsulting, investor and public relations, accounting and tax services.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we increase our headcount to support the continued \nresearch and development of our programs and the growth of our business. We also anticipate incurring additional expenses associated with operating as a \npublic company, including increased expenses related to accounting, legal and regulatory matters, compliance, director and officer insurance, investor and \npublic relations and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and standards applicable to \ncompanies listed on a national securities exchange.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, was primarily due \nto a $2.4 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to higher headcount and a $0.6 million increase in insurance, legal, information technology and \nother professional services consulting.\n128"

The increase in \ninterest income was primarily due to an increase in interest rates.\nOther (expense) income, net \nOther (expense) income, net for the year ended December 31, 2022 was less than $0.1 million of expense compared to less than $0.1 million of \nincome for the same period in 2021.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $0.4 million compared to $0.5 million for the same period in 2021. \nLiquidity and capital resources \nUses of cash \nOur primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures and general and \nadministrative expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in \nour outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. \nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditures into 2026, \nincluding three clinical data readouts from our three lead programs. However, we continue to anticipate that our research and development expenses, \ngeneral and administrative expenses and capital expenditures will remain significant to support our ongoing and planned activities. We expect to continue \nto incur net operating losses for at least the next several years.\nSources of liquidity \nWe have primarily funded our operations through proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock, convertible preferred stock and sale of our \nconvertible promissory notes. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development activities, organizing and staffing our \ncompany, raising capital, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and providing \ngeneral and administrative support for these operations. \nSince our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash \nflows from our operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $242.4 million, a net loss of approximately $60.3 \nmillion, negative cash flows from operations of approximately $49.1 million, and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $283.1 million.\nIn May 2020, we received proceeds of $16.8 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, or the 2020 Notes, and a bridge loan.\nIn December 2020, we issued and sold shares of our convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds of $87.4 million (including conversion of the \n$15.0 million of 2020 Notes and effective conversion of the $1.8 million bridge loan, plus accrued interest). \nIn February 2021, we completed our initial public offering of 8,625,000 shares of our common stock, including the exercise in full by the \nunderwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. The net proceeds from this offering were $133.0 million after deducting \nunderwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\n129"

The shares are offered pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \nThere were 4,122,628 shares of our common stock sold for aggregate net proceeds of $24.9 million after deducting commissions and offering expenses \npursuant to this agreement through December 31, 2022. In February 2023, the Company sold an additional 2,929,922 shares of the Company's common \nstock for aggregate net proceeds of $27.9 million after deducting commissions and offering expenses.\nIn August 2022, we issued 12,250,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $2.42 per share and, to certain investors in lieu of common stock, \npre-funded warrants to purchase 14,630,000 shares of common stock at a price of $2.4199 per pre-funded warrant. The purchase price per share of each \npre-funded warrant represents the per share offering price for the common stock, minus the $0.0001 per share exercise price of such pre-funded warrant. \nAggregate net proceeds were $60.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. \nIn December 2022, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Jefferies LLC and Cowen and Company, LLC, as representatives of the several \nunderwriters, relating to the underwritten public offering of 10,350,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price per share of $7.25. Under the \nterms of the Underwriting Agreement, we granted the underwriters an option, exercisable within 30 days from the date of the Underwriting Agreement, to \npurchase up to 1,552,500 additional shares of common stock, which the Underwriters exercised in full. Aggregate net proceeds were $80.8 million after \ndeducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. \nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure \nrequirements into 2026. We will need substantial additional funding to support our operating activities.\nFuture funding requirements\nWe expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our \nproduct candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will increase in connection with conducting \nadditional preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future research programs and product candidates, contracting with CROs and contract \nmanufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to support preclinical studies and clinical trials, expanding our intellectual property portfolio, and providing general \nand administrative support for our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional \nequity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources. \nOur primary uses of cash are to fund our research and development activities, business planning, establishing and maintaining our intellectual \nproperty portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. \nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, continue \nor initiate clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for our product \ncandidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to any approved products, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution to the \nextent that such sales, marketing and distribution are not the responsibility of potential collaborators. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs \nassociated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing \noperations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and \ndevelopment programs or future commercialization efforts. \n \nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n•\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of product discovery, preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n•\nthe scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs;\n•\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n130"

In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of \nproduct candidates that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional \nfinancing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. \nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues from product sales, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of \nequity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the \nsale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may \ninclude liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder.

Issuance costs are recognized in the statement of \noperations in the period in which they are incurred. The fair value of the loans payable was determined using a probability weighted expected return model, \na scenario-based valuation model in which discrete future outcome scenarios for our company are projected and discounted to present value.\nAccrued research and development expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to discover, research and \ndevelop drug candidates, including personnel expenses, stock-based compensation expense, allocated facility-related and depreciation expenses, third-party \nlicense fees and external costs, including fees paid to consultants and contract research organizations, or CROs, in connection with nonclinical studies and \nclinical trials and other related clinical trial fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening, laboratory work, clinical trial database management, \nclinical trial material management and statistical compilation and analysis. Non-refundable prepayments for goods or services that will be used or rendered \nfor future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or \nthe related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered, or the services rendered. Costs incurred in obtaining \ntechnology licenses are charged immediately to research and development expense if the technology licensed has not reached technological feasibility and \nhas no alternative future uses.\nFrom time to time, we have entered into various research and development and other agreements with commercial firms, researchers, universities \nand others for provisions of goods and services. These agreements are generally cancelable, and the related costs are recorded as research and development \nexpenses as incurred. We record accruals for estimated ongoing research and development costs. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, \nwe analyze progress of the studies or clinical trials, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs. Significant \njudgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our \nestimates. Since inception, our historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from the actual costs.\nEmerging growth company status\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, permits an “emerging growth company” to take advantage of an extended \ntransition to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private \ncompanies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective \ndates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably \nopt out of the extended transition provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other \npublic companies that are not emerging growth companies and our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to other public companies that \ncomply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We may choose to early adopt any new or revised \naccounting standards whenever such early adoption is permitted for private companies. The JOBS Act also exempts us from having to provide an auditor \nattestation of internal control over financial reporting under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b).\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the \nconsummation of our initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, (iii) the \nlast day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as \namended, or the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last \nbusiness day of the second fiscal quarter of such year or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities \nduring the prior three-year period.\n133"

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial \nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and \nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n  \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable \nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor \nwere we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of \ninternal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over \nfinancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n  \nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and \nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in \nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as \nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

(Terns) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of small-molecule product candidates to \naddress serious diseases including oncology, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and obesity. \nTerns was incorporated as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands in December 2016. In December 2020, the Company effected a de-\nregistration of the Company in the Cayman Islands and a domestication in the State of Delaware (the \"Domestication\"), pursuant to which it became a \nDelaware corporation. Terns owns all of the share capital of Terns Pharmaceutical HongKong Limited (Terns Hong Kong) and Terns, Inc., a Delaware \ncorporation (Terns U.S. Opco). Terns Hong Kong holds all of the share capital of Terns China Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (organized in Shanghai, People’s \nRepublic of China (PRC)) (Terns China) and Terns (Suzhou) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (organized in Suzhou, PRC) (Terns Suzhou). \nThe Company manages its operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions.\nBasis of Presentation \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States \nof America (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of Terns and its wholly owned subsidiaries Terns U.S. Opco and Terns Hong Kong and its wholly owned \nsubsidiaries Terns China and Terns Suzhou. The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. All \nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. \nInitial Public Offering\nIn February 2021, the Company completed an initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 8,625,000 shares of its common stock, including the exercise in \nfull by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional shares of common stock, for net proceeds of $133.0 million, after deducting \nunderwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and its shares started trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol \n“TERN.” Upon closing of the IPO, all of the Company's outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock automatically converted into an aggregate of \n16,079,230 shares of common stock.\nAt-the-Market Offering\nIn March 2022, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC (Cowen) as sales agent, pursuant to which the \nCompany has the ability to offer and sell, from time to time, through Cowen, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 \nmillion in an at-the-market offering. The shares are offered pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and \nExchange Commission, or SEC. There were 4,122,628 shares of the Company's common stock sold for aggregate net proceeds of $24.9 million, after \ndeducting commissions and offering expenses, pursuant to this agreement through December 31, 2022.

      "text": "TERNS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n \nAugust 2022 Financing\nIn August 2022, the Company issued 12,250,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $2.42 per share and, to certain investors in lieu of common \nstock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 14,630,000 shares of common stock at a price of $2.4199 per pre-funded warrant. The purchase price per share of \neach pre-funded warrant represents the per share offering price for the common stock, minus the $0.0001 per share exercise price of such pre-funded \nwarrant. Aggregate net proceeds were $60.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. \nThe pre-funded warrants were classified as a component of permanent stockholders’ equity within additional paid-in capital and were recorded at the \nissuance date using a relative fair value allocation method. The pre-funded warrants are equity classified because they (i) are freestanding financial \ninstruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the equity instruments, (ii) are immediately exercisable, (iii) do not embody an \nobligation for the Company to repurchase its shares, (iv) permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise, (v) are \nindexed to the Company’s common stock and (vi) meet the equity classification criteria. In addition, such pre-funded warrants do not provide any guarantee \nof value or return. The Company valued the pre-funded warrants at issuance, concluding that their sales price approximated their fair value, and allocated \nnet proceeds from the sale proportionately to the common stock and pre-funded warrants, of which $33.0 million was allocated to the pre-funded warrants \nand recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital.\nDecember 2022 Financing\nIn December 2022, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Jefferies LLC and Cowen and Company, LLC, as representatives of \nthe several underwriters, relating to the underwritten public offering of 10,350,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a public offering price per \nshare of $7.25. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company granted the underwriters an option, exercisable within 30 days from the date \nof the Underwriting Agreement, to purchase up to 1,552,500 additional shares of common stock, which the Underwriters exercised in full. Aggregate net \nproceeds were $80.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. \nCertificate of Incorporation\nPrior to the IPO, the Company’s certificate of incorporation adopted in December 2020 in connection with the Domestication (the “December 2020 \nCharter”) authorized the Company to issue the following shares of capital stock: (i) 299,700,000 shares of common stock, (ii) 40,000,000 shares of Series A \nconvertible preferred stock, (iii) 36,409,088 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock and (iii) 111,619,996 shares of Series C convertible preferred \nstock. All classes of stock under the December 2020 Charter were authorized at a par value of $0.0001.\nIn February 2021, the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware became \neffective in connection with the closing of the IPO. Under the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the Company is authorized to issue \n150,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. All classes of stock have a par value of $0.0001.\nReverse Stock Split \nIn January 2021, the Company filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation to effectuate a reverse split of shares of the Company’s \ncommon stock and convertible preferred stock on a 1-for-14 basis (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The par value and the number of authorized shares of the \nconvertible preferred stock and common stock were not adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. All issued and outstanding common stock, options \nto purchase common stock and per share amounts contained in the consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the \nReverse Stock Split for all periods presented. \n142"

      "text": "TERNS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n \nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic \nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The COVID-19 virus and new variants that emerge continue to impact countries worldwide, \nincluding the United States and China where the Company has business operations. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business, \noperations and development timelines and plans remains uncertain, and will depend on certain developments, including the duration and continuation of the \noutbreak and its impact on the Company’s development activities, planned clinical trial enrollment, future trial sites, contract research organizations \n(CROs), third-party manufacturers and other third parties with whom the Company conducts business, as well as its impact on regulatory authorities and \nthe Company’s key scientific and management personnel. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain \nand subject to change. To the extent possible, the Company is and plans to conduct business as usual, with any necessary or advisable modifications to \nemployee travel and to the on-site and in-person activities of the Company's personnel. The Company will continue to actively monitor the evolving \nsituation related to the COVID-19 pandemic and will take necessary actions that alter the Company’s operations, including those that may be required by \nfederal, state or local authorities in the United States and China, or that the Company determines are in the best interest of its employees and other third \nparties with whom the Company conducts business. At this point, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will affect the Company’s business, \noperations and development timelines and plans, including the resulting impact on expenditures and capital needs, remains uncertain. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies \nRevenue Recognition \nTo determine revenue recognition for arrangements, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) \nidentify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in \nthe contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to \ncontracts when it is probable that it will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services it transfers to the customer. At \ncontract inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract, determines those that are performance obligations and \nassesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to \nthe respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. \nThe Company enters into corporate collaborations under which it may obtain upfront license fees, research and development funding, and \ndevelopment, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalty payments. The Company’s performance obligations under these arrangements \nmay include licenses of intellectual property, distribution rights, research and development services, delivery of manufactured product and/or participation \non joint steering committees. \nLicenses of intellectual property \nIf the license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the \narrangement, the Company recognizes revenue from upfront license fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the \ncustomer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, the Company utilizes judgement to assess the nature \nof the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over \ntime, the appropriate method of measuring proportional performance for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees. The Company \nevaluates the measure of proportional performance each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue \nrecognition. \n143"

      "text": "TERNS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n \nMilestone payments \nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes development, regulatory or commercial milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether the \nmilestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price. The Company considers two \nalternatives to use when estimating the amount of variable consideration: the expected value method and the most likely amount method. Under the \nexpected value method, an entity considers the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. Under the most likely \namount method, an entity considers the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts. Whichever method is used, it should be \nconsistently applied throughout the life of the contract; however, it is not necessary for the Company to use the same approach for all contracts. The \nCompany expects to use the most likely amount method for development and regulatory milestone payments. If it is probable that a significant revenue \nreversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the Company’s or the \nlicensee’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The transaction price is \nthen allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. The Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance \nobligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability or achievement of \neach such milestone and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimates of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on \na cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. \nCommercial milestones and royalties \nFor arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and in which the license is deemed to \nbe the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue when the related sales occur. To date, the Company has not \nrecognized any royalty revenue resulting from its collaboration arrangements. \nUpfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due and may require deferral of revenue recognition to a future \nperiod until the Company performs its obligations under these arrangements. Amounts payable to the Company are recorded as accounts receivable when \nthe Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. \nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the \nreported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant \nestimates and assumptions made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the estimates for accruals of \nresearch and development expenses, accrual of research contract costs, unrecognized tax benefits, fair value of common stock and stock option valuations. \nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments, using historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other \nassumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\n \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nCash and cash equivalents consist of standard checking accounts and money market funds. The Company considers all highly liquid investments \nwith an original maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company classifies as available-for-sale marketable securities with a remaining maturity when purchased of greater than three months. The \nCompany’s marketable securities are maintained by investment managers and consist of U.S. government and non-U.S. government securities, corporate\ndebt securities and commercial paper. Debt securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive loss as a \ncomponent of stockholders’ equity until realized. Any premium arising at purchase is amortized to the earliest call date and any discount arising at purchase\nis accreted to maturity. Amortization and accretion of premiums and \n144"

If \nboth criteria are met, upon lease commencement, the Company records a lease liability which represents the Company’s obligation to make lease payments \narising from the lease, and a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset which represents the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease \nterm.\n145"

In determining the net present value of the lease payments, the Company uses its incremental \nborrowing rate applicable to the underlying asset unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. Any lease incentives received are deferred and recorded as \na reduction of the ROU asset and amortized over the term of the lease. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components and instead treats \nthem as a single component. Rent expense, comprised of amortization of the ROU asset and the implicit interest accreted on the operating lease liability, is \nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company determines the lease term as the noncancellable period of the lease and may include \noptions to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options.\nThe Company elected to not apply the recognition requirements of the new leasing standard to short term leases with terms of 12 months or less. As \na result, leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet.\n \nClassification of Convertible Preferred Stock\nThe holders of Series A, Series B and Series C convertible preferred stock, which were outstanding prior to the IPO, had certain liquidation rights in \nthe event of a deemed liquidation that, in certain situations, were not solely within the control of the Company and would call for the redemption of the then \noutstanding convertible preferred stock. Therefore, the Series A, Series B and Series C convertible preferred stock were classified outside of stockholders’ \nequity on the consolidated balance sheets. In February 2021, upon the completion of the IPO, all the outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock \nconverted into common stock and the Company does not have any shares of preferred stock outstanding.\n \nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to discover, research and \ndevelop drug candidates, including personnel expenses, stock-based compensation expense, allocated facility-related and depreciation expenses, third-party \nlicense fees and external costs, including fees paid to consultants and contract research organizations, or CROs, in connection with nonclinical studies and \nclinical trials and other related clinical trial fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening, laboratory work, clinical trial database management, \nclinical trial material management and statistical compilation and analysis.

These agreements are generally cancelable, and the related costs are recorded as research and \ndevelopment expenses as incurred. The Company records accruals for estimated ongoing research and development costs. When evaluating the adequacy of \nthe accrued liabilities, the Company analyzes progress of the studies or clinical trials, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and \ncontracted costs. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could \ndiffer materially from the Company’s estimates. Since inception, the Company’s historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from the \nactual costs.\n \nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities included the following: \n \n \n \nDecember 31,\n \n(in thousands)\n \n2022\n   \n2021\n \nResearch and development costs\n \n$\n1,209   \n$\n1,570 \nAccrued professional fees\n \n \n925   \n \n363 \nCompensation and benefit costs\n \n \n3,843   \n \n2,403 \nOther\n \n \n185   \n \n358 \nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities\n \n$\n6,162   \n$\n4,694 \n \nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes primarily relates to projected federal, state and foreign income taxes. To determine the quarterly provision for \nincome taxes, the Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is generally based on expected annual income and statutory tax rates in the \nvarious jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In addition, the tax effects of certain significant or unusual items are recognized discretely in the \nquarter during which they occur and can be a source of variability in the effective tax rates from quarter to quarter.\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected \nfuture tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company \nconsiders all expected future events including the enactment of changes in tax laws or rates. A valuation allowance is recorded, if necessary, to reduce net \ndeferred tax assets to their realizable values if management does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. In \nmaking such a determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary \ndifferences, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. \nWhen the Company establishes or reduces the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, its provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, \nrespectively, in the period such determination is made.\nThe Company assesses accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by modeling for the recognition, measurement and disclosure in financial \nstatements any uncertain income tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. As of each balance sheet date, unresolved \nuncertain tax positions are reassessed. The Company accrues interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been \nestablished consistent with jurisdictional tax laws.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances \nfrom non-owner sources.  \n147"

      "text": "TERNS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n \nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense, including grants of stock options and restricted stock awards issued under the Company’s equity incentive plan \nand rights to acquire stock granted under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the \nawards and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The Company’s \ndetermination of the fair value of stock options with time-based vesting and rights to acquire stock under the ESPP utilizes the Black-Scholes option-\npricing model. The Company lacks sufficient company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock \nvolatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate \nhistorical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. The Company estimates risk-free rates using the implied yield currently available on \nU.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term and dividend yield using the Company’s expectations and historical \ndata. The Company uses the simplified method to calculate the expected term of stock option grants as the Company has limited historical information from \nwhich to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior for its stock option grants. \nUnder the simplified method, the expected term is estimated to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual term of the option. The fair \nvalue of each stock option grant and right to acquire stock under the ESPP is calculated based upon the Company’s common stock valuation on the date of \nthe grant. The Company accounts for forfeitures of stock option grants as they occur.\nNet Loss Per Share of Common Stock\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net income (loss) per share of common stock as the Company has issued shares that \nmeet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net income (loss) per share of common stock for each class of common and \nparticipating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires \nincome available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based upon their respective rights to \nreceive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed.\nBasic net income (loss) per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net income (loss) per share of common stock by the weighted \naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, \n2022 included pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 14,630,000 shares of common stock that were issued in connection with the August \n2022 Financing. \nDiluted net income (loss) per share of common stock is computed by adjusting net income (loss) to reallocate undistributed earnings based on the \npotential impact of dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the diluted net loss by the weighted average \nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive shares. For purposes of this calculation, outstanding stock \noptions and convertible preferred stock are considered potential dilutive shares. The Company’s convertible preferred stock outstanding prior to the IPO \ncontractually entitled the holders of such shares to participate in dividends but did not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in \nlosses of the Company. Accordingly, in periods in which the Company reported a net loss, such losses were not allocated to such securities. \nThe Company reported a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. In periods in which the Company reported a net loss, diluted net \nloss per share of common stock was the same as basic net loss per share of common stock, since dilutive shares were not assumed to have been issued if \ntheir effect is anti-dilutive. The Company excluded the following potential shares of common stock, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period \nend, from the computation of diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share of common stock for the periods indicated because including \nthem would have had an anti-dilutive effect:\n \n \n \nDecember 31,\n \n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n \nOptions to purchase common stock\n \n \n4,823,928     \n3,577,485 \nUnvested restricted stock units\n \n \n128,280     \n— \nShares issuable under employee stock purchase plan\n \n \n25,326     \n6,717 \nTotal\n \n \n4,977,534     \n3,584,202 \n \n148"

Consequently, prior period \namounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historical accounting policies under ASC 840: Leases (Topic 840). The Company \nelected the package of practical expedients under which the Company has not reassessed prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification \nand initial direct costs. Additionally, the Company made a policy election that does not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities related to leases with a \nterm of 12 months or less. The Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components and instead treat them as a single component. The \npattern of recognition for operating leases within the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss has not significantly changed. Upon adoption, the \nCompany recognized operating liabilities of $1.7 million, with corresponding ROU assets of $1.5 million based on the present value of the remaining \nminimum rental payments under current leasing standards for existing operating leases. The Company’s current operating lease portfolio is primarily \ncomprised of property leases.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial \nInstruments (ASU 2016-13), which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU \n2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit \nlosses. For non-public entities, ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after \nDecember 15, 2022. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies have extended transition periods available for complying with new or revised \naccounting standards.

The 2020 Notes had an \ninterest rate of 10.0% per annum, were unsecured, and were due and payable, including accrued interest, in May 2021. In connection with the Series C \nConvertible Preferred Stock Financing, the 2020 Notes, totaling unpaid principal and accrued interest of $15.9 million, converted into 1,366,820 shares of \nSeries C convertible preferred stock.\nBridge Loan \nIn May 2020, the Company entered into a bridge loan with Terns China (Bridge Loan) for aggregate proceeds of $1.8 million, payable in renminbi \n(RMB) at an established USD/RMB exchange rate, based on an average of the previous five working days before May 8, 2020. The Bridge Loan had an \ninterest rate of 10% per year, which began to accrue on the date of drawdown, and was computed based on the actual number of days elapsed based on a \nyear of 365 days. The Bridge Loan holders have the same conversion rights as the 2020 Notes holders. \nIn connection with the closing of the Series C convertible preferred stock financing in December 2020, entities that are a part of Lilly Asia Ventures \n(LAV) agreed to effectively convert the Bridge Loan into shares of Series C preferred stock on the same terms as the 2020 Notes. The conversion was to be \nbased on an outstanding loan balance equal to $1.9 million, consisting of (i) the principal loan amount ($1.8 million) plus (ii) accrued interest through \nDecember 29, 2020 ($0.1 million).\nTo help facilitate the transfer of cash from China to the United States to effectively convert the Bridge Loan, the Company and Terns China agreed \nto enter into an agreement with LAV to (i) repay the Bridge Loan and (ii) issue shares of Series C convertible preferred stock at the initial closing of the \nSeries C financing to entities that are a part of LAV in exchange for a promissory note issued to the Company by LAV, or the LAV Affiliate Promissory \nNote.\nThe Bridge Loan was repaid in full by the Company following the requisite government approvals in China. Proceeds from the repayment of the \nBridge Loan by Terns China were used by LAV to repay the LAV Affiliate Promissory Note in full. The fair value of the Bridge Loan was determined to be \n$2.1 million as of December 31, 2020. The Bridge Loan and the LAV Affiliate Promissory Note were paid in full in March 2021.\nLAV Series A and Series B Promissory Notes\nIn November 2020, the Chinese government provided approval for entities affiliated with LAV to exercise the LAV Option (see Note 5, Convertible \nPreferred Stock). Terns Hong Kong agreed to repurchase all equity interests held by the LAV PRC Entities with proceeds to be used by LAV to purchase \nshares of Series A convertible preferred stock and Series B convertible preferred stock of the Company (Repurchase).\nIn December 2020, the Company issued 767,857 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock and 216,450 shares of Series B convertible preferred \nstock to an affiliate of LAV (LAV Affiliate) in exchange for a promissory note with a principal amount equal to the original investment by LAV in Terns \nChina (LAV Series A and Series B Promissory Note). The LAV Series A and Series B Promissory Note was repaid through proceeds of the Repurchase \nwhich was completed in January 2021.\nPrior to their repayment, the carrying value of the LAV Series A and Series B Promissory Notes approximated their respective fair value due to the \nshort-term nature of the liability. \nThe outstanding LAV Series A and Series B Promissory Note was settled in January 2021 and was paid with the proceeds received from the note \nreceivable of $10.8 million.

The 2021 Plan is the successor to the 2017 Incentive Award Plan and no additional awards may be issued from the \n2017 Plan.

This is based upon the weight of available evidence, including historical operating performance, \nthe change of structure due to the Domestication, and that a net loss will be expected to occur in the foreseeable future.\n                                                                                                                 \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $65.8 million and $0.7 million, \nrespectively. The federal net operating loss has an indefinite carryforward while the state net operating loss will begin to expire in 2042.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had California R&D credit \ncarryforwards of approximately $2.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively, which do not expire.\n \nUtilization of net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations \nprovided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net \noperating losses and credits before utilization. The Company does not expect any previous ownership changes, as defined under Section 382 and 383 of the \nInternal Revenue Code, to result in a limitation that will materially reduce the total amount of net operating loss carryforwards and credits that can be \nutilized. Further, foreign loss carryforwards maybe subject to limitations under the applicable laws of the taxing jurisdictions due to ownership change \nlimitations.\n                                                                                                 \nBeginning in 2022, the newly enacted tax legislation required U.S. R&D expenditures to be capitalized and amortized ratably over a five-year \nperiod.

The Company estimated \nthe costs incurred and required to be capitalized in 2022 based upon the current year R&D expenses and adjusted for book to tax basis differences.\n                                                                                                                 \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has provided U.S. income taxes on all its foreign earnings.

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or \nsubmit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that\nsuch information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow \ntimely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nAny controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control \nobjective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this \nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the design and operation of our disclosure \ncontrols and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company. Internal control \nover financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision \nof, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to \nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance \nwith generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable \ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \nexpenditures of our company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide \nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our company's assets that could have a \nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the \npreparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent \nlimitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future \nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or \nprocedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control \nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated \nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

(the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”) and the material provisions of \nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, the amended and restated investors’ rights agreement to \nwhich we and certain of our stockholders are parties and of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Because the following is only a summary, it does not \ncontain all of the information that may be important to you. For a complete description, you should refer to our amended and restated certificate of \nincorporation, amended and restated bylaws and amended and restated investors’ rights agreement, copies of which are incorporated by reference as \nExhibits 3.1, 3.2 and 10.1, respectively, to our Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nGeneral \nOur authorized capital stock consists of 150,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par\nvalue $0.0001 per share. \nCommon Stock \nVoting Rights \nEach holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of directors. \nOur stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Accordingly, holders of a majority of the voting shares are able to elect \nall of the directors. In addition, the affirmative vote of holders of 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding voting stock is required to take \ncertain actions, including amending certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including the provisions relating to \namending our amended and restated bylaws, the classified board and director liability. \nDividends \nSubject to preferences that may be applicable to any then outstanding preferred stock, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends as may \nbe declared from time to time by our board of directors out of legally available funds. \nLiquidation \nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for \ndistribution to stockholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities, subject to the satisfaction of any liquidation preference granted to the \nholders of any then outstanding shares of preferred stock. \nRights and Preferences \nHolders of our common stock have no preemptive, conversion or subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to \nour common stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of \nthe holders of shares of any series of our preferred stock that we may designate and issue in the future. \nFully Paid and Nonassessable \nAll of our outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. \n \n|US-DOCS\\122277646.2||"

      "text": "Preferred Stock \nOur board of directors has the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series \nand to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. These rights, preferences and privileges could include dividend rights, conversion \nrights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences, sinking fund terms and the number of shares constituting, or the designation of, such \nseries, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of our common stock. The issuance of our preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power \nof holders of common stock and the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon our liquidation. In addition, the \nissuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company or other corporate action. \nRegistration Rights \nCertain holders of shares of our common stock, are entitled to certain rights with respect to registration of such shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as \namended, (the “Securities Act”). These shares are referred to as registrable securities. The holders of these registrable securities possess registration rights \npursuant to the terms of our amended and restated investors’ rights agreement and are described in additional detail below. The registration of shares of our \ncommon stock pursuant to the exercise of the registration rights described below would enable the holders to trade these shares without restriction under the \nSecurities Act when the applicable registration statement is declared effective. We will pay the registration expenses, other than underwriting discounts, \nselling commissions and stock transfer taxes, of the shares registered pursuant to the demand, piggyback and Form S-3 registrations described below. \nThe demand, piggyback and Form S-3 registration rights described below will terminate upon the earliest of (i) with respect to each stockholder, such date, \non or after the closing of our initial public offering in February 2021, on which all registrable shares held by such stockholder may immediately be sold \nduring any 90-day period pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act, or Rule 144, and (ii) the occurrence of a deemed liquidation event, as defined in our \namended and restated certificate of incorporation, as currently in effect. \n \nDemand Registration Rights \nCertain holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to certain demand registration rights. Beginning August 3, 2021, certain investors holding, \ncollectively, 20% of registrable securities may, on not more than two occasions, request that we register all or a portion of their shares, subject to certain \nspecified exceptions. If any of these holders exercises its demand registration rights, then these holders will be entitled to register their shares, subject to \nspecified conditions and limitations in the corresponding offering. \nPiggyback Registration Rights \nIn the event that we propose to register any of our securities under the Securities Act, either for our own account or for the account of other security \nholders, certain holders of shares of our common stock will be entitled to certain “piggyback” registration rights allowing them to include their shares in \nsuch registration, subject to specified conditions and limitations. \nS-3 Registration Rights \nCertain  holders of  shares of our common stock are  entitled to certain Form S-3 registration rights. Certain investors holding at least 10% of registrable \nsecurities may, on not more than two registrations on Form S-3 within any 12-month period, request that we register all or a portion of their shares on Form \nS-3 if we are qualified to file a registration statement on Form S-3, subject to specified exceptions. Such request for registration on Form S-3 must cover \nsecurities with an aggregate offering price which equals or exceeds $1.0 million, net of selling expenses. The right to have such shares registered on Form \nS-3 is further subject to other specified conditions and limitations. \n \n|"

      "text": "Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Delaware Law and Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated \nBylaws \nCertain provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that \ncould make the following transactions more difficult: acquisition of us by means of a tender offer; acquisition of us by means of a proxy contest or \notherwise; or removal of our incumbent officers and directors. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter \ntransactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interest or in our best interests, including transactions that might result in a \npremium over the market price for our shares. \nThese provisions, summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also \ndesigned to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased \nprotection of our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the \ndisadvantages of discouraging these proposals because negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. \n \nDelaware Anti-Takeover Statute \nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits persons deemed “interested stockholders” from engaging in a \n“business combination” with a publicly-held Delaware corporation for three years following the date these persons become interested stockholders unless \nthe business combination is, or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder was, approved in a prescribed manner or another \nprescribed exception applies. Generally, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years \nprior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock. Generally, a “business combination” \nincludes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. The existence of this provision may \nhave an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors, such as discouraging takeover attempts that \nmight result in a premium over the market price of our common stock. \nUndesignated Preferred Stock \nThe ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or \npreferences that could impede the success of any attempt to effect a change in control of our company. These and other provisions may have the effect of \ndeterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of our company. \nSpecial Stockholder Meetings \nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation  provides that a special meeting of stockholders may be called at any time by our board of directors, \nbut such special meetings may not be called by the stockholders or any other person or persons. \nRequirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals \nOur amended and restated bylaws  establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election \nas directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors. \nElimination of Stockholder Action by Written Consent \nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation eliminates the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting. \n \n|"

      "text": "Classified Board; Election and Removal of Directors; Filling Vacancies \nOur board of directors is divided into three classes, divided as nearly as equal in number as possible. The directors in each class will serve for a three-year \nterm, one class being elected each year by our stockholders, with staggered three-year terms. Only one class of directors is elected at each annual meeting \nof our stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. Because our stockholders do not have \ncumulative voting rights, our stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding are able to elect all of our directors. Our amended \nand restated certificate of incorporation provides for the removal of any of our directors only for cause and requires a stockholder vote by the holders of at \nleast a 66 2/3% of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock. Furthermore, any vacancy on our board of directors, however occurring, including \na vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, may only be filled by a resolution of the board of directors unless the board of directors \ndetermines that such vacancies shall be filled by the stockholders. This system of electing and removing directors and filling vacancies may tend to \ndiscourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, because it generally makes it more difficult for \nstockholders to replace a majority of the directors. \nChoice of Forum \nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws  provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an \nalternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware \nstatutory or common law: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any \nof our directors, officers or stockholders to us or to our stockholders; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General \nCorporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time); \nor any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. As a result, any action brought by any of our stockholders with \nregard to any of these matters will need to be filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and cannot be filed in any other jurisdiction; provided \nthat, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \n“Exchange Act”), as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction; and provided further that, if and only if the Court \nof Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, such action may be brought in another state or \nfederal court sitting in the State of Delaware.

With respect to Performance-Based Awards, the \ngrant agreement may provide for alternative treatment in lieu of the foregoing and, absent any such treatment in the grant \nagreement, the vesting acceleration provided for herein shall be deemed to have been met based on the achievement of the \nPerformance-Based Award based on “at target” performance.\n7.\nProprietary Information and Inventions Agreement.

If a reduction in a Payment is required pursuant to the preceding sentence and the Reduced Amount is \ndetermined pursuant to clause (x) of the preceding sentence, the reduction shall occur in the manner (the “Reduction \nMethod”) that results in the greatest economic benefit for you.

If you do not cooperate in selecting the physician, submit to examination by \nthe physician mutually selected by the parties, or provide access to needed information upon which such determination can be made, then the \nBoard shall have no continued obligation to consult with such physician and will have the authority to determine whether you are subject to a \nDisability on its own. \n“Equity Awards” means all options to purchase Parent common stock as well as any and all other stock-based awards \ngranted to you by Parent, including but not limited to stock bonus awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards or stock \nappreciation rights."

The claims subject to this release include, but are not limited to, those relating to my employment with Company \nand/or any predecessor to Company and the termination of such employment. All such claims (including related attorneys’ fees \nand costs) are barred without regard to whether those claims are based on any alleged breach of a duty arising in statute, \ncontract, or tort.

Accordingly, I further waive any rights under Section 1542 of \nthe Civil Code of the State of California or any similar state statute. Section 1542 states: \n \n“A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his \nor her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or \nher settlement with the debtor or released party.” \n \nThis Release does not extend to, and has no effect upon, any benefits that have accrued or equity that has vested or is eligible for \nvesting post employment, to, under any employee benefit or equity plan, program, policy or grant sponsored or maintained by the \nCompany, or to my right to indemnification by the Company or Parent, and continued coverage by the Company’s or Parent’s \ndirector’s and officer’s insurance."
