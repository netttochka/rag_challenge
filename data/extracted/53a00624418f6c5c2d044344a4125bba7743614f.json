      "text": "May 2023\nDear Shareholder,\nAt MainStreet Bank, we’ve always operated with three core principles: 1) focus on what we do best, which\nmeans don’t try to be all things to all people; 2) lead with high-quality service, not price; and 3) conservatively\nanticipate and prepare for market changes.\nThe saying goes that when you try to be all things to all people, you end up being nothing to nobody. We are like\na high-end restaurant with a limited menu. The large banks are more akin to a corporate chain restaurant, which\ncan overwhelm you with selections – but when the menu is 32 pages long, the food has probably been frozen.\nSince we are focused on what we do best, it is easy to compete with quality service over price. When you\ncompete on price, it is a race to the bottom for loan rates and a race to the top for deposit rates. Every successful\nperson I know is willing to pay a little more for consistent quality service.\nAnticipating and preparing for opportunities in our niche market is its own exciting challenge. When rates started\ncoming down again in 2019, reaching historic lows in 2020, we knew that rates could either stay the same or go\nup, but they couldn’t really go lower. We focused on shifting our balance sheet to favor a rising rate environment.\nThe rest, as they say, is history. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates 4.25 percent during 2022. I’m happy to\nreport that the balance sheet shifts we made leading up to 2022 positioned us for what became our best year ever!\nWe have another project with a longer lead-time that has yet to make its mark. Back in 2018, we started thinking\nabout the effect new technologies have on changing how people manage their money. We also thought a lot\nabout how community banks will retain their share of deposits with all the new choices coming on-line to help\nconsumers manage their money.\nWithout losing sight of what we do best, we focused on our Banking as a Service (BaaS) experience to design a\nstate-of-the-art embedded banking solution for our technology-savvy community. Our product – Avenuä – is\nnearly ready for launch. Our goal for Avenuä is to generate low-cost deposits and fee income. We are full of\noptimism for this solution and once it is fully launched, we look forward to sharing the results of our hard work\nand efforts.\nThis is an exciting time to be in community banking – even more so as we continue to develop ourselves in the\nfinancial technology space. This year we added one more core principle to the mix – stay relevant.\nThank you for your ongoing support. We are doing our best to create value and opportunity in our Company.\nSincerely,\nJeff W. Dick\nChairman & CEO"

Business\nAs used herein, the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to MainStreet Bancshares, Inc., and the “Bank” refers to MainStreet Bank.\nOverview\nMainStreet Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company that owns 100% of MainStreet Bank and MainStreet Community Capital,\nLLC. On October 12, 2021, the Company filed an election to be a financial holding company with the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Company elected financial holding company status in order to engage in a\nbroader range of financial activities than are permitted for bank holding companies generally. We emphasize providing responsive and\npersonalized services to our clients. Due to the consolidation of financial institutions in our primary market area, we believe there is a\nsignificant opportunity for a local bank to provide a full range of financial services. By offering highly professional, personalized\nbanking products and service delivery methods and employing advanced banking technologies, we seek to distinguish ourselves from\nlarger, regional banks operating in our market area and are able to compete effectively with other community banks.\nMainStreet Bancshares, Inc.\nMainStreet Bancshares Inc. is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia whose principal\nactivity is the ownership and management of MainStreet Bank and MainStreet Community Capital. The Company is authorized to\nissue 10,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $4.00 per share. Additionally, the Company is authorized to issue 2,000,000\nshares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share. There were 7,442,743, shares of common stock outstanding and 28,750 shares of\n7.50% Series A Fixed-Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2022. At that date, there were\nalso outstanding 1,150,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock,\nwith a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share).\nThe Company is a registered bank holding company which is governed under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the\n“Bank Holding Act”), that has elected to be a financial holding company. As such, is subject to inspection, examination, and supervision\nby the Federal Reserve.\nThe Company’s executive offices are located at 10089 Fairfax Boulevard, Fairfax, Virginia. Our telephone number is (703) 481-4567,\nand our internet address is www.mstreetbank.com. The information contained on our website shall not be considered part of this Form\n10-K, and the reference to our website does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the website.\nMainStreet Bank\nMainStreet Bank is a community commercial bank incorporated in and chartered by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Bank is a\nmember of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and its deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank opened for business on May\n26, 2004, and is headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia. We currently operate six Bank branches located in Herndon, Fairfax, McLean,\nClarendon, and Leesburg, Virginia, and one in Washington D.C.\nThe Bank is a community bank focused on serving the borrowing, cash management and depository needs of retail customers, small to\nmedium-sized businesses, and professionals. We believe we have a solid franchise that meets the financial needs of our clients and\ncommunities by providing an array of personalized products and services delivered by seasoned banking professionals with decisions\nmade at the local level. We believe a significant customer base in our market prefers to do business with a local institution that has a\nlocal management team, a local Board of Directors, and local founders and that this customer base may not be satisfied with the\nresponsiveness of larger regional banks. By providing quality services, coupled with the opportunities provided by the economies in our\nmarket area, we have generated and expect to continue to generate organic growth.\nWe service Northern Virginia as well as the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Our goal is to deliver a customized and targeted\nmix of products and services that meets or exceeds customer expectations. To accomplish this goal, we have deployed a premium\noperating system that gives customers access to up-to-date banking technology. These systems and our skilled staff have allowed us to\ncompete aggressively with larger financial institutions. We believe the combination of sophisticated technology and personal service\nsets us apart from our competition. We strive to be the leading community bank in our market.\nWe offer a full range of banking services to individuals, small to medium-sized businesses and professional service organizations through\nboth traditional and electronic delivery. We were the first community bank in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to offer a full\nonline business banking solution, including remote check scanners on a business customer’s desktop. We offer mobile banking apps for\niPhones, iPads and Android devices that provide for remote deposit of checks. In addition, we were the first bank headquartered in the\nCommonwealth of Virginia to offer CDARS, the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service, an innovative deposit insurance\nsolution that provides Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance on deposits up to $50 million. We believe that\nenhanced electronic delivery systems and technology increase profitability through greater productivity and cost control and allow us to\noffer new and better products and services."

Avenu™will\nprovide an embedded banking solution that connects our partners (fintechs, application developers, money movers, and entrepreneurs)\ndirectly and seamlessly to our Software as a Service (SaaS) solution. Our transformational subledger combined with our high-touch\ncompliance training goes beyond the industry standards to ensure that our Fintech partners will prosper. This division of MainStreet\nBank currently serves money service businesses, payment processers, and Banking-as-a-Service customers and provides the Bank\nwith valuable low-cost deposits and additional streams of fee income. Our SaaS software program will be deployed in 2023.\nMainStreet Community Capital, LLC\nIn September 2021, the Company created a community development entity (“CDE”) subsidiary, MainStreet Community Capital, LLC,\na Virginia limited liability company, to apply for New Market Tax Credit (“NMTC”) allocations from the U.S. Department of\nTreasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. To promote development in economically distressed areas, the\nNMTC program was established under the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 to provide tax incentives for capital\ninvestment in disadvantaged market areas that have not experienced economic expansion. The program establishes a tax credit for\ninvestment in a CDE and ongoing compliance with the program is accomplished through a governing board and an advisory board\nwhich maintains accountability to residents and businesses in the aforementioned disadvantaged areas. This CDE will be an\nintermediary vehicle for the provision of loans and investments in Low-Income Communities (“LICs”). In January 2022, the\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions Fund (“CDFI”) of the United States Department of the Treasury certified MainStreet\nCommunity Capital, LLC as a registered CDE. In January 2023, MainStreet Community Capital submitted an application to apply for\nthe 2022 NMTC program allocation. Allocation awards are expected to be announced during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act and as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. For as\nlong as we are an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements\napplicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies. See “Risk Factors—We are an emerging growth company,\nand any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth\ncompanies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.”\nAs an emerging growth company:\n•\nwe may present as few as two years of audited financial statements and two years of related management discussion and analysis\nof financial condition and results of operations, in contrast to other reporting companies which must provide audited financial\nstatements for three fiscal years,\n•\nwe are exempt from the requirement to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on management’s assessment of our\ninternal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,\n•\nwe are permitted to provide less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements, including recently adopted\npay versus performance disclosures, and\n•\nwe are permitted to include less extensive narrative disclosures than required of other reporting companies, particularly with\nrespect to executive compensation.\nIn this Form 10-K we have elected to take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements relating to executive compensation, and in\nthe future, we may take advantage of any or all of these exemptions for so long as we remain an emerging growth company. We will\nremain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the first fiscal year during which we have total annual gross\nrevenues of $1.07 billion or more, (ii) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial registered\npublic offering of common equity securities, which will be in December 31, 2024, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous\nthree-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large\naccelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).\nIn addition to the relief described above, the JOBS Act permits us an extended transition period for complying with new or revised\naccounting standards affecting public companies. We have elected not to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means\nthat the financial statements included in this Form 10-K, as well as any financial statements that we file in the future, will be subject to\nall new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies."

We are required to file with the FDIC quarterly financial condition and\nperformance reports. The Federal Reserve and the Bureau conduct periodic onsite and offsite examinations. We must comply with a\nwide variety of reporting requirements and banking regulations. The laws and regulations governing us generally have been promulgated\nto protect depositors and the federal deposit insurance funds and not to protect shareholders. Additionally, we must bear the cost of\ncompliance with the reporting and regulations; these costs can be significant and may have an effect on our financial performance.\nOur Market Area. We consider our primary market area to be the northern Virginia counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince\nWilliam, and the cities of Fairfax, Alexandria, Falls Church, Manassas, and Manassas Park, as well as Washington DC and the greater\nWashington, DC metropolitan area. Our headquarters is located approximately 15 miles west of Washington, D.C., in Fairfax County,\nVirginia.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Statistical area (MSAs) includes three of the wealthiest\ncounties in the United States, as well as six of the top 20 wealthiest counties. Median household income growth projections range from\n9% to over 14% through 2028. Overall, the Washington D.C. MSA ranks sixth out of the largest 25 MSAs ranked by population estimates\nas of 2021 according to the Census Bureau.

We believe that our customer-centric business philosophy and sales\napproach enables us to build long-term relationships with desirable customers, which enhances the quality and stability of our funding\nand lending operations. Our mission and philosophy have positioned us well in the communities across our market area and have enabled\nus to attract and maintain a very talented and experienced management team.\nDisciplined Credit Culture. We achieve our strong credit quality by adherence to sound underwriting and credit administration standards\nand by maintaining long-term customer relationships. All credit decisions between $250,000 and $750,000 require concurrence of a\nsenior lender and the Bank’s Chief Credit Officer. Approvals of credits in excess of $750,000 require full consensus of the Officer’s\nLoan Committee or the Chief Credit Officer and Chief Lending Officer. We maintain an independent loan review team, and senior\nmanagement is actively involved with any credits requiring special attention.\nCapital Position. The Bank exceeds the regulatory guidelines to be classified as “well capitalized.” Our capital position is strong and\nhas consistently grown. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 15.05%, a common equity tier 1 risk-\nbased capital ratio of 15.47%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 15.47%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 16.27%. We believe that\nour capital position enhances our ability to grow organically because it enables the Bank to continue lending and to remain focused on\nour customers’ needs. For additional information, see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTechnology. We have invested in the technology necessary to meet the developing demands of our commercial and retail customers.\nWe utilize a strong core operating system that enables us to efficiently offer high-end deposit and loan products and have partnered with\nindustry-leading internet banking, cash management, mobile banking, and application-based banking solutions to offer a complete\nbanking experience to all customers, regardless of their preference. We participate in an international and nationwide automated teller\nmachine network in order to offer our customers ATM transactions at over 55,000 locations in the United States, Canada, United\nKingdom and Mexico.\nGrowth Opportunities. We believe that we can attract new customers and expand our total loans and deposits within our existing market\nareas through organic growth, online and mobile banking, strategic branching and possible acquisition opportunities. We expect our\nmarket will continue to create opportunities to attract new clients and, in some cases, may become the catalyst for mergers and\nacquisitions. We expect to grow our loan portfolio, open new branches and consider acquisitions only after rigorous due diligence and\nsubstantial quantitative analysis regarding the financial and capital impacts of any such transactions. We believe that maintaining our\nfinancial discipline will generate long-term shareholder value.\nLending Activities. The Bank’s primary market focus is on making loans to small businesses, professionals and other consumers in its\nlocal market area, along with various aspects of real estate finance. Owner-occupied and investment commercial real estate loans\nrepresent the largest segments of the Bank’s loan portfolio. The Bank’s primary lending activities are principally directed to its defined\nmarket area in Northern Virginia, as well as the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.\nWe offer a diversified loan portfolio consisting primarily of commercial business and owner-occupied and investment commercial real\nestate loans with higher risk-adjusted returns, shorter maturities and more sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, while still providing\nhigh quality loan products for single-family and multi-family residential borrowers.\nStress Testing. We stress test our loan portfolio on a quarterly basis and measure the results against our capital profile. We multiply the\ntotal outstanding amount for each loan category by the highest quarter historical loss for that category in order to determine the stressed\nloss for commercial business loans, residential real estate lending, owner-occupied commercial real estate lending and consumer\ninstalment lending. We stress test our investor-owned commercial real estate using three separate methodologies. If a property fails\nmore than one of the three tests, we extend the highest exposure amount and add on 10% for selling costs.\n•\nAn immediate and sustained increase in interest rates, which would increase interest expense for the borrower;\n•\nAn immediate and sustained increase in vacancy, which would decrease rental income; and\n•\nAn immediate and sustained change in the capitalization rate, or “cap rate,” which would decrease properties’ collateral values.\nWe stress test the construction lending portfolio by applying exponential discounting (k factor) to each project based upon its percentage\nof completion. The project is stressed using the as-is and as-complete appraised values and assumes 10% selling costs.\nThe total estimated losses from the loan stress tests are subtracted from the capital account and the regulatory ratios are recalculated. As\nof December 31, 2022, the post-stress capital ratios were all in excess of regulatory requirements.\nCommercial Business Lending. Commercial loans are written for a variety of business purposes, including government contract\nreceivables, plant and equipment, general working capital, contract administration and acquisition lending. Our client base is diverse,\nand we do not have a concentration of commercial business loans in any specific industry segment."

Our underwriting policies and\nprocesses focus on the client’s ability to repay the loan as well as assessment of the underlying real estate. Risks inherent in managing\na commercial real estate portfolio relate to sudden or gradual drops in property values as well as changes in the economic climate. We\nattempt to mitigate those risks by carefully underwriting loans of this type and by following appropriate loan-to-value standards.\nCommercial real estate loans represent the largest segment of the Bank’s loan portfolio. At December 31, 2022, approximately 14.3% of\nour loan portfolio related to owner occupied commercial real estate loans, and approximately 29.5% of our loan portfolio related to\ninvestment commercial real estate.\nReal Estate Construction Lending. This segment of our portfolio is predominately residential in nature and is composed of loans with\nshort durations. We offer real estate construction financing to customers that have in place a permanent loan “take-out,” either by the\nBank or another institution. Our approach to this type of lending reduces our credit risk, yet offers a competitive product in the\nmarketplace. We also offer construction financing to many local home builders. These loans are also short duration and carefully\nunderwritten with an increased focus on the builder’s reputation and ability to deliver high quality homes on time and within budget.\nWe also stress test the construction lending portfolio based upon the percentage completion method by stressing the as-is and as-\ncompleted appraised values. For further details, see stress test methodology under lending activities.\nResidential Real Estate Lending. The Bank offers a variety of consumer-oriented residential real estate loans both for purchase and\nrefinancing, most of which are brokered to the secondary market.\nConsumer Installment Lending. We offer a broad array of consumer loans including term loans and overdraft protection.\nCredit Policies and Administration. The Bank has adopted a comprehensive lending policy, which includes a well-defined risk tolerance\nand stringent underwriting standards for all types of loans. Management believes that it employs experienced lending officers, secures\nappropriate collateral, and carefully monitors the financial conditions of its borrowers.\nIn addition to normal repayment risks, all loans in the Bank’s portfolio are subject to the state of the economy and the related effects on\nthe borrower and/or the real estate market. Generally, longer-term loans have periodic interest rate adjustments and/or call provisions.\nSenior management monitors the loan portfolio closely minimize past due loans and swiftly address potential problem loans. In addition\nto the internal business processes employed in the credit administration area, the Bank engages an outside or independent credit review\nfirm to review the loan portfolio annually. Results of the credit review are used to validate our internal loan ratings and to review\nindependent commentary on specific loans and loan administration activities.\nLending Limit. As of December 31, 2022, our legal lending limit for loans to one borrower was approximately $43.0 million. The Bank\n“in-house” lending limit is 50% of the legal lending limit for all relationships unless the loan is owner occupied, 1 - 4 family/residential\nor a government contract line of credit. If owner occupied, 1 - 4 family or a government contractor, the “in-house” lending limit is 90%\nof the legal lending limit for \"Good\" rated credits; 85% for \"Standard\" rated credits and 75% for \"Acceptable\" rated credits. Our loan\npolicy prescribes a sub-limit to certain borrowers based upon our determination of each borrower’s credit quality. We routinely\nparticipate loan amounts in excess of our policy limits to other financial institutions.\nFor additional information, see Note 1 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInvestments and Funding. The Bank balances its liquidity needs based on loan and deposit growth through the investment portfolio\nand purchased funds. It is the Bank’s goal to provide adequate liquidity to support the loan growth of the Bank. In the event the Bank\nhas excess liquidity, investment securities are used to generate additional income. In the event deposit growth does not fully support the\nBank’s loan growth, the Bank will utilize deposit listing services, borrowed funds, or incorporate a combination of sales of investment\nsecurities, federal funds and other purchased/borrowed funds in order to augment the Bank’s funding position.\nThe current investment policy authorizes the Bank to invest in debt securities issued by the United States Government, agencies of the\nUnited States Government, or United States Government-sponsored enterprises. The policy permits investments in mortgage-backed\nsecurities, including pass-through securities, issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. The investment policy\nalso permits investments in federal funds and deposits in other insured institutions. In addition, management is authorized to invest in\ninvestment grade state and municipal obligations, private mortgage-backed securities, the subordinated debt of other financial\ninstitutions and equity investments in funds designed to help LMI geographies. The Bank does not engage in any hedging or trading\nactivities in its investment portfolio. The Company is also the owner and beneficiary of bank owned life insurance (BOLI) policies on\ncertain current and former Bank employees. These policies generate income and can be liquidated, if necessary, with associated tax\ncosts.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles require that, at the time of purchase, the Bank designate a security as “held-to-maturity,”\n“available-for-sale,” or “trading,” depending on our ability and intent to hold such security. Debt securities available for sale are reported\nat fair value, while debt securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. The Bank does not maintain a trading portfolio.\nEstablishing a trading portfolio would require specific authorization by the Board of Directors."

Under\nthe available-for sale classification, investment instruments may be sold as deemed appropriate by management. On a monthly basis,\nthe investment portfolio is marked to market as required by ASC 320. Additionally, the investment portfolio is used to balance the\nBank’s asset and liability position. The Bank invests in fixed rate or floating rate instruments as necessary to reduce interest rate risk\nexposure.\nAt December 31, 2022, the held-to-maturity portfolio, which is primarily composed of municipal securities and is carried at amortized\ncost, totaled $17.6 million. At that date, the available-for-sale portfolio, which is composed of U.S. Treasury securities, collateralized\nmortgage-backed securities, subordinated debt of other financial institutions and U.S. Government agency securities and is carried at\nfair value, totaled $62.6 million. For additional information, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSubordinated Notes. On December 30, 2016, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $14.3 million in aggregate principal\namount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes in a private placement transaction to various accredited investors. During the first\nquarter of 2017, an additional $700 thousand of subordinated notes was issued for a total issuance of $15.0 million. The net proceeds of\nthe offering supported growth and were used for other general business purposes. The notes had a maturity date of December 31, 2026,\nand had an annual fixed interest rate of 6.25% until December 31, 2021, with an opportunity to call the debt at December 31, 2021.\nThe Company, taking advantage of the attractive rates in the debt market in 2021, effectively “refinanced” this debt by completing an\nissuance and sale of $30 million in fixed-to-floating subordinated notes in April 2021 with a similar structure as the previous issuance\nat an annual fixed interest rate of 3.75% until April 15, 2026. The net proceeds were used to fully call the subordinated notes issued in\n2016 and to support additional growth for other general business purposes. After April 15, 2026, the notes will have a floating interest\nrate based on three-month SOFR rate plus 302 basis points (3.02%) (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months)\nfrom and including April 15, 2026, to the maturity date or any early redemption date. Interest will be paid semi-annually, in arrears, on\nJuly 1 and January 1 of each year during the time that the notes remain outstanding through the fixed interest rate period or earlier\nredemption date. Interest will be paid quarterly, in arrears, on April 15, July 15, October 15 and January 15 throughout the floating\ninterest rate period or earlier redemption date.\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company completed the issuance of $43.8 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate\nsubordinated notes in a private placement transaction to various accredited investors. The net proceeds of the offering have been and\nwill be used to support growth and for other general business purposes. The notes have a maturity date of March 15, 2032, and have an\nannual fixed interest rate of 4.00% until March 15, 2027. Thereafter, the notes will have a floating interest rate based on three-month\nSOFR rate plus 233 basis points (2.33%) (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) from and including March\n15, 2027, to the maturity date or any early redemption date. Interest will be paid semi-annually, in arrears, on March 15 and September\n15 of each year during the time that the notes remain outstanding through the fixed interest rate period or earlier redemption date. Interest\nwill be paid quarterly, in arrears, on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 throughout the floating interest rate period or\nearlier redemption date.\nDeposit Activities. Deposits are the major source of funding for the Bank. The Bank offers a broad array of deposit products that include\ndemand, NOW, money market and savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit. The Bank typically pays a competitive rate on the\ninterest-bearing deposits. As a relationship-oriented organization, we seek generally to obtain deposit relationships with our loan clients.\nWe offer a full range of consumer and commercial deposit products, including on-line banking with bill pay, cash management, sweep\naccounts, wire transfer, check imaging, remote deposit capture and courier services.\nAs the Bank’s overall balance sheet positions dictate, we may become more or less competitive in our interest rate structure as our\nliquidity position changes. Additionally, we may use wholesale deposits through sources such as deposit listing services, school systems,\ngovernment entities and other sources to augment our funding position.\nWe can also arrange for FDIC insurance for deposits up to $50 million through CDARS, the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry\nService, which provides a convenient method for a depositor to enjoy full FDIC insurance on deposits up to $50 million through a single\nbanking relationship.\nFor additional information on deposits, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBanking-as-a-Service (BaaS). Beginning in 2016, the Board and management identified an opportunity for alternative sources of low-\ncost deposits and fee income. We determined that Financial Technology (“FinTech”) companies were making significant inroads into\nbanking, and we expanded our strategic plan to include banking customers that require BaaS and other payment service solutions.\nConsistent with our culture, we worked over the past six years with a small group of clients in order to understand the risks associated\nwith this business line. We developed an infrastructure to identify, measure, monitor and control the risks associated with FinTechs,\nproviding BaaS, and payment systems in general. We designed and implemented comprehensive legal, strategic, procedural and policy\ndocuments to guide business opportunities."

We guide our FinTech partners through the complex maze of banking\nregulations by integrating compliance and fraud detection throughout the framework of our solution as well as in-person training for\nFinTech partners team members. We have developed a live sandbox for our FinTech partners to provide a proof of concept and allow\nfor quick integration and time to market when they are ready to “go-live.”\nOur transformational subledger combined with our high-touch compliance training goes beyond the industry standards to ensure that\nour FinTech partners will operate successfully. We believe partnering with FinTechs will provide an opportunity to access to untapped\nmarkets and will become a fresh source for growth in low-cost deposits and fee income.\nWe will continue to support the FinTech industry. Consumers in the United States express more confidence banking with FinTechs than\ntraditional banks in many cases. As a business-focused community bank, we see FinTechs as a natural way for us to expand our footprint\ninto consumer banking opportunities.\nCompetition. We face significant competition for the origination of loans and the attraction of deposits. Our competition for loans comes\nprimarily from financial institutions in our market area and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service providers, such as mortgage\ncompanies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from the increasing number of non-depository financial service\ncompanies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies, and specialty finance companies. Our\nmost direct competition for deposits has historically come from other financial institutions operating in our market area. We also face\ncompetition for investors’ funds from money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities.\nBoard Leadership and Oversight\nThe Board of Directors combines the position of Chairman of the Board with the position of Chief Executive Officer, coupled with a\nLead Independent Director position to further strengthen the Company's corporate governance structure. Terry Saeger serves as Vice\nChairman of the Board and Lead Independent Director. The Board of Directors believes this provides an efficient and effective\nleadership model for the Company.\n§\nCombining the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer positions promotes clear accountability, effective decision-\nmaking, and alignment on corporate strategy. Our Chief Executive Officer, who is a co‐ founder of the Bank, has always been\nthe CEO and has served as Chairman since 2009. He has extensive knowledge of all aspects of our current business and\noperations and our prospects which he communicates to the Board. He is particularly focused on the development and\nexecution of our current strategic plans and investments for future growth.\n§\nThe Vice Chairman and Lead Independent Director provides a means for our independent Directors to meet and discuss all\nissues and concerns that arise on an ongoing basis. The Lead Independent Director can independently engage external resources\nas needed to follow-up on issues and concerns. The Lead Independent Director also acts as a liaison to the Chairman to follow-\nup and share concerns raised by the independent Directors.\nThe Board of Directors also believes administration of its risk oversight function is enhanced by the Board's leadership structure. To\nassure effective independent oversight, the Board has adopted appropriate governance practices, including:\n§\nThe Lead Independent Director can call for executive sessions of the independent Directors as needed,\n§\nThe independent Compensation Committee conducts performance evaluations of the Chairman of the Board and Chief\nExecutive Officer, and works with management to evaluate risks posed by our compensation programs and limit unnecessary or\nexcessive risks these programs may pose to the Company, and\n§\nThe Nominating Committee is responsible for the selection and nomination of Directors and is made up exclusively of\nindependent Directors.\nRisk Management\nThe Board of Directors is actively involved in oversight of risks that could affect the Company. This oversight is conducted in part\nthrough the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, but the full Board of Directors has retained responsibility for general\noversight of risks. The Chief Risk Officer and Chief Compliance Officer have reporting lines to the Audit and Risk Committee and are\nfree to contact independent Directors whenever they feel the need to do so.\nThe Board of Directors satisfies this responsibility through full reports by the Audit and Risk Committee regarding its considerations\nand actions, regular reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of risks within the Company as well as through internal and\nexternal audits. The Audit and Risk Committee conducts an annual assessment of its performance and capabilities.\nRisks relating to the direct operations of the Bank are further overseen by the Board of Directors of the Bank. The Board of Directors\nof the Bank also has additional committees that conduct risk oversight separate from the Company. Further, the Board of Directors\noversees risks through the establishment of policies and procedures that are designed to guide daily operations in a manner consistent\nwith applicable laws, regulations and risks acceptable to the organization."

We face a number of risks, including credit risk, interest rate\nrisk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal risk, strategic risk and reputation risk. Management is responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the risks the Company faces, while the Board has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk\noversight role, the Board of Directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and\nimplemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. Senior management meets regularly to discuss strategy and\nrisks facing the Company. Senior management attends the Board meetings and is available to address any questions or concerns raised\nby the Board on risk management and any other matters. The independent members of the Board provide independent oversight of the\nCompany's management and affairs.\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance\nAt MainStreet Bancshares Inc., our overarching focus is to make a positive impact on the communities we serve. The Board and\nmanagement are aligned regarding the growing importance of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives, and we believe\nthat an emphasis on sustainability can strengthen risk management and enhance value. We are, in many ways, at the beginning of our\nESG journey. As we look to the future, we recognize that ESG initiatives require a commitment to the long term, and making an impact\nrequires a willingness to listen to, learn from, and work with stakeholders across our community. Fortunately, this approach is second\nnature to community banks; the challenge is to harness information. We are undertaking efforts to quantify how we make a tangible\ndifference in the communities where we live, play and work.\nEnvironmental\nThe Company has a goal of reducing its carbon emissions each year.\nMainStreet Bank’s origins as a “branch-lite” financial institution mean that we have been and will continue to be part of the transition\nto a sustainable economy that is kinder to our environment because it is less dependent on carbon fuels. Most banks the Company’s\nsize have 20+ branches. The Bank has six locations. The Company has adopted a strategy of Put Our Bank in Your Office®, which\nalso allows customers to conduct business with us without traveling to the Bank. On average, more than 70% of daily transactions are\nprocessed by our customers without the need to come to the Bank. These changes were underway at the Bank long before COVID-19\nforced behavioral patterns in our society to change. For business operators in particular, our remote banking solutions have reduced\nthe need to make frequent visits to a branch bank to deposit cash and checks. This helps to reduce vehicular traffic in our already\ncrowded market.\nThe Company has converted all lighting to LED, scheduled HVAC units for maximum efficiency during off-work hours, incorporated\nmini-split units for specific location heating and cooling, tinted windows to reduce cooling needs and increased the number of indoor\nplants to improve air quality.\nThe Company has also added charging stations to accommodate employees who drive electric vehicles and encourages the purchase of\nhybrid vehicles.\nWe recognize the growing environmental risks of electronic waste and have procedures in place to reduce our impact in this regard.\nFor example, MainStreet Bank contracts with an asset disposal company to ensure that electronic assets, including monitors, security\ncameras, and batteries, are disposed of and recycled in an appropriate and environmentally sensitive manner.\nWe have long allowed and even encouraged our employees to telecommute. Approximately 15% of our employees work remotely\nfull-time. All but our relatively lean team of branch staff are eligible to telecommute, and most do so at least a few days a month.\nThese arrangements give us a broader and more diverse pool of applicants in recruiting, and serve to reduce our employees’ carbon\nfootprint.\nIn our lending portfolio, we seek opportunities to support energy efficiency and renewable energy. In the first quarter of 2023, we are\nclosing our first Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loan, which follows Department of Energy guidelines on financing energy-\nrelated improvements on private property.\nSocial\nThe way the Company interacts with the communities in which it operates and with its employees constitute its social impact. The $2.2\nmillion PACE loan mentioned above exemplifies how we approach the “S” in ESG in our communities. Our funding is renovating The\nFestival Center, a hub for mission-driven organizations in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The new Festival\nCenter will provide office space to a wide range of community-focused ministries and non-denominational non-profits, which provide\naccess to affordable housing, job training, legal aid services, health services, substance abuse support, and more.\nThe establishment in 2022 of MainStreet Community Capital is another business initiative we have taken to support ESG initiatives in\nour communities. MainStreet Community Capital's focus is to invigorate distressed, low-income communities in the Washington,\nD.C., metropolitan area by providing capital and other financial services. These investments are intended to spur the creation of\nquality jobs and services in underserved areas. MainStreet Community Capital has earned its designation as a Community\nDevelopment Entity (CDE) as defined under the U.S. Treasury Department's Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI)\nFund. MainStreet Community Capital has applied to the CDFI Fund for an allocation of the New Markets Tax Credits that will be\nawarded in 2023 and plans to continue to do so annually."

Deposit accounts in\nthe Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum\nof $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts.\nThe FDIC charges insured depository institutions assessments to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (the \"DIF\"). Assessment rates for\nsmall institutions (those with less than $10 billion in assets) are based on an institution’s weighted average CAMELS component ratings\nand certain financial ratios and are applied to the institution’s assessment base, which equals its average total assets minus its average\ntangible equity.\nIn October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule that increased the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by\n2 basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC increased the insurance assessment rates in\nresponse to the 2020 decline in the DIF reserve ratio below the statutory minimum of 1.35% established by the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), and the increased assessment is expected to improve the\nlikelihood that the reserve ratio would be restored to 1.35% by September 30, 2028 prescribed under the FDIC’s restoration plan. The\nFDIC’s assessment rates effective January 1, 2023 (which are subject to certain adjustments) range from 3 to 16 basis points for\ninstitutions with CAMELS composite ratings of 1 or 2, 6 to 30 basis points for those with a CAMELS composite score of 3, and 16 to\n30 basis points for those with CAMELS Composite scores of 4 or 5.\nThe FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating\nexpenses and results of operations of the Bank. We cannot predict what the FDIC assessment rates will be in the future.\nInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is\nin an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed\nby the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements. The Bank is required to comply with applicable capital adequacy requirements adopted by the Federal\nReserve and the other federal bank regulatory agencies (the “Basel III Capital Rules”). The Basel III Capital Rules apply to all depository\ninstitutions as well as to all top-tier bank and savings and loan holding companies that are not subject to the Federal Reserve’s Small\nBank Holding Company Policy Statement. The capital requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require the\nBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory\nand possibly additional discretionary actions by bank regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the\nCompany’s financial statements.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules require the maintenance of “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”) capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital to\nrisk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. The capital rules also establish a minimum leverage ratio of at least 4%\nTier 1 capital to average consolidated assets. In addition to the above minimum requirements, the Basel III Capital Rules limits capital\ndistributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if a banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting\nof 2.5% of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The\ncapital conservation buffer requirement effectively increases the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7% for CET1, 8.5% for\nTier 1 capital and 10.5% for Total capital.\nIn determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, a bank’s assets, including certain\noff-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes and residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor\nassigned by the capital regulations based on the risk deemed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset\ncategories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk\nweight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100%\nis assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past\ndue or otherwise on non-accrual status, and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending\non certain specified factors.\nUnder applicable federal statute, the federal bank regulatory agencies are required to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to\ninstitutions that do not meet specified minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the statute establishes five capital categories:\nwell- capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Under the\nimplementing regulations, in order to be considered well-capitalized, a bank must have a ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets\nof 6.5%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10%, and a leverage\nratio of 5%. In order to be considered adequately capitalized, a bank must have the minimum capital ratios required by the regulatory\ncapital rule described above. Institutions with lower capital ratios are assigned to lower capital categories. Based on safety and\nsoundness concerns, a bank may be assigned to a lower capital category than would otherwise apply based on its capital ratios. A bank\nthat is not well-capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits. A bank that is not at least\nadequately capitalized is subject to numerous additional restrictions, and a guaranty by its holding company is required. A bank with a"

See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTransactions with Related Parties. The Bank is subject to the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W, which comprehensively implements the\nrestrictions of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act on transactions between a bank and its “affiliates.” The sole “affiliate”\nof the Bank, as defined in Regulation W, is the Company. Section 23A and the implementing provisions of Regulation W generally\nplace limits on the amount of a bank’s loans or extensions of credit to, investments in, or certain other transactions with its affiliates,\nand on the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates. Section 23B and Regulation\nW generally require a bank’s transactions with affiliates to be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as\nthose prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies.\nThe Bank is also subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders and\ntheir related interests. Such extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as\nthose prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment\nor present other unfavorable features.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All insured depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community\nReinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”) and federal regulations thereunder to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including\nlow- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a state-chartered Federal Reserve member bank like\nthe Bank, the Federal Reserve is required to assess our record of meeting the credit needs of our entire community. The CRA requires\nthe Bank’s record of compliance with the CRA to be taken into account in the evaluation of applications by the Bank or the Company\nfor approval of an expansionary proposal, such as a merger or other acquisition of another bank or the opening of a new branch office.\nThe Bank received an “Outstanding” CRA rating in its most recent assessment received on August 22, 2022 by the Federal Reserve.\nIn June 2022, the Federal Reserve and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a joint proposal to amend their regulations\nimplementing the CRA. The proposed rules would materially revise the current CRA framework, including new assessment area\nrequirements, new methods of calculating credit for lending, investment, and service activities, and additional data collection and\nreporting requirements. The rulemaking process is in its early stages, and the final CRA rule’s impact to our financial condition and\nresults of operations cannot be predicted at this time.\nIn addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices\non the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. A failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fair Housing\nAct could result in enforcement actions by a bank’s principal federal regulatory agency, as well as by other federal regulatory agencies\nor the Department of Justice.\nOther Consumer Protection Laws. The Bank’s lending and deposit-taking operations are subject to numerous other federal and state\nlaws designed to protect consumers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) issues regulations and standards under the\nfederal consumer protection laws, which include, among others, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement\nProcedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act,\nand the Dodd-Frank Act’s prohibition on unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. The Bank’s consumer financial products and\nservices are subject to examination by the Federal Reserve for compliance with these and other CFPB regulations and standards.\nIn addition, customer privacy statutes and regulations limit the ability of the Bank to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-\naffiliated third parties. These laws require us to provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices and to give our\ncustomers an option to prevent their non-public personal information from being shared with non-affiliated third parties or with our\naffiliates.\nCybersecurity. The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and\ncybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of a banking organization’s board of directors. This\nguidance, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information\ntechnology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial products and services. The federal bank regulatory agencies expect\nfinancial institutions to establish appropriate security controls and to ensure that their risk management processes address the risk\nposed by compromised customer credentials, and also expect financial institutions to maintain sufficient business continuity planning\nprocesses to ensure rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack. If we fail to meet\nthe expectations set forth in such regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial\npenalties.\nIn November 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to improve the sharing of information about cyber incidents\nthat may affect the U.S. banking system. The rule, which became effective on May 1, 2022, requires a banking organization to notify its\nprimary federal regulator within 36 hours of determining that a “computer-security incident” has materially affected – or is reasonably"

      "text": "15\nlikely to materially affect – the viability of the banking organization’s operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services, or\nthe stability of the financial sector. In addition, the rule requires a bank service provider to notify affected banking organization customers\nas soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially affected or is\nreasonably likely to materially affect banking organization customers for four or more hours.\nBank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws\nand regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020. These laws and regulations\nrequire the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing\nand to verify the identity of their customers. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In\naddition, provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness\nof a financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions.\nCommercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management\npractices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that\nare dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial\nreal estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The\npurpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank’s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management\npractices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance directs the federal\nbanking agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration\nrisk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial\nreal estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with\nrespect to real estate concentration risk:\n§\nTotal reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the bank’s total regulatory\ncapital; or\n§\nTotal commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300% or more of the bank’s total regulatory capital and\nthe outstanding balance of the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36\nmonths.\nThe guidance provides that the strength of an institution’s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations\nwill be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy.\nRegulation of the Company. The Company is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act that has elected status as\na financial holding company. As such, we are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve. We are\nrequired to file quarterly reports with the Federal Reserve and provide such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require.\nThe Federal Reserve has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to\nassess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries\n(including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or\nunsound practices. We are also required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of, the SEC.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements. The federal regulatory capital rules apply to all depository institutions as well as to bank holding\ncompanies with consolidated assets of $3 billion or more. However, the regulatory capital requirements generally do not apply on a\nconsolidated basis to a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion unless the holding company: (1) is\nengaged in significant nonbanking activities either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; (2) conducts significant off-balance sheet\nactivities (including securitization and asset management or administration) either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; or (3) has\na material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding (other than trust preferred securities) that are registered with the SEC. The\nFederal Reserve may apply the regulatory capital standards at its discretion to any bank holding company, regardless of asset size, if\nsuch action is warranted for supervisory purposes.\nBecause the Company has total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion and does not engage in activities that would trigger application\nof the federal regulatory capital rules, it is not at present subject to consolidated capital requirements under such rules.\nAcquisitions. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, we are required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve to acquire\nownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank holding company or bank or\nmerge or consolidate with another bank holding company. Federal law authorizes bank holding companies to make interstate acquisitions\nof banks without geographic limitation.\nPermissible Activities. In general, the Bank Holding Company Act limits the activities of a bank holding company to those of banking,\nmanaging or controlling banks, or any other activity that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking or to\nmanaging or controlling banks that an exception is allowed for those activities. A bank holding company that qualifies and elects to be\ntreated as a “financial holding company” may engage in a broad range of additional activities that are (i) financial in nature or incidental"

These activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency\nand underwriting, and making merchant banking investments. On October 12, 2021, the Company filed an election to be treated as a\nfinancial holding company.\nIncentive Compensation. Federal banking agencies have issued guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the\nincentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by\nencouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of\nan organization, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide\nincentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible\nwith effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and\neffective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. In accordance with federal statute, the federal banking agencies prohibit\nincentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions (generally\ninstitutions that have over $1 billion in assets) and are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses.\nThe Federal Reserve reviews, as part of its standard, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of\nbanking organizations (such as the Company) that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews are tailored to\neach organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation\narrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies are incorporated into\nthe organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions.\nEnforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-\nmanagement control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking\nprompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on executive\ncompensation is likely to continue to evolve. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely\naffect the Company’s ability to hire, retain and motivate its key employees.\nIn October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges, including Nasdaq, to establish listing standards\nrequiring listed companies to adopt policies providing for the recovery or “clawback” of excess incentive-based compensation earned\nby current or former executive officers during the three fiscal years preceding the date the listed company determines an accounting\nrestatement is required. The SEC final rule will require us to adopt a clawback policy within 60 days after the Nasdaq listing standard\nbecomes effective.\nSource of Strength. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and\nmanagerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. Under this source of\nstrength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank.\nThe Federal Reserve may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if it fails to commit resources\nto such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the Federal Reserve believes might jeopardize its ability to commit resources\nto such subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company does not have the resources to provide\nit.\nIn addition, any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other\nindebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any\ncommitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the\nbankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the\ninstitution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations.\nPayment of Dividends. The Company is subject to various restrictions relating to the payment of dividends. The Federal Reserve has\nissued guidance indicating that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only if the company’s net income available to\ncommon shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention\nappears consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve’s guidance also\nstates that a bank holding company should inform and consult with its regional Federal Reserve Bank in advance of declaring or paying\na dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to\nthe organization’s capital structure. In addition, under Virginia law, the Company generally may not pay dividends or distributions to\nholders of common stock if it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business or if its total assets\nwould be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount of the liquidation preference of any class of shares with superior rights\nthan common stock.\nAs the majority of the Company’s revenues result from dividends paid to the Company by the Bank, the Company’s ability to pay\ndividends to our shareholders largely depends on the receipt of such dividends from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various laws and\nregulations limiting the amount of dividends that it can pay. Under Virginia law, without the permission of the Virginia State Corporation\nCommission, a state bank may not pay dividends, except from retained earnings. Under federal law applicable to state-chartered Federal\nReserve member banks, a bank may not declare or pay a dividend without prior Federal Reserve approval if the total of all dividends\ndeclared during the calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of the bank’s net income during the current calendar"

The Federal Reserve may also object to a proposed dividend based on\nsafety and soundness concerns.\nNo insured depository institution may pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the institution would be undercapitalized. In addition,\nas noted above, if the Bank does not maintain the capital conservation buffer required by applicable regulatory capital rules, its ability\nto pay dividends to the Company will be limited.\nFederal Securities Law. The Company’s common stock is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and the Company is\nsubject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC regulations.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThis section highlights material risks that the Company currently faces. Any of the risks described below, along with management’s\ndiscussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements and footnotes, could materially adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. Additional risks of which management currently is not aware or which management\ncurrently considers to not be material may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is\nno assurance that this section describes all potential risks to which the Company may be exposed.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCredit and Lending Risks\nOur business, like that of most banking organizations, is highly susceptible to credit risk.\nAs a lender, the Bank is exposed to the risk that borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to terms of the loan\nagreements and that the collateral securing payment of the loans (if any) may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have significant exposure to risks associated with commercial and residential real estate.\nA substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and residential real estate-related loans, including construction and\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $228.4 million of owner-occupied\nand $472.4 million of investment commercial real estate loans outstanding, which represented approximately 14.3% and 29.5%,\nrespectively, of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022. As of that same date, we had approximately $393.8 million of\nconstruction real estate loans and $394.4 million of residential real estate loans, which represented 24.6% and 24.7% respectively.\nThe adverse consequences from real estate-related credit risks tend to be cyclical and are often driven by local and national economic\ndevelopments that are not controllable or entirely foreseeable by us or our borrowers. As a result:\n§\nwe have a greater risk of loan defaults and losses in the event of economic weaknesses associated with commercial and residential\nreal estate in our market area and nationally, which may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to timely repay\ntheir loans or the value of collateral securing those loans; and\n§\nloan concentrations and the associated risks related to commercial and residential real estate may pose additional regulatory credit\nrisk concerns, including interest rate risk due to maturity considerations, liquidity risk due to funding considerations and risks to\nearnings and capital.\nDuring the ordinary course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans, in which event we\nbecome exposed to the costs and risks inherent in the ownership of commercial and residential real estate, which could have an adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is\ndependent upon factors outside of our control, including:\n§\ngeneral or local economic conditions,\n§\nenvironmental clean-up liabilities,\n§\nneighborhood values,\n§\ninterest rates,\n§\nreal estate tax rates,\n§\noperating expenses of the foreclosed properties,\n§\nsupply of and demand for rental units or properties,\n§\nability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties,\n§\nzoning laws\n§\ngovernmental rules, regulations, and fiscal policies,\n§\nextreme weather conditions or other natural or man-made disasters."

      "text": "18\nCertain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may also\nadversely affect our operating expenses.\nCommercial and industrial loans may expose us to greater financial and credit risk than other loans.\nCommercial and industrial loans can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans, including less collateral at\nliquidation. Any significant failure to pay on time by these customers would hurt our earnings. The increased financial and credit risks\nassociated with these types of loans result from several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans\nand borrowers, the size of loan balances, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties and the increased\ndifficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans and factors outside the borrowers' control such as adverse financial\nconditions and governmental regulations. In addition, when underwriting a commercial or industrial loan, we may take a security\ninterest in commercial real estate, and, in some instances upon a default by the borrower, we may foreclose on and take title to the\nproperty, which may lead to additional risks for us under applicable environmental laws described below.\nIn recent years commercial real estate markets both nationally and locally have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRemote employee work opportunities during the pandemic have impacted, and may continue to impact, the occupancy of commercial\nproperties. Weakness in our commercial real estate market could result in an increased delinquency rate and losses from these loans.\nWe believe that the resilience of our market and borrowers provides an ability to adjust to and withstand such risks. However,\nincreased losses from this portfolio could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe small-to-midsized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may\nimpair a borrower’s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small-to-midsized businesses. These businesses frequently\nhave smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional\ncapital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower’s\nability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small-to-midsized business often depends on the management skills, talents and\nefforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could\nhave an adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the markets\nin which we operate and small-to-midsized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise harmed by adverse\nbusiness developments, this, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe borrowing needs of our customers may increase, especially during a challenging economic environment, which could result in\nincreased borrowing against our contractual obligations to extend credit.\nA commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition\nestablished under the agreement. The actual borrowing needs of our customers under these credit commitments have historically been\nlower than the contractual amount of the commitments. A significant portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon.\nBecause of the credit profile of our customers, we typically have a substantial amount of total unfunded credit commitments, which is\nnot reflected on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, we had $435.8 million in unfunded credit commitments to our\ncustomers. Actual borrowing needs of our customers may exceed our expectations, especially during a challenging economic\nenvironment when our customers may be more dependent on our credit commitments due to the lack of available credit elsewhere, the\nincreasing costs of credit, or the limited availability of financings from venture firms. This could adversely affect our liquidity, which\ncould impair our ability to fund operations and meet obligations as they become due and could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual future losses.\nOur success depends significantly on the quality of our assets, particularly loans. Like all financial institutions, we are exposed to the\nrisk that our borrowers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may\nbe insufficient to fully compensate us for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\"), which includes the allowance for loan losses (\"ALLL\"), at a level we believe is\nadequate to absorb expected losses in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date. The process to determine the ACL\nuses models and assumptions that require us to make difficult and complex judgments that are often interrelated. This includes\nforecasting how borrowers will perform in changing and unprecedented economic conditions. The ability of our borrowers to repay\ntheir obligations will likely be impacted by changes in future economic conditions, which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss\nforecasts and allowance estimates. There is also the possibility that we have failed or will fail to accurately identify the appropriate\neconomic indicators, to accurately estimate the timing of future changes in economic conditions, or to estimate accurately the impacts\nof future changes in economic conditions to our borrowers, which similarly could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and\nallowance estimates.\nIf the models, estimates, and assumptions we use to establish reserves or the judgments we make in extending credit to our borrowers\nprove inaccurate in predicting future events, we may suffer unexpected losses. The ACL is our best estimate of expected credit losses;"

      "text": "19\nhowever, there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address credit losses, particularly if the economic outlook deteriorates\nsignificantly and quickly. In such an event, we may increase our ACL, which would reduce our earnings. Additionally, to the extent\nthat economic conditions worsen, impacting our consumer and commercial borrowers or underlying collateral, and credit losses are\nworse than expected, as may be caused by persistent inflation, an economic recession or otherwise, we may increase our provision for\nloan losses, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and could negatively impact our financial condition.\nContinuing deterioration in economic conditions, including inflation, a possible recession, higher interest rates, unresolved or new\nadverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and unanticipated problem loans, may necessitate an increase in our allowance for loan\nlosses. In addition, bank regulatory authorities may require an increase or future charge-offs based on their judgments which may differ\nfrom ours.\nWe may be required to increase our provisions for credit losses and to charge off loans in the future, which increases and charges could\nmaterially adversely affect us.\nThere is no precise method of predicting the timing of loan losses. We can give no assurance that our allowance for credit losses is or\nwill be sufficient to absorb actual loan losses. We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a\nprovision for loan losses charged to expense, that represents management’s estimable and observable losses within the existing\nportfolio of loans. The level of the allowance reflects management’s evaluation of, among other factors, the status of specific impaired\nloans, trends in historical loss experience, delinquency trends, credit concentrations and economic conditions within our market area.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and\njudgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current and expected future credit risks and future trends, any or all of\nwhich may undergo subsequent material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding\nexisting loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to\nincrease our allowance for loan losses. Increases in nonperforming loans have a significant impact on our allowance for loan losses.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase the provision for\nloan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that differ from those of management. If loan charge-offs in\nfuture periods exceed our allowance for loan losses, we will need to record additional provisions to increase our allowance for loan\nlosses. Furthermore, growth in our loan portfolio would generally lead to an increase in the provision for loan losses. Generally, increases\nin our allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and shareholders’ equity, and may have a material adverse effect\non our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Material additions to our allowance could also materially decrease our\nnet income and, possibly, capital, and may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur credit standards and judgments and our ongoing process of credit assessment might not protect us from significant credit losses.\nWe extend credit to a variety of customers based on internally established standards, judgments and procedures. We manage credit risk\nthrough a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit decisions and an on-going process of assessment of the quality\nof the credit already extended. We avoid highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. Our credit\nadministration function employs risk management techniques to ensure that loans adhere to corporate policy and problem loans are\npromptly identified. While these procedures are designed to provide us with the information needed to implement policy adjustments\nwhere necessary, and to take proactive corrective actions, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding\nundue credit risk.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nIn the course of our business, we may purchase real estate, or we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. Although we exercise\nprudent due diligence when making loans, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be\nheld liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred\nby these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic\nsubstances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In\naddition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based\non damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Any significant environmental\nliabilities could cause an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change could have a material negative impact on us.\nClimate change could negatively impact our business, as well as the operations and activities of our customers. Climate change could\npresent both immediate and long-term risks to our operations, and these risks could increase over time. Climate change could\npresent multi-faceted risks, including operational risks from the physical effects of environmental events on our facilities and other\nassets, as well as those of our customers; potential credit risk from borrowers with significant exposure to environmental risk; and\npotential reputational risk from shareholder and public comments and concerns about our practices related to climate change and our\nrelationships with customers and vendors who operate in environmentally sensitive industries. Our business, reputation and ability to\nattract and retain employees could also be harmed if our responses to climate change are negatively perceived."

      "text": "20\nInterest Rate Risks\nChanges in interest rates may negatively affect our earnings, income and financial condition as well as the value of our assets.\nOur earnings and cash flows depend substantially upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest\nincome earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing\nliabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including\ngeneral economic conditions, competition, and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and the policies of the\nFederal Reserve.\nIn an attempt to help the overall economy and in response to inflationary pressures, throughout 2022 the Federal Reserve increased its\ntargeted Fed Funds rate. The Federal Reserve also announced its intention to take other actions to mitigate growing signs of inflation.\nAs the Federal Reserve continues to increase the targeted Fed Funds rate, overall interest rates have been impacted.\nChanges in monetary policy, including rapid changes in interest rates, not only could influence the interest we receive on loans and\ninvestment securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect: (1) our ability\nto originate loans and obtain deposits; (2) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, including our securities portfolio; and (3)\nthe average duration of our interest-earning assets. Interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than\ninterest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest-earning assets\nand interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period (basis risk), and interest rate relationships\nmay change across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk), including a prolonged\nflat or inverted yield curve environment. Higher interest payment obligations could also advesely affect certain borrowers, particularly\nour floating-rate borrowers. Substantial and prolonged increases in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operation.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the transition from the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a reference rate.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) has been used extensively in the United States and globally as a reference rate for\nvarious commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable-rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other\nderivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks for short-term loans.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intended to stop persuading or compelling banks to\nsubmit LIBOR rates after 2021.\nIn March 2022, the U.S. Government enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act to provide a transition for legacy contracts\nthat either lack or contain insufficient provisions addressing the cessation of LIBOR by providing for the transition to the applicable\nreference rate identified by the Federal Reserve on June 30, 2023 (the \"LIBOR replacement date\"). Effective in February 2023, the\nFederal Reserve adopted a final rule which establishes benchmark replacement rates to replace LIBOR on the LIBOR replacement\ndate. The final rule identifies SOFR-based Federal Reserve selected benchmark replacements for LIBOR contracts that will not mature\nprior to the LIBOR replacement date and do not contain clear and practicable benchmark replacements.\nThe Secured Oversight Financing Rate (SOFR) is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward-looking secured rate rather than a\nforward-looking unsecured rate. These differences could lead to a greater disconnect between our costs to raise funds for SOFR as\ncompared to LIBOR.\nWe have discontinued originating LIBOR-based financial instruments and are now originating loans based on SOFR. Until\nreplacement rates are fully established, and all agreements have been addressed, we will continue to have a number of loans, derivative\ncontracts, and other financial instruments with attributes that are directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. We are currently unable\nto assess the ultimate impact of the LIBOR transition.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations, meet our obligations as they become due, and jeopardize our financial\ncondition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources\ncould have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities,\nor on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or the\neconomy in general. Factors that could detrimentally affect our access to liquidity sources include, among other things, a decrease in\nthe level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated and an adverse\nregulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in\nthe financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nAmong other sources of funds, we rely heavily on deposits for funds to make loans and provide for our other liquidity needs. However,\nour loan demand has historically exceeded the rate at which we have been able to build core deposits for which there is substantial\ncompetition from a variety of different competitors, so we have relied on interest-sensitive deposits, including wholesale deposits, as"

Those deposits may not be as stable as other types of deposits and, in the future, depositors may not renew those\ndeposits when they mature, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to attract or retain them or to replace them with other deposits\nor with funds from other sources. Not being able to attract deposits, or to retain or replace them as they mature, would adversely affect\nour liquidity. Paying higher deposit rates to attract, retain or replace those deposits could have a negative effect on our interest margin\nand operating results. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operation.\nOperational Risks\nNew lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject us to additional risks.\nGeneral. From time to time, we implement new lines of business, or offer new products and product enhancements as well as new\nservices within our existing lines of business and we will continue to do so in the future. There are substantial risks and uncertainties\nassociated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In implementing, developing, or\nmarketing new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, we may invest significant time and resources, although\nwe may not assign the appropriate level of resources or expertise necessary to make these new lines of business, products, product\nenhancements or services successful or to realize their expected benefits. Further, initial timetables for the introduction and\ndevelopment of new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability\ntargets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market\npreferences, may also impact the ultimate implementation of a new line of business or offerings of new products, product\nenhancements or services. Furthermore, any new line of business, product, product enhancement or service could have a significant\nimpact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and\nimplementation of new lines of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services could have an adverse impact\non our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nPayments Services. In 2016, we added a new funding source by way of facilitating payment services. We are continuing to identify and\nsolicit new customers in need of these specialized services. The primary reasons for expanding into payment services are to secure an\nadditional source of low-cost deposits and to capture additional fee income. A bank’s risks when dealing with a processor account are\nsimilar to risks from other activities in which customers conduct transactions through the bank on behalf of the customers’ clients. It is\nnecessary for a bank to implement an adequate processor approval, monitoring and auditing program that extends beyond credit risk\nmanagement and is conducted on an ongoing basis. When a bank is not able to identify and understand the nature and source of\ntransactions processed through accounts, the bank’s risks and the likelihood of suspicious activity can increase. Without these\nprecautions, a bank could be vulnerable to processing illicit or sanctioned transactions.\nBaaS Software Solutions. In 2021, the Company began development of a proprietary BaaS software solution, AvenuTM, which provides\nan embedded banking solution that connects our partners (fintechs, application developers, money movers, and entrepreneurs) directly\nand seamlessly to our Software as a Service (SaaS) solution. Developing and deploying a software program may add additional risk.\nWe face risks related to our operational, technological, and organizational infrastructure.\nOur ability to grow and compete is dependent on the Company’s ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological\ninfrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure as we expand. In our case, operational risk can manifest itself in many\nways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or outside\npersons and exposure to external events. As discussed below, we are dependent on our operational infrastructure to help manage these\nrisks. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems that the Company uses both to\ninterface with customers and to manage internal financial and other systems. Our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet\nthe needs of our existing customers and attract new ones depends on the functionality of our technology systems. Additionally, our\nability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is dependent on these infrastructures.\nWe continuously monitor our operational and technological capabilities and make modifications and improvements as circumstances\nwarrant. In some instances, the Company may build and maintain these capabilities itself. We outsource many of these functions to third\nparties. These third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact the Company and over which it may have\nlimited control. We also face risk from the integration of new infrastructure platforms and/or new third-party providers of such platforms\ninto the Company’s existing businesses.\nMany of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be\nable to offer additional or superior technologies compared to those that we will be able to provide, which could put us at a competitive\ndisadvantage. Accordingly, we may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to\ncompete effectively.\nA failure or a breach of our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third-party service providers, could disrupt our business,\nresult in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation and cause financial losses.\nOperations Risk. Our business is dependent on our ability to process, store and transmit, on a daily basis, a number of transactions.\nThese transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific\nguidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure is"

Our financial,\naccounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of\nevents that are wholly or partially beyond the Company’s control, such as a spike in transaction volume, cyber-attack or other\nunforeseen catastrophic events, which may adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide services.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, proprietary and other information on\nour computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of\nour and our clients’ information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as\ncircumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be\nvulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential and proprietary client information), account\ntakeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events that could have an adverse\nsecurity impact. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats\nmay originate externally from third parties such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or\ninfrastructure-support providers and application developers or may originate internally from within our organization. Given the\nincreasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination, or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our\nbusiness activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be\nthe source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, as interconnectivity with our clients\ngrows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect to our clients’ systems.\nVendor Support Risk. As discussed below, we rely on external vendors to support our operations. We also rely on vendors to provide\npart of our services we deliver to customers. While we have a vendor management program policy in place and believe we have selected\nour vendors appropriately, we cannot directly control their employees or their operating environments. A breach or failure of a chosen\nvendor could have a material adverse impact on our operating environment. Replacing a chosen vendor could also result in a significant\ndelay and expense.\nInternet Risk. Our services and technology solutions rely on the internet more and more. Computers connected to the internet are\nvulnerable to many types of threats by cyber criminals. Although none of these types of attacks have had a material impact on our\nbusiness to date, we anticipate that the efforts to attack our systems, and those of our customers and vendors, will grow in complexity\nand volume. As such, we have developed an incident response plan to coordinate the efforts following the identification of an attack.\nFailure to maintain a secure computing environment, stay up to date on security vulnerabilities or deploy adequate technologies to\nprotect against attacks, may subject our information and systems to security breaches that could compromise confidential information\nand damage our reputation and business. We rely on industry-standard encryption and authentication security systems to provide the\nsecurity required to protect our data. Periodically our systems are subjected to scans, exploitations and audits by a qualified independent\nthird party to evaluate the effectiveness of our security controls and system configurations.\nCyber criminals may attempt to trick employees, customers or vendors through phishing schemes or other methods to disclose sensitive\ninformation. Employees receive annual security training and are periodically assessed through simulated attack tools to assist with\nbehavior shaping and coaching against social engineering threats.\nIf one or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and\nstored in, and transmitted through, the Company’s computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in\nour, as well as our clients’ or other third parties’ operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, substantial costs, regulatory\npenalties and/or client dissatisfaction or loss.\nPotential costs of a cyber incident may include, but would not be limited to, remediation costs, increased protection costs, lost revenue\nfrom the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the loss of current and/or future customers, and litigation.\nInsurance Risk. We maintain an insurance policy through the Company’s blanket bond at the maximum of currently available limits.\nHowever, we cannot assure you that this policy would be sufficient to cover all financial losses, damages, and penalties, including lost\nrevenues, should the Company experience any one or more of our or a third party’s systems failing or experiencing attack.\nA cyber-attack or other security incident, including one that results in the theft, loss, manipulation, or misuse of information (including\npersonal information), or the disabling of systems and access to information critical to business operations, may result in increased\ncosts, reductions in revenue, reputational damage, legal exposure and business disruptions.\nOur ability to provide our products and services, many of which are internet-based, and communicate with our customers, depends\nupon the management and safeguarding of information systems and infrastructure, networks, software, data, technology,\nmethodologies, and business secrets, including those of our service providers. Our products and services involve the collection,\nauthentication, management, usage, storage, transmission, and eventual destruction of sensitive and confidential information,\nincluding personal information, regarding our customers and their accounts, our employees, our partners and other third parties with\nwhich we do business. We also have arrangements in place with third parties through which we share and receive information about"

The financial services industry, including the Company, is particularly at risk\nbecause of the use of and reliance on digital banking products and other digital services, including mobile banking products, such as\nmobile payments, and other internet- and cloud-based products and applications, and the development of additional remote\nconnectivity solutions, which increase cybersecurity risks and exposure.\nTechnologies, systems, networks, and other devices of the Bank as well as those of our employees, service providers, partners and other\nthird parties with whom we interact, have been and may continue to be the subject of cyber-attacks and other security incidents, including\ncomputer viruses, hacking, malware, ransomware, supply chain attacks, vulnerabilities, credential stuffing, or phishing or other forms\nof social engineering. Such cyber-attacks and other security incidents are designed to lead to various harmful outcomes, such as\nunauthorized transactions in the Bank’s accounts, unauthorized or unintended access to or release, gathering, monitoring, disclosure,\nloss, destruction, corruption, disablement, encryption, misuse, modification or other processing of confidential or sensitive information\n(including personal information), intellectual property, software, methodologies or business secrets, disruption, sabotage or degradation\nof service, systems or networks, or other damage. These threats may derive from, among other things, error, fraud, or malice on the part\nof our employees, insiders, or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure or design flaws. Any of these parties may\nalso attempt to fraudulently induce employees, service providers, customers, partners or other third-party users of our systems or\nnetworks to disclose confidential or sensitive information (including personal information) in order to gain access to our systems,\nnetworks or data or that of our customers, partners, or third parties with whom we interact, or to unlawfully obtain monetary benefit\nthrough misdirected or otherwise improper payment. For instance, any party that obtains our confidential or sensitive information\n(including personal information) through a cyber-attack or other security incident may use this information for ransom, to be paid by us\nor a third party, as part of a fraudulent activity that is part of a broader criminal activity, or for other illicit purposes.\nCyber and information security risks for financial institutions like us continue to increase due to the proliferation of new technologies,\nthe industry-wide shift to reliance upon the internet to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of\nmalicious actors, organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, activists, extremist parties, formal and informal\ninstrumentalities of foreign governments, state-sponsored actors and other external parties. In addition, our customers access our\nproducts and services using personal devices that are necessarily external to our security control systems. There has also been a\nsignificant proliferation of consumer information available on the internet resulting from breaches of third-party entities, including\npersonal information, log-in credentials, and authentication data. This threat could include the risk of unauthorized account access, data\nloss and fraud. The use of artificial intelligence, “bots” or other automation software can increase the velocity and efficacy of these types\nof attacks. We will likely face an increasing number of attempted cyber-attacks as we expand our mobile and other internet-based\nproducts and services, as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies and as we provide more of these services to a greater\nnumber of banking customers.\nThe methods and techniques employed by malicious actors change frequently, are increasingly sophisticated and often are not fully\nrecognized or understood until after they have occurred, and some techniques could occur and persist for an extended period of time\nbefore being detected and remediated. We may also be unable to hire, develop and retain talent that keeps pace with the rapidly changing\ncyber threat landscape, and which are capable of preventing, detecting, mitigating or remediating these risks. Although we seek to\nmaintain a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls, any one or combination of these controls could fail\nto prevent, detect, mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner.\nA disruption or breach, including as a result of a cyber-attack or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities at the Bank or at our\nservice providers, could result in legal and financial exposure, regulatory intervention, litigation, remediation costs, card reissuance,\nsupervisory liability, damage to our reputation or loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services that could\nadversely affect our business. There can be no assurance that unauthorized access or cyber incidents will not occur or that we will not\nsuffer material losses in the future. If future attacks are successful or if customers are unable to access their accounts online for other\nreasons, it could adversely impact our ability to service customer accounts or loans, complete financial transactions for our customers\nor otherwise operate any of our businesses or services. In addition, a breach or attack affecting one of our service providers or other third\nparties with which we interact could harm our business even if we do not control the service that is attacked.\nFurther, our ability to monitor our service providers’ cybersecurity practices is limited. Although the agreements that we have in place\nwith our service providers generally include requirements relating to cybersecurity and data privacy, we cannot guarantee that such\nagreements will prevent a cyber incident impacting our systems or information or enable us to obtain adequate or any reimbursement\nfrom our service providers in the event we should suffer any such incidents.\nIn addition, the increasing prevalence and the evolution of cyber-attacks and other efforts to breach or disrupt our systems or networks\nor those of our customers, service providers, partners or other third parties with which we interact has led, and will likely continue to\nlead, to increased costs to us with respect to preventing, detecting, mitigating and remediating these risks, as well as any related attempted\nfraud. In order to address ongoing and future risks, we must expend resources to support protective security measures, investigate and\nremediate any vulnerabilities of our information systems and infrastructure and invest in new technology designed to mitigate security\nrisks. Further, high profile cyber incidents at the Bank or other financial institutions could lead to a general loss of customer confidence\nin financial institutions that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security\nmeasures or the global financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our financial products. We have insurance\nagainst some cyber risks and attacks; nonetheless, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss"

Our business depends on the successful and uninterrupted\nfunctioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. The failure of these systems, or\nthe termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our\noperations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems,\nwe could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity, or such third-party systems fail or experience\ninterruptions. Replacing vendors or addressing other issues with our third-party service providers could entail significant delay and\nexpense. If we are unable to efficiently replace ineffective service providers, or if we experience a significant, sustained or repeated\nsystem failure or service denial, it could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of\ncustomer business, and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReputational risk and social factors may impact our results.\nOur ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon consumer and other external perceptions, whether or not\ntrue, of our business practices and/or our financial health. Adverse perceptions could damage our reputation in both the customer and\nfunding markets, leading to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. Adverse developments\nwith respect to the consumer or other external perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, may\nalso adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse reputational impacts on third parties with whom we have important\nrelationships may also adversely impact our reputation. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also\nresult in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that may change or constrain the manner\nin which the Company engages with its customers and the products the Company offers. Adverse reputational impacts or events may\nalso increase our litigation risk. We carefully monitor internal and external developments for areas of potential reputational risk and\nhave established governance structures to assist in evaluating such risks in our business practices and decisions.\nWe could be subject to losses, regulatory action, or reputational harm due to fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants,\nour employees and vendors.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, and the terms of any such\ntransaction, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements,\nproperty appraisals, title information, employment and income documentation, account information and other financial information.\nWe may also rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with\nrespect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Any such misrepresentation or incorrect or incomplete information,\nwhether fraudulent or inadvertent, may not be detected prior to funding. In addition, one or more of our employees or vendors could\ncause a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or\nfraudulently manipulates our loan documentation, operations or systems. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or\nanother third party, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. A loan subject to a material\nmisrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation. The sources of\nthe misrepresentations may also be difficult to locate, and we may be unable to recover any of the monetary losses we may suffer as a\nresult of the misrepresentations. Any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to intellectual property.\nBanking and other financial services companies, such as ours, rely on technology companies to provide information technology\nproducts and services necessary to support their day-to-day operations. Technology companies frequently enter into litigation based on\nallegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to\nmonetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. Competitors of our vendors, or other individuals or companies, may from\ntime to time claim to hold intellectual property sold to us by our vendors. Such claims may increase in the future as the financial\nservices sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions\nand substantial damages.\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual\nlitigants, we may have to engage in protracted litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations\nand distracting to management. If we are found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, we may be required\nto pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party. In certain cases, we may consider entering into licensing agreements for disputed\nintellectual property, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will\nnot occur. These licenses may also significantly increase our operating expenses. If legal matters related to intellectual property claims\nwere resolved against us or settled, we could be required to make payments in amounts that could have an adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. As described below these competitors include banks, other financial institution and non-\nbanks offering services and products previously only provided by banks."

New\nvariants could adversely disrupt our future operations.\nStrategic Risks\nStrong competition within our market area could reduce our profits and slow growth.\nWe face strong competition in making loans, attracting deposits and hiring and retaining experienced employees from various\ncompetitors, many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than the Company. Price competition for loans and\ndeposits may result in our charging lower interest rates on loans and paying higher interest rates on deposits, thereby reducing our net\ninterest income. Price competition also may limit our ability to originate loans and adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nCompetition makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur financial performance will be negatively affected if we are unable to execute our growth strategy.\nOur stated growth strategy is to grow organically and supplement that growth with select acquisitions, if available. Our success\ndepends primarily on generating loans and deposits of acceptable risk and expense. There can be no assurance that we will be\nsuccessful in continuing our organic, or internal, growth strategy. Our ability to identify appropriate markets for expansion, recruit and\nretain qualified personnel, and fund growth at reasonable cost, depends upon prevailing economic conditions, maintenance of\nsufficient capital, competitive factors, changes in banking laws, and other factors.\nWe cannot be certain as to our ability to manage increased levels of assets and liabilities without increased expenses and higher levels\nof nonperforming assets. We may be required to make additional investments in equipment and personnel to manage higher asset levels\nand loan balances, which may adversely affect earnings, shareholder returns, and our efficiency ratio. Increases in operating expenses\nor nonperforming assets may decrease our earnings and the value of the Company’s capital stock.\nWe may face increasing deposit-pricing pressures, which may, among other things, reduce our profitability.\nDeposit pricing pressures may result from competition as well as changes to the interest rate environment. Current economic\nconditions have intensified competition for deposits. The competition has had an impact on interest rates paid to attract deposits as\nwell as fees charged on deposit products. In addition to the competitive pressures from other depository institutions, we face\nheightened competition from non-depository financial products such as securities and other alternative investments.\nFurthermore, technology and other market changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds for investing\npurposes. Bank customers also have greater access to deposit vehicles that facilitate spreading deposit balances among different\ndepository institutions to maximize FDIC insurance coverage. In addition to competitive forces, we also are at risk from market forces\nas they affect interest rates. It is not uncommon when interest rates transition from a low interest rate environment to a rising rate\nenvironment, for deposit and other funding costs to rise in advance of yields on earning assets. In order to keep deposits required for\nfunding purposes, it may be necessary to raise deposit rates without commensurate increases in asset pricing in the short term.\nIn recent years it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted\nfederal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. As a result, market rates on the loans we have originated and the\nyields on securities we have purchased have been at historically low levels. As discussed above, rates are fluctuating, and due to a\nnumber of factors including changes in monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, will likely continue to fluctuate.\nExternal and Market-Related Risks\nChanges in general business, economic and political conditions, especially in our market area, could adversely affect our growth and\nearnings."

Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, money supply and\nother factors beyond our control may adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore our growth and\nearnings. In addition, there are continuing concerns related to, among other things, the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal actions\nthat may be taken to address that debt, a potential resurgence of economic and political tensions with China or an escalation of tensions\nbetween Russia and Ukraine, all of which may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets and economic activity. Economic pressure\non consumers, businesses and overall economic uncertainty may result in changes in spending, borrowing, and saving habits. These\neconomic conditions and other negative developments in the domestic or international credit markets and economies may significantly\naffect the markets in which we do business. Because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, decreases in real estate values\ncould adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Adverse changes in\nthe economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would\nhave an adverse impact on our earnings. If during a period of reduced real estate values, we are required to liquidate the collateral\nsecuring a loan to satisfy the debt or to increase our allowance for loan losses, it could materially reduce our profitability and adversely\naffect our financial condition. The substantial majority of our loans are to individuals and businesses in the Northern Virginia and\nWashington D.C metropolitan area. Consequently, significant declines in the economy in the Northern Virginia and Washington D.C.\nmetropolitan area could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, such as coronavirus (“COVID-19”), could lead to\nquarantines, business shutdowns, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, disruptions to supply chains, and overall economic\ninstability. Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage such as disrupt power and\ncommunication services, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to\nrepay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, which could result in the loss of revenue. While we\nhave established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect\non our business, operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not adjust to rapid changes in the financial services industry, our financial performance may suffer.\nWe face substantial competition for customer relationships, as well as other sources of funding in the communities we serve.\nCompeting providers include other banks, savings institutions and trust companies, insurance companies, mortgage banking\noperations, credit unions, finance companies, title companies, money market funds and other financial and nonfinancial companies\nwhich offer products functionally equivalent to those available at the Bank. Many competing providers have greater financial\nresources than we do and offer services within and outside the market areas we serve. In addition to this challenge of attracting and\nretaining customers for traditional banking services, our competitors include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment\nadvisors and finance and insurance companies who seek to offer one-stop financial services to their customers that may include\nservices that financial institutions have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past. The increasingly competitive\nenvironment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating\npace of consolidation among financial service providers. If we are unable to adjust both to increased competition for traditional\nbanking services and changing customer needs and preferences, our financial performance and your investment in our capital stock\ncould be adversely affected.\nAdditional required capital may not be available.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, we may\nelect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may otherwise elect or be required to\nraise additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic\nconditions, and a number of other factors, many of which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly,\nthere can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional\ncapital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCompliance and Regulatory Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, our primary federal regulator, the\nVirginia Bureau of Financial Institutions, our chartering authority and the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits. Such regulation and\nsupervision govern the activities in which we may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the\ndepositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Various consumers and compliance laws also\naffect our operations.\nRegulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions\non our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such\nregulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation, or supervisory action, may have a material\nimpact on our operations. The earnings of the Bank, and therefore the earnings of the Company, are affected by changes in federal and\nstate legislation and actions of various regulatory authorities."

There are many factors that may impact the market price and trading volume of our common stock, including,\nwithout limitation:\n§\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, financial condition, or asset quality,\n§\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors,\n§\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance,\n§\noperating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us,\n§\nfuture issuances of our common stock or other securities,\n§\nchanges in general economic or business conditions,\n§\nchanges in the credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and\ndevelopments with respect to financial institutions generally,\n§\nproposed or adopted changes in laws, regulations or policies affecting us,\n§\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving\nour competitors or us, and\n§\nother economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products,\nand services.\nThe Company depends on the Bank for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nThere can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends in the future. Cash available to pay dividends to our\nshareholders is derived primarily, if not entirely, from dividends paid to us from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to\nus as well as our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is limited by regulatory and legal restrictions and the need to maintain\nsufficient consolidated capital. We may also decide to limit the payment of dividends even when we have the legal ability to pay them\nin order to retain capital for use in our business. Further, any lenders making loans to us may impose financial covenants that may be\nmore restrictive than regulatory requirements with respect to the payment of dividends.\nWe are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock if the required payments on our subordinated debentures have not\nbeen made. Additionally, dividends on our common stock could be adversely impacted if dividend payments on our preferred stock\nhave not been made.\nAlthough we have paid cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the past, we may not pay cash dividends on shares of our\ncommon stock in the future.\nHolders of shares of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds\nlegally available for such purpose. We have a history of paying dividends to our shareholders. However, future cash dividends will\ndepend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the need to\ncomply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory expectations, and other factors, including the ability of the\nBank to make distributions to us, which ability may be restricted by statutory, contractual, or other constraints. There can be no\nassurance that we will continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial and regulatory conditions are met and if sufficient\ncash is available for distribution.\nOur common stock is subordinate to our existing and future preferred stock and to our subordinated notes.\nThe Company has outstanding preferred stock that is senior to the common stock and could adversely affect the ability of the\nCompany to declare or pay dividends or distributions of common stock. In addition, the terms of the Company’s outstanding fixed-to-\nfloating rate subordinated notes prohibit it from declaring or paying any dividends, or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation\npayment with respect to, its capital stock, during an event of default under the subordinated note purchase agreement. Furthermore, if\nthe Company experiences a material deterioration in its financial condition, liquidity, capital, results of operations or risk profile, the\nCompany’s regulators may not permit it to make future payments on its preferred stock, thereby preventing the payment of dividends\non the common stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure\nrequirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take\nadvantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth\ncompanies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and\nproxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and\nstockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company, we also are\nnot subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest\nas to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

In addition to the relief described above, the JOBS Act permits us\nan extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. We have elected\nnot to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means that the financial statements included in this Form 10-K, as well\nas any financial statements that we file in the future, will be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to\npublic companies.\nWe will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i)the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.07\nbillion or more; (ii)the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible\ndebt securities; or (iii)the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700\nmillion as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year, or five years after completing our initial public offering. Investors may\nfind our common stock less attractive because we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less\nattractive as a result of our choices to reduce disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price\nof our common stock may be more volatile.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe will depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations, and we could be harmed\nby the loss of their services.\nWe are dependent upon the services of the members of our senior management team who direct our strategy and operations. Members\nof our senior management team, as well as commercial lending specialists who possess expertise in our markets and key business\nrelationships, could be difficult to replace. The loss of these persons, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could\nimpact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our\nability to compete in our markets.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in\nwhich we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need. In order to attract and retain\nqualified employees, we must compensate our employees at market levels. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified\nemployees or do so at rates necessary to maintain our competitive position, our performance, including our competitive position, could\nsuffer, and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The number of experienced banking\nprofessionals in our markets may not be the same as in certain other markets.\nWe may be subject to increased litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to our reputation.\nWe may be named from time to time as a defendant in litigation relating to its business and activities. Litigation may include claims\nfor substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We are also involved from time to\ntime in other reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self- regulatory agencies\nregarding its business. These matters also could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other relief.\nIn addition, in recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of\nvarious evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability.” Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender\nhas either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree\nof control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.\nSubstantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against the Company could materially adversely affect its business, financial\ncondition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to our reputation.\nOur reported financial results depend on management’s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nOur accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to the Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations.\nManagement must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so that they comply\nwith generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management’s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our\nfinancial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more\nalternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in the Company’s reporting materially different\nresults than would have been reported under an alternative method.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nAs a public company, we face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs, and expenses that we have not previously\nincurred, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the\nExchange Act, which requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition\nand proxy and other information statements, and the applicable rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct, the Dodd-Frank Act, the PCAOB and the Nasdaq Stock Market, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations\non public companies."

The discussion of the critical accounting policies and analysis set forth below is intended to supplement and\nhighlight information contained in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the selected financial data presented\nelsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, the financial statements require certain estimates,\njudgments, and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable, based upon the information available. These estimates and\nassumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nincome and expenses during the periods presented. Critical accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most\ncritical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These policies require numerous estimates or\neconomic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results\nand financial condition for the current period or in future periods.\nThe accounting principles followed by the Company and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America and with general practices within the banking industry. The Company’s critical\naccounting policies relate to (1) the allowance for loan losses, (2) fair value of financial instruments, and (3) derivative financial\ninstruments. These critical accounting policies require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments which are based on information\navailable as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, as this information changes, future financial statements could reflect\nthe use of different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain determinations inherently have a greater reliance on the use of"

Management performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan\nportfolio to identify trends and to assess the overall collectability of the loan portfolio. Accounting standards require that loan losses be\nrecorded when management determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably\nestimated.\nThe allowance consists of a specific component and a general component. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as\nimpaired and is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower\nthan the carrying value of that loan. For impaired collateral dependent loans, an updated appraisal will typically be ordered if a current\none is not on file. Appraisals are performed by independent third-party appraisers with relevant industry experience. Adjustments to the\nappraised value may be made based on recent sales of like properties or general market conditions when appropriate. The general\ncomponent covers non-classified or performing loans and those loans classified as substandard or special mention that are not impaired.\nThe general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors, such as current economic conditions,\nincluding current home sales and foreclosures, unemployment rates and retail sales. Non-impaired classified loans are assigned a higher\nallowance factor based on an internal migration analysis, which increases with the severity of classification, than non-classified loans.\nEstimates for the allowance for loan losses are determined by analyzing historical losses, historical migration to charge-off experience,\ncurrent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, the results of regulatory examinations and changes in the size, composition and risk\nassessment of the loan portfolio. Also included in management’s estimate for the allowance for loan losses are considerations with\nrespect to the impact of current economic events. These events may include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in overall interest rates,\npolitical conditions, legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific\ngeographical areas and industries in which the Company conducts business.\nWhile management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance\nfor loan losses and methodology may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in\nmaking the estimates. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other\nrelevant considerations indicate that loss levels vary from previous estimates. A detailed discussion of the methodology used in\ndetermining the allowance for loan losses is included in Note 1, Basis of Presentation, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments: A portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities is carried at fair value, with changes in fair value\nrecorded either in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These include investment securities available for sale\nand interest rate loan swaps on qualifying commercial loans. Periodically, the estimation of fair value also affects investment securities\nheld to maturity when it is determined that an impairment write-down is other than temporary. Fair value determination is also relevant\nfor certain other assets such as other real estate owned, which is recorded at the lower of the recorded balance or fair value, less estimated\ncosts to sell. The determination of fair value also impacts certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair\nvalue estimates, including impaired loans.\nFair value is generally based upon quoted market prices, when available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is\nbased upon internally developed models that primarily use observable market-based parameters as inputs. Valuation adjustments may\nbe made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty\ncredit quality and the Company’s creditworthiness, among other things, as well as other unobservable parameters. Any such valuation\nadjustments are applied consistently over time. While management believes the Company’s valuation methodologies are appropriate\nand consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain\nfinancial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nSee Note 20, Fair Value Presentation, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value,\nincluding pricing validation processes.\nDerivative Financial Instruments: The Bank recognizes derivative financial instruments at fair value as either other assets or other\nliabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The Bank’s derivative financial instruments include interest rate swaps with certain\nqualifying commercial loan customers and dealer counterparties. Because the interest rate swaps with loan customers and dealer\ncounterparties are not designated as hedging instruments, adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in\nfair value of these instruments are reported as noninterest income or noninterest expense, as applicable. The Bank’s interest rate swaps\nwith loan customers and dealer counterparties are described more fully in Note 19 in the December 31, 2022, Consolidated Financial\nStatements."

The increase in net income was due to $16.5 million of additional net interest income,\nprimarily driven by increased volume of loans and increase in interest rates. The increase net interest income was offset by an increase\nin non-interest expenses of $6.2 million primarily in salaries and employee benefits and general operating expenses.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income is the principal component of the Company’s income stream and represents the difference, or spread, between\ninterest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest\nmargin, stated as a percentage, is the yield obtained by dividing the difference between interest income generated on earning assets\nand the interest expense paid on all funding sources by average earning assets. Fluctuations in interest rates as well as changes in the\nvolume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities can impact net interest income and net interest margin.\nNet interest income before provision for or recovery of loan losses totaled $70.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,\ncompared to $53.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net interest income was driven by an increase in\nloan production and increase in interest rates on variable rate credits and loans that repriced during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe net interest margin was 4.19% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 3.35% for the year ended December 31, 2021,\non a fully tax equivalent basis. The increase in net interest margin primarily resulted from an increase of income on our interest earning\nassets that outpaced the increase on average rates of our cost of funds, primarily in interest-bearing deposits, money market deposits and\nother borrowings. The increase in the federal funds target rate will impact wholesale deposits that will reprice in a higher interest rate\nenvironment, which will increase margin pressure on our loan portfolio and other interest earning assets.\nThe yield for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the loan portfolio was 5.47% compared to 4.79% for the year ended December 31,\n2021. The increase primarily reflects the maturity of lower yielding loans and higher yields on new and variable rate loans based on\nhigher interest rates during the year. The Federal Reserve increased its targeted benchmark interest rate 425 - 450 basis points by the year\nend, which impacted yields obtained on new loans throughout the year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the yield on the taxable investment securities portfolio was 2.20% compared to 2.08% for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the yield on the tax-exempt investment securities portfolio was\n3.48% compared to 3.42% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in both categories was primarily due to rates on variable\nsecurities increasing with the current rate environment and lower yields on investment securities maturing during the period.\nThe rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased to 1.14% during the year ended December 31, 2022, from 0.90% during the year\nended December 31, 2021. This increase was a result of higher rates paid on all outstanding deposits in conjunction with the increasing\nrate environment throughout the year.\nThe rate paid on FHLB borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1.45% compared to the prior year when the bank did not\nhave any FHLB borrowings outstanding.\nThe following table sets forth the major components of net interest income and the related yields and rates for the year ended December\n31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021."

In determining the level of the allowance for loan losses, we consider past and current loss experience, evaluations\nof real estate collateral, current economic conditions, volume and type of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower’s\nability to repay a loan and the levels of non-performing loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates, and actual losses\nmay vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or economic conditions change.\nThis evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as circumstances change as\nmore information becomes available. The allowance for loan losses is assessed on a monthly basis and provisions are made for loan\nlosses as required in order to maintain the allowance.\nThe provision for loan losses increased to a loan loss provision of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the\nprior year which ended as a recovery of loan loss provision of $1.2 million. The increase is a return to a normal provision for loan losses\ndue to loan growth. The prior year was a direct result of recovering the special COVID-19 pandemic provision that was provisioned for\nin 2021. Loan originations increased $24.4 million, which totaled $575.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to\nloan originations of $599.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Non-performing loans were $0 at December 31, 2021 and\n$21,000 at December 31, 2022.\nOn September 22, 2022, the Company completed the sale of a loan note for a customer that had stopped making payments and declared\nbankruptcy. The Company incurred a loss of $211,000 on this transaction that was properly accounted for in its Statement of Income as\na loss on the sale of a loan. This credit had previously identified weaknesses and deemed to be of substandard quality with an appropriate\nreserve allocation. We determined that the best course of action was to sell the note at a discount to an interested party. Had the loan\nsale not occurred, the Company would have recorded a specific allocation to the provision for loan losses and proceeded with an orderly\nliquidation of collateral.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, substandard loans increased $4.2 million for a balance of $9.5 million. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, special mention loans decreased $16.9 million to $0. During the year ended December 31, 2022, watch list loans\ndecreased $45.6 million to $25.0 million. Management does not believe any loss currently exists in these loans. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, there were no charge-offs and recoveries of $19,000 were received. During the year ended December 31, 2021,\nthere were $32,000 in charge-offs recorded and recoveries received of $27,000.\nNon-Interest Income\nOur primary sources of non-interest income are service charges on deposit accounts, such as interchange fees and statement fees,\nincome earned on bank owned life insurance, fees earned from executing interest rate swaps on commercial loans, and gains realized\non the sale of the guaranteed portion of Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans."

The decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to mortgage originations and other loan fees\nwere down $382,000 and $528,000, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2022. Fees earned on interest rate swaps for\ncommercial loans increased $536,000, or 645.8%, to $619,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $83,000 for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. This increase was purely related to the volume of interest rate swaps entered into during 2021 compared to 2022.\nBank owned life insurance income increased $108,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December\n31, 2021, due to the rising rate environment throughout 2022. The deposit service fees largely remained consistent for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021.\nNon-Interest Expense\nGenerally, non-interest expense is composed of all employee expenses and costs associated with operating our facilities, obtaining and\nretaining customer relationships and providing bank services. The largest component of non-interest expense is salaries and employee\nbenefits. Non-interest expense also includes operational expenses, such as occupancy and equipment expenses, professional fees,\nadvertising expenses and other general and administrative expenses, including FDIC assessments, communications, travel, meals,\ntraining, supplies and postage.

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $4.5 million to\n$23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of\nincreasing our personnel team members by 30 employees. Advertising and marketing increased $739,000, or 47.2%, to $2.3 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 from $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Outside service expenses increased\n$681,000, or 48.9%, to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, due to investments in the Company’s payments division and\nother technological infrastructure. Offsetting these increases, our FDIC insurance decreased approximately $414,000 to $637,000 for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 from $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was attributed to continued\nfinancial strength that resulted in a reduction of FDIC assessments."

The increase in federal income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the\nsame period a year earlier was driven by the increase in income before income taxes of $5.4 million, or 19.4%, to $33.4 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 compared to $28.0 million for the same period in the prior year.

As the Company develops the software and\nramps up the resources needed to operate a new division, elevated levels of non-interest expenses were anticipated. The Avenu division\nheld $62.9 million in average non-interest bearing deposits which provides tremendous value to the Company, while simultaneously\nestablishing a new division. Avenu is developing a comprehensive hosted BaaS software platform that will provide Fintechs with a\nsubledger integrated within a regulatory compliant framework, easily connectable application programming interfaces (\"APIs\"), and\naccess to banking payment networks.

The\nincrease was primarily the result of increases of $240.7 million in gross loans receivable, $37.4 million in cash equivalents, and $25.4\nmillion in other assets. These increases were offset by a decrease in available-for-sale securities of $37.3 million, attributable to not\npurchasing treasury securities as part of our income tax strategy.\nInvestment Securities\nWe use our securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, provide an appropriate return on funds invested, manage interest rate\nrisk, meet collateral requirements, and meet regulatory capital and liquidity requirements. Our investment policy is established and\nreviewed annually by the Board of Directors.

Our loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate as\nwell as commercial business loans and consumer loans, substantially all of which are secured by corresponding deposits at the Bank.\nOur loan customers primarily consist of small- to medium-sized businesses, professionals, real estate investors, small residential builders\nand individuals. Our owner occupied and investment commercial real estate loans, residential construction loans and commercial\nbusiness loans provide us with higher risk-adjusted returns, shorter maturities and more sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, and are\ncomplemented by our relatively lower risk residential real estate loans to individuals.

The\nincrease in total loans was primarily driven by growth in the overall loan portfolio, with significant increases in multifamily residential\nreal estate, as well as the owner occupied, and non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio.\nAsset Quality\nThe Company’s asset quality remained strong during the year ended December 31, 2022. Nonperforming assets, which includes\nnonaccrual loans, accruing loans 90 days past due, accruing troubled debt restructured (“TDR”) loans 90 days past due, and other real\nestate owned totaled $21,000 at December 31, 2022, and $775,000 million at December 31, 2021.\nA loan’s past due status is based on the contractual due date of the most delinquent payment due. All loans which are 30 or more days\npast due at the end of the month are reported to the Board of Directors. Commercial loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status\nwhen the collection of principal or interest is 90 days or more past due, or earlier, if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of the\nnet realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower. Consumer loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status\nwhen the collection of principal or interest is 120 days or more past due, or earlier, if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of\nthe net realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower. Loans greater than 90 days past due may remain on\naccrual status if management determines it has adequate collateral to cover the principal and interest. For those loans that are carried on\nnonaccrual status, payments are first applied to principal outstanding. A loan may be returned to accrual status if the borrower has\ndemonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan and there is reasonable\nassurance the borrower will continue to make payments as agreed.\nThe Company may identify loans for potential restructure primarily through direct communication with the borrower and evaluation of\nthe borrower’s financial statements, revenue projections, tax returns, and credit reports. Even if the borrower is not presently in default,\nmanagement will consider the likelihood that cash flow shortages, adverse economic conditions and negative trends may result in a\npayment default in the near future."

The\nCARES Act states that from March 1, 2020, until the end of the year (unless the President terminates the COVID-19 emergency\ndeclaration sooner), financial institutions may elect to suspend the TDR accounting principles for loan modifications related to COVID-\n19. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, enacted in December 2020, extended this relief to the earlier of January 1, 2022, or\nthe first day of a bank’s fiscal year that begins after the national emergency ends.\nThe suspension applies during the modification. A modification can be a forbearance agreement, a new repayment plan, interest rate\nmodification, or any other arrangement that defers or delays the payment of principal or interest. This provision applies only to loans\nthat were current or less than 30 days past due on payments as of December 31, 2019.\nThe agencies are to defer to the financial institutions to suspend the TDR requirements. Financial institutions may presume that\nborrowers current on payments are not experiencing financial difficulties at modification to determine TDR status, and no further TDR\nanalysis is required for each loan modification in the program. Examiners will exercise judgment in reviewing loan modifications,\nincluding TDRs, will not automatically adversely risk rate credits affected by COVID-19, and will not criticize prudent efforts to modify\nthe terms on existing loans to affected customers.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were no loans not disclosed in the above table, where known information about possible credit problems\nof borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment\nterms.\nAnalysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in\nmanagement’s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable and estimable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the\nallowance is based on management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit\nconcentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, and economic conditions. Allowances for impaired loans\nare generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. Because of uncertainties associated\nwith regional economic conditions, collateral values, and future cash flows on impaired loans, it is reasonably possible that\nmanagement’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change materially in the\nnear-term. The allowance is increased by a provision for loans losses which is charged to expense and reduced by full and partial charge-\noffs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses.\nManagement’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including, but not limited to,\nmanagement’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss or loan pools, the fair\nvalue of the underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential\ncredit losses. An integral part of their examination process, the Federal Reserve Board will periodically review our allowance for loan\nlosses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses."

FHLB advances,\nother secured borrowings, federal funds purchased, and other short-term borrowed funds, as well as longer-term debt issued through\nthe capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sources.

Federal\nHome Loan Bank advances are generally available to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of deposit accounts and to permit increased\nlending.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, we were permitted to borrow up to an aggregate total of $465.0 million and $414.0 million,\nrespectively, from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Richmond. There were Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings outstanding\nof $100.0 million and $0 at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Additionally, we had credit availability of $104.0\nmillion with correspondent banks for short-term liquidity needs, if necessary. No borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2022\nand 2021, under this facility.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is the ability of the Company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional\nfunds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining the Company’s ability to meet the day-to-day cash flow\nrequirements of its customers, whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit\nneeds. Without proper liquidity management, the Company would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial\nintermediary and would, therefore, not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves.\nThe Company assesses liquidity needs on a daily basis using a sophisticated monitoring system that identifies daily sources and uses for\na rolling 30-day period. The Company also assesses liquidity needs under various scenarios of market conditions, asset growth and\nchanges in credit ratings. The assessment includes liquidity stress testing which measures various sources and uses of funds under the\ndifferent scenarios. The assessment provides regular monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent\nliquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity.\nThe asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through unencumbered debt securities available for sale, loan principal\nand interest payments, maturities and prepayments of investment securities held to maturity and, to a lesser extent, sales of investment\ndebt securities available for sale. Other short-term investments such as federal funds sold and maturing interest- bearing deposits with\nother banks, are additional sources of liquidity.\nThe liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various customers’ interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposit\naccounts and through FHLB and other borrowings.

These sources of liquidity are\nused as necessary to fund asset growth and meet short-term liquidity needs.\nIn addition to the Company’s financial performance and condition, liquidity may be impacted by the Company’s structure as a bank\nholding company that is a separate legal entity from the Bank. The Company requires cash for various operating needs that could include\npayment of dividends to its stockholder, the servicing of debt, and the payment of general corporate expenses. The primary source of\nliquidity for the Company is dividends paid by the Bank. Applicable federal and state statutes and regulations impose restrictions on the\namount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. In addition to the formal statutes and regulations, regulatory authorities also consider\nthe adequacy of the Bank’s total capital in relation to its assets, deposits and other such items. Any future dividends must be set forth in\nthe Company's capital plans before any dividends can be paid.\nThe Company’s ability to raise funding at competitive prices is affected by the rating agencies’ views of the Company’s credit quality,\nliquidity, capital and earnings. Management meets with the rating agencies on a routine basis to discuss the current outlook for the\nCompany.\nThe Board of Director's and the Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) are responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets\nand strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers\nas well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long-term liquidity\nneeds as of December 31, 2022.\nWe monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand; (2) expected deposit\nflows; (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management program.\nExcess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short-and intermediate-term securities.\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments\nare greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash\nequivalents, which include federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits in other banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on\nour operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents\ntotaled $130.6 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $62.6 million at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing\nactivities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $33.5 million and $29.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31,\n2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan\noriginations and the purchase of securities, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturing securities, was $228.7\nmillion and $60.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. There were no sales\nof available-for-sale debt securities in 2022 or 2021. Net cash provided by financing activities was $232.6 million and used in financing\nactivities was $14.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which consisted primarily\nof increases in interest bearing deposits and FHLB advances for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. There were no net\nrepayments from the Federal Home Loan Bank for year ended 2022.\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we\nwill have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2022,\ntotaled $516.9 million of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds in the\nnormal course of business, including other deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Depending on market conditions, we may\nbe required to pay higher rates on such deposits or borrowings than we currently pay. We believe, however, based on past experience\nthat a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest\nrates offered. Management believes that the current sources of liquidity are adequate to meet the Company’s requirements and plans for\ncontinued growth.\nRegulatory Capital\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum\ncapital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken,\ncould have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the\nregulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures\nof assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and\nclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nThe federal regulatory capital rules apply to all depository institutions as well as to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of\n$3 billion or more. However, the regulatory capital requirements generally do not apply on a consolidated basis to a bank holding\ncompany with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion unless the holding company: (1) is engaged in significant nonbanking\nactivities either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; (2) conducts significant off-balance sheet activities (including securitization\nand asset management or administration) either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; or (3) has a material amount of debt or equity"

Under the Basel III rules, the Company must hold a\ncapital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer was phased in\nfrom 0.0% for 2015 to 2.50% by 2019. The capital conservation buffer for 2022 and 2021 is 2.50%.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nMarket Risk Management\nThe effective management of market risk is essential to achieving the Company’s strategic financial objectives. As a financial\ninstitution, the Company’s most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also\nincludes product liquidity risk, price risk and volatility risk in the Company’s lines of business. The primary objectives of market risk\nmanagement are to minimize any adverse effect that changes in market risk factors may have on net interest income, and to offset the\nrisk of price changes for certain assets recorded at fair value.\nInterest Rate Market Risk\nThe Company’s net interest income and the fair value of its financial instruments are influenced by changes in the level of interest\nrates. The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by its Asset/Liability\nCommittee. The Asset/Liability Committee meets regularly and has responsibility for approving asset/liability management policies,\nformulating strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and/or earnings and reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of the Company.\nWe estimate what our net interest income would be for a 12-month period. We then calculate what the net interest income would be\nfor the same period under different interest rate assumptions. These estimates require certain assumptions to be made, including loan\nand mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturity and decay rates. These assumptions are\ninherently uncertain. As a result, no simulation model can precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest\nincome.\nThe table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2022, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net interest income that would result\nfrom changes in market interest rates over one year if we take no action from our current plan.\nBasis Point Change in\nNet Interest Income\nYear 1 Change\nInterest Rates\nYear 1 Forecast\nFrom Level\n(000’s)\n+400\n$39,336\n63.14%\n+300\n$35,752\n48.27%\n+200\n$31,847\n32.08%\n+100\n$28,271\n17.25%\nLevel\n$24,112\n—\n-100\n$19,857\n-17.65%\n-200\n$15,088\n-37.43%\n-300\n$10,798\n-55.22%\n-400\n$6,764\n-71.95%"

However, inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the\nresulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity-to-assets ratio. Inflation\nalso affects other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation.\nManagement believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on financial results is a direct result of the Company’s ability to\nmanage the impact of changes in interest rates. Management attempts to maintain a balanced position between rate-sensitive assets and\nliabilities in order to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income. However, this goal can be difficult to\ncompletely achieve in times of rapidly changing interest rates and is one of many factors considered in determining the Company’s\ninterest rate positioning. The Company is asset sensitive as of December 31, 2022. Refer to the Net Interest Income Sensitivity table for\nadditional details on the Company’s interest rate sensitivity.\nThe Bank also uses derivative financial instruments to manage risk to the Bank associated with changing interest rates, and to assist\ncustomers with their risk management objectives. The Bank enters into interest rate swaps with certain qualifying commercial loan\ncustomers to meet their interest rate risk management needs. The net result of these interest rate swaps is that the customer pays a fixed\nrate of interest and the Bank receives a floating rate thus allowing the Bank another tool to further manage the interest rate risk for\ncertain products. These back-to-back loan swaps qualify as financial derivatives with fair values reported in “Other assets” and “Other\nliabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe believe that our current interest rate exposure is manageable and does not indicate any significant exposure to interest rate changes."

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nThe Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part\nof our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no\nsuch opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ YOUNT, HYDE & BARBOUR, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.\nWinchester, Virginia\nMarch 23, 2023"

On May 18, 2016, the stockholders of MainStreet Bank\n(the “Bank”) approved a Reorganization Agreement and Plan of Share Exchange (“Reorganization”) whereby the Bank would\nreorganize into a holding company structure. The Plan of Share Exchange called for each outstanding share of Bank common stock to\nbe automatically converted into and exchanged for one share of the Company’s common stock, and the common stockholders of the\nBank would become the common stockholders of the Company on the effective date of the Reorganization. On October 12, 2021, the\nCompany filed an election with the Federal Reserve Board to be a financial holding company in order to engage in a broader range of\nfinancial activities than are permitted for bank holding companies generally. The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of\ncommon stock with a par value of $4.00 per share. Additionally, the Company is authorized to issue 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock\nat a par value $1.00 per share.

The holding\ncompany is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to inspection, examination, and\nsupervision by the Federal Reserve Board.\nOn April 18, 2019, the Company completed the registration of its common stock with the Securities Exchange Commission through its\nfiling of a General Form for Registration of Securities on Form 10 (“Form 10”), pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934. The Company is considered an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or\nthe “JOBS Act,” and as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the “Securities Act.” We are also a “smaller\nreporting company” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. As such, we may elect to comply with certain reduced public company\nreporting requirements in future reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the “SEC.”\nWe were approved to list shares of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under our current symbol “MNSB” as of April 22,\n2019. We were approved to list depositary shares of preferred stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the symbol “MNSBP” as of\nSeptember 16, 2020. Each depositary share represents a 140th interest in a share of 7.50% Series A Fixed-Rate Non-Cumulative\nPerpetual Preferred Stock.\nIn August 2021, the Company created a community development entity (“CDE”) subsidiary, MainStreet Community Capital, LLC, a\nVirginia limited liability company to promote development in economically distressed areas. This CDE will be an intermediary vehicle\nfor the provision of loans and investments in Low-Income Communities (“LICs”).

At\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bank held approximately $17.6 million and $20.3 million, respectively, in securities\nclassified as held to maturity. The Bank held no securities classified as trading.\nDebt securities which are not classified as held to maturity or trading are classified as securities available for sale. Debt securities\navailable for sale are reported at fair value. Any unrealized gain or loss, net of applicable income taxes, is reported as a separate addition\nto or reduction from stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses arising from the sale of debt securities available for sale are recognized\nbased on the specific identification method on a trade-date basis and included in results of operations.\nDebt securities held to maturity includes securities purchased with the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity. Debt securities are\nstated at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discount. Any investment security, for which there has\nbeen a value impairment deemed by management to be other than temporary, is written down to its estimated fair value with a charge\nto current operations.\nPurchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. Declines\nin the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale debt securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are\nreflected in earnings as realized losses. In determining whether other-than-temporary impairment exists, management considers many\nfactors, including (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and\nnear-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) whether the Bank intends to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not that the Bank\nwill be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether the Bank expects to recover the security’s\nentire amortized cost basis. Gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific\nidentification method.\nRestricted equity securities consist of the Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”) stock in the amount\nof $4.8 million and $5.1 million respectively, as of December 31, 2022, compared to $4.1 million and $826,000, respectively, as of\nDecember 31, 2021. Restricted equity securities also consisted of $126,800 in Community Bankers Bank stock at December 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021. This restricted stock is recorded at cost because its ownership is restricted and it lacks a market for resale. The\nBank is required to maintain Federal Reserve Bank stock at a level of 6% of capital and surplus. The FHLB requires the Bank to maintain\nstock, at a minimum, in an amount equal to 4.5% of outstanding borrowings and 0.20% of total assets. When evaluating restricted stock\nfor impairment, its value is based on ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. The\nBank does not consider these investments to be impaired at December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021 and no previous impairment has\nbeen recognized. Restricted equities include $6.7 million in Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (“LIHTC”) that are carried at amortized\ncost through the proportional amortization method. Restricted equities also include $6.1 million of nonmarketable securities as of\nDecember 31, 2022 that do not qualify for equity method accounting. As of December 31, 2021 restricted equities include $4.9 million\nin LIHTC and $5.7 million of nonmarketable securities that do not qualify for equity method accounting. These investments are recorded\nat cost because the ownership is restricted and lacks a market for resale.\nLoans held for sale - Loans intended for sale are recorded at the lower aggregate cost or fair value as of the statement of financial\ncondition date. Gains and losses on loan sales are determined by the specific-identification method.\nLoans - The Bank makes commercial and consumer loans to customers. Our recorded investment in loans that management has the\nintent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or pay-off, generally are reported at their unpaid principal balances\nadjusted for charge-offs, unearned discounts, any deferred fees or costs on originated loans, and the allowance for loan losses. Interest\non loans is credited to operations based on the principal amount outstanding. Loan fees and origination costs are deferred, and the net\namount is amortized as an adjustment of the related loan’s yield using the effective interest method. The Bank is amortizing these\namounts over the contractual life of the related loans.\nA loan’s past due status is based on the contractual due date of the most delinquent payment due. All loans which are 30 or more days\npast due at the end of the month are reported to the Board of Directors. Commercial loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status\nwhen the collection of principal or interest is 90 days or more past due, or earlier, if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of the\nnet realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower. Consumer loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status\nwhen the collection of principal or interest is 120 days or more past due, or earlier, if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of\nthe net realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower. Loans greater than 90 days past due may remain on\naccrual status if management determines it has adequate collateral to cover the principal and interest. For those loans that are carried on\nnonaccrual status, payments are first applied to principal outstanding. A loan may be returned to accrual status if the borrower has\ndemonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan and there is reasonable\nassurance the borrower will continue to make payments as agreed. It is Bank policy to charge-off loans whose collectability is sufficiently\nquestionable and can no longer be justified as an asset on the statement of financial condition. To determine if a loan should be charged-\noff, all possible sources of repayment are analyzed, including: (1) the potential for future cash flow, (2) the value of the Bank’s collateral,\nand (3) the strength of co-makers or guarantors. All principal and previously accrued interest is charged to the allowance for loan losses.\nAll future payments received on the loan are credited to the allowance for loan losses as a recovery. These policies are applied\nconsistently across our loan portfolio."

      "text": "59\nImpairment of a loan - The Bank considers a loan impaired when it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all interest and\nprincipal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement when due. A loan is not considered impaired during a period of an insignificant\ndelay in payment if the ultimate collectability of all amounts due is expected. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for all\ncommercial, construction and residential loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective\ninterest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Consistent with the\nBank’s method for nonaccrual loans, payments on impaired loans are first applied to principal outstanding. Smaller balance consumer\nloans are not individually evaluated for impairment.\nTroubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) occurs when the Bank agrees to modify the original terms of a loan due to the deterioration in the\nfinancial condition of the borrower. TDRs are considered impaired loans. Upon designation as a TDR, the Bank evaluates the borrower’s\npayment history, past due status and ability to make payments based on the revised terms of the loan. If a loan was accruing prior to\nbeing modified as a TDR and if the Bank concludes that the borrower is able to continue making such payments, and there are no other\nfactors or circumstances that would cause it to conclude otherwise, the loan will remain on an accruing status. If a loan was on nonaccrual\nstatus at the time of the TDR, the loan will remain on nonaccrual status following the modification and may be returned to accrual status\nbased on the policy for returning loans to accrual status as noted above. Restructured loans for which there was no rate concession, and\ntherefore made at a market rate of interest, may be eligible to be removed from TDR status in periods subsequent to the restructuring\ndepending on the performance of the loan. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Bank had zero loans classified as\nTDR.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan\nlosses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the\nestimated net realizable value or fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent, when:\n●\nManagement believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely regardless of delinquency status.\n●\nThe loan is a consumer loan and is 120 days past due.\n●\nThe loan is a non-consumer loan, unless the loan is well secured and recovery is probable.\n●\nThe borrower is in bankruptcy, unless the debt has been reaffirmed, is well secured and recovery is probable.\nSubsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nThe allowance represents an amount that, in management’s judgment, will be adequate to absorb probable and estimable losses inherent\nin the loan portfolio. Management’s judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectability of\nloans while taking into consideration such factors as trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, changes in the nature and volume of the\nloan portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect a borrower’s ability to repay and the value of collateral, overall portfolio\nquality and review of specific potential losses. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to\nsignificant revision as more information becomes available. The evaluation also considers the following risk characteristics of each loan\nportfolio segment:\n●\nReal estate residential mortgage loans, including equity lines of credit, carry risks associated with the continued\ncreditworthiness of the borrower and the changes in the value of the collateral.\n●\nReal estate construction loans and land improvement carry risks that the project will not be finished according to schedule,\nthe project will not be finished according to budget and the value of the collateral may, at any point in time, be less than the\nprincipal amount of the loan. Construction loans also bear the risk that the general contractor, who may or may not be a loan\ncustomer, may be unable to finish the construction project as planned because of financial pressure unrelated to the project.\n●\nCommercial real estate loans carry risks of the client’s ability to repay the loan from the cash flow derived from the\nunderlying real estate. Risks inherent in managing a commercial real estate portfolio relate to sudden or gradual drops in\nproperty values as well as changes in the economic climate. Real estate security diminishes risks only to the extent that a\nmarket exists for the subject collateral. These risks are attempted to be mitigated by carefully underwriting loans of this type\nand by following appropriate loan-to-value standards.\n●\nCommercial and industrial loans carry risks associated with the successful operation of a business or a real estate project, in\naddition to other risks associated with the ownership of real estate, because the repayment of these loans may be dependent\nupon the profitability and cash flows of the business or project. In addition, there is risk associated with the value of collateral\nother than real estate which may depreciate over time and cannot be appraised with as much precision."

      "text": "60\n●\nConsumer secured loans (indirect lending) carry risks associated with the continued creditworthiness of the borrower and the\nvalue of the collateral (e.g., rapidly-depreciating assets such as automobiles). These risks are attempted to be mitigated by\nfollowing appropriate loan-to-value standards and an experienced management team for this type of portfolio.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired and\nis established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the\ncarrying value of that loan. For collateral dependent loans, an updated appraisal will be ordered if a current one is not on file. Appraisals\nare performed by independent third-party appraisers with the relevant industry experience. Adjustments to the appraised value may be\nmade based on recent sales of like properties or general market conditions when appropriate. The general component covers non-\nclassified or performing loans and those loans classified as substandard or special mention that are not impaired. The general component\nis based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors, such as current economic conditions, including current home sales\nand foreclosures, unemployment rates and retail sales. Non-impaired classified loans are assigned a higher allowance factor based on\nan internal migration analysis, which increases with the severity of classification, than non-classified loans. The characteristics of the\nloan ratings are as follows:\n●\nPass rated loans are to persons or business entities with an acceptable financial condition, appropriate collateral margins,\nappropriate cash flow to service the existing loan, and an appropriate leverage ratio. The borrower has paid all obligations as\nagreed and it is expected that this type of payment history will continue. When necessary, acceptable personal guarantors\nsupport the loan.\n●\nWatch rated loans have all the characteristics of pass rated loans but show signs of emerging financial weaknesses which the\nBank will continue monitoring more closely. Watch rated loans are still performing as agreed.\n●\nSpecial mention loans have a specific defined weakness in the borrower’s operations and the borrower’s ability to generate\npositive cash flow on a sustained basis. The borrower’s recent payment history is characterized by late payments. The Bank’s\nrisk exposure is mitigated by collateral supporting the loan. The collateral is considered to be well-margined, well\nmaintained, accessible and readily marketable.\n●\nSubstandard loans are considered to have specific and well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the viability of the Bank’s\ncredit extension. The payment history for the loan has been inconsistent and the expected or projected primary repayment\nsource may be inadequate to service the loan. The estimated net liquidation value of the collateral pledged and/or ability of\nthe personal guarantor(s) to pay the loan may not adequately protect the Bank. There is a distinct possibility that the Bank\nwill sustain some loss if the deficiencies associated with the loan are not corrected in the near term. A substandard loan\nwould not automatically meet our definition of impaired unless the loan is significantly past due and the borrower’s\nperformance and financial condition provide evidence that it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts\nwhen due.\n●\nDoubtful rated loans have all the weaknesses inherent in a loan that is classified substandard but with the added\ncharacteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions\nand values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high.\n●\nLoss rated loans are not considered collectible under normal circumstances and there is no realistic expectation for any future\npayment on the loan. Loss rated loans are fully charged off.\nOther Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) - Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded\nat fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, management periodically\nperforms valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals, general market conditions, and recent sales of like properties,\nlength of time the properties have been held and our ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties. The\nBank may incur additional write-downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further deterioration\nin market values. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net expenses from\nforeclosed assets and improvements are capitalized.\nInterest income on loans – Interest on loans is accrued and credited to income on daily balances of the principal amount outstanding.\nThe accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when, in the opinion of management, there is an indication that the borrower may be\nunable to meet payments as they become due. Upon such discontinuance, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed.\nGenerally, the Bank will return a loan to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal becomes current and remains current\nfor six consecutive months under the terms of the loan agreement or the loan is well-secured or in process of collection. Upon returning\nto accrual status, interest payments applied to the principal balance of a loan while in nonaccrual status are recognized as a yield\nadjustment over the remaining life."

      "text": "61\nLoan origination and commitment fees and certain related direct costs - Loan origination and commitment fees charged by the Bank\nand certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the net amount is amortized as a yield adjustment. The Bank amortizes these\nnet amounts over the life of the related loans or, in the case of demand loans, over the estimated life. Net fees related to standby letters\nof credit are recognized over the commitment period.\nPremises and equipment – Land is carried at cost. Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and\namortization computed principally on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset, which ranges from 3 to 39 years.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.\nConstruction in progress includes assets which will be reclassified and depreciated once placed into service.\nComputer software development - The Company capitalizes new product development costs incurred for software to be sold from the\npoint at which technological feasibility has been established through the point at which the product is ready for general availability.\nSoftware development costs that are capitalized are evaluated annually for impairment and are assigned an estimated economic life\nbased on the type of product, market characteristics, and maturity of the market for that particular product. These costs are amortized on\na straight-line basis. All of this amortization expense is included within components of operating income.\nIncome taxes – The Bank uses an asset and liability approach in financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income\ntax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will\nresult in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. The principal items relate primarily to differences between the allowance for loan\nlosses, deferred loan fees, and accumulated depreciation and amortization. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense (benefit) is the tax payable or refundable for the\nperiod plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWhen tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities,\nwhile others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately\nsustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available\nevidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution\nof appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet\nthe more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being\nrealized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds\nthe amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along\nwith any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of December 31, 2022,\nand December 31, 2021, there were no such liabilities recorded.\nInterest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would be classified as additional income taxes in the statement\nof income.\nComprehensive income – Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains, and losses be included in\nnet income. Although, certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, are\nreported as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet, such items, along with net income, are components of\ncomprehensive income.\nStock compensation plans – Stock compensation accounting guidance (FASB ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation”)\nrequires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be\nmeasured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued.\nThe stock compensation accounting guidance requires that compensation cost for all stock awards be calculated and recognized over\nthe employees’ service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded-vesting, compensation cost is recognized\non a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. A Black-Sholes model is used to estimate the fair value of\nstock options, while the market price of the Bank’s common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards. No stock\noptions were granted during 2022 and 2021.\nEarnings per common share – Net income per common share has been determined under the provisions of FASB ASC 260, “Earnings\nPer Share” and has been computed based on the weighted average common shares outstanding during the year ended December 31,\n(7,529,382 for 2022 and 7,559,310 for 2021). Diluted earnings per share reflect additional potential common shares that would have\nbeen outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the\nassumed issuance.\nThe only potential dilutive stock of the Bank as defined in FASB ASC 260 would be stock options granted to various directors, officers,\nand employees of the Bank. There were no such options outstanding at December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. Restricted stock is\nincluded in the computation of basic earnings per share as the holder is entitled to full benefits of a stockholder during the vesting period\nand is thus considered a participating security."

      "text": "62\nOff-balance sheet instruments – In the ordinary course of business, the Bank has entered into off-balance sheet financial instruments\nconsisting of commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are\nrecorded in the financial statements when they are funded, or related fees are incurred or received.\nAdvertising and marketing expense – Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.\nUse of estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could\ndiffer from the estimates.\nThe Company’s critical accounting policies relate to (1) the allowance for loan losses, (2) fair value of financial instruments, and\n(3) derivative financial instruments. These critical accounting policies require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments which\nare based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, as this information changes, future financial\nstatements could reflect the use of different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain determinations inherently have a greater\nreliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be\nmaterially different than originally reported. In connection with the determination of the allowances for losses on loans, management\nobtains independent appraisals for significant properties.\nFair value of financial instruments – Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other\nassumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 20. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment.\nChanges in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates.\nDerivative Financial Instruments – The Bank recognizes derivative financial instruments at fair value as either an other-asset or other-\nliability in the consolidated statement of financial condition. The Bank’s derivative financial instruments include interest rate swaps\nwith certain qualifying commercial loan customers and dealer counterparties. Because the interest rate swaps with loan customers and\ndealer counterparties are not designated as hedging instruments, adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes\nin fair value of these instruments are reported as noninterest income or noninterest expense, as applicable. The Bank’s interest rate swaps\nwith loan customers and dealer counterparties are described more fully in Note 19.\nTransfers of financial assets – Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been surrendered.\nControl over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Bank – put presumptively\nbeyond reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of\nconditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Bank does not\nmaintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or the ability to\nunilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets.\nRevenue Recognition. Most revenue associated with the Company’s financial instruments, including interest income and gains/losses\non investment securities, derivatives and sales of financial instruments are outside the scope of ASC Topic 606. The Company’s services\nthat fall within the scope of ASC Topic 606 are presented within noninterest income and are recognized as revenue. A description of\nthe primary revenue streams accounted for under ASC Topic 606 follows:\nService Charges on Deposit Accounts. The Company earns fees from its deposit customers for overdraft and account maintenance\nservices. Overdraft fees are recognized when the overdraft occurs. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly\nmaintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the company satisfies the performance\nobligation.\nOther Service Charges and Fees. The Company earns fees from its customers for transaction-based services. Such services include safe\ndeposit box, ATM, stop payment, wire transfer, mortgage origination and interest rate swap fees. In each case, these service charges and\nfees are recognized in income at the time or within the same period that the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied.\nInterchange Income. The Company earns interchange fees from debit and credit cardholder transactions conducted through various\npayment networks. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are\nrecognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services."

Among other things, the ASU also amended the impairment model for\navailable for sale securities and addressed purchased financial assets with deterioration. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 as of\nJanuary 1, 2023 in accordance with the required implementation date and recorded the impact of adoption to retained earnings, net of\ndeferred income taxes, as required by the standard. The adjustment recorded at adoption was not significant to the overall allowance\nfor credit losses or shareholders’ equity as compared to December 31, 2022 and consisted of adjustments to the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans as well as an adjustment to the Company’s reserve for unfunded loan commitments. Subsequent to adoption, the\nCompany will record adjustments to its allowances for credit losses and reserves for unfunded commitments through the provision for\ncredit losses in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company is utilizing a third-party model to tabulate its estimate of current expected credit losses, using a weighted average\nremaining life methodology. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company has segmented its loan portfolio based on similar risk\ncharacteristics which included call report codes and other attributes that significant to the Company. The Company primarily\nutilizes average remaining portfolio life and Federal Reserve Economic Data for its reasonable and supportable forecasting of current\nexpected credit losses. To further adjust the allowance for credit losses for expected losses not already included within the quantitative\ncomponent of the calculation, the Company may consider the following qualitative adjustment factors: lending practices,\nnational/local economics, portfolio composition, employee experience, credit quality indicators, underlying collateral, concentrations,\nand other external factors. The Company’s CECL implementation process was overseen by the Allowance for Credit Losses\nCommittee and included an assessment of data availability and gap analysis, data collection, consideration and analysis of multiple\nloss estimation methodologies, an assessment of relevant qualitative factors and correlation analysis of multiple potential loss drivers\nand their impact on the Company’s historical loss experience.\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-04 “Reference\nRate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” These amendments provide\ntemporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients\nand exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to\nmeeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. It is intended to help stakeholders\nduring the global market-wide reference rate transition period. The guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through\nDecember 31, 2022. Subsequently, in January 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards\nUpdate (ASU) No. 2021-01 “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope.” This ASU clarifies that certain optional expedients and\nexceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting\ntransition. The ASU also amends the expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 to capture the incremental consequences of the scope\nclarification and to tailor the existing guidance to derivative instruments affected by the discounting transition. An entity may elect to\napply ASU No. 2021-01 on contract modifications that change the interest rate used for margining, discounting, or contract price\nalignment retrospectively as of any date from the beginning of the interim period that includes March 12, 2020, or prospectively to new\nmodifications from any date within the interim period that includes or is subsequent to January 7, 2021, up to the date that financial\nstatements are available to be issued. An entity may elect to apply ASU No. 2021-01 to eligible hedging relationships existing as of the\nbeginning of the interim period that includes March 12, 2020, and to new eligible hedging relationships entered into after the beginning\nof the interim period that includes March 12, 2020. The Company has inventoried its exposure to instruments that include a reference\nto LIBOR and have included amendments to transition to an appropriate comparable rate. The Company has also discontinued using\nLIBOR as a primary rate reference. The Company is assessing ASU 2020-04 and its impact on the Company’s transition away from\nLIBOR for its loan and other financial instruments.\nIn August 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-06, “'Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205), Financial Services—Depository\nand Lending (Topic 942), and Financial Services—Investment Companies (Topic 946): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to\nSEC Final Rule Releases No. 33-10786, Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses, and No. 33-\n10835, Update of Statistical Disclosures for Bank and Savings and Loan Registrants. This ASU incorporates recent SEC rule changes\ninto the FASB Codification, including SEC Final Rule Releases No. 33-10786, Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired\nand Disposed Businesses, and No. 33-10835, Update of Statistical Disclosures for Bank and Savings and Loan Registrants”. The ASU\nis effective upon addition to the FASB Codification. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2021-06 to have a material\nimpact on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Developments\nASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments: In June\n2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments.

The CECL model is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables, and held-to-debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures not accounted for as loan recievables (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other\nsimilar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor. The CECL model requires an entity to estimate credit losses\nover the life of an asset or off-balance sheet exposure. The new accounting guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and\ninterim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2022.\nAdoption will be applied through a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first\nreporting period in which the guidance is effective. Management adopted the guidance on January 1, 2023 and implemented changes\nto relevant systems as necessary. The Company currently intends to use a blend of multiple economic forecasts to estimate expected\ncredit losses over a six-month reasonable forecast period and then revert, over a one year period, to longer term historical loss\nexperience to arrive at lifetime expected credit losses. The estimated increase in the allowance is primarily due to required increases\nfor commercial real estate, residential, and installment loans to include the requirement to estimate lifetime expected credit losses and\nthe remaining length of time to maturity for these loans. Additionally, management expects an increase in the allowance for credit\nlosses for unfunded commitments.\nWhile adoption of this ASU is expected to increase the allowance for credit losses, it does not change the overall credit risk in the\nCompany's loan, lease and securities portfolios or the ultimate losses therein. The transition adjustment to increase the allowance\nwill result in a decrease to shareholders' equity on January 1, 2023, but will not have an impact on the Bank's regulatory capital. The\nultimate impact of the adoption of this ASU on January 1, 2023 was an increase of $2.2 million, comprised of increases of $895,000 in\nthe allowance for credit losses and $1.3 million for the reserve for unfunded commitments. This represents an increase of 2 and 8 basis\npoints, respectively. Calculated credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities were not material and there was no impact to the\navailable for sale portfolio or other financial instruments.\nNote 2. Restrictions on Cash\nTo comply with Federal Reserve regulations, the Bank is required to maintain certain average cash reserve balances. The daily average\ncash reserve requirements were $0 as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nOn March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective March 26, 2020. This action\neliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions. Prior to the change, reserve requirement ratios on net transactions\naccounts differed based on the amount of net transactions accounts at the depository institution.\nA certain amount of net transaction accounts, known as the \"reserve requirement exemption amount,\" was subject to a reserve\nrequirement ratio of zero percent. Net transaction account balances above the reserve requirement exemption amount and up to a\nspecified amount, known as the \"low reserve tranche,\" were subject to a reserve requirement ratio of 3 percent. Net transaction account\nbalances above the low reserve tranche were subject to a reserve requirement ratio of 10 percent. The reserve requirement exemption\namount and the low reserve tranche are indexed each year pursuant to formulas specified in the Federal Reserve Act\nNote 3.

These unrealized losses are primarily attributable to current financial market\nconditions for these types of investments, particularly changes in interest rates, causing bond prices to decline, and are not attributable\nto credit deterioration.\nAt December 31, 2022, there were twelve collateralized mortgage backed securities with fair values totaling $2.0 million, twenty-\ntwo municipal securities with a fair value of $12.4 million, eight subordinated debt securities with fair values of $3.4 million, and one\nU.S. government agency securitiy with a fair value of $1.8 million considered temporarily impaired and in an unrealized loss position\nof less than 12 months.

The Bank does not consider any of the securities in the available for sale portfolio to be other-\nthan-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. There were no securities sold during 2022 or 2021.\nAll municipal securities originally purchased as available for sale were transferred to held to maturity during 2013. The unrealized loss\non the securities transferred to held to maturity is being amortized over the expected life of the securities. The unamortized, unrealized\nloss, before tax, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $8,228 and $29,016, respectively."

They include loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and\npaying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans\nclassified substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions and facts, is\nhighly improbable.

Leases\nThe right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements\nof Financial Condition.\nLease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments and are presented at each reporting date as the net present\nvalue of the remaining contractual cash flows. Cash flows are discounted at the Company’s incremental borrowing rate in effect at the\ncommencement date of the lease. The incremental borrowing rate was equal to the rate of borrowing from the FHLB that aligned with\nthe term of the lease contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and are\ncalculated as the sum of the lease liability and if applicable, prepaid rent, initial direct costs and any incentives received from the lessor.\nThe Company’s long-term lease agreements are classified as operating leases. Certain of these leases offer the option to extend the lease\nterm and the Company has included such extensions in its calculation of the lease liabilities to the extent the options are reasonably\nassured of being exercised.

Derivatives and Risk Management Activities\nThe Bank uses derivative financial instruments (or “derivatives”) primarily to assist customers with their risk management objectives.\nThe Bank classifies these items as free standing derivatives consisting of customer accommodation interest rate loan swaps (or “interest\nrate loan swaps”). The Bank enters into interest rate swaps with certain qualifying commercial loan customers to meet their interest rate\nrisk management needs. The Bank simultaneously enters into interest rate swaps with dealer counterparties, with identical notional\namounts and terms. The net result of these interest rate swaps is that the customer pays a fixed rate of interest and the Bank receives a\nfloating rate. These back-to-back interest rate loan swaps qualify as financial derivatives with fair values reported in “Other assets” and\n“Other liabilities” in the consolidated financial statements. Changes in fair value are recorded in other noninterest expense and net to\nzero because of the identical amounts and terms of the interest rate loan swaps.\nThe following tables summarize key elements of the Banks’s derivative instruments as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nDecember 31, 2022\nCustomer-related interest rate contracts\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNotional\nAmount\nPositions\nAssets\nLiabilities\nCollateral\nPledges\nMatched interest rate swap with borrower\n$\n245,717\n44\n—\n$\n23,896\n$\n3,034\nMatched interest rate swap with counterparty\n$\n245,717\n44\n$\n23,896\n—\n$\n3,034\nDecember 31, 2021\nCustomer-related interest rate contracts\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNotional\nAmount\nPositions\nAssets\nLiabilities\nCollateral\nPledges\nMatched interest rate swap with borrower\n$\n210,793\n40\n$\n2,097\n—\n$\n15,120\nMatched interest rate swap with counterparty\n$\n210,793\n40\n—\n$\n2,097\n$\n15,120\nThe Company is able to recognize fee income upon execution of the interest rate swap contract. Interest rate swap fee income for the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $619,000 and $83,000, respectively.\nNote 20. Fair Value Presentation\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure”, the Bank uses fair value measurements to record fair\nvalue adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. The fair value of a financial instrument is the\nprice that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (“an exit price”) in the principal or most advantageous market\nfor the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined\nbased upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Bank’s various financial\ninstruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other\nvaluation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of\nfuture cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.\nThe fair value guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value, which focuses on exit price in the principal or most advantageous\nmarket for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants\nat the measurement date under current market conditions. If there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for\nthe asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. In such instances,\ndetermining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions"

The fair value is a reasonable point within the range\nthat is the most representative of fair value under current market conditions.\nIn accordance with the guidance, a hierarchy of valuation techniques is based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are\nobservable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect\nthe Bank’s market assumptions. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FASB ASC 820 based on these two types of inputs\nare as follows:\nLevel 1 –Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the\nability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 –Valuation is based on observable inputs including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in less active markets, and model-based valuation techniques for which\nsignificant assumptions can be derived primarily from or corroborated by observable data in the market.\nLevel 3 –Valuation is based on model-based techniques that use one or more significant inputs or assumptions that are\nunobservable in the market.\nThe following describes the valuation techniques used by the Bank to measure certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis in the financial statements:\nSecurities available for sale\nSecurities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted market prices,\nwhen available (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques\nof identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market\ndata. Third party vendors compile prices from various sources and may determine the fair value of identical or similar securities by\nusing pricing models that consider observable market data (Level 2). In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency\naround inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. As of December 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the Bank’s entire portfolio of available for sale securities are considered to be Level 2 securities, with the exception\nof one subordintated debt security.\nDerivative asset (liability) – interest rate swaps on loans\nAs discussed in “Note 19: Derivatives and Risk Management Activities”, the Bank recognizes interest rate swaps at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. The Bank has contracted with a third party vendor to provide valuations for these interest rate swaps using standard\nvaluation techniques and therefore classifies such interest rate swaps as Level 2."
