      "text": "Benjamin Hornigold Ltd \nDirectors’ Letter \n30 June 2022 \n \nPage | 1 \nDear Shareholders \n \nThe 2022 financial year was a challenging year for global markets.  The BHD portfolio was impacted by the \ngeneral instability in the market driven by inflation concerns, tensions in Ukraine and the flow on effects from \nthese events to markets globally.  Equity markets were displaying signs of overvaluation, especially in the \ntech and unlisted space which was probably a reflection more of overvaluation driven by unsustainably low \ninterest rates following on from Covid-19 measures put in place by Central Banks to minimise the damage to \ntheir economies as the world went into lockdown.  That overreaction forced asset prices higher and at the \nfirst sign of a shift back to interest rate normalisation we are experiencing a winding back of asset prices.  The \nupside of this pullback in asset prices is that we see more value in the equity market and the potential for \nstrong returns with many companies now at oversold levels.   \n \nWe have focused on investing in lower-risk situations as a means to generate returns while limiting downside, \nthough these investments were not immune to a global sell-off in risk assets and still have risk and correlation \nwith equity markets. Over the year BHD’s investment portfolio generated a gross return of (-5.97%) gross of \ndividends and franking.  This compares with the S&P/ASX 200 Accumulation Index return of (-6.47%) and the \nS&P/ASX Small Ordinaries Accumulation Index return of (-19.5%). \n \nWe expect to continue with the same strategy, preserving capital and at the same time providing us with \nsufficient capital to fund ongoing legal matters while pursuing recovery of loans owed to the company.  While \nthese loans have been impaired, they still remain outstanding and your Directors are of the opinion that we \nwill recover additional funds for investors in pursuing these debts. \n \nIn regards to the outcome of the various legal matters before the company, the process has been significantly \nslower than we anticipated as we await the outcome of various other actions being undertaken by \nAdministrators, ASIC and Insurance Companies. Notably, the recent judgement to wind up Henry Morgan Ltd \nprovided significant findings from the Federal Court and likely to provide tailwinds for our claims. \n \nThe Company experienced some small wins in the financial in relation to clawing back funds for shareholders.  \nWe received a small insurance payout over the period over $116k. \n \nAs a final point, your Directors have all backed the company, now owning over 30% of the issued capital. We \nhave returned the shares to trading on the ASX, providing liquidity for shareholders who wish to sell and still \nremain committed to maximising the potential for shareholders from our impaired loans and other claims. \n \n \nStay safe, stay well \n \nGary, Michael & Sulieman"

The \nregistered office is located at Level 10, 171 Clarence Street, Sydney NSW 2000. \n  \nThe investment objective of the Company is to achieve moderate to high portfolio returns over the medium \nto long term.  \n \nThe Company was incorporated on 28 September 2016 and commenced operations on 11 May 2017. \n \nThe Company is a for-profit entity and these financial statements have been prepared using historical cost \nbasis. The Company is an investment company and accounts for investments at fair value through profit or \nloss in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments and AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.  \n \nThe financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared in accordance \nwith Australian Accounting Standards adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the \nCorporations Act 2001. The financial report complies with the International Financial Reporting Standards \n(IFRS) and interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).   \n \nThe financial statements are presented in Australian dollars which is the Company’s functional and \npresentation currency. \n  \nAll amounts have been rounded to the nearest whole dollar unless otherwise stated. \n  \nThe financial statements were authorised by the Board of Directors on 29 August 2022.  \n \nNote 2. Significant accounting policies \nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out either in \nthe respective notes or below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless \notherwise stated. \n \nNew Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted \nAustralian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not \nyet mandatory, have not been early adopted by the Company for the annual reporting period ended 30 June \n2022. The Company’s assessment of the impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards and \nInterpretations and there is no material impact. \n \nBasis of preparation  \nCritical accounting estimates \nThe preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.

Transaction costs are included as \npart of the initial measurement, except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

Except for effective hedging instruments, derivatives are \nalso categorised as fair value through profit or loss. Fair value movements are recognised in profit or loss.  \n \nLoans  \nLoans are financial assets initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and fees. \nLoans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method where there \nhave been contractual cashflows which represent solely payment of principal and interest (‘SPPI’) on the \nprincipal balance outstanding and they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved through \nholding loans to collect these cashflows.  \n \nImpairment of financial assets \nAt the end of each reporting period, an assessment is made as to the extent of any expected credit losses \n(‘ECLs’) impacting on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset.  Expected credit losses may arise \nwhere there are indications that the counterparty is experiencing significant financial difficulty or might enter \ninsolvency proceedings or other financial reorganisation, where there has been a default or delinquency in \ninterest or principal payments, or where changes in economic conditions have occurred impacting on the \nlikelihood of defaults. \nInterest earned on these balances is presented on a net basis in the income statement as this reflects how \nthe customer is charged. \n \nProfit reserve \nA profit reserve has been created representing an amount allocated from current period earnings that is \npreserved for future dividend payments. \n \nDividends \nProvision is made for the amount of any dividend declared on fully paid ordinary shares, being appropriately \nauthorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but \nnot distributed at the end of the reporting period. \nIn accordance with the Corporation Act 2001, the Company may pay a dividend where the Company’s assets \nexceed its liabilities, the payment of the dividend is fair and reasonable to the Company’s shareholders as \na whole and the payment of the dividend does not materially prejudice the Company’s ability to pay its \ncreditors. \n \nNote 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions \n \nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and \nassumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually \nevaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and \nexpenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on \nother various factors, including expectations of future events, which management believes to be \nreasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom \nequal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of \ncausing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and within the next financial year are \ndiscussed below."

Considerable judgement is required to determine what is significant to fair value and \ntherefore which category the asset or liability is placed in can be subjective. \n \nThe fair value of regularly traded quoted instruments is based on current market prices, otherwise \nmanagement make an assessment on the bid ask spread of the share price and will use a value within that \nrange. The fair value of privately held investments (and instruments that are linked to their value) which \nare not currently traded in the public market are estimated using valuation techniques, such as the Income \nApproach, the Market Approach and the Cost Approach; these valuation approaches are included in Level \n3 of the hierarchy. Factors considered in determining the fair value of these investments include, but are \nnot limited to, market conditions, purchase price, nature of investment, estimation of liquidity value, \nsubsequent third-party equity financing or significant change in operating performance or potential \nresulting in a change in valuation, and other pertinent information. Refer to Note 9 for further information. \n  \nAllowance for expected credit losses \nThe allowance for expected credit losses assessment requires a degree of estimation and judgement. It is \nbased on the lifetime expected credit loss, grouped based on days overdue, and makes assumptions to \nallocate an overall expected credit loss rate for each group. These assumptions include recent sales \nexperience, historical collection rates, the impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and forward-\nlooking information that is available. The allowance for expected credit losses, as disclosed in Note 10, is \ncalculated based on the information available at the time of preparation. The actual credit losses in future \nyears may be higher or lower. \n \nRecovery of deferred tax assets \nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and tax losses only if the Company \nconsiders it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences \nand losses.  \n \nEstimated fair values of level 2 and level 3 investments \nThe Company carries its investments at fair value with changes in the fair values recognised in Statement \nof profit or loss and other comprehensive income. At the end of each reporting period, the Directors update \ntheir assessment of the fair value of securities which are categorised under level 2 and level 3 in the fair \nvalue hierarchy. Refer to Note 6 for information on level 2 and level 3 securities. \n \nImpact of COVID-19 pandemic \nJudgement has been exercised in considering the impacts that the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has \nhad, or may have, on the operations of the Company and its financial position and results. During the \nfinancial year there has been no significant impact upon the financial results and position of the Company \nreported on in these financial statements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \nNote 4. Operating segments \n  \nOperating segments are identified based on the financial information periodically reviewed by the Board \n(representing the Chief Operating Decision Maker) in assessing the performance and determining the \nallocation of resources. As the Company operates in only one segment, all results presented in this financial \nreport relate to the financial services segment. \nThe Company operates materially in only one geographical segment being Australia."

For non-financial assets, the fair value \nmeasurement is based on its highest and best use. Valuation techniques that are appropriate in the \ncircumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, are used, maximising the \nuse of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. \n \nNote 7. Income tax \n  \nThe income tax expense for the period comprises current income tax expense and deferred tax \nexpense/(benefit). \n \nCurrent income tax expense charged to profit or loss is the tax payable on taxable income. Current tax \nliabilities/(assets) are measured at the amounts expected to be paid to/ (recovered from) the relevant \ntaxation authority. \n  \nDeferred income tax expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances \nduring the period as well as unused tax losses. \n  \nCurrent and deferred income tax expense/(benefit) is charged or credited outside profit or loss when the \ntax relates to items that are recognised outside profit or loss. \n  \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period \nwhen the asset is realised or the liability is settled and their measurement also reflects the manner in which \nmanagement expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related asset or liability. \n  \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to be \napplied when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that are enacted \nor substantively enacted, except for:  \n• \nWhen the taxable temporary difference is associated with interests in subsidiaries, associates or \njoint ventures, and the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary \ndifference will not reverse in the foreseeable future; or \n• \nWhen the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an \nasset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the \ntransaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profits."

As repayment was not made on 31 October 2019, the loan is in default. \n \nAccounting policy for trade and other receivables \nTrade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using \nthe expected credit loss (ECL) method. The Company calculated the provisions for ECL based on a three-\nstage approach. ECL are a probability- weighted estimate of the cash shortfalls expected to result from \ndefaults over the relevant timeframe under AASB 9 Financial Instruments. They are determined by \nrevaluation a range of possible outcomes, taking into account the time value of money, past events, current \nconditions and forecast economic conditions. The model uses three main components to determine the \nECL including: \n• \nProbability of default (PD) the probability that the counterparty will default, \n• \nLoss given default (LGD) the loss that is expected from the default event, \n• \nExposure to default (EAD) the estimated outstanding amount of credit exposure at the time of \ndefault. \n \nThe three ECL stages are: \n1. 12 months ECL performing \nFor financial assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, a \nprovision for 12 months ECL is recognised. \n2. Lifetime ECL performing \nFor financial assets where there is a significant increase in credit risk since origination but the \nassets are still performing, a provision for lifetime ECL is recognised. \n3.

The other information comprises the Operating \nFinancial Report, the Company’s Director’s, Corporate Governance Statement and ASX Information \nwhich was obtained as at the date of our audit report, and any additional other information that will be \nincluded in the Company’s annual report for the year ended 30 June 2022, but does not include the \nfinancial report and our auditor’s report thereon.  \n \nOur opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not \nexpress any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  \n \nIn connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information \nand, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial \nreport or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  \n \nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this \nother information, we are required to report that fact.

Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation. \nPitcher Partners is a member of the global network of Baker Tilly International Limited, the members of which are separate and independent legal entities. \n \nResponsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report  \n \nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a \ntrue and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 \nand for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the \nfinancial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to \nfraud or error.  \n \nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to \ncontinue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the \ngoing concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to \ncease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.  \n \n \nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report  \n \nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is \nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that \nincludes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that \nan audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material \nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material \nif, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.  \n \nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional \njudgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:  \n \n Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud \nor error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence \nthat is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control.  \n Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by the directors.  \n Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting \nand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going \nconcern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our \nauditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are \ninadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to \nthe date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to \ncease to continue as a going concern.  \n Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the \ndisclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in \na manner that achieves fair presentation.  \n \nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of \nthe audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n \nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other \nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related \nsafeguards."
