This annual report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of \nthe Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange \nAct”). You can identify such forward-looking statements by the words “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” \n“believes,” “estimates,” “likely,” “possibly,” “probably,” “could,” “goal,” “opportunity,” “objective,” “target,” “assume,” \n“outlook,” “guidance,” “predicts,” “appears,” “indicator” and similar expressions. In the normal course of business, in an \neffort to help keep our stockholders and the public informed about our operations, from time to time, we may issue such \nforward-looking statements, either orally or in writing. Generally, these statements relate to business plans or strategies; \nprojected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of such plans or strategies; or projections involving anticipated \nrevenues, earnings, average number of worksite employees (“WSEEs”), benefits and workers’ compensation costs, or \nother operating results. We base the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections. \nWe caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and \nassumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we have based many of these forward-looking statements on \nassumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Therefore, the actual results of the future events \ndescribed in such forward-looking statements in this annual report, or elsewhere, could differ materially from those stated \nin such forward-looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the risks and \nuncertainties discussed in this annual report, including, without limitation, factors discussed in Item 1, “Business,” Item 1A, \n“Risk Factors,” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nItem 1.   Business.\nGeneral\nWe provide an array of human resources (“HR”) and business solutions designed to help improve business performance. \nSince our formation in 1986, we have evolved from being solely a professional employer organization (“PEO”), an industry \nwe pioneered, to our current position as a comprehensive business performance solutions provider.\nOur long-term strategy is to provide the best small and medium-sized businesses in the United States with our specialized \nhuman resources service offering and to leverage our buying power and expertise to provide additional valuable services \nto clients. Our most comprehensive HR services offerings are provided through our Workforce Optimization® and \nWorkforce SynchronizationTM solutions (together, our “PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions”), which encompass a broad range \nof human resources functions, including payroll and employment administration, employee benefits, workers’ \ncompensation, government compliance, performance management, and training and development services, along with \nour cloud-based human capital management platform, our Insperity PremierTM platform.  Workforce Optimization is our \nmost comprehensive HR outsourcing solution and is our primary offering. Workforce Synchronization, which generally is \noffered only to our middle market client segment, is a lower cost offering with a typically longer commitment that includes \nthe same compliance and administrative services as Workforce Optimization and allows those clients to select, for an \nadditional fee, from the strategic HR products and services that are included with Workforce Optimization.\nIn addition to our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions, we offer a comprehensive traditional payroll and human capital \nmanagement solution, known as our Workforce AccelerationTM solution. We also offer a number of other business \nperformance solutions, including Recruiting Services, Employment Screening, Retirement Services, and Insurance \nServices. These other products and services generally are offered only with our other solutions.\nOur PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions are designed to improve the productivity and profitability of small and medium-sized \nbusinesses. These solutions relieve business owners and key executives of many employer-related administrative and \nregulatory burdens, which enable them to focus on the core competencies of their businesses. Our PEO HR Outsourcing \nSolutions also promote employee performance through human capital management techniques designed to improve \nemployee engagement and satisfaction. We enter into a Client Service Agreement (“CSA”) with each of our PEO HR \nOutsourcing Solutions clients under which we and our client act as co-employers of the employees who work at the \nclient’s worksite, or worksite employees (“WSEEs”). Under the CSA, we assume responsibility for personnel \nadministration and assist our clients in complying with employment-related governmental regulations, while the client \nretains the employees’ services in its business and remains the employer for other purposes. We charge a comprehensive \nservice fee (“comprehensive service fee” or “gross billing”), which is invoiced concurrently with the processing of payroll \nBUSINESS\n2\n2022 Form 10-K"

The comprehensive service fee consists of the payroll of our WSEEs plus an additional \namount reflected as a percentage of the payroll cost of the WSEEs.\nWe accomplish the objectives of our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions through a “high-touch/high-tech” approach to service \ndelivery. In advisory areas, such as recruiting, employee performance management and employee training, we employ a \nhigh-touch approach designed to ensure that our clients receive the personal attention and expertise needed to create a \ncustomized human resources solution. We utilize a variety of information technology capabilities to deliver our PEO HR \nOutsourcing Solutions, including Insperity Premier through which we, along with our clients and WSEEs, manage \nemployee administration, payroll, payroll tax, benefits, retirement solutions and other HR-related information, creating \nefficiencies for all parties. \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 74 physical office locations in 43 markets. To take advantage of economic efficiencies, \nmultiple sales offices may share a physical location. In addition, we had four regional service centers along with human \nresources and client service personnel located in a majority of our 43 sales markets, which serviced an average of \n307,506 WSEEs per month in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our service centers coordinate PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions \nfor clients on a regional basis and localized face-to-face human resources services.\nWe were organized as a corporation in 1986. Our principal executive offices are located at 19001 Crescent Springs Drive, \nKingwood, Texas 77339. Our telephone number at that address is (281) 358-8986, and our website address is \nwww.insperity.com. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “NSP.” We file or furnish \nperiodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our annual reports on Form 10-K, \nquarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or \nfurnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Through the investor relations section of our website, \nwe make available electronic copies of the documents that we file or furnish to the SEC, the charters of the standing \ncommittees of our Board of Directors and other documents related to our corporate governance, including our Code of \nConduct. Access to these electronic filings is available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or \nfurnishing them to the SEC. Printed copies of our committee charters and other governance documents and filings can be \nrequested by writing to our corporate secretary at the address above. Information on our website is not a part of, and is \nnot incorporated into, this report or any other report we may file with or furnish to the SEC, whether before or after the \ndate of this report and irrespective of any general incorporation language therein.\nPEO Industry\nThe PEO industry began to evolve in the early 1980s largely in response to the burdens placed on small and medium-\nsized employers by an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. While various service providers were \navailable to assist these businesses with specific tasks, PEOs emerged as providers of a more comprehensive range of \nservices relating to the employer/employee relationship. In a PEO arrangement, the PEO assumes certain aspects of the \nemployer/employee relationship as defined in the contract between the PEO and its client. Because PEOs provide \nemployer-related services to a large number of employees, they can achieve economies of scale that allow them to \nperform employment-related functions more efficiently, provide a greater variety of employee benefits, and devote more \nattention to human resources management than a client can individually.\nWe believe the key factors driving demand for PEO services include:\n•\nthe focus on growth and productivity of the small and medium-sized business community in the United States, \nutilizing outsourcing to concentrate on core competencies\n•\nthe need to provide competitive health care and related benefits to attract and retain employees\n•\nthe increasing costs associated with health and workers’ compensation insurance coverage, workplace safety \nprograms, employee-related complaints and litigation\n•\ncomplex regulation of payroll, payroll tax and employment issues and the related costs of compliance, including \nthe allocation of time and effort to such functions by owners and key executives\n•\nthe significant costs, time and specialized knowledge required to purchase or develop the technology \ninfrastructure to administer benefits, HR and payroll processing on an integrated basis\nBUSINESS\n3\n2022 Form 10-K"

      "text": "A significant factor in the development of the PEO industry has been increasing recognition and acceptance of PEOs and \nthe co-employer relationship by federal and state governmental authorities. Insperity and other industry leaders, in concert \nwith the National Association of Professional Employer Organizations (“NAPEO”), have worked with the relevant \ngovernmental entities for the establishment of a regulatory framework that protects clients and employees, discourages \nunscrupulous and financially unsound PEOs, and promotes further development of the industry. Currently, 42 states have \nenacted legislation either recognizing PEOs or requiring licensing, registration, or certification, and several others are \nconsidering such regulation. Such laws vary from state to state but generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility \nof PEOs. State regulation assists in screening insufficiently capitalized PEO operations and helps to resolve interpretive \nissues concerning employer/employee status for specific purposes under applicable state law. We have actively supported \nsuch regulatory efforts and are currently recognized, licensed, registered, certified or pursuing registration in all of these \nstates. The cost of compliance with these regulations is not material to our financial position or results of operations.\nThe Small Business Efficiency Act (“SBEA”) created a federal regulatory framework for the payment of wages to WSEEs \nand the reporting and remittance of federal payroll taxes on those wages paid by PEOs certified under the Internal \nRevenue Code as meeting certain requirements (“CPEOs”). We actively supported the enactment of this law. The SBEA \nclarified that a CPEO, rather than the client, is treated as the employer for purposes of reporting and remitting payroll \ntaxes. It also clarified that a CPEO is treated as a successor employer for purposes of the wage base of WSEEs on which \nfederal payroll taxes are applied. In addition, the law clarified that clients of a CPEO remain eligible for specified tax \ncredits for which they would have been eligible absent the CPEO relationship. Following the establishment of the \nvoluntary certification program by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States (“IRS”) and Treasury Department, our \nPEO subsidiary, Insperity PEO Services, L.P., received its designation as a CPEO from the IRS.\nService Offerings\nPEO HR Outsourcing Solutions\nWe serve small and medium-sized businesses by providing our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions, which encompass a \nbroad range of services. Both of our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions offer the following:\n•\npayroll and benefits administration\n•\ngeneral HR advice\n•\nhealth and workers’ compensation insurance programs \n•\n401(k) retirement plan sponsored by us\n•\nemployer liability management\n•\nassistance with government compliance\n•\npersonnel records management\n•\naccess to Insperity Premier for employees, managers, and client owners\nOur Workforce Optimization solution also provides additional services that our Workforce Synchronization clients can \npurchase for an additional fee, including the following:\n•\nemployee recruiting and support\n•\nemployee performance management\n•\ntraining and development services\nBUSINESS\n4\n2022 Form 10-K"

Our incurred costs in excess of annual premiums with respect to this \nexposure have historically been insignificant to our operating results.\nBecause we are a co-employer with the client for some purposes, it is possible that we could incur liability for violations of \nsuch laws, even if we are not responsible for the conduct giving rise to such liability. Our CSA ordinarily addresses this \nissue by providing that the client will indemnify us for liability incurred to the extent the liability is attributable to conduct by \nthe client.

We market our services through various business promotions and a broad range of media outlets, including digital \nmarketing, television, radio, newspapers, periodicals and direct mail. We employ public relations firms for most of our \nmarkets as well as advertising consultants to coordinate and implement our marketing campaigns. We have developed an \ninventory of television, radio and newsprint advertisements, which are utilized in this effort.\nWe routinely seek to develop new marketing approaches and campaigns to capitalize on changes in the competitive \nlandscape for our human resources services and to more successfully reach our target market. We have an agreement \nwith the Professional Golf Association Champions Tour to be the title sponsor of the annual Insperity Invitational™ \npresented by UnitedHealthcare® professional golf tournament held annually in The Woodlands, Texas (a suburb of \nHouston).

This full-service \napproach is exemplified by our commitment to provide a high level of service and technology personnel, which has \nproduced a ratio of corporate staff to WSEEs (the “staff support ratio”) that is higher than average for the PEO industry. \nBased on an analysis of the 2019 through 2021 annual NAPEO surveys of the PEO industry, we have successfully \nleveraged our full-service approach into significantly higher returns for Insperity on a per WSEE per month basis. During \nthe three-year period from 2019 through 2021, our staff support ratio averaged 55% higher than the PEO industry \naverage. During the same three-year period, our gross profit per WSEE and operating income per WSEE exceeded \nindustry averages by 144% and 223%, respectively.\nCompetition in the PEO industry revolves primarily around quality of services, scope of services, choice and quality of \nbenefits packages, reputation, and price. We believe reputation, national presence, regulatory expertise, financial \nresources, risk management, and information technology capabilities distinguish leading PEOs from the rest of the \nindustry. We also believe we compete favorably in these areas; however, other PEOs may offer their PEO services at \nlower prices than we offer.\nDue to the differing geographic regions and market segments in which most PEOs operate, and the relatively low level of \nmarket penetration by the industry, we consider our primary competition for our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions to be the \ntraditional in-house provision of human resources services. The PEO industry is highly fragmented and we have seen \ncompetition intensify; however, we believe Insperity is one of the largest PEO service providers in the United States. Our \nlargest national competitors include the PEO divisions of large business services companies such as Automatic Data \nProcessing, Inc. and Paychex, Inc., and other national PEOs, such as TriNet Group, Inc. In addition, we also face \ncompetition from: (1) fee-for-service providers such as payroll processors and human resources consultants; (2) human \nresources technology solution companies; and (3) large regional PEOs in certain areas of the country. \nVendor Relationships\nInsperity provides benefits to its WSEEs under arrangements with a variety of vendors. We consider our contracts with \nUnitedHealthcare (“United”) and the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies (“Chubb”) to be the most significant elements \nof our employee benefits package, as they would be the most difficult to replace.\nWe provide group health insurance coverage to our WSEEs through a national network of carriers including United, \nUnitedHealthcare of California, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Shield of California, HMSA BlueCross BlueShield of Hawaii and \nTufts, all of which provide fully insured policies or service contracts. The health insurance contract with United provides \napproximately 87% of our participants’ health insurance coverage and expires on December 31, 2026, subject to \ncancellation by either party upon 180 days’ notice. For a discussion of our contract with United, which is accounted for \nusing a partially self-funded insurance accounting model, please read Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Benefits Costs.”\nOur workers’ compensation coverage (the “Chubb Program”) has been provided through an arrangement with Chubb \n(formerly ACE) since 2007. The Chubb Program is a fully insured program whereby Chubb has the responsibility to pay all \nclaims incurred under the policies regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities. The current workers’ \ncompensation coverage with Chubb expires on September 30, 2023. Chubb has committed to certain expense and \npremium terms for one additional policy year (through September 30, 2024) subject to certain customary terms and \nconditions. In the event we are unable to secure replacement coverage on competitive terms, significant disruption to our \nbusiness could occur.

      "text": "Employment Taxes\nAs a co-employer, Insperity generally assumes responsibility and liability for the payment of federal and state employment \ntaxes with respect to wages and salaries paid to our WSEEs. There are essentially three types of federal employment tax \nobligations included in Subtitle C — Employment Taxes of the Code:\n•\nwithholding of income tax requirements governed by Code Section 3401, et seq.\n•\nobligations under FICA, governed by Code Section 3101, et seq.\n•\nobligations under FUTA, governed by Code Section 3301, et seq.\nUnder these Code sections, employers have the obligation to withhold and remit the employer portion and, where \napplicable, the employee portion of these taxes.\nThe SBEA provides a CPEO shall be treated as the employer under Subtitle C – Employment Taxes of the Code and shall \nbe responsible for reporting federal employment taxes on remuneration paid by the CPEO rather than the CPEO clients.\nFor any client CSA that is not a CPEO contract, Code Section 3401, which applies to federal income tax withholding \nrequirements, contains an exception to the general common law test applied to determine whether an entity is an \n“employer” for purposes of federal income tax withholding. Code Section 3401(d)(1) states that if the person for whom \nservices are rendered does not have control of the payment of wages, the “employer” for this purpose is the person \nhaving control of the payment of wages. The Treasury regulations issued under Code Section 3401(d)(1) state that a third \nparty can be deemed to be the employer of workers under this section for income tax withholding purposes where the \nperson for whom services are rendered does not have legal control of the payment of wages. While several courts have \nexamined Code Section 3401(d)(1), its ultimate scope has not been delineated. Moreover, the IRS has to date relied \nextensively on the common law test of employment in determining liability for failure to comply with federal income tax \nwithholding requirements.\nAccordingly, while we believe that we can assume the withholding obligations for WSEEs, in the event we fail to meet \nthese obligations, the client may be held ultimately liable for those obligations. While this interpretive issue has not to our \nknowledge discouraged clients from enrolling with Insperity, there can be no assurance that a definitive adverse resolution \nof this issue would not do so in the future. These interpretive uncertainties may also impact our ability to report \nemployment taxes on our own account rather than the accounts of our clients.\nClients who elected to defer the employer portion of social security under the recent CARES Act have sole responsibility \nfor reporting and depositing deferred amounts with the U.S. Treasury. \nUnemployment Taxes\nWe record our state unemployment insurance (“SUI”) tax expense based on taxable wages and tax rates assigned by \neach state. State unemployment tax rates vary by state and are determined, in part, based on Insperity’s prior years’ \ncompensation and unemployment experience in each state. Certain rates are determined, in part, by each client’s own \ncompensation and unemployment experience. In addition, states have the ability under law to increase unemployment tax \nrates, including retroactively, to cover deficiencies in the unemployment tax funds. Rate notices are typically provided by \nthe states during, or prior to, the first quarter of each year; however, some notices are received later. Until we receive the \nfinal tax rate notices, we estimate our expected SUI rate in those particular states.\nState Regulation\nWhile some states do not explicitly regulate PEOs, 42 states have adopted provisions for licensing, registration, \ncertification or recognition of PEOs, and several others are considering such regulation. Such laws vary from state to state \nbut generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility of PEOs, and in some cases codify and clarify the co-\nemployment relationship for unemployment, workers’ compensation and other purposes under state law. We believe that \nwe are in compliance with the material requirements in all 42 states that have such laws. Regardless of whether a state \nhas licensing, registration or certification requirements for PEOs, we must comply with a number of other state and local \nregulations that could impact our operations.\nBUSINESS\n16\n2022 Form 10-K"

As a result, the demand for the outsourced HR services we provide clients could be adversely impacted by weak \neconomic conditions or difficulty obtaining credit. Current and prospective clients may respond to such conditions by \nreducing employment levels, compensation levels, employee benefit levels and outsourced HR services. In addition, \nduring periods of weak economic conditions, current clients may have difficulty meeting their financial obligations to us \nand may select alternative HR services at more competitive rates than we offer. Further, our growth is partially dependent \non hiring of new employees by our existing clients, which may be negatively impacted during periods of tight labor \nmarkets, such as the low unemployment environment experienced during 2022, and during economic slowdowns, such as \nthe high unemployment levels experienced during 2020.

The current pandemic may \nhave, and a future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases could have, a material and adverse \nimpact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 virus has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, including actions \ntaken by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic that have resulted or could result in a significant \nreduction in commercial activity.  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics impact our business, \noperations, financial results and financial condition will depend on numerous evolving factors that are highly uncertain and \nthat we may not be able to accurately predict, including:\n•\nscope, severity and duration of the pandemic;\n•\nvarying impact that the pandemic has within each locality;\n•\nactions taken by government authorities to contain the outbreak or address its impact;\n•\ndevelopment, distribution, adoption and cost of safe and effective testing, treatments or vaccines for COVID-19;\n•\ndirect and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures;\n•\nscope, significance and duration of business disruptions on small and medium-sized businesses, including any \nreduction in employment levels, compensation levels and employee benefits;\n•\nmagnitude and extent of business failures among the small and medium-sized businesses that we serve;\n•\nimpact of the pandemic on our benefits costs;\n•\nability of our clients to pay for the outsourced HR services and solutions we provide; and\n•\nany resulting impact on the demand for our outsourced HR services and solutions.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing and even after it has subsided, we may experience material adverse impacts \nto our business, operations and financial results due to any existing or continuing negative economic impact, including a \nrecession, depression, or periods of supply shortages or high inflation, such as experienced in 2022.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 virus has changed, and future pandemics may change further, how and when we incur \nhealth insurance costs under our health insurance contract with United. We have experienced, and may continue to \nexperience, changes in quarterly levels and timing of both medical and pharmaceutical health insurance claims and \nprocessing payment patterns.

Our ability to estimate health care claim trends became more difficult due to the testing, \nvaccination and treatment costs and as participant utilization of health care services are deferred or canceled while stay-\nat-home orders and social distancing requirements are enacted or recommended by state and local governments. \nFurthermore, our ability to predict the rate at which participants will increase utilization of health care services in future \nperiods is also difficult. \nThe 2020 increase in U.S. unemployment levels resulted in a significant increase in unemployment claims with state \nunemployment agencies. A continuous increase in unemployment claims may increase state and/or federal \nunemployment insurance tax rates. In addition, some states have the authority to increase unemployment tax rates \nretroactively. Any such increases, which are reflected in our comprehensive service fee, may result in client attrition due to \nincreased prices or we may have to reduce our overall pricing, which would adversely affect our profitability, to assist \nclients with these additional costs. \nThe economic disruptions caused by a pandemic may cause customers to have difficulty meeting their financial \nobligations to us or increase business failures. As a co-employer, we assume the obligation to pay the salaries, wages and \nrelated benefits, and related payroll taxes associated with the WSEEs. An increase in the number of clients unable to pay \nus would result in an increase in bad debts, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and \nresults of operations. \nIn addition, we have modified certain business and workforce practices to be more flexible in light of government \nrestrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities. While most of our operations can \nbe performed remotely, there is no guarantee we will be as effective while working remotely because our team is \ndispersed, many employees may have additional personal needs to attend to and employees may become sick \nthemselves and be unable to work. The remote work environment that was implemented during the pandemic also has \nhad an impact on the expectations of our employees and, as a result, many of our departments have now switched to a \n“hybrid” mode in which remote work is permitted one or more days per week. These changes may also impact productivity \nor have other impacts on our operations. Further, our increased reliance on remote access to our information systems as \nour employees work remotely impacts our control over cybersecurity protection and service stability and performance, \nwhich increases our exposure to cybersecurity and privacy issues and to disruptions to employee productivity. We may \ntake further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our \nemployees, clients, partners and vendors. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks \nposed by COVID-19 or the changes to the workplace resulting from the pandemic, in which case our ability to perform \ncritical functions could be harmed, and we may be unable to respond to the needs of our business. \nThe COVID Relief Programs created various programs and incentives to assist businesses and individuals managing \nthrough the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain of these programs and incentives have required us to make changes to our \nsystems that manage leave, payroll and payroll-related tax calculation, and invoicing and collection of service fees, \nCOBRA participation, and client reporting. The CARES Act allowed companies to defer certain payroll taxes, which were \nreflected in the payrolls we processed for clients electing deferrals. Client companies are liable for repaying the deferred \namounts to the IRS; however, the IRS has not yet clarified how such deferred amounts will be properly applied to \ncompanies utilizing a PEO and, if and when issued, such guidance may require further revisions to our systems or \nprocesses. In addition, PEO clients are dependent on the PEO to process Employee Retention Tax Credits (“ERC”) on a \nconsolidated basis, including amending previously filed payroll tax forms with the IRS. The IRS has experienced \nsignificant backlogs of amended tax forms from employers seeking ERC refunds. In addition, various states and localities \nand the federal government may enact further legislation that may require further changes to our processes and systems \nor that may expand the coverage afforded to WSEEs under our health and workers’ compensation programs. If we \nexperience extended IRS delays related to ERC credits on behalf of clients, or are unable to timely make these changes, \nincur substantial additional costs in doing so, or are otherwise adversely affected by these requirements, then we may \nface fines, penalties, other regulatory action, or litigation relating to such failure, which could further adversely impact our \nPEO state licenses or registrations, our CPEO status, our results of operations and our ability to attract and retain clients.\nThe nature of the COVID-19 pandemic or other future pandemic precludes any prediction as to its full adverse impact. \nNevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic presents, and other future pandemics may present, material uncertainty and risk \nwith respect to our business, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash \nflows and business. \nRISK FACTORS\n  \n19\n2022 Form 10-K"

      "text": "Health care reform could affect our health insurance plan and could lead to a significant disruption in our \nbusiness.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) was signed into law on March 23, 2010. The PPACA was \nsubsequently amended on March 30, 2010 by the Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Act”). The Act entails sweeping \nhealth care reforms with some provisions in the Act still requiring the issuance of additional guidance from the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the states. The future impact of the following provisions or \nchanges to the provisions of the Act, or future legislative actions, is unknown and, if any such developments were to \nreduce our ability to make health care benefits available to WSEEs or were to make our offerings less attractive to our \nclients, then our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nBeginning in 2014, a number of key provisions of the Act took effect, including the Exchanges, insurance market reforms \nand the imposition of excise taxes on the health insurance industry and reinsurance taxes on insurers and third-party \nadministrators. Additionally, the pay or play penalties on Applicable Large Employers were fully phased-in by 2016. As part \nof the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, the requirements that individuals maintain health insurance \ncoverage or pay a federal tax penalty, which was known as the individual mandate, was effectively eliminated beginning in \n2019. In addition, supporters in various states are advocating for adoption of health care-related reforms at the state level, \nincluding those states that have enacted individual mandates. Collectively, these items have the potential to significantly \nchange the insurance marketplace for small and medium-sized businesses and how employers provide insurance to \nemployees. Generally, the Act and subsequently issued guidance by the IRS and HHS have not addressed or in some \ninstances are unclear as to their application in the PEO relationship or whether such provisions should be applied at the \nPEO or client level.\nThe Act also ushered in a number of insurance market reforms for the small group and individual markets. The reforms \nrequired guaranteed issue and renewability of coverage, eliminated certain underwriting practices by issuers, consolidated \nthe number of risk pools in each state and restricted the permissible factors and variable ranges of those factors that can \nbe considered in determining health insurance premiums. Transition relief permitted states to delay the effective date of \nsome of these reforms. In addition, various states have adopted or are considering reforms that may impact the \nrequirements for or availability of PEO-sponsored health plans.  At this time, the insurance market reforms have not had a \nmaterial adverse impact on our business operations, and if any future changes impact our ability to attract and retain \nclients, or our ability to increase service fees to offset any increased costs, then our business may be materially adversely \naffected.\nInformation contained in the Congressional Record, which specifically references PEOs, indicates that any pay or play \npenalties should apply separately to clients of a PEO and not at the PEO level. However, the Act and subsequently issued \nIRS guidance do not expressly address the issue of whether the pay or play penalties apply only at the client level or \nwhether the penalties can be applied at the PEO level. If pay or play penalties were assessed against a PEO for coverage \nprovided to WSEEs under a PEO sponsored plan, then our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be \nmaterially adversely affected.\nAs part of the Tax Extenders Act passed in 2019, the rules imposing excise taxes commencing in 2022 on employers and \ninsurers who offer excessive health benefits under so-called “Cadillac plans” have been repealed. At this time, we are \nunable to determine the effect that the repeal of these pending excise taxes will have on our business and whether such \nchanges will make it more difficult for us to attract and retain and clients.\nThe elimination of the penalty associated with the individual mandate and subsequent changes resulting from action that \nmay be taken at the federal or state level may impact our benefit plans, business model and future results of operations, \nincluding repeal or repeal and replacement of the Act as has been advocated by some Congressional leaders. In future \nperiods, changes may result in increased costs to us and could affect our ability to attract and retain clients. Additionally, \ncontractual arrangements and competitive market conditions may limit or delay our ability to increase service fees to offset \nany associated potential increased costs. We are currently unable to determine whether potential future changes to the \nAct or other regulatory action, including at the state level, may adversely affect our business or market conditions.\nA determination that we are not the employer of our WSEEs and an inability to offer alternate benefit plans could \nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Code, employee benefit plans must be established and maintained \nby an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees.

In addition, the officers of a corporation are deemed to be employees of that corporation for \nfederal employment tax purposes. The common law test of employment, as applied by the IRS, involves an examination \nof approximately 20 factors to ascertain whether an employment relationship exists between a worker and a purported \nemployer. Generally, the test is applied to determine whether an individual is an independent contractor or an employee \nfor federal employment tax purposes and not to determine whether each of two or more companies is a “co-employer.” \nSubstantial weight is typically given to the question of whether the purported employer has the right to direct and control \nthe details of an individual’s work. Among the factors that appear to have been considered more important by the IRS are:\n•\nthe employer’s degree of behavioral control (the extent of instructions, training and the nature of the work)\n•\nthe financial control or the economic aspects of the relationship\n•\nthe intended relationship of the parties (whether employee benefits are provided, whether any contracts exist, \nwhether services are ongoing or for a project, whether there are any penalties for discharge/termination, and the \nfrequency of the business activity)\nEmployee retirement and welfare benefit plans are also governed by ERISA. ERISA defines “employer” as “any person \nacting directly as an employer, or indirectly in the interest of an employer, in relation to an employee benefit plan.” ERISA \ndefines the term “employee” as “any individual employed by an employer.” The United States Supreme Court has held \nthat the common law test of employment must be applied to determine whether an individual is an employee or an \nindependent contractor under ERISA. A definitive judicial interpretation of “employer” in the context of a PEO or employee \nleasing arrangement has not been established.\nIf Insperity were found not to be an employer with respect to WSEEs for ERISA purposes, its plans would not comply with \nERISA and/or the Code. Further, as a result of such finding, Insperity and its plans would not enjoy, with respect to \nWSEEs, the preemption of state laws provided by ERISA and could be subject to varying state laws and regulations as \nwell as to claims based upon state common laws. In addition, if Insperity were found not to be the employer sponsoring a \nsingle-employer plan under ERISA for purposes of its health benefits plan, we could be subject to additional requirements \nunder state and federal laws that could restrict our ability to provide benefits to our WSEEs in the same manner that we do \ntoday, which could negatively impact our business.  In the case of any such events, we would endeavor to make available \nsimilar benefits at comparable costs in a manner that complied with applicable state laws.   However, if we were unable to \npromptly transition our benefit plans to a compliant structure with terms that were acceptable to our clients and at a \ncomparable cost to us, then our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely \naffected.\nIncreases in workers’ compensation costs or inability to secure replacement coverage on competitive terms \ncould lead to a significant disruption to our business.\nOur workers’ compensation coverage has been provided through an arrangement with Chubb since 2007. Under our \ncurrent arrangement with Chubb for claims incurred on or before September 30, 2019, we have a financial responsibility to \nChubb for the first $1 million layer of claims per occurrence and for claims over $1 million, up to a maximum aggregate \namount of $6 million per policy year for claims that exceed the first $1 million. Effective for claims incurred on or after \nOctober 1, 2019, our financial responsibility increased as we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1.5 million \nlayer of claims per occurrence and for claims over $1.5 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $6 million per \npolicy year for claims that exceed $1.5 million. Chubb bears the financial responsibility for all claims in excess of these \nlevels.

Our client attrition rate was \napproximately 15% in 2022. There can be no assurance that the number of contract cancellations will continue at these \nlevels and such cancellations may increase in the future due to various factors, including economic conditions in the \nmarkets we operate. Clients electing to purchase our services or electing an alternative solution often do so at the \nbeginning of the calendar year. As a result, we typically experience our largest concentration of new client additions and \nattrition in the first quarter of each year.\nOur loss of insurance coverage, the failure of our insurance carriers or increased insurance costs or deductibles \ncould have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs part of our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions, in addition to our health insurance carriers, we contract with other \ninsurance carriers to provide workers’ compensation insurance and employment practices liability insurance. In addition, \nwe obtain insurance coverage for various commercial risks in our business such as property insurance, errors and \nomissions insurance, cyber liability insurance, general liability insurance, fiduciary liability insurance, automobile liability \ninsurance, and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.

While \nthe CSA provides that we have sole legal responsibility for making these tax contributions, the applicable state taxing \nauthority could conclude that such liability cannot be completely transferred to us. Accordingly, in the event that we fail to \nmeet our tax withholding and payment obligations, the client may be held jointly and severally liable for those obligations. \nWhile this interpretive issue has not, to our knowledge, discouraged clients from enrolling with Insperity, a definitive \nadverse resolution of this issue may discourage clients from enrolling in the future.\nNew and higher federal, state and local taxes could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and \nresults of operations.\nIn times of economic slowdowns, the federal government and states and municipalities in which we operate may \nexperience reductions in tax revenues and corresponding budget deficits.

      "text": "laws) do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of non-traditional employers such as PEOs, and the \ndefinition of “employer” under these laws is not uniform despite the SBEA having provided clarification under federal \nemployment tax laws for CPEOs. In addition, many of the states in which we operate have not addressed the PEO \nrelationship for purposes of compliance with applicable state laws governing the employer/employee relationship or PEO \nhealth insurance plans. Any adverse application of, or adverse legislative/regulatory response to, new or existing federal \nor state laws to the PEO relationship with our WSEEs and client companies could have a material adverse effect on our \nresults of operations or financial condition.\nWhile some states do not explicitly regulate PEOs, 42 states have passed laws that have recognition, licensing, \ncertification or registration requirements for PEOs and several other states are considering such regulation. Such laws \nvary from state to state, but generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility of PEOs, and in some cases codify \nand clarify the co-employment relationship for unemployment, workers’ compensation and other purposes under state law. \nIn addition, the SBEA provides certain benefits for companies that qualify as a CPEO. While we generally support \nlicensing regulation because it serves to validate the PEO relationship, we may not be able to satisfy licensing \nrequirements or other applicable regulations for all states. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to \nrenew our licenses in all states or that we will be able to maintain our CPEO designation.\nCertain state and federal regulators are more closely evaluating the existing regulatory framework governing money \nservices businesses and money transmitters in their jurisdictions, particularly following the high-profile failures in 2019 of \nseveral national payroll companies. While we maintain that we are not a money services business or money transmitter, \nthe adoption of new, or changes in interpretations of existing, state and federal money transmitter or money services \nbusiness statutes, or disagreements by regulatory authorities with our interpretation of such statutes or regulations, could \nsubject us to registration or licensing or result in limitations on our business activities until we are appropriately licensed, \nand such additional regulation and the actions of the regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our \nresults of operations or financial condition. These occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we \nconduct some aspects of our business. In addition, should any state or federal regulators make a determination that we \nhave operated as an unlicensed money services business or money transmitter, we could be subject to civil and criminal \nfines, penalties, costs, legal fees, reputational damage or other negative consequences, which could be material.\nCompetition and other developments in the HR services industry may impact our growth and/or profitability.\nThe human resources services industry, including the PEO industry, is highly fragmented. Many PEOs have limited \noperations and fewer than 2,500 WSEEs, but there are several industry participants that are comparable to our size or \nlarger. We also encounter competition from “fee for service” companies such as payroll processing firms, insurance \ncompanies, human resources consultants and human resources technology solutions as well as cloud-based self-service \nbundled human resources offerings. Our competitors include the PEO divisions of large business services companies, \nsuch as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Paychex, Inc., and other national PEOs such as TriNet Group, Inc. In many \ncases, these competitors offer a reduced service PEO offering at a lower price than our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions. \nWe expect that as the PEO industry grows and its regulatory framework becomes better established, well organized \ncompetition with greater resources than we have may enter the PEO market, possibly including large “fee for service” \ncompanies currently providing a more limited range of services. In addition, competitors may be able to offer or develop \nnew technology-based lower service models that may require us to make substantial investments in order to effectively \ncompete.\nWe offer a lower priced reduced service level PEO offering referred to as Workforce Synchronization in response to \ncertain middle market client needs and the evolving PEO marketplace. As of December 2022, approximately 13% of our \nWSEEs were co-employed by Workforce Synchronization clients. In the event we were to experience a significant \nincrease in the number of clients using the Workforce Synchronization offering or increased pricing pressures in the PEO \nmarketplace without corresponding reductions in operating costs, our operating margins may decline, which could have a \nmaterial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nTechnology Risks\nEvolving regulations, market trends and client expectations require us to constantly enhance and expand our \nservice and technology offerings. \nThe HR services industry is experiencing rapid technological advances to meet client expectations and expanding \nregulations. As new regulations are adopted, we must modify our systems to address these changes in the law, such as \nRISK FACTORS\n  \n26\n2022 Form 10-K"

In \norder to make these types of modifications, we may be required to reallocate resources, potentially resulting in delays to \nplanned competitive improvements to our systems. If we do not successfully or timely deploy these types of modifications, \nwe may be unable to comply with regulations, which could subject us to penalties, damage our reputation or result in \ndecreased sales. Further, in order to effectively compete in this environment, we must identify and predict trends, and \nadapt our technology and service offerings accordingly. In addition, as a larger portion of our client base falls within the \nmiddle market segment, we must also develop different technology and services to meet the more complex needs and \ndemands of this key group. These efforts require us to devote substantial resources to develop new functionality, or to \nintegrate third-party solutions, into our offerings. If we fail to respond successfully to these developments or we make \ninvestments in enhancements that are not accepted by the market, then the demand for our solutions and services may \ndiminish.\nDisruptions of our information technology systems could damage our reputation and materially disrupt our \nbusiness operations.\nMany of the HR services offerings we provide to clients are conducted through a technology infrastructure using both \ninternally developed and purchased commercial software, a wide variety of hardware infrastructure technologies, and a \nmulti-carrier wide area network. The processing of payroll, benefits and other transactions is dependent upon this complex \ninfrastructure, some of which is provided by third-party vendors. We must manage all of these systems, and are \ndependent on third parties to manage the systems that we obtain from them, including any upgrades, replacements or \nenhancements, to ensure that they continue to support our services. For example, we are currently working on a multi-\nyear project to replace our sales force automation system and our customer relationship management (“CRM”) system \nwith a single CRM solution to be used widely across the company. We continue to monitor and make changes to our \nproprietary system for our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions for compliance and modernization. Any delays or failures \nresulting from network outages; planned upgrades, enhancements, or replacements of software, hardware, or other \nsystems, including in connection with our CRM replacement project or any updated for compliance and modernization of \nsystems; or other data processing disruptions, even for a brief period of time, could result in our inability to timely process \ntransactions. The speed with which we, or third-party vendors, are able to address significant cybersecurity incidents may \nbe influenced by the cooperation of certain government agencies. We may also incur significant costs in the future to \nprotect against damage or disruptions that could be caused by cybersecurity incidents. If such failures cause us to not \nmeet client service expectations or to breach our obligations to our clients, we may lose existing clients, have difficulty \nattracting new clients, incur regulatory penalties or liability to our clients, or suffer other financial losses, which may have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe could be subject to reduced revenues, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position as \na result of data theft, cyberattacks or other security vulnerabilities.\nIn connection with our offerings, we collect, use, transmit and store large amounts of personal and business information \nabout our WSEEs, employees paid under our traditional payroll solution, and clients, including payroll information, \npersonal and business financial data, social security numbers, bank account numbers, tax information and other sensitive \npersonal and business information. Attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency and \nsophistication, and we and our third-party vendors are targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and \nviruses. Hardware or applications we develop or procure from third-party vendors may contain defects in design or other \nproblems that could unexpectedly compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or our systems. Because \nthe techniques used to obtain unauthorized access and disable or sabotage systems change frequently and may be \ndifficult to detect for long periods of time, we and our third-party vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or \nimplement adequate preventive measures. As these threats continue to evolve, we may be required to invest significant \nadditional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any \nsecurity vulnerabilities. We have limited ability to monitor the implementation of similar safeguards by our vendors and do \nnot have the ability to monitor such implementation by our clients or their employees, including WSEEs.\nIn addition, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information to us that could be used \nby a malicious party to commit identity theft or otherwise gain access to the data or funds of our clients or their employees, \nincluding WSEEs. If any person, including any corporate employee, misappropriates or misuses such funds, documents or \ndata, we may have liability for damages, and our reputation could be substantially harmed and we may have other \nliabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRISK FACTORS\n  \n27\n2022 Form 10-K"

We may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for losses from a security incident. Accordingly, \nthe impact of a data security incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and \nfinancial condition.\nFailure to comply with privacy, data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations could have a material \nadverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse \nconsequences.\nWe are subject to various laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, transmission and security and privacy \nof personal and business information. Most states and the District of Columbia have enacted notification rules that may \nrequire notification to regulators, clients or employees in the event of a privacy breach. In addition, new laws and \nregulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex \ncompliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs. It is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted \nand applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could \nresult in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. \nComplying with these various laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our \nbusiness practices in a manner adverse to our business. For example, we incurred additional costs and reallocated \ninternal resources in order to comply with the requirements of the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which amended \nthe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and became effective on January 1, 2023, and we expect to incur \nadditional costs and reallocate additional resources when the final regulations under the CPRA are released. Other states \nhave adopted or are currently contemplating additional privacy requirements. The future enactment of similar laws, rules \nor regulations could have a material adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and \nnoncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant liability. Additionally, any failure by us to comply with \nthese laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant penalties and \nliabilities for us.\nThe failure of third-party providers, such as financial institutions, data centers or cloud-service providers, could \nhave a material adverse effect on us.\nIn conjunction with providing services to clients, we communicate and rely on financial institutions to electronically transfer \nfunds for the collection of our comprehensive service fee as well as the payment of wages and associated payroll tax \nwithholdings. Communication failures or other failures involving these financial institutions, for any reason, could cause  \nmaterial interruptions to our operations, impact client retention, and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us.\nWe lease hosting facilities for our data centers at two separate facilities with one facility acting as our primary data center. \nThese facilities host the majority of our business applications, telecommunications equipment, information security \ninfrastructure and network equipment. If our data centers experience any interruptions or outages, and our business \ncontinuity plan fails, then our operations may be materially impacted, which could result in our failure to meet our \nobligations to our clients, WSEEs, tax authorities, and/or other vendors, which could damage our reputation, subject us to \nliability and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, some of our systems and services rely upon third-party technology. Examples include, the human capital \nmanagement system on which our Workforce Acceleration solution is based, the data analytics solution on which our \nInsperity People Analytics solution is based, and the payroll tax calculation and reporting tools that provide the rates used \nto calculate payroll taxes for our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions, among others. Any failure by these service providers to \ndeliver their services in a timely manner and in compliance with applicable laws could result in material interruptions to our \noperations, damage our reputation, and result in a loss of clients.\nOther Operational Risks\nFailure to integrate or realize the expected return on future product offerings, including through acquisitions and \ninvestments, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nRISK FACTORS\n  \n28\n2022 Form 10-K"

Risk Factors and the \nuncertainties set forth from time to time in our other public reports and filings and public statements.\nExecutive Summary\nOverview\nOur long-term strategy is to provide the best small and medium-sized businesses in the United States with our specialized \nhuman resources service offering and to leverage our buying power and expertise to provide additional valuable services \nto clients. Our most comprehensive HR services offerings are provided through our Workforce Optimization® and \nWorkforce SynchronizationTM solutions (together, our “PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions”), which encompass a broad range \nof human resources functions, including payroll and employment administration, employee benefits, workers’ \ncompensation, government compliance, performance management and training and development services, along with our \ncloud-based human capital management solution, our Insperity PremierTM platform. Our overall operating results can be \nmeasured in terms of revenues, gross profit or adjusted EBITDA per WSEE per month. We often use the average number \nof WSEEs paid during a period as our unit of measurement in analyzing and discussing our results of operations.\nIn addition to our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions, we offer a comprehensive traditional payroll and human capital \nmanagement solution, known as our Workforce AccelerationTM solution, our traditional payroll solution. We also offer a \nnumber of other business performance solutions, including  Recruiting Services, Employment Screening, Retirement \nServices, and Insurance Services. These other products or services generally are offered only with our other solutions.\n2022 Highlights\n•\nAverage number of WSEEs paid per month increased 17.7% to 295,005. Revenues increased 19.4% on the \n17.7% WSEE growth and a 1.5% increase in revenue per WSEE.\n•\nWe ended 2022 averaging 307,506 paid WSEEs in the fourth quarter of 2022, which represents a 14.3% \nincrease over the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect the average number of paid WSEEs per month to be \nbetween 317,000 and 326,000 for the full year 2023, an increase of 7.5% to 10.5%.\n•\nApproximately 24.9% and 23.8% of our average paid WSEEs were in our middle market sector for the years \nended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is generally defined as companies with 150 to 5,000 \nWSEEs. \n•\nGross profit increased 23.3% to $1.0 billion, primarily due to the 17.7% growth in the average number of WSEEs \npaid per month and a 4.8% increase in gross profit per WSEE.\n•\nOur average gross profit per WSEE per month increased from $273 in 2021 to $286 in 2022.\n•\nOperating expenses increased 17.7% in 2022 to $761.0 million, and included increases in salary and wages, \nmarketing, travel and event costs and the implementation of a CRM solution. On a per WSEE per month basis, \noperating expenses remained flat at $215 in both 2021 and 2022.\n•\nNet income and diluted earnings per share (“Diluted EPS”) increased 44.5% to $179.4 million and 45.9% to \n$4.64, respectively.\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 38.2% to $352.3 million.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n37\n2022 Form 10-K"

While uncertainties continue regarding the \npandemic, including its duration, future variants, and its longer-term impacts we believe we are well-positioned to continue \nto adjust our business plans and workforce practices as conditions change. In response to the pandemic’s impact on the \nworkplace, we implemented flexible remote working arrangements for our employees. To serve our clients, we have \ninstituted a number of service offerings and developed COVID-19 resources to assist clients with obtaining government \nprovided tax credits, tax deferrals, loans, and loan forgiveness and to provide guidance to assist clients with addressing \nthe challenges faced by employers as a result of the pandemic. These service offerings and guidance to assist clients with \nthe impact of the pandemic include additional benefits support, remote workforce transition, monitoring and educating on \nregulatory changes, including vaccine mandates, return to the workplace and workplace safety. \nWe experienced a 1.2% increase in the year-over-year benefits costs per covered employee during 2022 compared to \n2021, as the level of COVID-19 related claims decreased substantially. During 2023 and possibly beyond 2023, benefits \ncosts trends may continue to be affected by the dynamics of the pandemic, including the impact on healthcare utilization \nand COVID-19 testing, vaccination and treatment costs. These costs have resulted and may continue to result in a higher \nor more volatile level of healthcare claims costs than our historical claim cost trends. We have experienced a reduced \nfrequency in workers’ compensation claims since the beginning of the pandemic, driven by the trend toward hybrid and \nremote work. While certain COVID-19 cases are covered under workers’ compensation, they have not had a material \nimpact on our workers’ compensation costs. \nThe extent to which our future results are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on various factors and \nconsequences beyond our control, such as the scope, duration and magnitude of the pandemic, impacts of changes in or \nvariants of the COVID-19 virus, actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic, including programs \ndesigned to assist small and medium-sized businesses with the economic impact of the pandemic; and the speed and \neffectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including the development, availability, and acceptance of therapeutics \nand vaccines. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for additional information.\nRevenues\nWe account for our revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts \nwith Customers. Our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions gross billings to clients include the payroll cost of each WSEE at the \nclient location and a markup computed as a percentage of each WSEEs payroll cost. We invoice the gross billings \nconcurrently with each periodic payroll of our WSEEs. Revenues, which exclude the payroll cost component of gross \nbillings, and therefore, consist solely of the markup, are recognized ratably over the payroll period as WSEEs perform \ntheir service at the client worksite. This markup includes pricing components associated with our estimates of payroll \ntaxes, benefits and workers’ compensation costs, plus a separate component related to our HR services. Revenues that \nhave been recognized but not invoiced represent unbilled accounts receivable included in accounts receivable, net on our \nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nOur revenues are primarily dependent on the number of clients enrolled, the resulting number of WSEEs paid each period \nand the number of WSEEs enrolled in our benefit plans.

Payroll taxes are generally paid as a percentage of payroll cost. The federal \nunemployment tax rates are defined by federal regulations. State unemployment tax rates are subject to claim histories \nand vary from state to state.\nEmployee benefits costs are comprised primarily of health insurance premiums and claims costs (including dental and \npharmacy costs), but also include costs of other employee benefits such as life insurance, vision care, disability insurance, \neducation assistance, adoption assistance, a flexible spending account program and an employee well-being program.\nWorkers’ compensation costs include administrative and risk charges paid to the insurance carrier, and claims costs, \nwhich are driven primarily by the frequency and severity of claims.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit per WSEE is primarily determined by our ability to accurately estimate and control direct costs and our \nability to incorporate changes in these costs into the gross billings charged to PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions clients, \nwhich are subject to pricing arrangements that are typically renewed annually. We use gross profit per WSEE per month \nas our principal measurement of relative performance at the gross profit level.\nOperating Expenses\n•\nSalaries, wages and payroll taxes — Salaries, wages and payroll taxes (“Salaries”) are primarily a function of the \nnumber of corporate employees, their associated average pay and any additional cash incentive compensation. \nOur corporate employees include client services, sales and marketing, benefits, legal, finance, information \ntechnology, administrative support personnel and those associated with our other products and services.\n•\nStock-based compensation — Our stock-based compensation relates to the recognition of non-cash \ncompensation expense over the requisite service period of time-vested and performance-based incentive plan \nawards.\n•\nCommissions — Commissions expense consists primarily of amounts paid to sales managers and other sales \npersonnel, including BPAs as well as channel referral fees. Commissions are based on new accounts sold and a \npercentage of revenue generated by such personnel.\n•\nAdvertising — Advertising expense primarily consists of media advertising and other business promotions in our \ncurrent and anticipated sales markets, including the Insperity Invitational™ presented by UnitedHealthcare® \nsponsorship.\n•\nGeneral and administrative expenses — Our general and administrative expenses primarily include:\n◦\nrent expenses related to our service centers and sales offices\n◦\noutside professional service fees related to legal, consulting and accounting services\n◦\nadministrative costs, such as postage, printing and supplies\n◦\nemployee travel and training expenses\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n39\n2022 Form 10-K"

Please read \n“—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes typically differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, due primarily to state income taxes, \nnon-deductible expenses, vesting of equity awards and various tax credits. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax \neffects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting \npurposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant items resulting in deferred income taxes include \nprepaid assets, accruals for workers’ compensation expenses, stock-based compensation, software development costs, \naccrued incentive compensation, operating lease assets and liabilities and depreciation. Changes in these items are \nreflected in our financial statements through a deferred income tax provision. Please read Note 7 to the Consolidated \nFinancial statements, “Income Taxes,” for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial \nStatements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires \nour management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and \nexpenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, \nincluding those related to health and workers’ compensation insurance claims experience, client bad debts, income taxes, \nproperty and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, and contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on historical \nexperience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of \nwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent \nfrom other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are critical and/or require significant judgments and estimates used in the \npreparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\n•\nBenefits costs — We provide group health insurance coverage under a single-employer plan that covers both our \nWSEEs in our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions and our corporate employees and utilizes a national network of carriers \nincluding United, UnitedHealthcare of California, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Shield of California, HMSA BlueCross \nBlueShield of Hawaii and Tufts, all of which provide fully insured policies or service contracts.\nThe health insurance contract with United provides the majority of our health insurance coverage. As a result of \ncertain contractual terms, we have accounted for this plan since its inception using a partially self-funded insurance \naccounting model. Accordingly, we record the costs of the United plan, including an estimate of the incurred claims, \ntaxes and administrative fees (collectively the “Plan Costs”), as benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of \nOperations. The estimated incurred but not reported claims are based upon: (1) the level of claims processed during \nthe quarter; (2) estimated completion rates based upon recent claim development patterns under the plan; and (3) the \nnumber of participants in the plan, including both active and COBRA enrollees. Each reporting period, changes in the \nestimated ultimate costs resulting from claim trends, plan design and migration, participant demographics and other \nfactors are incorporated into the benefits costs.\nEffective January 1, 2020, we entered into an arrangement whereby our financial responsibility is limited to the first $1 \nmillion of paid claims per claimant per year. Additionally, since the plan’s inception, under the terms of the contract, \nUnited establishes cash funding rates 90 days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter.

      "text": "a reporting quarter are greater than the premiums paid and owed to United, a deficit in the plan would be incurred and \nwe would accrue a liability for the excess costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On the other hand, if the Plan \nCosts for the reporting quarter are less than the premiums paid and owed to United, a surplus in the plan would be \nincurred and we would record an asset for the excess premiums in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The terms of \nthe arrangement with United require us to maintain an accumulated cash surplus in the plan of $9.0 million, which is \nreported as long-term prepaid insurance. As of December 31, 2022, Plan Costs were more than the net premiums \npaid and owed to United by $3.7 million. As this amount is less than the agreed-upon $9.0 million surplus \nmaintenance level, the $5.3 million difference is included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, in our \nConsolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the premiums owed to United at December 31, 2022, were $46.4 million, \nwhich is also included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe believe that recent claim development patterns are representative of incurred but not reported claims costs during \nthe reporting period. The estimated completion rate used to compute incurred but not reported claims involves a \nsignificant level of judgment. Accordingly, an increase (or decrease) in the completion rate used to estimate the \nincurred claims would result in an increase (or decrease) in benefits costs and net income would decrease (or \nincrease) accordingly.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the completion rate on our estimate of total benefits costs of \n$2.6 billion in 2022:\nChange in\nCompletion Rate\nChange in \nBenefits Costs \n(in thousands)\nChange in \nNet Income \n(in thousands)\n(2.5)%\n$ \n(25,675) \n$ \n18,762 \n(1.0)%\n \n(10,270) \n \n7,505 \n1.0%\n \n10,270 \n \n(7,505) \n2.5%\n \n25,675 \n \n(18,762) \n•\nWorkers’ compensation costs — Since 2007, our workers’ compensation coverage has been provided through an \narrangement with Chubb. The Chubb Program is fully insured in that Chubb has the responsibility to pay all claims \nincurred under the policy regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities. Under the Chubb Program for claims \nincurred on or before September 30, 2019, we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1 million layer of \nclaims per occurrence and, for claims over $1 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $6 million per policy \nyear for claims that exceed $1 million. Effective for claims incurred on or after October 1, 2019, we have financial \nresponsibility to Chubb for the first $1.5 million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over $1.5 million, up to a \nmaximum aggregate amount of $6 million per policy year for claims that exceed $1.5 million.\nBecause we bear the financial responsibility for claims up to the levels noted above, such claims, which are the \nprimary component of our workers’ compensation costs, are recorded in the period incurred. Workers’ compensation \ninsurance includes ongoing health care and indemnity coverage whereby claims are paid over numerous years \nfollowing the date of injury. Accordingly, the accrual of related incurred costs in each reporting period includes \nestimates, which take into account the ongoing development of claims and therefore requires a significant level of \njudgment.\nWe utilize a third-party actuary to estimate our loss development rate, which is primarily based upon the nature of \nWSEEs’ job responsibilities, the location of WSEEs, the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation \nclaims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting \nfrom changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers’ compensation claims \ncost estimates. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we reduced accrued workers’ compensation \ncosts by $42.2 million and $41.7 million, respectively, for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting \nperiods. Workers’ compensation cost estimates are discounted to present value at a rate based upon the U.S. \nTreasury rates that correspond with the weighted average estimated claim payout period (the average discount rate \nwas 2.9% in 2022 and 0.6% in 2021) and are accreted over the estimated claim payment period and included as a \ncomponent of direct costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n41\n2022 Form 10-K"

If we \nwere to experience any significant changes in actuarial assumptions, our loss development rates could increase (or \ndecrease), which would result in an increase (or decrease) in workers’ compensation costs and a resulting decrease \n(or increase) in net income reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the loss development rate on our estimate of workers’ \ncompensation costs totaling $66.1 million in 2022:\nChange in Loss \nDevelopment Rate\nChange in Workers’ \nCompensation Costs \n(in thousands)\nChange in\nNet Income \n(in thousands)\n(5.0)%\n$ \n(4,006) \n$ \n2,929 \n(2.5)%\n \n(2,003) \n \n1,464 \n2.5%\n \n2,003 \n \n(1,464) \n5.0%\n \n4,006 \n \n(2,929) \nAt the beginning of each policy period, the workers’ compensation insurance carrier establishes monthly funding \nrequirements comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims (“claim funds”). The \nlevel of claim funds is primarily based upon anticipated WSEE payroll levels and expected workers’ compensation \nloss rates, as determined by the insurance carrier. Monies funded into the program for incurred claims expected to be \npaid within one year are recorded as restricted cash, a short-term asset, while the remainder of claim funds are \nincluded in deposits, a long-term asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2022, we received $30.2 million for the \nreturn of excess claim funds related to the workers’ compensation program, which decreased deposits. As of \nDecember 31, 2022, we had restricted cash of $49.8 million and deposits of $196.4 million. We have estimated and \naccrued $229.4 million in incurred workers’ compensation claim costs as of December 31, 2022. Our estimate of \nincurred claim costs expected to be paid within one year is recorded as accrued workers’ compensation costs and is \nincluded in short-term liabilities, while our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid beyond one year is \nincluded in long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n•\nContingent liabilities — We accrue and disclose contingent liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements in \naccordance with ASC 450-10, Contingencies. GAAP requires accrual of contingent liabilities that are considered \nprobable to occur and that can be reasonably estimated. For contingent liabilities that are considered reasonably \npossible to occur, financial statement disclosure is required, including the range of possible loss if it can be reasonably \ndetermined. From time to time, we disclose in our financial statements issues that we believe are reasonably possible \nto occur, although we cannot determine the range of possible loss in all cases. As issues develop, we evaluate the \nprobability of future loss and the potential range of such losses. If such evaluation were to determine that a loss was \nprobable and the loss could be reasonably estimated, we would be required to accrue our estimated loss, which \nwould reduce net income in the period that such determination was made.\n•\nAllowance for doubtful accounts — We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting \nfrom the inability of our clients to pay their comprehensive service fees. We believe that the success of our business is \nheavily dependent on our ability to collect these comprehensive service fees for several reasons, including:\n•\nthe fact that we are at risk for the payment of our direct costs and WSEE payroll costs regardless of whether our \nclients pay their comprehensive service fees\n•\nthe large volume and dollar amount of transactions we process\n•\nthe periodic and recurring nature of payroll, upon which the comprehensive service fees are based\nTo mitigate this risk, we have established very tight credit policies. We generally require our PEO HR Outsourcing \nSolutions clients to pay their comprehensive service fees no later than the same day as the applicable payroll date. In \naddition, we generally maintain the right to terminate the CSA and associated WSEEs or to require prepayment, \nletters of credit or other collateral if a client’s financial position deteriorates or if the client does not pay the \ncomprehensive service fee. As a result of these efforts, losses related to client nonpayment have historically been low \nas a percentage of revenues.

To meet short-term liquidity requirements, which are primarily the payment of direct costs and operating \nexpenses, we rely primarily on cash from operations. Longer-term projects, large stock repurchases or significant \nacquisitions may be financed with public or private debt or equity. We have a $650 million revolving credit facility \n(“Facility”) with a syndicate of financial institutions. The Facility is available for working capital and general corporate \npurposes, including acquisitions and stock repurchases. We have in the past sought, and may in the future seek, to raise \nadditional capital or take other steps to increase or manage our liquidity and capital resources. \nWe had $765.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2022, of which approximately \n$504.8 million was payable in early January 2023 for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and \nother payroll deductions, and $36.8 million were client prepayments that were payable in January 2023. At December 31, \n2022, we had working capital of $158.5 million compared to $116.3 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in working \ncapital reflects, in part, cash flow from operations offset by share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. We \ncurrently believe that our cash on hand, marketable securities, cash flows from operations and availability under our \nFacility will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements for 2023. We intend to rely on these same sources, as well as \npublic and private debt or equity financing, to meet our longer-term liquidity and capital needs.\n At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit and borrowings totaling $370.4 million under the Facility. \nPlease read Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Long-Term Debt,” for additional information.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n52\n2022 Form 10-K"

      "text": "Cash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur net cash flows from operating activities in 2022 were $347.7 million. Our primary source of cash from operations is \nthe comprehensive service fee and payroll funding we collect from our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions clients. Cash and \ncash equivalents, and thus our reported cash flows from operating activities, are significantly impacted by various external \nand internal factors, which are reflected in part by the changes in our balance sheet accounts. These include the following:\n•\nTiming of client payments / payroll taxes — We typically collect our comprehensive service fee, along with the \nclient’s payroll funding, from clients no later than the same day as the payment of WSEE payrolls and associated \npayroll taxes. Therefore, the last business day of a reporting period has a substantial impact on our reporting of \noperating cash flows. For example, many WSEEs are paid on Fridays and at month-end; therefore, operating \ncash flows decrease in the reporting periods that end on a Friday. In the year ended December 31, 2022, the last \nbusiness day of the reporting period ended on a Friday, client prepayments were $36.8 million and amounts \npayable for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions was $504.8 \nmillion. In the year ended December 31, 2021, which ended on a Friday, client prepayments were $20.1 million \nand amounts payable for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions \nwas $424.8 million.\n•\nWorkers’ compensation plan funding — In 2022 and 2021, we received $30.2 million and $35.1 million, \nrespectively, for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers’ compensation program, which resulted in \nan increase in working capital. \n•\nMedical plan funding — Our health care contract with United establishes participant cash funding rates 90 days in \nadvance of the beginning of a reporting quarter. Therefore, changes in the participation level of the United plan \nhave a direct impact on our operating cash flows. In addition, changes to the funding rates, which are determined \nsolely by United based primarily upon recent claim history and anticipated cost trends, also have a significant \nimpact on our operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, Plan Costs were more than the net premiums paid \nand owed to United by $3.7 million, which is $5.3 million less than our agreed-upon $9.0 million surplus \nmaintenance level. The $5.3 million difference is therefore reflected as a current liability and $9.0 million is \nreflected as a long-term asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022. In addition, the \npremiums owed to United at December 31, 2022, were $46.4 million, which is included in accrued health \ninsurance costs, a current liability, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n•\nOperating results — Our adjusted net income has a significant impact on our operating cash flows. Our adjusted \nnet income increased 40.2% to $215.9 million in 2022 from $154.0 million in 2021. Please read “Results of \nOperations.”\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur net cash flows used in investing activities were $32.1 million during 2022, primarily due to $30.4 million in property \nand equipment purchases. \nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur net cash flows used in financing activities were $141.2 million during 2022. We repurchased $73.3 million in stock and \npaid $76.6 million in dividends. \nSeasonality, Inflation and Quarterly Fluctuations\nOur quarterly earnings are impacted by the seasonal nature of our medical claims costs and payroll taxes. Typically, \nmedical claims costs tend to increase throughout the year with the fourth quarter being the period with the highest costs, \nwhich has a negative impact on our fourth quarter earnings. This trend is primarily the result of many WSEEs’ medical \nplan deductibles being fully met by the fourth quarter, which increases our liability with respect to those claims. We have \nalso experienced variability on a quarterly basis in medical claims costs based on the unpredictable nature of large claims \nand the COVID-19 pandemic effect on health care utilization patterns, as well as incremental costs related to COVID-19 \ntesting, vaccination administration and treatment, which were driven by further COVID-19 variants in 2021. Payroll taxes \nand associated billings are computed based on an employee’s annual taxable wage base. The annual payroll tax wage \nbases are frequently met in the first two quarters of each year depending on the employee’s compensation levels. As a \nresult, the gross profit contribution from payroll taxes is typically higher in the first two quarters and declines in the latter \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n53\n2022 Form 10-K"

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the \nmarket values of our cash equivalent short-term investments and our available-for-sale marketable securities. In addition, \nborrowings under our Facility bear interest at a variable market rate. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding letters \nof credit and borrowings totaling $370.4 million under the Facility. Please read Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial \nStatements, “Long-Term Debt,” for additional information. Our cash equivalent short-term investments consist primarily of \novernight investments, which are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk, except to the extent that changes in \ninterest rates will ultimately affect the amount of interest income earned on these investments. Our available-for-sale \nmarketable securities are subject to interest rate risk because these securities generally include a fixed interest rate. As a \nresult, the market values of these securities are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates.\nWe attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through diversification and low investment turnover. Our \ninvestment policy is designed to maximize after-tax interest income while preserving our principal investment. As a result, \nour marketable securities consist of tax-exempt short and intermediate-term debt securities, which are primarily U.S. \nTreasury bills, as well as pre-refunded municipal bonds that are secured by escrow funds containing U.S. Government \nSecurities.\nItem 8.

(the Company) as of December 31, \n2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity (deficit) \nand cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively \nreferred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, \nin all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its \noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. \ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria \nestablished in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 9, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion \nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an \nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the \nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities \nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material \nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material \nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those \nrisks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide \na reasonable basis for our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements \nthat were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or \ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex \njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial \nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate \nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nF-2\n2022 Form 10-K"

While the policy with United is a fully insured plan, \nas a result of certain contractual terms, the Company accounts for this plan using a partially self-funded \ninsurance accounting model. Accordingly, the Company records the cost of the United plan, including an \nestimate of the incurred claims, taxes and administrative fees, as benefits expense, which is a component \nof Payroll taxes, benefits and workers’ compensation costs in the consolidated statement of operations. \nThe estimated incurred but not reported claims under the Company’s United insurance policy are based \nupon: (i) the level of claims processed during each quarter; (ii) estimated completion rates based upon \nrecent claim development patterns under the plan; and (iii) the number of participants in the plan, including \nboth active and COBRA enrollees.\nAuditing management’s estimate of the cost of incurred but not reported health insurance claims was \nsubjective and judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the medical reserve. \nEstimating incurred but not reported claims is subjective due to the large number of plan participants and \nthe possibility that the number, nature, magnitude, and the timing of processing of current period claims \nmay not be comparable to historical results experienced by the Company.\nHow We \nAddressed \nthe Matter in \nOur Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls \nover the estimation process, including, among others, controls over the completeness and accuracy of the \ndata used to estimate the cost of incurred health insurance claims and the review and approval processes \nthat management has in place for the assumptions applied and the calculation of the cost of incurred health \ninsurance claims. \nOur audit procedures included, among others, assessing (i) the Company’s health insurance cost \nestimation methodologies, (ii) significant assumptions used to develop the medical completion rates, which \nincludes the incurred but not reported component, (iii) the accuracy and completeness of the claims \nprocessed data and the number of plan participants used in the Company’s computation, as well as (iv) the \nhistorical accuracy of management’s estimates of the cost of incurred health insurance claims. Our testing \nof the medical completion rate assumptions included comparing the completion rate assumptions used by \nmanagement to the completion rates experienced in historical periods and assessing whether contrary \nevidence exists with respect to the completion rate assumptions utilized by the Company to estimate the \ncost of incurred health insurance claims. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in our \nevaluation of the Company’s methodologies and compared the Company’s estimate to a range developed \nby our actuarial specialists based on the historical claim data and independently selected assumptions.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nF-3\n2022 Form 10-K"

Under the Company’s insurance program, \nthe Company has financial responsibility for a significant portion of the workers’ compensation claims. Accordingly, the \naccrual related to incurred costs, which is recorded in accrued workers’ compensation costs in the consolidated \nbalance sheets, includes estimates that take into account the ongoing development of claims and therefore requires a \nsignificant level of judgment. The estimated accrued claims are based on (i) the loss development rate which is \nprimarily based upon the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and (ii) discount rates \nwhich correspond to the weighted-average estimated claim payout period. \nAuditing management’s estimate of the cost of incurred workers’ compensation claims was subjective and \njudgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the workers’ compensation reserve. \nEstimating accrued claims is subjective given the nature of the inputs to the underlying actuarial model as \nreferenced above.\nHow We \nAddressed \nthe Matter in \nOur Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls \nover the estimation process, including, among others, controls over the completeness and accuracy of data \nused to estimate the cost of incurred workers’ compensation claims and the review and approval processes \nthat management has in place for the assumptions applied and the calculation of the cost of incurred \nworkers’ compensation claims. \nOur audit procedures included, among others, assessing (i) the Company’s workers’ compensation reserve \nmethodologies, (ii) significant assumptions used to develop the loss development rate, as well as (iii) the \nhistorical accuracy of management’s estimates of the cost of incurred workers’ compensation claims. Our \naudit procedures included testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims and payroll data \nprovided to management’s third-party actuaries and reviewing the Company's insurance contracts to \nassess the Company's self-insured retentions, deductibles, and coverage limits. Furthermore, we involved \nour actuarial specialists to assist in our evaluation of the methodologies utilized by management‘s third-\nparty actuaries in developing the reserves recorded by the Company and compared the Company's \nestimate to a range developed by our actuarial specialists based on the historical loss data and \nindependently selected assumptions.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1991.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 9, 2023 \nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nF-4\n2022 Form 10-K"

(“Insperity” or “we”, “our”, and “us”) provides an array of human resources (“HR”) and business solutions \ndesigned to help improve business performance. Since our formation in 1986, we have evolved from being solely a \nprofessional employer organization (“PEO”), an industry we pioneered, to our current position as a comprehensive \nbusiness performance solutions provider. We were organized as a corporation in 1986 and have provided PEO services \nsince inception.\nOur most comprehensive HR services offerings are provided through our Workforce Optimization® and Workforce \nSynchronizationTM solutions (together, our “PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions”), which encompass a broad range of human \nresources functions, including payroll and employment administration, employee benefits, workers’ compensation, \ngovernment compliance, performance management and training and development services, along with our cloud-based \nhuman capital management platform, known as Insperity PremierTM. \nIn addition to our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions, we offer a comprehensive traditional payroll and human capital \nmanagement solution, known as our Workforce AccelerationTM solution. We also offer a number of other business \nperformance solutions, including Recruiting Services, Employment Screening, Retirement Services, and Insurance \nServices. These other products and services generally are offered only with our other solutions.\nWe provide our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions by entering into a co-employment relationship with our clients, under \nwhich Insperity and its clients each take responsibility for certain portions of the employer-employee relationship. Insperity \nand its clients designate each party’s responsibilities through its Client Service Agreement (“CSA”), under which Insperity \nbecomes an employer of the employees who work at the client’s location (“WSEE”) for most administrative and regulatory \npurposes.\nAs a co-employer of our WSEEs, we assume many of the rights and obligations associated with being an employer. We \nenter into an employment agreement with each WSEE, thereby maintaining a variety of employer rights, including the right \nto hire or terminate employees, the right to evaluate employee qualifications or performance, and the right to establish \nemployee compensation levels. Typically, Insperity only exercises these rights in consultation with its clients or when \nnecessary to ensure regulatory compliance. The responsibilities associated with our role as employer include the following \nobligations with regard to our WSEEs: (1) to compensate our WSEEs through wages and salaries; (2) to pay the employer \nportion of payroll-related taxes; (3) to withhold and remit (where applicable) the employee portion of payroll-related taxes; \n(4) to provide employee benefit programs; and (5) to provide workers’ compensation insurance coverage.\nIn addition to our assumption of employer status for our WSEEs, our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions also includes other \nhuman resources functions for our clients to support the effective and efficient use of personnel in their business \noperations. To provide these functions, we maintain a significant staff of professionals trained in a wide variety of HR \nfunctions, including employee training, employee recruiting, employee performance management, employee \ncompensation and employer liability management. These professionals interact and consult with clients on a daily basis to \nhelp identify each client’s service requirements and to ensure that we are providing appropriate and timely human capital \nmanagement services.\nRevenue and Direct Cost Recognition\nWe enter into contracts with our customers for HR services based on a stated rate and price in the contract. Our contracts \ngenerally establish pricing for a period of 12 months and are generally cancellable at any time by either party with 30-\ndays’ notice. Our performance obligations are satisfied as services are rendered each month. The term between invoicing \nand when our performance obligations are satisfied is not significant. Our payment terms typically require payment \nconcurrently with the invoicing of our PEO services. We do not have significant financing components or significant \npayment terms.\nOur revenue is generally recognized ratably over the payroll period as WSEEs perform their service at the client worksite \nin accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Customers \nare invoiced concurrently with each periodic payroll of its WSEEs. Revenues that have been recognized but not invoiced \nrepresent unbilled accounts receivable included in accounts receivable, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \nF-13\n2022 Form 10-K"

These costs are recorded in commissions in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOur revenue for our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions by geographic region and for our other products and services \nofferings are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nNortheast\n$ 1,624,556 $ 1,390,156 $ 1,189,837 \nSoutheast\n \n796,219  \n630,342  \n509,846 \nCentral\n \n1,045,043  \n867,914  \n761,905 \nSouthwest\n \n1,163,088  \n993,747  \n935,634 \nWest\n \n1,251,186  \n1,033,996  \n839,347 \n \n5,880,092  \n4,916,155  \n4,236,569 \nOther revenue\n \n58,726  \n56,915  \n50,435 \nTotal revenue\n$ 5,938,818 $ 4,973,070 $ 4,287,004 \nOur PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions revenues are primarily derived from our gross billings, which are based on (1) the \npayroll cost of our WSEEs; and (2) a markup computed as a percentage of the payroll cost. The gross billings are invoiced \nconcurrently with each periodic payroll of our WSEEs. Revenues, which exclude the payroll cost component of gross \nbillings and therefore consist solely of the markup, are recognized ratably over the payroll period as WSEEs perform their \nservice at the client worksite.\nIn determining the pricing of the markup component of our gross billings, we take into consideration our estimates of the \ncosts directly associated with our WSEEs, including payroll taxes, benefits and workers’ compensation costs, plus an \nacceptable gross profit margin. As a result, our operating results are significantly impacted by our ability to accurately \nestimate, control, and manage our direct costs relative to the revenues derived from the markup component of our gross \nbillings.\nConsistent with our revenue recognition policy, our direct costs do not include the payroll cost of our WSEEs. Our direct \ncosts associated with our revenue generating activities are primarily comprised of all other costs related to our WSEEs, \nsuch as the employer portion of payroll-related taxes, employee benefit plan premiums and workers’ compensation \ninsurance costs.\nSegment Reporting\nWe operate one reportable segment under ASC 280, Segment Reporting.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Insperity, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. \nIntercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles \n(“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial \nstatements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that could potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk include accounts receivable and \nmarketable securities.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \nF-14\n2022 Form 10-K"

All highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase are \nclassified as cash equivalents. Liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months are classified as \nmarketable securities in current assets.\nWe account for marketable securities in accordance with ASC 320, Investments — Debt and Equity Securities. We \ndetermine the appropriate classification of all marketable securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading at the \ntime of purchase, and re-evaluate such classification as of each balance sheet date. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, all \nof our investments in marketable securities were classified as available-for-sale, and as a result, were reported at fair \nvalue. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in \nstockholders’ equity (deficit). The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion \nof discounts from the date of purchase to maturity. Such amortization is included in interest income as an addition to or \ndeduction from the coupon interest earned on the investments. We use the specific identification method of determining \nthe cost basis in computing realized gains and losses on the sale of our available-for-sale securities. Realized gains and \nlosses are included in other income.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets \nusing the straight-line method.\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following:\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nLand\n$ \n6,215 $ \n6,215 \nBuildings and improvements\n \n207,740  \n206,449 \nComputer hardware and software\n \n141,856  \n136,346 \nSoftware development costs\n \n123,967  \n112,433 \nFurniture, fixtures and other\n \n50,835  \n51,552 \nProperty and equipment, gross\n \n530,613  \n512,995 \nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n \n(330,621)  \n(302,272) \nProperty and equipment, net\n$ \n199,992 $ \n210,723 \nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment for purposes of computing depreciation are as follows:\nUseful Life\nBuildings and improvements\n5 — 30 years\nComputer hardware and software\n2 —\n5 years\nSoftware development costs\n3 —\n3 years\nFurniture, fixtures and other\n5 —\n7 years\nSoftware development costs relate primarily to software code development, systems integration and testing of our \nproprietary professional employer information systems and are accounted for in accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal \nUse Software. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated \nuseful lives of the software, generally three years. We recognized $13.2 million, $10.9 million and $8.7 million in \namortization of capitalized software development costs in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Unamortized software \ndevelopment costs were $33.7 million and $35.4 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \nWe periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10, Property, Plant, and \nEquipment. ASC 360-10 requires that an impairment loss be recognized for assets to be disposed of or held-for-use when \nthe carrying amount of an asset is deemed to not be recoverable.

      "text": "flows to be generated from the applicable asset or asset group. In addition, we may record an impairment loss to the \nextent that the carrying value of the asset exceeded the fair value of the asset. Fair value is generally determined using an \nestimate of discounted future net cash flows from operating activities or upon disposal of the asset. \nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of a contract in accordance with ASC 842, Leases, as well as the \nFinancial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Updates clarifying the lease guidance. ROU assets \nrepresent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make \nlease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date \nbased on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit \ninterest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in \ndetermining the present value of lease payments. The lease terms used to calculate the ROU asset and related lease \nliability include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. \nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense. \nWe have lease agreements which require payments for lease and non-lease components and have elected to account for \nthese as a single lease component related to our other operating facilities. Please read Note 11, “Leases,” for additional \ninformation.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nOur goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis or when there is an indication that there has \nbeen a potential decline in the fair value of a reporting unit. Annually, we perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is \nmore likely than not that the fair value has declined below its carrying value. This analysis considers various qualitative \nfactors. Due to the nature of our business, all of our goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. We perform our annual \nimpairment testing during the fourth quarter. Based on the results of our analysis, no impairment loss was recognized in \n2022, 2021 or 2020.\nHealth Insurance Costs\nWe provide group health insurance coverage under a single-employer plan that covers both our WSEEs in our PEO HR \nOutsourcing Solutions and our corporate employees and utilizes a national network of carriers, including UnitedHealthcare \n(“United”), UnitedHealthcare of California, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Shield of California, HMSA BlueCross BlueShield of \nHawaii and Tufts, all of which provide fully insured policies or service contracts. \nApproximately 87% of our costs related to health insurance coverage are provided under our policy with United. While the \npolicy with United is a fully insured plan, as a result of certain contractual terms, we have accounted for this plan since its \ninception using a partially self-funded insurance accounting model. Effective January 1, 2020, under the amended \nagreement with United, we no longer have financial responsibilities for participant’s annual claim costs that exceed $1 \nmillion. Accordingly, we record the cost of the United plan, including an estimate of the incurred claims, taxes and \nadministrative fees (collectively the “Plan Costs”) as benefits expense, which is a component of direct costs, in our \nConsolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated incurred but not reported claims are based upon: (1) the level of \nclaims processed during each quarter; (2) estimated completion rates based upon recent claim development patterns \nunder the plan; and (3) the number of participants in the plan, including both active and COBRA enrollees. Each reporting \nperiod, changes in the estimated ultimate costs resulting from claim trends, plan design and migration, participant \ndemographics and other factors are incorporated into the benefits costs, which requires a significant level of judgment. \nAdditionally, since the plan’s inception, under the terms of the contract, United establishes cash funding rates 90 days in \nadvance of the beginning of a reporting quarter. If the Plan Costs for a reporting quarter are greater than the premiums \npaid and owed to United, a deficit in the plan would be incurred and a liability for the excess costs would be accrued in our \nConsolidated Balance Sheets. On the other hand, if the Plan Costs for the reporting quarter are less than the premiums \npaid and owed to United, a surplus in the plan would be incurred and we would record an asset for the excess premiums \nin our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The terms of the arrangement require us to maintain an accumulated cash surplus in \nthe plan of $9.0 million, which is reported as long-term prepaid insurance. In addition, United requires a deposit equal to \napproximately one day of claims funding activity, which was $6.5 million as of December 31, 2022, and is reported as a \nlong-term asset. As of December 31, 2022, Plan Costs were more than the net premiums paid and owed to United by $3.7 \nmillion. As this amount is less than the agreed-upon $9.0 million surplus maintenance level, the $5.3 million difference is \nincluded in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

      "text": "including the additional quarterly premiums, owed to United at December 31, 2022, were $46.4 million, which is also \nincluded in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our benefits costs \nincurred included an increase of $12.1 million in 2022, an increase of $4.9 million in 2021, and a reduction of $0.2 million \nin 2020 for changes in estimated run-off related to prior periods.\nWorkers’ Compensation Costs\nOur workers’ compensation coverage for our WSEEs in our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions has been provided through an \narrangement with the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies or its predecessors (the “Chubb Program”) since 2007. The \nChubb Program is fully insured in that Chubb has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred under the policy regardless \nof whether we satisfy our responsibilities. Under the Chubb Program, for claims incurred on or before September 30, \n2019, we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1 million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over \n$1 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $6 million per policy year for claims that exceed $1 million. Chubb bears \nthe financial responsibility for all claims in excess of these levels. Effective for claims incurred on or after October 1, 2019, \nwe have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1.5 million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over $1.5 \nmillion, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $6 million per policy year for claims that exceed $1.5 million.\nBecause we bear the financial responsibility for claims up to the levels noted above, such claims, which are the primary \ncomponent of our workers’ compensation costs, are recorded in the period incurred. Workers’ compensation insurance \nincludes ongoing health care and indemnity coverage whereby claims are paid over numerous years following the date of \ninjury. Accordingly, the accrual of related incurred costs in each reporting period includes estimates, which take into \naccount the ongoing development of claims and therefore requires a significant level of judgment.\nWe utilize a third-party actuary to estimate our loss development rate, which is primarily based upon the nature of WSEEs’ \njob responsibilities, the location of WSEEs, the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, and an \nestimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in \nactual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers’ compensation claims cost estimates. During \nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we reduced accrued workers’ compensation costs by $42.2 million, \n$41.7 million, and $42.1 million, respectively, for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting periods. Workers’ \ncompensation cost estimates are discounted to present value at a rate based upon the U.S. Treasury rates that \ncorrespond with the weighted average estimated claim payout period (the average discount rate was 2.9% in 2022 and \n0.6% in 2021) and are accreted over the estimated claim payment period and included as a component of direct costs in \nour Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table provides the activity and balances related to incurred but not paid workers’ compensation claims:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2022\n2021\nBeginning balance\n$ \n239,623 $ \n240,761 \nAccrued claims\n \n49,121  \n48,097 \nPresent value discount, net of accretion\n \n(9,517)  \n(898) \nPaid claims\n \n(49,819)  \n(48,337) \nEnding balance\n$ \n229,408 $ \n239,623 \nCurrent portion of accrued claims\n$ \n49,779 $ \n46,929 \nLong-term portion of accrued claims\n \n179,629  \n192,694 \nTotal accrued claims\n$ \n229,408 $ \n239,623 \nThe current portion of accrued workers’ compensation costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022 \nand 2021 includes $3.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively, of workers’ compensation administrative fees.\nThe undiscounted accrued workers’ compensation costs were $250.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and $255.1 million \nas of December 31, 2021.\nAt the beginning of each policy period, the workers’ compensation insurance carrier establishes monthly funding \nrequirements comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims (“claim funds”).

Monies funded into the program for incurred claims expected to be paid within one \nyear are recorded as restricted cash, a short-term asset, while the remainder of claim funds are included in deposits, a \nlong-term asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2022, we received $30.2 million for the return of excess claim \nfunds related to the workers’ compensation program, which decreased deposits. As of December 31, 2022, we had \nrestricted cash of $49.8 million and deposits of $196.4 million.\nOur estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid within one year is included in current liabilities, while our \nestimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid beyond one year is included in noncurrent liabilities on our \nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAt December 31, 2022, we have one stock-based employee compensation plan under which we may issue awards. We \naccount for this plan under the recognition and measurement principles of ASC 718, Compensation — Stock \nCompensation, which requires all share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the income statement based \non their fair values.\nWe generally make annual grants of unrestricted stock under our stock-based incentive compensation plan to our non-\nemployee directors, and grants of restricted stock units to our officers and certain other employees. Restricted stock unit \ngrants to officers and other employees generally vest over a period of three years from the date of grant. Restricted stock \nunits are valued based on the fair value on date of grant and the associated expense, net of estimated forfeitures, and are \nrecognized over the requisite service period. Stock grants issued to non-employee directors are 100% vested on the grant \ndate. \nOur Insperity Long-Term Incentive Program (the “LTIP”) provides for performance based long-term compensation awards \nin the form of performance units to certain employees based on the achievement of pre-established performance goals. \nEach performance unit represents the right to receive one common share at a future date based on our performance \nagainst certain targets. Performance units have a vesting schedule of three years. A portion of the LTIP grant to \nemployees was considered a market-based performance award that cliff vests at the end of three years assuming \ncontinued employment and achievement of market-based performance goals. The fair value of each performance unit is \nthe market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each market-based performance unit was \ndetermined through use of the Monte Carlo simulation method. The compensation expense for such awards is recognized \non a straight-line basis over the vesting term. Over the performance period the number of shares expected to be issued is \nadjusted upward or downward based on the probability of achievement of the performance target.\nCompany-Sponsored 401(k) Retirement Plans\nUnder our 401(k) retirement plan for corporate employees (the “Corporate Plan”), we matched 100% of eligible corporate \nemployees’ contributions, up to 6% of the employees’ eligible compensation in 2022, ranging from 3% to 6% of the \nemployees’ eligible compensation in 2021, and up to 6% of the employees’ eligible compensation in 2020. Matching \ncontributions under the Corporate Plan are immediately vested. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we made matching \ncontributions on behalf of corporate employees to the Corporate Plan of $14.4 million, $8.2 million, and $12.6 million, \nrespectively, and are included in salaries, wages and payroll taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nUnder our separate 401(k) retirement plan for WSEEs (the “Worksite Employee Plan”), the match percentage for WSEEs \nranges from 0% to 6%, as determined by each client company. Matching contributions under the Worksite Employee Plan \nare immediately vested. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we made matching contributions on behalf of WSEEs to the \nWorksite Employee Plan of $328.5 million, $244.1 million, and $199.2 million, respectively.\nAdvertising\nWe expense all advertising costs as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are \ndetermined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and \nare measured using the enacted tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.

The Board may at any time amend or terminate the 2012 Incentive Plan. \nHowever, no amendment that would impair the rights of any participant, with respect to outstanding grants, can be made \nwithout the participant’s prior consent. Stockholder approval of amendments to the 2012 Incentive Plan is necessary only \nwhen required by applicable law or stock exchange rules. Assuming all outstanding performance-based awards are paid \nat maximum achievement of pre-established performance goals, at December 31, 2022, 942,973 shares of common stock \nwere available for future grants under the 2012 Incentive Plan. \nWe also maintain the Insperity, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) under the 2012 Incentive Plan. The LTIP provides \nfor performance-based long-term compensation awards in the form of performance units to certain employees based on \nthe achievement of pre-established performance goals. We granted performance units under the LTIP to our named \nexecutive officers and certain other officers in 2020, 2021 and 2022. \nEmployees who attain a minimum age of 62 and have provided 15 years or more of continuous service may continue to \nvest in awards following a qualifying retirement as defined under the 2012 Incentive Plan award agreement, as though he \nor she were still an employee, provided the grant date of the award is six months or more before the employee’s last day \nof employment, the employee provides the Company with six months advance notice of retirement, the employee \ncontinues to work full-time during such six (6) month period, and the employee signs a waiver and release of claims. In \naddition, in order to avoid forfeiting any outstanding award, a retired employee must refrain from providing any services, \nincluding but not limited to, as an employee, director, advisor, or independent contractor to a business engaged in \nproviding any services offered by the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates at the time of the employee’s retirement, \nincluding but not limited to PEO services, payroll services, retirement services or insurances services.

Such value is recognized as compensation expense over the \ncorresponding vesting period, generally three years to five years for awards currently outstanding. However, for some \nRSUs currently outstanding, compensation expense is accelerated over the shortened requisite service period for \nemployees who meet the requirements for continued vesting.\nThe following is a summary of time-based RSAs and time-based RSUs award activity for 2022:\nTotal Awards\n(in thousands)\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nValue\nNon-vested — December 31, 2021\n \n713 $ \n82.61 \nGranted\n \n653  \n90.06 \nVested\n \n(340)  \n85.53 \nCanceled\n \n(39)  \n86.38 \nNon-vested — December 31, 2022\n \n987 $ \n86.34 \nAdditional disclosures for time-based RSAs and time-based RSUs:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nWeighted average grant date fair value of awards granted\n$ \n90.06 $ \n88.84 $ \n66.32 \nFair value of awards vested during the year (in millions)\n \n30.4  \n28.7  \n18.1 \nAs of December 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation expense associated with the unvested RSAs and RSUs \noutstanding was $44.0 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 23 months.\nLong-Term Incentive Program Awards\nEach performance unit represents the right to receive common shares at a future date based on our performance against \nspecified targets. The ultimate number of shares issued and the related compensation cost recognized is based on a \ncomparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets, which can range from 0% to 200% of the targeted \namounts. A performance unit may be comprised of either a performance-based award or a market-based award. For \nperformance-based awards, performance units have a vesting schedule of three years and compensation expense is \nrecognized based on the number of common shares expected to be issued and the market price per common share on \nthe date of grant. Over the performance period, the number of shares expected to be issued is adjusted upward or \ndownward based upon the probability of achievement of the performance targets.

The ESPP is a non-compensatory plan under GAAP for \nstock-based compensation. As a result, no compensation expense is recognized in conjunction with this plan. \nApproximately 36,000, 36,000 and 57,000 shares were issued from treasury under the ESPP during fiscal years 2022, \n2021 and 2020, respectively.\n10. Earnings Per Share\nFrom 2009 through 2021, we used the two-class method to compute basic earnings per share (“Basic EPS”) and diluted \nearnings per share (\"Diluted EPS\"). Under the accounting guidance for the calculation of earnings per share for share-\nbased payment awards with rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, unvested share-based payment awards that \ncontain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and \nare included in the computation of Basic EPS and Diluted EPS using the two-class method.\nIn 2022, our share-based payment awards with non-forfeitable rights to dividends became fully vested. As a result, we are \nno longer required to use the two-class method and, at December 31, 2022, we used the treasury stock method to \ncalculate earnings per share. \nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during \nthe period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares \noutstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of time-vested and performance-based RSUs.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \nF-27\n2022 Form 10-K"
