Virtual attendance at the annual meeting constitutes presence in person for purposes of a quorum at the\nmeeting. For purposes of determining a quorum, your shares will be included as represented at the meeting even if you\nindicate on your proxy that you abstain from voting. If a broker, who is a record holder of shares, indicates on a form of proxy\nthat the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote those shares on a particular proposal or proposals, or if\nthose shares are voted in circumstances in which proxy authority is defective or has been withheld, those shares (broker\nnon-votes) will nevertheless be treated as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. See “—Voting\nProcedures for Shares Held in Street Name—Effect of Broker Non-Votes” below.\nWHO MAY VOTE\nHolders of shares of LBRDA, LBRDB and LBRDP, as recorded in our stock register as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time,\non April 10, 2023 (such date and time, the record date for the annual meeting), will be entitled to notice of the annual\nmeeting and to vote at the annual meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.\nVOTES REQUIRED\nEach director nominee who receives a plurality of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our voting\nstock present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors at\nthe annual meeting, voting together as a single class, will be elected to office.\nApproval of the auditors ratification proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the combined voting power of\nthe outstanding shares of our voting stock that are present in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the annual meeting,\nvoting together as a single class.\nTHE ANNUAL MEETING\n10 / 2023 PROXY STATEMENT"

For a director\nto be deemed independent, our Board of Directors must affirmatively determine that the director has no direct or indirect\nmaterial relationship with us. To assist our Board of Directors in determining which of our directors qualify as independent\nfor purposes of Nasdaq rules as well as applicable rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the nominating and\ncorporate governance committee of our Board of Directors follows Nasdaq’s corporate governance rules on the criteria\nfor director independence.\nOur Board of Directors has determined that each of Gregg L. Engles, Julie D. Frist, Richard R. Green, Sue Ann R.\nHamilton, J. David Wargo and John E. Welsh III qualifies as an independent director of our company.\nBOARD COMPOSITION\nAs described above under “Proposal 1—The Election of Directors Proposal,” our Board is comprised of directors with a\nbroad range of backgrounds and skill sets, including in media and telecommunications, science and technology, venture\ncapital, investment banking, auditing and financial engineering. For more information on our policies with respect to Board\ncandidates, see “—Board Criteria and Director Candidates” below.\nBOARD CLASSIFICATION\nAs described above under “Proposal 1—The Election of Directors Proposal,” our Board of Directors currently consists of\neight directors, divided among three classes. Our Board believes that its current classified structure, with directors serving\nfor three-year terms, is the appropriate Board structure for our company at this time and is in the best interests of our\nstockholders for the following reasons.\nLONG-TERM FOCUS & ACCOUNTABILITY\nOur Board believes that a classified board encourages our directors to look to the long-term best interest of our company\nand our stockholders, rather than being unduly influenced by the short-term focus of certain investors and special interests.\nIn addition, our Board believes that three-year terms focus director accountability on the Board’s long-term strategic\nvision and performance, rather than short-term pressures and circumstances.\nCONTINUITY OF BOARD LEADERSHIP\nA classified board allows for a greater amount of stability and continuity providing institutional perspective and knowledge\nto both management and less-tenured directors. By its very nature, a classified board ensures that at any given time\nthere will be experienced directors serving on our Board who are fully immersed in and knowledgeable about our\nbusinesses, including our relationships with current and potential strategic partners, as well as the competition, opportunities,\nrisks and challenges that exist in the industries in which our businesses operate. We also believe the benefit of a classified\nboard to our company and our stockholders comes not from continuity alone but rather from the continuity of highly\nqualified, engaged and knowledgeable directors focused on long-term stockholder interests. Each year, our nominating\nand corporate governance committee works actively to ensure our Board continues to be comprised of such individuals.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nLIBERTY BROADBAND CORPORATION / 23"

We believe this division of responsibility effectively assists our Board in fulfilling its duties.\nBOARD ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT\nThe Board as a whole has responsibility for risk oversight, with reviews of certain areas being conducted by the relevant\nBoard committees. Our audit committee oversees management of financial risks and risks relating to potential conflicts of\ninterest. Our compensation committee oversees the management of risks relating to our compensation arrangements\nwith senior officers. Our nominating and corporate governance committee oversees the nomination of individuals with the\njudgment, skills, integrity, and independence necessary to oversee the key risks associated with our company, as well\nas risks inherent in our corporate structure. These committees then provide reports periodically to the full Board. In addition,\nthe oversight and review of other strategic risks are conducted directly by the full Board.\nThe oversight responsibility of the Board and its committees is enabled by management reporting processes that are\ndesigned to provide visibility to the Board about the identification, assessment and management of critical short-,\nintermediate-, and long-term risks. These areas of focus include existing and emerging strategic, operational, financial\nand reporting, succession and compensation, legal and compliance, cybersecurity and other risks, including those related\nto material environmental and social matters such as climate change, human capital management, diversity, equity and\ninclusion, and community relations. Our management reporting processes include regular reports from Mr. Maffei, which\nare prepared with input from our senior management team, and also include input from our Internal Audit group and our Vice\nPresident, Investor Relations, who manages our company’s ESG efforts and remains in regular contact with senior ESG\nleaders across our portfolio of companies who provide feedback and disclosure on material issues.

      "text": "BOARD CRITERIA AND DIRECTOR CANDIDATES\nBOARD CRITERIA. The nominating and corporate governance committee believes that nominees for director should\npossess the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity, values and judgment and should be committed to the\nlong-term interests of our stockholders. To be nominated to serve as a director, a nominee need not meet any specific\nminimum criteria. As described in our corporate governance guidelines, director candidates are identified and nominated\nbased on broad criteria, with the objective of identifying and retaining directors that can effectively develop the company’s\nstrategy and oversee management’s execution of that strategy. In the director candidate identification and nomination\nprocess, our Board seeks a breadth of experience from a variety of industries and from professional disciplines, along with\na diversity of gender, ethnicity, age and other characteristics. When evaluating a potential director nominee, including one\nrecommended by a stockholder, the nominating and corporate governance committee will take into account a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n• independence from management;\n• his or her unique background, including education, professional experience, relevant skill sets and diversity of\ngender, ethnicity, age and other characteristics;\n• judgment, skill, integrity and reputation;\n• existing commitments to other businesses as a director, executive or owner;\n• personal conflicts of interest, if any; and\n• the size and composition of the existing Board of Directors, including whether the potential director nominee would\npositively impact the composition of the Board by bringing a new perspective or viewpoint to the Board of Directors.\nThe nominating and corporate governance committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no particular\ncriterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees.\nOUTSIDE COMMITMENTS. In recent years, some investors and proxy advisors have instituted “bright-line” proxy voting\npolicies on the number of outside public company boards that a director may serve on. Our Board of Directors recognizes\ninvestors’ concerns that highly sought-after directors could lack the time and attention to adequately perform their duties\nand responsibilities, and considers each director’s performance and commitment to ensure their continued effectiveness as\na director. Given our company’s ownership interest in Charter, our company and our Board values the positions of certain\nof our directors and members of management hold on Charter’s Board, as they provide our company with unique insight and\ninput into Charter’s business and operations. The nominating and corporate governance committee also recognizes and\nvalues the benefits derived by our directors from their service on other public company boards, as such service provides our\ndirectors with diverse perspectives, in-depth industry knowledge and cross-industry insights, all of which enhance the\nknowledge base and skill set of our Board as a whole.\nOur Board also recognizes the uniqueness of the relationships among Liberty Media, Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband\nand Liberty TripAdvisor, including the collaborative approach to addressing ESG, as well as with the portfolio of assets within\neach of these public companies. To the extent our directors serve on more than one of the Boards of these companies,\nwe believe that such service is an important aspect of our directors’ (including Messrs. Malone’s and Maffei’s) service, as\nit capitalizes on various synergies between and among these Boards. For this reason, we believe that a better presentation\nof these directors’ outside commitments is to consider the number of their “non-Liberty” public company board directorships\n(see “Proposal 1—The Election of Directors Proposal—Our Board at a Glance”). Based on this perspective, we have\nconsidered the facts-and-circumstances of the roles of our directors with our company, including the following considerations:\n• from a historical perspective, the significant time and resources each of these directors has regularly dedicated to\nour company;\n• the nature of their Board commitments relating to their respective roles with these companies;\n• the synergies between their respective service on these other Boards and ours;\n• their respective service on “non-Liberty” public company board directorships; and\n• the respective directors’ personal skills, expertise and qualifications (including the broad industry knowledge of\neach such director).\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n28 / 2023 PROXY STATEMENT"

The awards issued to our directors with respect to their\nservice on our Board in 2023 were issued in December 2022. See “—Director RSU Grants” and “—Director Option Grants”\nbelow for information on the equity awards granted in 2022 to the nonemployee directors with respect to service on our\nBoard in 2023.\nFees for service on our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee\nare the same for 2023 and 2022, with each member thereof receiving an additional annual fee of $15,000, $10,000 and\n$10,000, respectively, for his or her participation on each such committee, except that the chairperson of each such\ncommittee instead receives an additional annual fee of $25,000, $15,000 and $15,000, respectively, for his or her\nparticipation on that committee. The cash portion of the director fees and the fees for participation on committees are\npayable quarterly in arrears.\nEQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN\nAs discussed below, awards granted to our nonemployee directors under the Liberty Broadband Corporation 2019\nOmnibus Incentive Plan, as amended (the 2019 incentive plan) are administered by our Board of Directors or our\ncompensation committee. Our Board of Directors has full power and authority to grant eligible persons the awards described\nbelow and to determine the terms and conditions under which any awards are made. The 2019 incentive plan is designed\nto provide additional remuneration to our nonemployee directors and independent contractors, among others, to\nencourage their investment in our capital stock, thereby increasing their proprietary interest in our business and to aid in\nattracting persons of exceptional ability to become nonemployee directors of our company. Our Board of Directors may grant\nnon-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted shares, RSUs, cash awards, performance\nawards or any combination of the foregoing under the 2019 incentive plan.\nThe maximum number of shares of our common stock with respect to which awards may be issued under the 2019\nincentive plan is 6,000,000, subject to anti-dilution and other adjustment provisions of the respective plans. Under the\n2019 incentive plan, no nonemployee director may be granted during any calendar year awards having a value determined\non the date of grant in excess of $3 million. Shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to awards made under the\n2019 incentive plan are made available from either authorized but unissued shares or shares that have been issued but\nreacquired by our company.\nDIRECTOR RSU GRANTS\nPursuant to our director compensation policy described above and the 2019 incentive plan, on December 12, 2022,\nMr. Engles and Dr. Green were granted RSUs with respect to 488 and 976 shares of LBRDK, respectively. The RSUs will\nvest on the first anniversary of the grant date, or on such earlier date that the grantee ceases to be a director because of\ndeath or disability and, unless our Board of Directors determines otherwise, will be forfeited if the grantee resigns or is\nremoved from the Board before the vesting date.\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nLIBERTY BROADBAND CORPORATION / 31"

As a result, Liberty\nMedia employees, including our named executive officers other than Mr. Maffei, who is paid certain compensation elements\ndirectly by our company pursuant to the amended services agreement (as described below), are typically not separately\ncompensated by our company other than with respect to equity awards with respect to our common stock and with respect\nto performance-based cash bonuses.

Maffei—2019 Maffei\nEmployment Agreement.” Under the 2019 Maffei Employment Agreement, Mr. Maffei’s compensation was allocated\nacross Liberty Media, and each of our company, Qurate Retail and Liberty TripAdvisor (each a Service Company, or,\ncollectively, the Service Companies) based on two factors, each weighted 50%: (i) the relative market capitalization of each\nseries of stock of each company and (ii) the average of (a) the percentage allocation of time for all Liberty Media\nemployees across all companies and (b) Mr. Maffei’s percentage allocation of time across all companies, unless a different\nallocation method is agreed.

Mr. Maffei may\nmake recommendations with respect to any equity compensation and performance cash bonuses to be awarded to our\nexecutive officers. It is expected that Mr. Maffei, in making any related recommendations to our compensation committee,\nwill evaluate the performance and contributions of each of our executive officers, given his or her respective area of\nresponsibility, and, in doing so, will consider various qualitative factors such as:\n• the executive officer’s experience and overall effectiveness;\n• the executive officer’s performance during the preceding year;\n• the responsibilities of the executive officer, including any changes to those responsibilities over the year; and\n• the executive officer’s demonstrated leadership and management ability.\nWhen determining the extent to which the 2022 Chief RSUs (as defined below) were earned by our named executive\nofficers, our compensation committee considered the recommendations obtained from Mr. Maffei as to the performance of\nMessrs. Wendling and Rosenthaler and Ms. Wilm. To make these recommendations, Mr. Maffei evaluated the performance\nand contributions of each such named executive officer.\nIn December 2019, our compensation committee approved the amended services agreement, which established the\nterms and conditions of our allocable portion of Mr. Maffei’s compensation for the term of the 2019 Maffei Employment\nAgreement. See “—Services Agreement” above.\nAt the 2021 annual stockholder meeting, stockholders representing a majority of the aggregate voting power of Liberty\nBroadband present and entitled to vote on its say-on-pay proposal voted in favor of, on an advisory basis, Liberty Broadband’s\nexecutive compensation, as disclosed in our proxy statement for the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders. No material\nchanges were implemented to our executive compensation program as a result of this vote. In addition, at the 2021 annual\nmeeting of stockholders, stockholders elected to hold a say-on-pay vote every three years.\nROLE OF INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT\nPrior to entering into the amended services agreement with Liberty Media in connection with the 2019 Maffei Employment\nAgreement, our compensation committee engaged Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (FW Cook), an independent and\nexperienced compensation consultant, to assist in determining the reasonableness of compensation to be allocated to our\ncompany under the amended services agreement.\nIn order to assess the reasonableness of compensation, FW Cook evaluated the market value of Mr. Maffei’s role at our\ncompany and the proposed allocation to our company under the amended services agreement.

Also set forth in the table below are the corresponding\nactual financial measures achieved for 2022, which deviated from our forecasts as indicated below. Although forecasted\nrevenue, Adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow deviated from the actual result, none of the deviations would have affected the\namounts paid under the corporate performance bonus portion of the program.\nFor purposes of the bonus program, Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and\namortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, transaction related costs (including\nacquisition, restructuring, integration, and advisory fees), impairments and fire related costs.

For\nmore information regarding these bonus awards, please see the “Grants of Plan-Based Awards” table below.\nEQUITY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION\nThe 2019 incentive plan provides for the grant of a variety of incentive awards, including stock options, restricted shares,\nRSUs, SARs and performance awards. Subject to share availability considerations, our compensation committee has a\npreference for grants of stock options and awards of restricted stock or RSUs (as compared with other types of available\nawards under the 2019 incentive plan) based on the belief that they better promote retention of key employees through the\ncontinuing, long-term nature of an equity investment. It is the policy of our compensation committee that stock options\nbe awarded with an exercise price equal to fair market value on the date of grant, typically measured by reference to the\nclosing price on the grant date.\nAs discussed above, our executive officers perform management services for our company pursuant to the amended\nservices agreement. In consultation with the compensation Committees of each of Liberty Media and the other Service\nCompanies, our compensation committee determined that each of our company, Liberty Media and the other Service\nCompanies would grant a proportionate share of the aggregate equity grant value to each named executive officer each year\nfor their service to our company and each of Liberty Media and the other Service Companies. The proportionate share\nfor each company was determined based 50% on the relative market capitalization and 50% on relative time spent by Liberty\nMedia’s employees working for such issuer. With respect to awards made to Mr. Maffei, the 2019 Maffei Employment\nAgreement provides that Mr. Maffei’s aggregate annual equity award value will be granted across Liberty Media and the\nService Companies by Liberty Media’s compensation committee, our compensation committee and the compensation\ncommittees of each other Service Company based on two factors, each weighted 50%: (i) the relative market capitalization\nof each series of stock of each company and (ii) the average of (a) the percentage allocation of time for all Liberty\nMedia employees across all companies and (b) Mr. Maffei’s percentage allocation of time across all companies, unless a\ndifferent allocation method is agreed.\nMaffei Annual Equity Awards. The 2019 Maffei Employment Agreement provides Mr. Maffei with the opportunity to\nearn equity awards during the employment term. See “—Executive Compensation Arrangements—Gregory B. Maffei—\nAnnual Awards” for additional information about the annual awards provided under the 2019 Maffei Employment Agreement.\nWhen structuring the 2019 Maffei Employment Agreement, to further align Mr. Maffei’s interests with those of the other\nstockholders, the compensation committee structured his annual equity award grants as either option awards or\nperformance-based restricted stock units with meaningful payout metrics determined annually. This structure was designed\nto provide for alignment of interests with the company’s stockholders and flexibility to the compensation committee to\nincent achievement of strategic objectives that may change or evolve over the term of the agreement.\nThe 2019 Maffei Employment Agreement provided that Mr. Maffei was entitled to receive from our company, Liberty Media\nand the other Service Companies in 2022 a combined target value equity award of $17.5 million comprised of time-vested\nstock options, performance-based restricted stock units or a combination of award types, at Mr. Maffei’s election.\nIn 2022, our compensation committee granted time-vested stock options to Mr. Maffei in satisfaction of our obligations\nunder the 2019 Maffei Employment Agreement for 33% of Mr. Maffei’s aggregate annual equity award for 2022, or\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n46 / 2023 PROXY STATEMENT"

      "text": "$5,775,000. Our compensation committee believed that time-vested stock options are consistent with its philosophy of\naligning the interests of the named executive officers with those of our stockholders, with the ultimate goal of appropriately\nmotivating our executives to increase long-term stockholder value.\nAs a result, our compensation committee granted to Mr. Maffei 136,100 LBRDK time-vested options (the 2022 Maffei\nAnnual Options). The 2022 Maffei Annual Options had a grant date of March 11, 2022, a term of seven years, and an\nexercise price of $138.26, which was the closing price of LBRDK on the grant date. In addition, the stock options vested in\nfull on December 30, 2022, and were subject to other applicable terms and conditions for option grants as set forth in the\n2019 Maffei Employment Agreement.\nFor more information regarding the equity awards, see the “Grants of Plan-Based Awards” table below.\nMultiyear Equity Awards. Our compensation committee makes larger stock option grants (equaling approximately three\nto four years’ value of the named executive officer’s annual grants) that vest between two and four years after grant, rather\nthan making annual grants over the same period. These multiyear grants provide for back-end weighted vesting and\ngenerally expire seven to ten years after grant to encourage executives to remain with the company over the long-term\nand to better align their interests with those of the stockholders. Messrs. Wendling and Rosenthaler and Ms. Wilm each\nreceived a multiyear stock option award in December 2020 (the 2020 NEO Multiyear Options), which equaled the value\nof, for Messrs. Wendling and Rosenthaler, the annual grants that were expected to be granted to each for the period from\nJanuary 1, 2021 through December 31, 2023, and for Ms. Wilm, a top up in value over grants already made for the\nsame period to reflect the increased responsibilities associated with her new role beginning in 2021 of Chief Administrative\nOfficer. One-half of each named executive officer’s 2020 NEO Multiyear Options vested on December 7, 2022 and the\nremaining one-half will vest on December 7, 2023. See the “Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal-Year End” table below\nfor more information about the 2020 NEO Multiyear Options.\nPerformance-based RSU Awards. Our compensation committee granted annual performance RSUs to Messrs. Wendling\nand Rosenthaler and Ms. Wilm in March 2022. Our compensation committee granted to each of Messrs. Wendling and\nRosenthaler and Ms. Wilm 1,698, 3,067 and 3,067 LBRDK performance-based RSUs, respectively, (collectively, the 2022\nChief RSUs). The 2022 Chief RSUs would vest subject to the satisfaction of the performance objectives described below.\nOur compensation committee adopted an annual, performance-based program for payment of the 2022 Chief RSUs\nand reviewed each named executive officer’s performance against that performance program to determine which portion\nof the award would be paid. Our compensation committee reviewed the 2022 personal performance of Messrs. Wendling\nand Rosenthaler and Ms. Wilm and considered the recommendations from Mr. Maffei. Mr. Maffei recommended that our\ncommittee vest 100% of the 2022 Chief RSUs based on his assessment of their individual performance against the goals\nestablished in connection with the performance cash bonus program and his general observation of their leadership and\nexecutive performance. Accordingly, our compensation committee approved vesting in full of the 2022 Chief RSUs previously\ngranted to Messrs. Wendling and Rosenthaler and Ms. Wilm.\nPERQUISITES AND OTHER PERSONAL BENEFITS\nThe perquisites and other personal benefits available to our executives (that are not otherwise available to all of our\nsalaried employees) consist of:\n• limited personal use of Liberty Media’s corporate aircraft (pursuant to aircraft time sharing agreements between\nour company and Liberty Media);\n• in the case of Mr. Maffei, payment of legal expenses pertaining to his employment arrangement; and\n• occasional, personal use of Liberty Media’s apartment in New York City (pursuant to a sharing arrangement\nbetween our company and Liberty Media), which is primarily used for business purposes, and occasional, personal\nuse of a company car and driver.\nTaxable income may be incurred by our executives in connection with their receipt of perquisites and personal benefits.\nWe have not provided gross-up payments to our executives in connection with any such taxable income incurred during the\npast three years.\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nLIBERTY BROADBAND CORPORATION / 47"

If Mr. Maffei’s employment is terminated due to disability, for good reason or without\ncause, Mr. Maffei would be entitled to continued use of the corporate aircraft for 12 months after termination of his\nemployment.

Flights where\nthere are no passengers on company-owned aircraft are not charged against the 120 hours of personal flight time per\nyear allotted to Mr. Maffei if the flight department determines that the use of a NetJets, Inc. supplied aircraft for a proposed\npersonal flight would be disadvantageous to our company due to (i) use of budgeted hours under the then current Liberty\nMedia fractional ownership contract with NetJets, Inc. or (ii) higher flight cost as compared to the cost of using\ncompany-owned aircraft.\nFor disclosure purposes, Liberty Media determines the aggregate incremental cost to Liberty Media of the executives’\npersonal flights by using a method that takes into account all operating costs related to such flights, including:\n• landing and parking expenses;\n• crew travel expenses;\n• supplies and catering;\n• aircraft fuel and oil expenses per hour of flight;\n• aircraft maintenance and upkeep;\n• any customs, foreign permit and similar fees; and\n• passenger ground transportation.\nBecause Liberty Media’s aircraft is used primarily for business travel, this methodology excludes fixed costs that do not\nchange based on usage, such as salaries of pilots and crew, and purchase or lease costs of aircraft.\nPursuant to the amended services agreement, we pay Liberty Media for any costs, calculated in accordance with Part 91\nof the Federal Aviation Regulations, associated with Mr. Maffei using Liberty Media’s corporate aircraft for our company’s\nbusiness matters along with the approved personal use of Liberty Media’s corporate aircraft that are allocable to our\ncompany under the amended services agreement. Pursuant to aircraft time sharing agreements between Liberty Media\nand Mr. Maffei, Mr. Maffei was responsible for reimbursing Liberty Media for costs associated with his 50 additional hours\nper year of personal flight time and such costs include the expenses listed above, insurance obtained for the specific flight\nand an additional charge equal to 100% of the aircraft fuel and oil expenses for the specific flight.\nFor purposes of determining an executive’s taxable income, personal use of Liberty Media’s aircraft is valued using a\nmethod based on SIFL rates, as published by the Treasury Department. The amount determined using the SIFL rates is\ntypically lower than the amount determined using the incremental cost method. Under the American Jobs Creation Act of\n2004, the amount that may be deducted for U.S. federal income tax purposes for a purely personal flight is limited to the\namount included in the taxable income of the executives who took the flight. Also, the deductibility of any non-business\nuse will be limited by Section 162(m) of the Code to the extent that the named executive officer’s compensation that is\nsubject to that limitation exceeds $1 million. See “—Deductibility of Executive Compensation” below.\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n48 / 2023 PROXY STATEMENT"

      "text": "DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nIn developing the 2022 compensation packages for the named executive officers, the deductibility of executive\ncompensation under Section 162(m) of the Code is considered. That provision prohibits the deduction of compensation of\nmore than $1 million paid to certain executives, subject to certain exceptions. Following the enactment of the Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act of 2017, beginning with the 2018 calendar year, the executives potentially affected by the limitations of\nSection 162(m) of the Code have been expanded and there is no longer any exception for qualified performance-based\ncompensation. Therefore, portions of the compensation we pay to the named executive officers may not be deductible due\nto the application of Section 162(m) of the Code. Our compensation committee believes that the lost deduction on\ncompensation payable in excess of the $1 million limitation for the named executive officers is not material relative to the\nbenefit of being able to attract and retain talented management.\nRECOUPMENT PROVISIONS\nIn those instances where we grant equity-based incentive compensation, we expect to include in the related agreement\nwith the executive a right, in favor of our company, to require the executive to repay or return to the company any cash, stock\nor other incentive compensation (including proceeds from the disposition of shares received upon exercise of options or\nstock appreciation rights). That right will arise if (1) a material restatement of any of our financial statements is required and\n(2) in the reasonable judgment of our compensation committee, (A) such restatement is due to material noncompliance\nwith any financial reporting requirement under applicable securities laws and (B) such noncompliance is a result of\nmisconduct on the part of the executive. In determining the amount of such repayment or return, our compensation\ncommittee may take into account, among other factors it deems relevant, the extent to which the market value of the\napplicable series of our common stock was affected by the errors giving rise to the restatement. The cash, stock or other\ncompensation that we may require the executive to repay or return must have been received by the executive during the\n12-month period beginning on the date of the first public issuance or the filing with the SEC, whichever occurs earlier, of\nthe financial statement requiring restatement. The compensation required to be repaid or returned will include (1) cash or\ncompany stock received by the executive (A) upon the exercise during that 12-month period of any stock appreciation right\nheld by the executive or (B) upon the payment during that 12-month period of any incentive compensation, the value of\nwhich is determined by reference to the value of company stock, and (2) any proceeds received by the executive from the\ndisposition during that 12-month period of company stock received by the executive upon the exercise, vesting or payment\nduring that 12-month period of any award of equity-based incentive compensation. Beginning in December 2020, we also\nbegan including in new forms of equity-based award agreements a right, in favor of our company, to require the executive\nto repay or return to the company, upon a reasonable determination by our compensation committee that the executive\nbreached the confidentiality obligations included in the agreement, all or any portion of the outstanding award, any\nshares received under awards during the 12-month period prior to any such breach or any time after such breach and any\nproceeds from the disposition of shares received under awards during the 12-month period prior to any such breach or\nany time after such breach. The company intends to review and update its recoupment provisions as necessary or appropriate\nin light of the new rules adopted by the SEC and Nasdaq with respect to the recoupment of incentive compensation.\nSTOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES AND HEDGING POLICIES\nOur Board of Directors has adopted stock ownership guidelines that generally require our executive officers to own shares\nof our company’s stock equal to at least three times the value of the annual performance RSUs granted by our company\nto such executive officer, or in the case of Mr. Maffei, three times the value of the annual performance RSUs or annual option\nawards, as selected by Mr. Maffei, with the required ownership level automatically adjusted following these annual grants.\nOur executive officers generally have five years from the date of their appointment to an executive officer role to comply with\nthese guidelines. For information regarding our policies with respect to the ability of our officers and directors to hedge or\noffset any decrease in the market value of our equity securities, see “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and\nManagement—Hedging Disclosure.”\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION\nThe compensation committee members whose names appear on the Compensation Committee Report below comprised\nthe compensation committee during 2022. No member of our compensation committee during 2022 is or has been an officer\nor employee of our company, or has engaged in any related party transaction in which our company was a participant.\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nLIBERTY BROADBAND CORPORATION / 49"

Mr. Maffei received\nan aggregate of $147,600 in cash salary during 2020. In consideration for the portion of Mr. Maffei’s 2020 base salary that he\noffered to waive and restructure (which totaled $392,400), we granted to Mr. Maffei RSUs, which had a grant date fair value of\n$225,003, and this amount is reflected in the “Salary” column of this Summary Compensation Table.\n(2)\nReflects, as applicable, the grant date fair value of the 2022 Chief RSUs and the RSUs awarded to Messrs.

Non-qualified stock options, SARs, restricted\nshares, RSUs, cash awards, performance awards or any combination of the foregoing may be granted under the 2019\nincentive plan (collectively, as used in this description of the 2019 incentive plan, awards). The maximum number of shares\nof our common stock with respect to which awards may be granted is 6,000,000 shares (plus an additional 3,678,357\nshares, which were assumed into the 2019 incentive plan from the GCI Liberty, Inc. 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as\namended) (the GCI Liberty 2018 incentive plan) after being converted into shares of common stock of Liberty Broadband\nin connection with the combination, which may be used for awards to participants who were not employees or other\nservice providers of Liberty Broadband or any of its subsidiaries immediately before the combination), subject to anti-\ndilution and other adjustment provisions of the 2019 incentive plan. No nonemployee director may be granted during any\ncalendar year awards having a value (as determined on the grant date of such award) in excess of $3 million. Shares of our\ncommon stock issuable pursuant to awards will be made available from either authorized but unissued shares or shares\nthat have been issued but reacquired by our company, including shares purchased on the open market. The 2019 incentive\nplan is administered by the compensation committee with regard to all awards granted under the 2019 incentive plan\n(other than awards granted to the nonemployee directors which may be administered by our full Board of Directors or the\ncompensation committee), and the compensation committee has full power and authority to determine the terms and\nconditions of such awards. The 2019 incentive plan is the only incentive plan under which awards will be made.\nIn December 2020, our company completed the combination with GCI Liberty. Prior to the combination, GCI Liberty had\ngranted to our named executive officers under the GCI Liberty 2018 incentive plan equity-based awards, including GCI\nLiberty’s allocable portion of Mr. Maffei’s annual equity-based awards and his Upfront Awards under the 2019 Maffei\nEmployment Agreement, and multi-year stock option awards and annual equity-based awards to the other named\nexecutive officers. Some of our named executive officers also held equity-based awards with respect to GCI Liberty’s\ncommon stock that were issued in connection with adjustments made to outstanding equity incentive awards with respect\nto shares of Qurate Retail’s Liberty Ventures common stock, which awards were issued pursuant to the GCI Liberty, Inc.\nTransitional Stock Adjustment Plan (the GCI Liberty transitional plan). All of the equity-based awards with respect to\nGCI Liberty’s common stock, including those held by our named executive officers, were assumed by our company and\nconverted into Liberty Broadband awards when the combination was complete. Subject to certain changes to reflect the\ncombination, these plans will continue to govern the terms and conditions of the assumed and converted awards, but will not\nbe used to make any additional grants following the combination.\nPAY RATIO INFORMATION\nWe are providing the following information about the relationship of the median annual total compensation of our employees\nand the total compensation of Mr. Maffei, our chief executive officer on December 31, 2022, pursuant to the SEC’s pay\nratio disclosure rules set forth in Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We believe our pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated\nin a manner consistent with the SEC’s pay ratio disclosure rules. However, because these rules provide flexibility in\ndetermining the methodology, assumptions and estimates used to determine pay ratios and the fact that workforce\ncomposition issues differ significantly between companies, our pay ratio may not be comparable to the pay ratios reported\nby other companies.\nTo identify our median employee, we first determined our employee population as of December 31, 2022, which consisted\nof employees located in the U.S. representing all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees employed by\nour company and our subsidiary, GCI Holdings, LLC, on that date. Using information from our payroll records and Form W-2s,\nwe then measured each employee’s gross wages for calendar year 2022, consisting of base salary, commissions, actual\nbonus payments, long-term incentive cash payments, if any, realized equity award value and taxable fringe benefits. We did\nnot annualize the compensation of employees who were new hires or took a leave of absence in 2022. Also, we did not\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nLIBERTY BROADBAND CORPORATION / 55"

      "text": "POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN\nCONTROL\nThe following table sets forth the potential payments to our named executive officers if their employment had terminated\nor a change in control had occurred, in each case, as of December 31, 2022, which was the last day of our last completed\nfiscal year. For purposes of the following table, we have assumed that Mr. Maffei’s employment had terminated at each of\nLiberty Media, Liberty Broadband and the other Service Companies. In the event of such a termination or change in control,\nthe actual amounts may be different due to various factors. In addition, we may enter into new arrangements or modify\nthese arrangements from time to time.\nThe amounts provided in the table are based on the closing market prices on December 30, 2022 (the last trading day in\n2022) for our LBRDK and LBRDB common stock, which were $76.27 and $73.75, respectively. Any option awards held by\nthe named executive officers that had an exercise price that was more than the closing market price of our Series C or\nSeries B common stock on December 30, 2022 have been excluded from the table below. For all other option awards, the\nvalue of the options shown in the table is based on the spread between the exercise price of the award and the applicable\nclosing market price. The value of the RSUs shown in the table is based on the applicable closing market price and the\nnumber of unvested RSUs that would have vested in the applicable termination scenario according to the terms of the\napplicable award.\nEach of our named executive officers has received awards and payments under our incentive plans. Additionally, Mr. Maffei\nis entitled to certain payments and acceleration rights upon termination under his employment agreement.\nThe circumstances giving rise to these potential payments and a brief summary of the provisions governing their payout\nare described below and in the footnotes to the table (other than those described under “—Executive Compensation\nArrangements—Gregory B. Maffei—Termination Payments and Benefits,” which are incorporated by reference herein):\nVOLUNTARY TERMINATION\nEach of the named executive officers holds equity awards that were issued under our existing incentive plans. Additionally,\nthe equity-based awards with respect to GCI Liberty common stock held by our named executive officers assumed by\nour company and converted into Liberty Broadband awards in connection with the combination were issued under the GCI\nLiberty 2018 incentive plan and the GCI Liberty transitional plan. Under these plans and the related award agreements,\nin the event of a voluntary termination of his or her employment with our company for any reason, each named executive\nofficer would typically only have a right to the equity grants that vested prior to his or her termination date. However, if\nMr. Maffei had voluntarily terminated his employment without good reason, his 2020 Maffei Term Options, his 2019\nMaffei Term Options and his Upfront Awards originally granted by GCI Liberty in December 2019 and December 2020,\nrespectively, which were assumed and converted into Upfront Awards with respect to Liberty Broadband common stock in\nconnection with the combination (the 2019 Maffei Legacy GLIB Term Options and 2020 Maffei Legacy GLIB Term\nOptions, respectively), would have vested on a pro rata basis (based on the number of days elapsed during the four-year\nvesting period). Mr. Maffei would have been entitled to certain other benefits upon a voluntary termination without good\nreason of his employment with our company as of December 31, 2022. The type and amount of severance pay and benefits\nMr. Maffei would receive would depend on whether he remained employed by Liberty Media at or following the date of\ntermination of his services to our company or whether his employment with Liberty Media was also voluntarily terminated.\nThese additional severance payments and benefits are described above in “—Executive Compensation Arrangements—\nGregory B. Maffei—Termination Payments and Benefits—Voluntary Termination at our Company without Good Reason”\nabove. Messrs. Wendling and Rosenthaler and Ms. Wilm are not entitled to any severance payments or other benefits upon\na voluntary termination of his or her employment.\nTERMINATION FOR CAUSE\nAll outstanding equity grants constituting options, whether unvested or vested but not yet exercised, and all equity grants\nconstituting unvested RSUs under the existing incentive plans would be forfeited by any named executive officer who is\nterminated for “cause” (other than Mr. Maffei in the case of equity grants constituting vested options or similar rights).\nUnless there is a different definition in the applicable award agreement, each of the transitional plan, the 2014 incentive\nplan, the 2019 incentive plan, the GCI Liberty 2018 incentive plan and the GCI Liberty transitional plan define “cause” as\ninsubordination, dishonesty, incompetence, moral turpitude, other misconduct of any kind and the refusal to perform duties\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n60 / 2023 PROXY STATEMENT"

The type and\namount of severance pay and benefits Mr. Maffei would receive would depend on whether he remained employed by Liberty\nMedia at or following the date of termination of his services to our company or whether his employment with Liberty\nMedia was also terminated without cause or for good reason. These additional severance payments and benefits are\ndescribed above in “—Executive Compensation Arrangements—Gregory B.

Ms. Wilm’s only unvested equity awards were her 2022 Chief RSUs, the final vesting tranche of her\n2020 NEO Multiyear Options, 2020 NEO Legacy GLIB Multiyear Options, the final vesting tranche of the stock options\ngranted to Ms. Wilm in 2019 and the final vesting tranche of the stock options originally granted by GCI Liberty to Ms. Wilm\nin 2019 (the 2019 Wilm Legacy GLIB Options).

Such figure includes 3,678,357 shares, which were assumed into the 2019 incentive plan from the GCI Liberty\n2018 incentive plan after being converted into shares of common stock of Liberty Broadband in connection with the combination.\nThose assumed shares may be used for awards to participants who were not employees or other service providers of Liberty\nBroadband or any of its subsidiaries immediately before the combination. The amounts reported for the 2019 incentive plan\nreflect 1,259,509 shares of LBRDK to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options and 233,418 shares of LBRDK to be issued\nupon the settlement of restricted stock units. For restricted stock units subject to performance-based vesting requirements, such\namounts assume the awards vest at 100 percent of target performance. The weighted average exercise price does not take into\naccount restricted stock units, which by their nature do not have an exercise price.\n(3)\nOn December 18, 2020, in connection with the combination, we assumed each outstanding award issued pursuant to the GCI\nLiberty 2018 incentive plan, the GCI Liberty transitional plan and the Amended and Restated 1986 Stock Option Plan of General\nCommunications, Inc. (together with the GCI Liberty 2018 incentive plan and the GCI Liberty transitional plan, the GCI Liberty Plans\nand such awards collectively, the Legacy GCI Liberty Awards). The Legacy GCI Liberty Awards were assumed and converted into\nLiberty Broadband awards. We do not intend to issue any new grants under the Legacy GCI Liberty Plans in the future. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, under the GCI Liberty 2018 incentive plan, the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding\noptions, warrants and rights was 598,539 LBRDK shares, which have a weighted average exercise price of $137.82 and 12,445\nLBRDB shares, which have a weighted average exercise price of $100.19, and the number of securities to be issued upon the\nsettlement of restricted stock units was 69,454 LBRDK shares. With respect to the GCI Liberty transitional plan, the number of\nsecurities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights was 159,916 LBRDK shares, which have a weighted\naverage exercise price of $88.82 and 302,360 LBRDB shares, which have a weighted average exercise price of $96.09.\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n70 / 2023 PROXY STATEMENT"

No related party transaction may be effected by our company\nwithout the approval of the audit committee of our Board or another independent body of our Board designated to address\nsuch actual or potential conflicts.\nEXCHANGE AGREEMENT WITH JOHN C. MALONE\nOn June 13, 2022, we entered into an Exchange Agreement (as defined below) with our Chairman of the Board, John C.\nMalone, whereby, among other things, Mr. Malone agreed to an arrangement under which his aggregate voting power in our\ncompany would not exceed 49% (the Target Voting Power) plus 0.5% (under certain circumstances). We have an\nongoing stock repurchase program which permits us to purchase shares of our common stock. In light of Mr. Malone’s\ncurrent ownership interests in our company, absent the Exchange Agreement, continued repurchases of LBRDA, pursuant\nto this program would be expected to have the effect of increasing Mr. Malone’s aggregate voting power in our company\nto greater than 50%. We and our Board believe it is in the best interests of our company and its stockholders to not have a\nsingle stockholder control greater than 50% of our aggregate voting power and to maintain flexibility with respect to\nfuture share repurchases and other transactions that may have an accretive voting power effect.\nA special committee of independent and disinterested directors was formed by our Board to consider a potential exchange\narrangement between us and Mr. Malone and engaged independent legal counsel to assist it. The special committee\nrecommended to our Board of Directors the approval of an exchange agreement, among us, Mr. Malone and a revocable\ntrust of which Mr. Malone is the sole trustee and beneficiary (the JM Trust) (the Exchange Agreement). Our Board of\nDirectors, upon the unanimous recommendation of the members of the special committee, approved the Exchange\nAgreement.\nThe Exchange Agreement provides for exchanges by our company and Mr. Malone or the JM Trust of shares of LBRDB\nfor shares of LBRDK in connection with certain events, as described below.\nAccretive Event Exchange. In connection with any event that would result in a reduction in the outstanding votes that\nmay be cast by holders of our voting stock or an increase of Mr. Malone’s beneficially-owned voting power in our company\n(an Accretive Event), in each case, such that Mr. Malone’s voting power would exceed the Target Voting Power plus\n0.5%, Mr. Malone or the JM Trust will be required to exchange with our company shares of LBRDB (Exchanged LBRDB\nShares) for an equal number of shares of LBRDK (Exchanged LBRDK Shares) so as to maintain Mr. Malone’s voting\npower as close as possible to, without exceeding, the Target Voting Power, on the terms and subject to the conditions of\nthe Exchange Agreement. For example, repurchases by us of shares of our capital stock, conversions of LBRDB into\nLBRDA, as well as purchases by Mr. Malone of our capital stock, in each case, having the effect on Mr. Malone’s voting power\ndescribed above would be Accretive Events.\nDilutive Event Exchange. From and after the occurrence of any Accretive Event, in connection with any event that would\nresult in an increase in the outstanding votes that may be cast by holders of our voting stock or a decrease of Mr. Malone’s\nbeneficially-owned voting power in our company (a Dilutive Event), in each case, such that Mr. Malone’s voting power falls\nbelow the Target Voting Power less 0.5%, Mr. Malone and the JM Trust may exchange with our company shares of\nLBRDK for an equal number of shares of LBRDB equal to the lesser of (i) the number of shares of LBRDB which would\nmaintain Mr. Malone’s voting power as close as possible to, without exceeding, the Target Voting Power and (ii) the number\nof Exchanged LBRDB Shares at such time, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Exchange Agreement. For\nexample, exercises of stock options for, conversions of convertible securities into or issuances of new shares of our voting\nstock having the effect on Mr. Malone’s voting power described above would be Dilutive Events.\nFundamental Event Exchange.

(“Charter”). \nDuring May 2014, the board of directors of Liberty Media Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Liberty”) authorized \nmanagement to pursue a plan to spin-off to its stockholders common stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary, Liberty Broadband, \nand to distribute subscription rights to acquire shares of Liberty Broadband’s common stock (the “Broadband Spin-Off”).  \nOn December 18, 2020, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 6, 2020, entered into by GCI \nLiberty, Inc. (“GCI Liberty”), Liberty Broadband, Grizzly Merger Sub 1, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Broadband \n(“Merger LLC”), and Grizzly Merger Sub 2, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger LLC (“Merger Sub”), Merger Sub merged \nwith and into GCI Liberty (the “First Merger”), with GCI Liberty surviving the First Merger as an indirect wholly owned \nsubsidiary of Liberty Broadband (the “Surviving Corporation”), and immediately following the First Merger, GCI Liberty (as the \nSurviving Corporation in the First Merger) merged with and into Merger LLC (the “Upstream Merger”, and together with the \nFirst Merger, the “Combination”), with Merger LLC surviving the Upstream Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty \nBroadband. \nAs a result of the Combination, each holder of a share of Series A common stock and Series B common stock of GCI \nLiberty received 0.58 of a share of Series C common stock and Series B common stock, respectively, of Liberty Broadband. \nAdditionally, each holder of a share of Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock of GCI Liberty received one share of \nnewly issued Liberty Broadband Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, which has substantially identical terms to \nGCI Liberty’s former Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, including a mandatory redemption date of March 9, \n2039.

(“Charter”). Liberty Broadband controls 25.01% of the aggregate voting power of Charter. \nSkyhook Holdings, Inc. (“Skyhook”) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Broadband until its sale on May 2, 2022 \nfor aggregate consideration of approximately $194 million, including amounts held in escrow of approximately $23 million. \nLiberty Broadband recognized a gain on the sale of $179 million, net of closing fees, in the second quarter of 2022, which is \nrecorded in Gain (loss) on dispositions, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Skyhook is included in \nCorporate and other through April 30, 2022 and is not presented as a discontinued operation as the sale did not represent a strategic \nshift that had a major effect on Liberty Broadband’s operations and financial results. Included in Revenue in the accompanying \nconsolidated statements of operations is $6 million, $18 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 \nand 2020, respectively, related to Skyhook. Included in Net earnings (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statement of \noperations are earnings of $4 million and less than $1 million and losses of $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, \n2021 and 2020, respectively, related to Skyhook. Included in Total assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of \nDecember 31, 2021 is $18 million related to Skyhook. \nStrategies and Challenges \nExecutive Summary \nGCI Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, provides a full range of data, wireless, video, voice, and \nmanaged services to residential customers, businesses, governmental entities, and educational and medical institutions primarily \nin Alaska under the GCI brand.  \nCharter is a leading broadband connectivity company and cable operator serving more than 32 million customers in 41 \nstates through its Spectrum brand. Over an advanced high-capacity, two-way telecommunications network, Charter offers a full \nrange of state-of-the-art residential and business services including Spectrum Internet, TV, Mobile and Voice. For small and \nmedium-sized companies, Spectrum Business delivers the same suite of broadband products and services coupled with special \nfeatures and applications to enhance productivity, while for larger businesses and government entities, Spectrum Enterprise \nprovides highly customized, fiber-based solutions. Spectrum Reach delivers tailored advertising and production for the modern \nmedia landscape. Charter also distributes award-winning news coverage and sports programming to its customers through \nSpectrum Networks. At December 31, 2022, Liberty Broadband owned approximately 47.2 million shares of Charter Class A \ncommon stock, representing an approximate 30.9% economic ownership interest in Charter’s issued and outstanding shares.  \nKey Drivers of Revenue \nGCI Holdings earns revenue from the monthly fees customers pay for data, wireless, video, voice and managed services. \nThrough close coordination of its customer service and sales and marketing efforts, its customer service representatives suggest \nto its customers other services they can purchase or enhanced versions of services they already purchase to achieve increased \nrevenue and penetration of its multiple service offerings.  \nCharter’s revenue is principally derived from the monthly fees customers pay for services it provides. Charter also earns \nrevenue from one-time installation fees and advertising sales. Charter’s marketing organization creates and executes marketing \nprograms intended to grow customer relationships, increase the number of services they sell per relationship, retain existing \ncustomers and cross-sell additional products to current customers. \nCurrent Trends Affecting Our Business \nGCI Holdings and Charter must stay abreast of rapidly evolving technological developments and offerings to remain \ncompetitive and increase the utility of their products and services. These companies must be able to incorporate new technologies \ninto their products and services in order to address the needs of their customers."

      "text": "F-4 \nGCI Holdings \nGCI Holdings offers wireless and wireline telecommunication services, data services, video services, and managed \nservices to customers primarily throughout Alaska. Because of this geographic concentration, growth of GCI Holdings’ business \nand operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global \neconomy, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The Russian \ninvasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has led to further economic disruptions. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased interest rates \nstarting in March 2022 and additional increases are expected to continue. Mounting inflationary cost pressures and recessionary \nfears have negatively impacted the U.S. and global economy. Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic \nslowdown in the U.S., or inflation in the markets in which GCI operates, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand \nfor GCI’s products and services and its cost of doing business.  \nThe Alaska economy is dependent upon the oil industry, state and federal spending, investment earnings and tourism. A \ndecline in oil prices would put significant pressure on the Alaska state government budget. The Alaska state government has \nsignificant reserves that GCI Holdings believes will help fund the state government for the next couple of years. The Alaska \neconomy is subject to recessionary pressures as a result of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, volatility in oil \nprices, inflation, and other causes that could result in a decrease in economic activity. While it is difficult for GCI Holdings to \npredict the future impact of a recession on its business, these conditions have had an adverse impact on its business and could \nadversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of its products and services and cause customers to shift to lower priced \nproducts and services or to delay or forgo purchases of its products and services. GCI Holdings’ customers may not be able to \nobtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to GCI Holdings. In addition, adverse \neconomic conditions may lead to an increased number of customers that are unable to pay for services. There is a risk that GCI \nHoldings’ accounts receivable and bad debt expense could increase substantially in a recessionary environment. If a recession \noccurs, it could negatively affect GCI Holdings’ business including its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as \nwell as its ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns. \nIn addition, during 2022, GCI Holdings began to experience the impact of inflation-sensitive items, including upward \npressure on the costs of materials, labor, and other items that are critical to GCI Holding’s business. GCI Holdings continues to \nmonitor these impacts closely and, if costs continue to rise, may be unable to recoup losses or offset diminished margins by \npassing these costs through to its customers or implementing offsetting cost reductions. \nRural Health Care (“RHC”) Program \nGCI Holdings receives support from various Universal Service Fund (\"USF\") programs including the RHC Program. \nThe USF programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\"), \ninterpretations of or compliance with USF program rules, or legislative actions. Changes to any of the USF programs that GCI \nHoldings participates in could result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts receivable, which could have an adverse \neffect on GCI Holdings' business and the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The following \nparagraphs describe certain separate matters related to the RHC Program that impact or could impact the revenue earned and \nreceivables recognized by the Company. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had net accounts receivable from the RHC \nProgram in the amount of approximately $80 million, which is included within Trade and other receivables in the consolidated \nbalance sheets. \nFCC Rate Reduction. In November 2017, the Universal Service Administrative Company (\"USAC\") requested further \ninformation in support of the rural rates charged to a number of GCI Holdings' RHC customers in connection with the funding \nrequests for the year that runs July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018. On October 10, 2018, GCI Holdings received a letter from the \nFCC's Wireline Competition Bureau (“Bureau”) notifying it of the Bureau’s decision to reduce the rural rates charged to RHC \ncustomers for the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018 by approximately 26% resulting in a reduction of total support \npayments of $28 million. The FCC also informed GCI Holdings that the same cost methodology used for the funding year that \nended on June 30, 2018 would be applied to rates charged to RHC customers in subsequent funding years. In response to the \nBureau’s letter, GCI Holdings filed an Application for Review with the FCC.  \nOn October 20, 2020, the Bureau issued two separate letters approving the cost-based rural rates GCI Holdings \nhistorically applied when recognizing revenue for services provided to its RHC customers for the funding years that ended on \nJune 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020. GCI Holdings collected approximately $175 million in accounts receivable relating to these \ntwo funding years during the year ended December 31, 2021. GCI Holdings also filed an Application for Review of these"

Subsequently, GCI identified rates for similar services provided by a competitor that would justify higher rates \nfor certain GCI satellite services in the funding years that ended on June 30, 2018, June 30, 2019, and June 30, 2020. GCI \nsubmitted that information to the Bureau on September 7, 2021. The Applications for Review remain pending. \nOn June 25, 2020, GCI Holdings submitted cost studies with respect to a number of its rates for services provided to its \nRHC customers for the funding year ended June 30, 2021, which require approval by the Bureau. GCI Holdings further updated \nthose studies on November 12, 2020, to reflect the completion of the bidding season for that funding year. On May 24, 2021, the \nFCC approved the cost studies submitted by GCI Holdings for the funding year ended June 30, 2021. Subsequently, on August 16, \n2021, GCI submitted a request for approval of rates for 17 additional sites, 13 of which the FCC approved on December 22, 2022. \nThe rest remain pending. \nRHC Program Funding Cap. The RHC program has a funding cap for each individual funding year that is annually \nadjusted for inflation, and which the FCC can increase by carrying forward unused funds from prior funding years. In recent \nyears, including the current year, this funding cap has not limited the amount of funding received by participants; however, \nmanagement continues to monitor the funding cap and its potential impact on funding in future years. \nEnforcement Bureau and Related Inquiries. On March 23, 2018, GCI Holdings received a letter of inquiry and request \nfor information from the Enforcement Bureau of the FCC relating to the period beginning January 1, 2015 and including all future \nperiods. This includes inquiry into the rates charged by GCI Holdings and other aspects related to the Enforcement Bureau’s \nreview of GCI Holdings’ compliance with program rules, which are discussed separately below. The ongoing uncertainty in \nprogram funding, as well as the uncertainty associated with the rate review, could have an adverse effect on its business, financial \nposition, results of operations or liquidity. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, GCI Holdings became aware of potential RHC Program compliance issues related to \ncertain of GCI Holdings’ currently active and expired contracts with certain of its RHC customers. The Company and its external \nexperts performed significant and extensive procedures to determine whether GCI Holdings’ currently active and expired \ncontracts with its RHC customers would be deemed to be in compliance with the RHC Program rules. GCI Holdings notified the \nFCC of the potential compliance issues in the fourth quarter of 2019. \nOn May 28, 2020, GCI Holdings received a second letter of inquiry from the Enforcement Bureau in the same matter \nnoted above. This second letter, which was in response to a voluntary disclosure made by GCI Holdings to the FCC, extended \nthe scope of the original inquiry to also include various questions regarding compliance with the records retention requirements \nrelated to the (i) original inquiry and (ii) RHC Program. \nOn December 17, 2020, GCI Holdings received a Subpoena Duces Tecum from the FCC’s Office of the Inspector \nGeneral requiring production of documents from January 1, 2009 to the present related to a single RHC customer and related \ncontracts, information regarding GCI Holdings’ determination of rural rates for a single customer, and to provide information \nregarding persons with knowledge of pricing practices generally. \nOn April 21, 2021, representatives of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) informed GCI Holdings that a qui tam action \nhas been filed in the Western District of Washington arising from the subject matter under review by the Enforcement Bureau. \nThe DOJ is investigating whether GCI Holdings submitted false claims and/or statements in connection with GCI’s participation \nin the FCC’s RHC Program. On July 14, 2021, the DOJ issued a Civil Investigative Demand with regard to the qui tam action. \nThe FCC’s Enforcement Bureau and GCI Holdings held discussions regarding GCI Holdings potential RHC Program \ncompliance issues related to certain of its contracts with its RHC customers for which GCI Holdings had previously recognized \nan estimated liability for a probable loss of approximately $12 million in 2019 for contracts that were deemed probable of not \ncomplying with the RHC Program rules. During the year ended December 31, 2022, GCI Holdings recorded an additional \nestimated settlement expense of $15 million relating to a settlement offer made by GCI Holdings resulting in a total estimated \nliability of $27 million. GCI Holdings also identified certain contracts where additional loss was reasonably possible and such \nloss could range from zero to $30 million, which is a reduction of the reasonably possible loss range as previously disclosed in \nour December 31, 2021 Form 10-K given the settlement offer made during 2022. An accrual was not made for the amount of the \nreasonably possible loss in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. GCI Holdings could also be assessed fines and \npenalties but such amounts could not be reasonably estimated."

      "text": "F-6 \nThe DOJ and GCI Holdings held discussions regarding the qui tam action whereby the DOJ clarified that its investigation \nrelates to the years from 2010 through 2019 and alleged that GCI Holdings had submitted false claims under the RHC Program \nduring this time period. GCI Holdings continues to work with the DOJ related to this matter and has recorded a $14 million \nestimated settlement expense during the year ended December 31, 2022 to reflect discussions and settlement offers that GCI \nHoldings made to the DOJ during 2022. However, the Company is unable to assess the ultimate outcome of this action and is \nunable to reasonably estimate any range of additional possible loss beyond the $14 million estimated settlement liability, including \nany type of fine or penalty that may ultimately be assessed as permitted under the applicable law. \nSeparately, during the third quarter of 2022, GCI Holdings became aware of possible RHC Program compliance issues \nrelating to potential conflicts of interest identified in the historical competitive bidding process with respect to certain of its \ncontracts with its RHC customers. GCI Holdings notified the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau of the potential compliance issues; \nhowever, the Company is unable to assess the ultimate outcome of the potential compliance issues and is unable to reasonably \nestimate any range of loss or possible loss. \nRevision of Support Calculations. On August 20, 2019, the FCC released an order changing the manner in which support \nissued under the RHC Program will be calculated and approved. Some of these changes will become effective beginning with the \nfunding year ended June 30, 2021, while others will apply beginning with the funding year ending June 30, 2022. On October 21, \n2019, GCI Holdings appealed the order to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On December 6, \n2019, that appeal was held in abeyance for nine months due to pending Petitions for Reconsideration filed by other parties at the \nFCC. The period of abeyance was subsequently extended several times, and is currently in place through March 8, 2023. At the \ndirection of the FCC, USAC has released a database that purports to determine a median rate which will cap the amount of support \navailable for each service sold under the program, starting in the funding year ending June 30, 2022. GCI Holdings has sought \nFCC review of various aspects of the database implementation. On September 30, 2020, USAC released a refreshed version of \nthe database incorporating limited changes submitted by interested parties. On January 19, 2021, the Bureau issued an Order that \nwaives the requirement to use the database for health care providers in Alaska for the two funding years ending June 30, 2022 \nand June 30, 2023. The Order requires GCI Holdings to determine its rural rates based on previously approved rates or under \nreinstitution of the rules currently in effect through the funding year ended on June 30, 2021. On April 8, 2021, the Bureau issued \nan Order further extending the January 19, 2021 waiver to carriers nationwide and eliminating the ability or requirement to use \nthe database to establish the healthcare provider payments for services subsidized by the RHC Telecom Program. On April 12, \n2022 and May 25, 2022, the Bureau issued Orders further extending the January 19, 2021 and April 8, 2021 waivers regarding \nuse of the database by health care providers seeking support under the RHC Program through the funding year ending June 30, \n2024. On January 26, 2023, the Commission adopted an Order on Reconsideration, Report and Order, and Second Further Notice \nof Proposed Rulemaking, which grants the petitions challenging the rates database, returns the RHC Telecom Program to the rate \ndetermination rules in place prior to the adoption of the rates database, permits providers to determine rural rates based on \npreviously approved rates through the funding years ending June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2026, and seeks comment on future \nrevisions to the rate determination rules. \nCharter \nCharter faces intense competition for residential customers, both from existing competitors and, as a result of the rapid \ndevelopment of new technologies, services and products, from new entrants. With respect to its residential business, Charter \ncompetes with other providers of video, Internet access, telephone and mobile services, and other sources of home entertainment. \nCharter’s principal competitors for video services are DBS service providers, as well as virtual multichannel video programming \ndistributors such as Hulu Live, YouTube TV, Sling TV, Philo and DirecTV Stream. Charter’s principal competitors for Internet \nservices are the broadband services provided by companies, including fiber-to-the-home, fixed wireless broadband, Internet \ndelivered via satellite and DSL services. A growing number of commercial areas, such as retail malls, restaurants and airports, \noffer WiFi Internet service. Numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized WiFi \nInternet access networks. These options offer alternatives to cable-based Internet access. Charter’s principal competitors for voice \nand mobile services are other mobile and wireline phone providers, as well as other forms of communication, such as text \nmessaging on cellular phones, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email. The increase in the \nnumber of different technologies capable of carrying voice services and the number of alternative communication options \navailable to customers as well as the replacement of wireline services by wireless have intensified the competitive environment \nin which Charter operates its residential voice service.  \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, Charter added 1,728,000 mobile lines, 344,000 Internet customers and \n126,000 residential and Small and Medium Business customer relationships, which excludes mobile-only customers.

With the sale of Skyhook in May 2022, Corporate and other revenue was minimal \nduring the first half of 2022 and will be zero in future periods as all Corporate and other revenue was generated by Skyhook. \nRevenue for Corporate and other increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the corresponding \nprior year period, due to increased revenue at Skyhook from both existing and new customers. \nOperating Income (Loss) \nConsolidated operating loss decreased $59 million and increased $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 \nand 2021, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Operating loss for Corporate and other for the years \nended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included net litigation settlements of $38 million and $95 million, respectively. Operating \nloss for Corporate and other decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding prior year period, \nprimarily due to decreased litigation settlements, as well as decreased professional service fees. Operating loss for Corporate and \nother for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the corresponding prior year period, increased due to increased \nlitigation settlements, as well as an increase in professional service fees and corporate compensation expenses, partially offset by \nthe absence of transaction costs in 2021.  \nOperating income decreased at GCI Holdings for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding \nprior year period, and increased for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the corresponding prior year period. See \n“Results of Operations – GCI Holdings, LLC” below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of GCI Holdings. \nStock-based compensation  \nStock-based compensation expense decreased $4 million and increased $32 million for the years ended December 31, \n2022 and 2021, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The decrease in stock-based compensation \nexpense during 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in Liberty Broadband’s allocation rate per the services agreement \narrangement as described in note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The increase in stock-based \ncompensation expense during 2021 was primarily due to upfront grants per our CEO’s employment agreement, along with the \nimpact of the Combination."

      "text": "F-9 \nAdjusted OIBDA \nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted OIBDA, \nwhich is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and \namortization, stock-based compensation, transaction costs, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, and \nimpairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction \nwith other measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe \nthis is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses by identifying those items that are \nnot directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows \nus to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to \nimprove performance. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating \nincome, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in \naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Operating costs increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the \ncorresponding prior year, primarily due to increased mobile and programming costs, as well as increased regulatory, connectivity \nand produced content costs. Operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 also increased due to increased litigation \nsettlements, including the settlement with Sprint Communications Company L.P. and T-Mobile USA, Inc. for $220 million.  \nMobile costs were comprised of mobile device, mobile service, customer acquisition and operating costs. The increase \nin both years is attributable to an increase in the number of mobile lines. \nCosts to service customers increased during 2022 compared to the corresponding period in 2021 primarily due to higher \nbad debt, adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer tenured workforce and fuel costs."

Regulatory, \nconnectivity and produced content increased during 2021 primarily due to higher sports rights costs as a result of more NBA and \nMajor League Baseball games during 2021 as compared to the corresponding period in 2020. \nProgramming costs decreased during 2022 compared to the corresponding period in 2021 as a result of fewer customers \nand a higher mix of lower cost video packages within Charter’s video customer base, offset by contractual rate adjustments, \nincluding renewals and increases in amounts paid for retransmission consent. Programming costs increased during 2021 \ncompared to the corresponding period in 2020 as a result of $124 million more rebates in 2020 than 2021 from sports \nprogramming networks as a result of canceled sporting events due to COVID-19, as well as contractual rate adjustments, including \nrenewals and increases in amounts paid for retransmission consent offset by fewer customers and a higher mix of lower cost \nvideo packages within Charter’s video customer base.  \nCharter’s Adjusted OIBDA in 2022 and 2021 increased for the reasons described above. \nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $442 million and $359 million during the years ended December 31, \n2022 and 2021, respectively. The decreases in both years were primarily due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization as \ncertain assets acquired in acquisitions become fully depreciated, offset by an increase in depreciation as a result of more recent \ncapital expenditures. \nCharter’s results were also impacted by other expenses, net which increased $362 million and $35 million in the years \nended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, compared to the corresponding prior year periods.

Income tax expense increased during the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily as a result of an increase in pretax \nincome, lower benefit from state tax rate changes and decreased recognition of excess tax benefits resulting from share-based \ncompensation during 2021. Income tax expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the \ncorresponding period in the prior year, primarily as a result of higher pretax income.  \nGain (loss) on dilution of investment in equity affiliate  \nThe loss on dilution of investment in affiliate decreased by $39 million and $82 million during the years ended \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year.

Listed below are the accounting estimates and accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial \nstatements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, \nliability, revenue or expense being reported. All of these accounting estimates and assumptions, as well as the resulting impact \nto our financial statements, have been discussed with our audit committee. \nApplication of the Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Affiliates. For those investments in affiliates in \nwhich the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, the equity method of accounting is used. Under this method, \nthe investment, originally recorded at cost, is adjusted to recognize the Company’s share of net earnings or losses of the affiliate \nas they occur rather than as dividends or other distributions are received. Losses are limited to the extent of the Company’s \ninvestment in, advances to and commitments for the equity method investee. The Company determines the difference between \nthe purchase price of the equity method investee and the underlying equity which results in an excess basis in the investment. \nThis excess basis is allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities of the Company’s equity method investee through an \nacquisition accounting exercise and is allocated within memo accounts used for equity method accounting purposes. Depending \non the applicable underlying assets, these amounts are either amortized over the applicable useful lives or determined to be \nindefinite lived. \nChanges in the Company’s proportionate share of the underlying equity of an equity method investee, which result from \nthe issuance of additional equity securities by such equity method investee, to investors other than the Company, are recognized \nin the statement of operations through the gain (loss) on dilution of investment in affiliate line item. We periodically evaluate our \nequity method investment to determine if decreases in fair value below our cost basis are other than temporary. If a decline in \nfair value is determined to be other than temporary, we are required to reflect such decline in our consolidated statements of \noperations. Other than temporary declines in fair value of our equity method investment would be included in share of earnings \n(losses) of affiliates in our consolidated statement of operations. \nThe primary factors we consider in our determination of whether declines in fair value are other than temporary are the \nlength of time that the fair value of the investment is below our carrying value; the severity of the decline; and the financial \ncondition, operating performance and near term prospects of the equity method investee. In addition, we consider the reason for \nthe decline in fair value, be it general market conditions, industry specific or equity method investee specific; analysts' ratings \nand estimates of 12 month share price targets for the equity method investee; changes in stock price or valuation subsequent to \nthe balance sheet date; and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in \nfair value.  \nOur evaluation of the fair value of our investments and any resulting impairment charges are made as of the most recent \nbalance sheet date. Changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date due to the factors described above are possible. \nSubsequent decreases in fair value will be recognized in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which they \noccur to the extent such decreases are deemed to be other than temporary. Subsequent increases in fair value will be recognized \nin our consolidated statement of operations only upon our ultimate disposition of the investment. \nFair Value of Non-Financial Instruments. The Company’s non-financial instrument valuations are primarily \ncomprised of its determination of the estimated fair value allocation of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in \nbusiness combinations, the Company’s annual assessment of the recoverability of its goodwill and other nonamortizable \nintangibles, and the Company’s evaluation of the recoverability of its other long-lived assets upon certain triggering events."

      "text": "F-16 \nThe Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived \nassets to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or \nasset groups might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse \nchange in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that \ncould affect the value of the asset group, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset group, among others. \nIf such facts indicate a potential impairment, the recoverability of the asset group is assessed by determining whether the carrying \nvalue of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual \ndisposition of the asset group over the remaining economic life of the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset group is \ngreater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by such asset group, including its ultimate disposition, an \nimpairment adjustment is recognized. \nIf the carrying value of the Company’s amortizing intangible or long-lived assets exceeds their estimated fair value, the \nCompany is required to write the carrying value down to fair value. Any such write down is included in impairment expense in \nthe Company’s consolidated statements of operations. A high degree of judgment is required to estimate the fair value of the \nCompany’s amortizing intangible and long-lived assets. The Company may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets, \npresent value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates. The Company may need to make estimates \nof future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques. Due to the \nhigh degree of judgment involved in our estimation techniques, any value ultimately derived from the Company’s amortizing \nintangible or long-lived assets may differ from its estimate of fair value. \nThe Company utilizes the cost approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for its property and equipment \nin connection with business combinations. The cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing \nor purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and \ntechnological obsolescence as of the appraisal date. The cost approach relies on management’s assumptions regarding current \nmaterial and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of the Company’s property and equipment \nalong with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of its property and equipment. \nThe accounting guidance permits entities to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely \nthan not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If the qualitative assessment supports that it is more likely than not \nthat the carrying value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, exceeds its fair value, then a \nquantitative assessment is performed. \nThe Company utilizes an income approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for its customer \nrelationships and cable certificates in connection with business combinations and annual impairment testing when deemed \nnecessary. The income approach quantifies the expected earnings of the Company’s customer relationships and cable certificates, \nby isolating the after tax cash flows attributable to the respective asset and then discounting the cash flows to their present value. \nThe income approach relies on management’s assumptions such as projected revenue, market penetration, expenses, capital \nexpenditures, customer trends, and a discount rate applied to the estimated after tax cash flows. \nThe Company performs an annual assessment of the recoverability of its goodwill during the fourth quarter, or more \nfrequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, the \nCompany reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant \naccounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of its reporting \nunits. The Company considers whether there are any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market \nchanges, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges, legal environments and how these \nfactors might impact company specific performance in future periods. As part of the analysis, the Company also considers fair \nvalue determinations for certain reporting units that have been made at various points throughout the current and prior year for \nother purposes. If based on the qualitative analysis it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the Company performs \nthe quantitative impairment test. \nThe quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. \nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit has historically been determined using an income approach, when deemed necessary. \nThe Company’s income approach model used for its reporting unit valuation is consistent with that used for the cable certificates \nexcept that cash flows from the entire business enterprise are used."

We are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred \nincome tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or \ntax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires our management to make judgments regarding \nthe timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of the various agreements and transactions that we enter into. Based on these \njudgments we may record tax reserves or adjustments to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected \nrealizability of future tax benefits. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, \nsignificant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or \nunpredicted results from the final determination of each year's liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a \nsignificant impact on our financial position. \nResults of Operations—GCI Holdings, LLC \nAs described in notes 1 and 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, Liberty Broadband acquired GCI \nHoldings in the Combination on December 18, 2020. As GCI Holdings’ results are only included in the Company’s 2020 results \nfor 13 days following the Combination, we believe a discussion of GCI Holdings’ results for a comparative three year period \npromotes a better understanding of GCI Holdings’ operations.

The increases in both years were driven by increases in the \nnumber of subscribers and the subscribers' selection of plans with higher recurring monthly charges that offer higher speeds and \nhigher usage limits. \nConsumer wireless revenue increased $9 million and $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increases in both years were primarily due to increased \nplan service fee revenue driven by an increase in the number of subscribers and subscribers’ selection of plans with higher \nrecurring monthly charges that offer higher usage limits. Additionally, equipment and accessories sales revenue increased, which \nwas driven by an increase in the number of handsets sold. \nConsumer other revenue decreased $31 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Consumer other revenue consists of consumer video and voice \nrevenue. The decreases in both years were due to a decrease in video revenue primarily driven by decreased video subscribers. \nThis was the result of both the transition from traditional linear video delivery to IP delivery and GCI Holdings’ decision to \ndiscontinue selling bulk video packages for multi-dwelling units. Additionally, when 2021 is compared to the corresponding prior \nyear period, there was a decrease in advertising revenue driven by a reduction in advertising sales due to the absence of a major \npolitical election in 2021 compared to 2020. Historically, GCI Holdings has seen declines in video and voice subscribers and \nrevenue and expects a continued decrease as customers potentially choose alternative services. \nBusiness data revenue increased $27 million and $29 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods.

The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to decreases in \nroaming revenue. The decrease in roaming revenue was driven by a contract amendment signed in the fourth quarter of 2021. \nAlthough the contract amendment will result in lower annual roaming revenue, GCI Holdings will benefit from the extension of \nthe agreement for several years as well as continued backhaul revenue. The decrease in 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in \ngrant and roaming revenue.  \nBusiness other revenue decreased $2 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Business other revenue consists of business video and voice \nrevenue. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to decreased business video and long distance revenue. The decrease in 2021 \nwas primarily due to the sale of the Company’s broadcast television station in the third quarter of 2020, as well as a reduction in \nconference calling, long distance minutes and local service lines for voice services. Historically, GCI Holdings has seen declines \nin video and voice subscribers and revenue and has not focused business efforts on growth in these areas.  \nOperating expenses decreased $22 million and increased $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in video \ncosts, primarily due to a decrease in costs paid to content producers driven by reduced video subscribers, partially offset by an \nincrease in costs to operate GCI Holdings’ network driven by the increase in demand for data services. \nThe increase in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in costs to operate our network driven by the increase in demand \nfrom school and health care customers, as well as an increase in wireless handset costs. These increases were partially offset by \na decrease in professional services costs driven by a reduction in time and materials project work and a decrease in video costs \ndriven by the sale of the Company’s broadcast television station in the third quarter of 2020, as well as a decrease in costs paid \nto content producers driven by a decrease in video subscribers. \nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $17 million and $11 million for the years ended December 31, \n2022 and 2021, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to increases in labor \nrelated costs driven by an increase in contract labor costs. \nThe increase in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in labor related costs driven by increases in healthcare costs as \nemployees returned to normal healthcare interactions and increases in contract labor. The increase is partially offset by decreased \nlegal and compliance costs and decreased lease and facility costs. \nStock based compensation decreased $3 million and increased $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and \n2021, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The decrease in 2022 was due to awards granted in prior \nyears that became fully vested in 2021. The increase in 2021 was due to the fair value assigned to converted awards as part of the \nmodification as a result of the Combination. Additionally, stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, \n2020 included the reversal of expense for performance-based awards that did not vest. \nLitigation settlement increased $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the corresponding \nprior year period. This was due to an increase in the estimated liability of $29 million relating to compliance with RHC program \nrules which reflects settlement offers that GCI Holdings made to the DOJ and the Enforcement Bureau of the FCC in 2022. \nDepreciation and amortization decreased $4 million and increased $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 \nand 2021, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods.

The risk of loss can be assessed \nfrom the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies, procedures \nand internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure \nto such risks.  \nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investment activities, which could \ninclude investments in fixed and floating rate debt instruments and borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund business \noperations. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, \nmarket conditions and other factors. We manage our exposure to interest rates by maintaining what we believe is an appropriate \nmix of fixed and variable rate debt. We believe this best protects us from interest rate risk. We could achieve this mix by (i) issuing \nfixed rate debt that we believe has a low stated interest rate and significant term to maturity, (ii) issuing variable rate debt with \nappropriate maturities and interest rates and (iii) entering into interest rate swap arrangements when we deem appropriate.  \nLiberty Broadband’s borrowings under the Margin Loan Agreement (as defined in note 8 to the accompanying \nconsolidated financial statements) and the Senior Credit Facility (as defined in note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial \nstatements) carry a variable interest rate based on LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest. LIBOR is the \nsubject of national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial \nConduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the \nFCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative: \n(a) immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the one week and two month U.S. dollar settings; and (b) immediately \nafter June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar settings. The United States Federal Reserve has also advised banks \nto cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate. The Alternative Reference Rate Committee, a \ncommittee convened by the Federal Reserve that includes major market participants, has identified the Secured Overnight \nFinancing Rate (“SOFR”), an index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities, as its \npreferred alternative rate for LIBOR. Our Margin Loan Agreement and Senior Credit Facility provide for a transition to a SOFR \nbased rate or to other alternative reference rates depending on acceptance in the market of these rates. \nAs of December 31, 2022, our debt is comprised of the following amounts: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVariable rate debt \n  \nFixed rate debt \n  \n \n \nPrincipal \n  \nWeighted avg \n   \nPrincipal \n  \nWeighted avg \n  \n \n    \namount \n    \ninterest rate \n  \namount \n \ninterest rate \n  \n \n \ndollar amounts in millions \n  \nGCI Holdings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   $ \n402  \n5.9  %  $ \n600  \n4.8  % \nCorporate and other. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   $ \n1,400  \n6.2  %  $ \n1,415  \n1.9  % \nOur investment in Charter (our equity method affiliate) is publicly traded and not reflected at fair value in our balance \nsheet.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over \nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the \nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the \nconsolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, \ncomprehensive earnings (loss), cash flows, and equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related \nnotes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those \nconsolidated financial statements. \nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the \neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over \nFinancial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. \nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance \nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain \nreasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of \ninternal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that \na material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our \naudit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a \nreasonable basis for our opinion. \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial \nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A \ncompany’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, \nin reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance \nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and \ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any \nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or \nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n/s/ KPMG LLP \nDenver, Colorado \nFebruary 17, 2023"

      "text": "F-24 \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors \nLiberty Broadband Corporation: \nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Liberty Broadband Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive earnings (loss), cash flows, and equity for each \nof the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our \nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended \nDecember 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the \nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated \nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 17, 2023 \nexpressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. \nBasis for Opinion \nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on \nthese consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be \nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain \nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our \naudits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error \nor fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the \namounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and \nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe \nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matters \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that \nwere communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to \nthe consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of \ncritical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by \ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to \nwhich they relate. \nEquity method accounting for the Company’s investment in Charter \nAs discussed in notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded an investment in Charter of $11,433 \nmillion as of December 31, 2022, accounted for using the equity method. The investment represents approximately 75.5% of the total \nassets of the Company as of December 31, 2022. The investment, originally recorded at cost, is adjusted to recognize the Company’s share \nof net earnings or losses as they occur and for additional purchases and sales of Charter shares. The Company’s investment in Charter \ndiffers from the underlying equity of Charter which results in excess basis in the investment. This excess basis is allocated to the underlying \nassets and liabilities of the Company’s investee within memo accounts used for equity method accounting. \nWe identified the evaluation of the equity method of accounting for the Company’s investment in Charter as a critical audit matter. \nEvaluating the Company’s application of the equity method of accounting for the Company’s investment in Charter required a higher \ndegree of auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of audit effort required to address the matter, including the involvement of \nvaluation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge. \nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the \noperating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company’s \napplication of its equity method accounting, including the related share of earnings calculation, allocation of excess basis to the memo \naccounts, the associated amortization, and the gain or loss on dilution.  We performed risk assessment procedures, including sensitivity \nanalyses, and applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over the investment. We \ndeveloped independent expectations of (1) the Company’s share of earnings of Charter and (2) the gain or loss on dilution and compared"

We recalculated (1) the allocation of excess basis to the memo accounts and \n(2) the related excess basis amortization.  We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in \nassessing the allocation of the excess basis, including (1) assessing the valuation methodology used by the Company to estimate the fair \nvalue of Charter’s assets by comparison to generally accepted valuation methodologies, and (2) assessing the identification of marketplace \ntransactions used in the model by considering the comparability to Charter. \nSufficiency of audit evidence over certain data, wireless, video and voice revenue streams \nAs discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the consolidated statements of operations, the Company \nreported revenue of $975 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which included $892 million of revenue related to data, wireless, \nvideo and voice services at GCI Holdings. The Company’s accounting for these revenue streams involves multiple processes and \ninformation technology (IT) systems. \nWe identified the evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over certain data, wireless, video, and voice revenue streams at GCI Holdings \nas a critical audit matter. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence required subjective auditor judgment due to the number of revenue \nstreams and related IT applications utilized throughout the revenue recognition process. Subjective auditor judgment was required to \nevaluate whether relevant revenue data was captured and aggregated throughout these various processes and IT applications, which \nincluded the involvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge. We applied auditor judgment in determining the \nrevenue streams over which procedures would be performed and evaluating the nature and extent of evidence obtained over each relevant \nrevenue stream. \nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine \nthe nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue.  For each revenue stream where procedures were performed: \n—   we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the revenue recognition process, \nincluding controls related to accurately recording amounts for certain of the Company’s data, wireless, video, and voice revenue streams \n—   we assessed the recorded revenue by selecting a sample of transactions and compared the amounts recognized to underlying \ndocumentation, including evidence of contracts with customers. \nWe involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: \n—  testing relevant IT applications and internal controls over the Company’s revenue recognition processes \n—  testing the transfer of relevant revenue data between different IT systems used in the Company’s revenue recognition processes. \nWe evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of the procedures performed, including the appropriateness \nof the nature and extent of such evidence. \n/s/ KPMG LLP \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014. \nDenver, Colorado \nFebruary 17, 2023"

      "text": "LIBERTY BROADBAND CORPORATION \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 \n \nF-32 \n(1) Basis of Presentation \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Liberty Broadband Corporation and its \ncontrolled subsidiaries (collectively, \"Liberty Broadband,\" the \"Company,\" “us,” “we,” or “our” unless the context otherwise \nrequires). Liberty Broadband Corporation is primarily comprised of GCI Holdings, LLC (“GCI Holdings” or “GCI”) (as of \nDecember 18, 2020), a wholly owned subsidiary, and an equity method investment in Charter Communications, Inc. (“Charter”).  \nGCI Holdings provides a full range of data, wireless, video, voice, and managed services to residential customers, \nbusinesses, governmental entities, and educational and medical institutions primarily in Alaska under the GCI brand. Charter is \na leading broadband connectivity company and cable operator. Over an advanced high-capacity, two-way telecommunications \nnetwork, Charter offers a full range of state-of-the-art residential and business services including Spectrum Internet, TV, Mobile \nand Voice. For small and medium-sized companies, Spectrum Business® delivers the same suite of broadband products and \nservices coupled with special features and applications to enhance productivity, while for larger businesses and government \nentities, Spectrum Enterprise provides highly customized, fiber-based solutions. Spectrum Reach® delivers tailored advertising \nand production for the modern media landscape. Charter also distributes award-winning news coverage and sports programming \nto its customers through Spectrum Networks. \nOn December 18, 2020, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 6, 2020, entered into by GCI \nLiberty, Inc. (“GCI Liberty”), Liberty Broadband, Grizzly Merger Sub 1, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Broadband \n(“Merger LLC”), and Grizzly Merger Sub 2, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger LLC (“Merger Sub”), Merger Sub merged \nwith and into GCI Liberty (the “First Merger”), with GCI Liberty surviving the First Merger as an indirect wholly owned \nsubsidiary of Liberty Broadband (the “Surviving Corporation”), and immediately following the First Merger, GCI Liberty (as the \nSurviving Corporation in the First Merger) merged with and into Merger LLC (the “Upstream Merger”, and together with the \nFirst Merger, the “Combination”), with Merger LLC surviving the Upstream Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty \nBroadband. \nAs a result of the Combination, each holder of a share of Series A common stock and Series B common stock of GCI \nLiberty received 0.58 of a share of Series C common stock and Series B common stock, respectively, of Liberty Broadband. \nAdditionally, each holder of a share of Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock of GCI Liberty (“GCI Liberty Preferred \nStock”) received one share of newly issued Liberty Broadband Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Liberty \nBroadband Preferred Stock”), which has substantially identical terms to GCI Liberty’s former Series A Cumulative Redeemable \nPreferred Stock, including a mandatory redemption date of March 9, 2039. Cash was paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares of \nLiberty Broadband stock in the Combination. No shares of Liberty Broadband stock were issued with respect to shares of GCI \nLiberty capital stock held by (i) GCI Liberty as treasury stock, (ii) any of GCI Liberty’s wholly owned subsidiaries or (iii) Liberty \nBroadband or its wholly owned subsidiaries. \nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries throughout the world took aggressive actions, including \nimposing travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders, closing public attractions and restaurants, and mandating social distancing \npractices, which caused a significant disruption to most sectors of the economy at varying levels during the periods covered by \nthe financial statements. \nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and \ncreated significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, we are not presently aware of any events or circumstances \narising from the COVID-19 pandemic that would require us to update our estimates or judgments or revise the carrying value of \nour assets or liabilities. Our estimates may change, however, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and any \nsuch changes will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from estimates, and any such \ndifferences may be material to our financial statements. \nSkyhook Holdings, Inc. (“Skyhook”) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Broadband until its sale on May 2, 2022 \nfor aggregate consideration of approximately $194 million, including amounts held in escrow of approximately $23 million. \nLiberty Broadband recognized a gain on the sale of $179 million, net of closing fees, in the second quarter of 2022, which is"

In \nconnection with the Broadband Spin-Off, Liberty (for accounting purposes a related party of the Company) and Liberty \nBroadband entered into certain agreements in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships between the two companies \nand to provide for an orderly transition, including a services agreement and a facilities sharing agreement. Additionally, in \nconnection with a prior transaction, GCI Liberty and Qurate Retail, Inc. (“Qurate Retail”) (for accounting purposes a related \nparty of the Company) entered into a tax sharing agreement, which was assumed by Liberty Broadband as a result of the \nCombination. The tax sharing agreement provides for the allocation and indemnification of tax liabilities and benefits between \nQurate Retail and Liberty Broadband and other agreements related to tax matters. Under the facilities sharing agreement, Liberty \nBroadband shares office space with Liberty and related amenities at Liberty’s corporate headquarters. Liberty Broadband will \nreimburse Liberty for direct, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Liberty in providing these services which will be negotiated \nsemi-annually.  \nPursuant to the services agreement, Liberty provides Liberty Broadband with general and administrative services \nincluding legal, tax, accounting, treasury and investor relations support. In December 2019, the Company entered into an \namendment to the services agreement with Liberty in connection with Liberty’s entry into a new employment arrangement with \nGregory B. Maffei, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Under the amended services agreement, components \nof his compensation would either be paid directly to him by each of the Company, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc., GCI \nLiberty, and Qurate Retail (collectively, the “Service Companies”) or reimbursed to Liberty, in each case, based on allocations \namong Liberty and the Service Companies set forth in the amended services agreement. This allocation percentage will be \ndetermined based on a combination of (1) relative market capitalizations, weighted 50%, and (2) a blended average of historical \ntime allocation on a Liberty-wide and CEO basis, weighted 50%, in each case, absent agreement to the contrary by Liberty and \nthe Service Companies in consultation with the CEO. The allocation percentage will then be adjusted annually and following \ncertain events. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the allocation percentage for Liberty Broadband was \n33%, 37% and 18%, respectively. Following the Combination, GCI Liberty no longer participates in the services agreement \narrangement. The amended services agreement provides for a five year employment term which began on January 1, 2020 and \nends December 31, 2024, with an aggregate annual base salary of $3 million (with no contracted increase), an aggregate one-\ntime cash commitment bonus of $5 million (paid in December 2019), an aggregate annual target cash performance bonus of $17 \nmillion, aggregate annual equity awards of $18 million and aggregate equity awards granted in connection with his entry into his \nnew agreement of $90 million (the “upfront awards”). A portion of the grants made to our CEO in the year ended December 31, \n2020 related to our company’s allocable portion of these upfront awards. \nUnder these various agreements, amounts reimbursable to Liberty were approximately $10 million and $14 million for \nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Liberty Broadband had a tax sharing receivable with Qurate Retail \nof $7 million and $86 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which $1 million and zero was in Other current \nassets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted \naccounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and represent the historical consolidated financial information of GCI"

All \nsignificant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. \n(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nCash and Cash Equivalents \nCash consists of cash deposits held in global financial institutions. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments \nwith original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Cash that has restrictions upon its usage has been \nexcluded from cash and cash equivalents. Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit \nrisk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and corporate debt securities. The Company maintains some cash and cash \nequivalents balances with financial institutions that are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. \nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses \nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for credit losses \nis the Company’s best estimate of the amount of expected credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company bases \nits estimates on the aging of its accounts receivable balances, financial health of specific customers, regional economic data, \nchanges in its collections process, regulatory requirements and its customers’ compliance with the Federal Communications \nCommission (\"FCC\") rules. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses methodology at least annually. \nDepending upon the type of account receivable the Company’s allowance is calculated using a pooled basis with an \nallowance for all accounts greater than 120 days past due, a pooled basis using a percentage of related accounts, or a specific \nidentification method. When a specific identification method is used, potentially uncollectible accounts due to bankruptcy or \nother issues are reviewed individually for collectability. Write-offs of accounts receivable balances occur when the Company \ndeems the receivables are uncollectible. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its \ncustomers. \nAllowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2020. A summary of activity in the allowance for credit \nlosses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (amounts in millions): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditions \n \nDeductions \n  \n \n \nBalance at \n \nCharged to \n \n \n \n \n \n     \nbeginning of \n    \ncosts and \n     \nWrite-offs net \n    \nBalance at \n \n     \nyear \n    \nexpenses \n     \nof recoveries \n \nend of year \n2022 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n$ \n 4 \n 4 \n \n (4)  \n 4 \n2021 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n$ \n — \n 4 \n \n —   \n 4 \n \nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities \nAll of the Company’s derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet \nat fair value. None of the Company’s derivatives are currently designated as hedges, as a result, changes in the fair value of the \nderivative are recognized in earnings. \nThe fair value of certain of the Company’s derivative instruments are estimated using the Black Scholes Merton option-\npricing model (“Black-Scholes model”). The Black-Scholes model incorporates a number of variables in determining such fair \nvalues, including expected volatility of the underlying security and an appropriate discount rate. The Company obtained volatility \nrates from pricing services based on the expected volatility of the underlying security over the remaining term of the derivative \ninstrument. A discount rate was obtained at the inception of the derivative instrument and updated each reporting period, based \non the Company’s estimate of the discount rate at which it could currently settle the derivative instrument. The Company \nconsidered its own credit risk as well as the credit risk of its counterparties in estimating the discount rate. Management judgment"

The Company had no outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, \n2022 or December 31, 2021. \nInvestments in Equity Method Affiliates \nFor those investments in affiliates in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, the equity \nmethod of accounting is used. Under this method, the investment, originally recorded at cost, is adjusted to recognize the \nCompany’s share of net earnings or losses of the affiliate as they occur rather than as dividends or other distributions are received. \nLosses are limited to the extent of the Company’s investment in, advances to and commitments for the equity method investee. \nThe Company determines the difference between the purchase price of the equity method investee and the underlying equity \nwhich results in an excess basis in the investment. This excess basis is allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities of the \nCompany’s equity method investee through an acquisition accounting exercise and is allocated within memo accounts used for \nequity method accounting purposes. Depending on the applicable underlying assets, these amounts are either amortized over the \napplicable useful lives or determined to be indefinite lived. Changes in the Company’s proportionate share of the underlying \nequity of an equity method investee, which result from the issuance of additional equity securities by such equity method investee, \nare recognized in the statement of operations through the gain (loss) on dilution of investment in affiliate line item. We \nperiodically evaluate our equity method investment to determine if decreases in fair value below our cost basis are other than \ntemporary. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, we are required to reflect such decline in our \nconsolidated statements of operations. Other than temporary declines in fair value of our equity method investment would be \nincluded in share of earnings (losses) of affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations. \nThe primary factors we consider in our determination of whether declines in fair value are other than temporary are the \nlength of time that the fair value of the investment is below our carrying value; the severity of the decline; and the financial \ncondition, operating performance and near term prospects of the equity method investee. In addition, we consider the reason for \nthe decline in fair value, be it general market conditions, industry specific or equity method investee specific; analysts' ratings \nand estimates of 12 month share price targets for the equity method investee; changes in stock price or valuation subsequent to \nthe balance sheet date; and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in \nfair value. \nAs Liberty Broadband does not control the decision making process or business management practices of our affiliates \naccounted for using the equity method, Liberty Broadband relies on management of its affiliates to provide it with accurate \nfinancial information prepared in accordance with GAAP that the Company uses in the application of the equity method. In \naddition, Liberty Broadband relies on the audit reports that are provided by the affiliates’ independent auditors on the financial \nstatements of such affiliate. The Company is not aware, however, of any errors in or possible misstatements of the financial \ninformation provided by its equity affiliates that would have a material effect on Liberty Broadband’s consolidated financial \nstatements. See note 6 for additional discussion regarding our investment in Charter.  \nOther Investments \nAll marketable equity and debt securities held by the Company are carried at fair value, generally based on quoted \nmarket prices and changes in the fair value of such securities are reported in realized and unrealized gain (losses) on financial \ninstruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company elected the measurement alternative \n(defined as the cost of the security, adjusted for changes in fair value when there are observable prices, less impairments) for its \nequity securities without readily determinable fair values. \nThe Company performs a qualitative assessment each reporting period for its equity securities without readily \ndeterminable fair values to identify whether an equity security could be impaired. When the Company’s qualitative assessment \nindicates that an impairment could exist, it estimates the fair value of the investment and to the extent the fair value is less than \nthe carrying value, it records the difference as an impairment in the consolidated statements of operations."

If the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted \ncash flows to be generated by such asset group, including its ultimate disposition, an impairment adjustment is to be recognized. \nSuch adjustment is measured by the amount that the carrying value of such asset groups exceeds its fair value. The Company \ngenerally measures fair value by considering sale prices for similar asset groups or by discounting estimated future cash flows \nusing an appropriate discount rate. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of asset groups. \nAccordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.

When the liability is initially recorded, the Company capitalizes a cost by \nincreasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, changes in the \nliability for an asset retirement obligation resulting from revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of \nundiscounted cash flows are recognized. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized \ncost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, the Company either settles the \nobligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. \nThe majority of the Company’s asset retirement obligations are the estimated cost to remove telephony transmission \nequipment and support equipment from leased property.

The Company expects \nto continually renew its permits and therefore cannot reasonably estimate any liabilities associated with such agreements. A \nremote possibility exists that the Company would not be able to successfully renew a permit, which could result in it incurring \nsignificant expense in complying with restoration or removal provisions. \nIntangible Assets \nInternally used software, whether developed or purchased and installed as is, is capitalized and amortized using the \nstraight-line method over an estimated useful life of three to five years. The Company capitalizes certain costs associated \nwith internally developed software such as payroll costs of employees devoting time to the projects, external direct costs for \nmaterials and services, and interest costs incurred. Costs associated with internally developed software to be used internally are \nexpensed until the point the project has reached the development stage. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to \ninternal-use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. \nSoftware maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The capitalization of software \nrequires judgment in determining when a project has reached the development stage. \nThe Company has Software as a Service (\"SaaS\") arrangements which are accounted for as service agreements, and are \nnot capitalized. Internal and other third party costs for SaaS arrangements are capitalized or expensed in accordance with the \ninternal use software guidance as discussed in the preceding paragraph. \nIntangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated \nresidual values, and reviewed for impairment upon certain triggering events.

Cable certificates represent agreements or \nauthorizations with government entities that allow access to homes in cable service areas, including the future economic benefits \nof the right to solicit and service potential customers and the right to deploy and market new services to potential \ncustomers. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition. \nThe Company’s annual impairment assessment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets is performed during the fourth quarter of \neach year. \nThe accounting guidance allows entities the option to perform a qualitative impairment test for goodwill. The entity may \nresume performing the quantitative assessment in any subsequent period. In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, the \nCompany reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant \naccounting guidance to determine whether it was more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of its reporting \nunits. The Company considers whether there are any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market \nchanges, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges, the legal environments and how these \nfactors might impact company specific performance in future periods. As part of the analysis the Company also considers fair \nvalue determinations for certain reporting units that have been made at various points throughout the current year and prior year \nfor other purposes. If based on the qualitative analysis it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the Company performs \nthe quantitative impairment test. \nThe quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and \nto the extent the carrying value is greater than the fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment in the consolidated \nstatements of operations. Developing estimates of fair value requires significant judgments, including making assumptions about \nappropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, relevant comparable market multiples, public trading prices and the amount \nand timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the Company’s valuation analyses are based on \nmanagement’s best estimates considering current marketplace factors and risks as well as assumptions of growth rates in \nfuture years. There is no assurance that actual results in the future will approximate these forecasts. \nThe accounting guidance also permits entities to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more \nlikely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset, other than goodwill, is impaired. The accounting guidance also allows \nentities the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly \nto the quantitative impairment test. The entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. If the \nqualitative assessment supports that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible \nassets, other than goodwill, exceeds its fair value, then a quantitative assessment is performed. If the carrying value of an \nindefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. \nRevenue Recognition \nGCI Holdings \nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes any sales incentives \nand amounts collected on behalf of third parties. GCI Holdings recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by \ntransferring control of a product or service to a customer. Substantially all of GCI Holdings’ revenue is earned from services \ntransferred over time. If at contract inception, GCI Holdings determines the time period between when it transfers a promised \ngood or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service is one year or less, it does not adjust the \npromised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component. \nCertain of GCI Holdings’ customers have guaranteed levels of service. If an interruption in service occurs, GCI Holdings \ndoes not recognize revenue for any portion of the monthly service fee that will be refunded to the customer or not billed to the \ncustomer due to these service level agreements."

Monthly \nservice revenue for data network access and high-speed internet services is billed in advance, recorded as deferred revenue on \nthe balance sheet, and recognized as the associated services are provided to the customer. Internet service excess usage revenue \nis recognized when the services are provided. GCI Holdings recognizes revenue for product sales when a customer takes \npossession of the equipment. GCI Holdings provides telecommunications engineering services on a time and materials basis. \nRevenue is recognized for these services as-invoiced. \nWireless \nWireless revenue is generated by providing access to, and usage of GCI Holdings’ network by consumer, business, and \nwholesale carrier customers. Additionally, GCI Holdings generates revenue by selling wireless equipment such as handsets and \ntablets. In general, access revenue is billed in advance, recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet, and recognized as the \nassociated services are provided to the customer. Equipment sales revenue associated with the sale of wireless devices and \naccessories is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and control transfers to the customer. Consideration \nreceived from the customer is allocated to the service and products based on stand-alone selling prices when purchased together. \nNew and existing wireless customers have the option to participate in Upgrade Now, a program that provides eligible \ncustomers with the ability to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a period of up to 36 months. Participating \ncustomers have the right to trade-in the original equipment for a new device after making the equivalent of 12 monthly installment \npayments, provided their handset is in good working condition. Upon upgrade, the outstanding balance of the wireless equipment \ninstallment plan is exchanged for the used handset. GCI Holdings accounts for this upgrade option as a right of return with a \nreduction of Revenue and Operating expense for handsets expected to be upgraded based on historical data. \nOther \nOther revenue consists of video and voice revenue. Video revenue is generated primarily from residential and business \ncustomers that subscribe to GCI Holdings’ cable video plans. Video revenue is billed in advance, recorded as deferred revenue \non the balance sheet, and recognized as the associated services are provided to the customer. Voice revenue is for fixed monthly \nfees for voice plans as well as usage based fees for long-distance service usage. Voice plan fees are billed in advance, recorded \nas deferred revenue on the balance sheet, and recognized as the associated services are provided to the customer. Usage based \nfees are recognized as services are provided. \nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations \nContracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations as customers purchase multiple services and \nproducts within those contracts. For such arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative \nstandalone selling price for each service or product within the contract. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based \non the prices charged to customers. \nSignificant Judgments \nSome contracts with customers include variable consideration, and may require significant judgment to determine the \ntotal transaction price, which impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized.

Services and \nproducts are generally sold separately, which helps establish standalone selling price for services and products GCI Holdings \nprovides. \nRemaining Performance Obligations \nThe Company expects to recognize revenue in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or \npartially unsatisfied) as of December 31, 2022 of $242 million in 2023, $93 million in 2024, $64 million in 2025, $35 million in \n2026 and $40 million in 2027 and thereafter. \nThe Company applies certain practical expedients as permitted and does not disclose information about remaining \nperformance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less, information about revenue remaining from \nusage based performance obligations that are recognized over time as-invoiced, or variable consideration allocated to wholly \nunsatisfied performance obligations. \nContract Balances \nThe Company had receivables of $189 million and $217 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the long-\nterm portion of which are included in Other assets, net. The Company had deferred revenue of $33 million and $32 million at \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the long-term portion of which are included in Other liabilities. The receivables and \ndeferred revenue are only from contracts with customers. GCI Holdings’ customers generally pay for services in advance of the \nperformance obligation and therefore these prepayments are recorded as deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is recognized as \nrevenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as the services are provided. Changes in the contract liability \nbalance for the Company during 2022 was not materially impacted by other factors. \nAssets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer \nManagement expects that incremental commission fees paid to intermediaries as a result of obtaining customer contracts \nare recoverable and therefore the Company capitalizes them as contract costs. \nCapitalized commission fees are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate which \ntypically range from two to five years, and are included in Selling, general, and administrative expenses. \nThe Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization \nperiod of the assets that otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. These costs are included in Selling, general, and \nadministrative expenses."

Advertising expense aggregated $4 million and $5 million for the \nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was not material for the year ended December 31, 2020. Advertising \ncosts are reflected in the Selling, general and administrative, including stock-based compensation line item in our consolidated \nstatements of operations. \nStock-Based Compensation \nAs more fully described in note 12, Liberty Broadband has granted to its directors, employees and employees of certain \nof its subsidiaries, restricted stock and stock options to purchase shares of Liberty Broadband common stock (collectively, \n“Awards”). Liberty Broadband measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an equity classified Award (such \nas stock options and restricted stock) based on the grant-date fair value of the Award, and recognizes that cost over the period \nduring which the employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period of the Award). Liberty Broadband measures \nthe cost of employee services received in exchange for a liability classified Award based on the current fair value of the Award, \nand remeasures the fair value of the Award at each reporting date.  \nIncome Taxes \nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nrecognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and \nincome tax bases of assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. \nThe deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for each taxing jurisdiction in which the \nCompany operates for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Net deferred tax \nassets are then reduced by a valuation allowance if the Company believes it more likely than not that such net deferred tax assets \nwill not be realized. We consider all relevant factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, \nincluding our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods \navailable to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as assessing available tax planning strategies. The effect on deferred tax assets \nand liabilities of an enacted change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that \nincludes the enactment date. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income \ntax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments \nand estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates."

Such interest expense is included \nin interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Any accrual of penalties related to underpayment \nof income taxes on uncertain tax positions is included in Other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. \nWe recognize in our consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than \nnot to be sustained upon an examination, based on the technical merits of the position. \n \nCertain Risks and Concentrations \nGCI Holdings offers wireless and wireline telecommunication services, data services, video services, and managed \nservices to customers primarily throughout Alaska. Because of this geographic concentration, growth of GCI Holdings’ business \nand operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska.  \nGCI Holdings receives support from each of the various Universal Service Fund (\"USF\") programs: rural health care, \nschools and libraries, high-cost, and lifeline. The programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the FCC or \nlegislative actions, therefore, changes to the programs could result in a material decrease in revenue that the Company has \nrecorded. Historical revenue recognized from the programs was 35%, 32% and 29% of GCI Holdings’ revenue for the years \nended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company had USF net receivables of $116 million at December 31, \n2022. See note 14 for more information regarding the rural health care receivables.  \nLoss Contingencies \nPeriodically, we review the status of all significant outstanding matters to assess any potential financial exposure. When \n(i) it is probable that a loss has been incurred and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the estimated \nloss in our consolidated statements of operations. We provide disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss \ncontingencies that do not meet both these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would \nbe material to the financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred \nand whether such liability is reasonably estimable. We base accruals made on the best information available at the time which can \nbe highly subjective. The final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts included in the accompanying \nconsolidated financial statements. \nComprehensive Earnings (Loss) \nComprehensive earnings (loss) consists of net earnings (loss), comprehensive earnings (loss) attributable to debt credit \nrisk adjustments and the Company’s share of the comprehensive earnings (loss) of our equity method affiliate. \nEarnings per Share (EPS)  \nBasic earnings (loss) per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average \nnumber of common shares outstanding (“WASO”) for the period. Diluted EPS presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of \npotential common shares as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented. Potentially dilutive shares are \nexcluded from the computation of diluted EPS during periods in which losses are reported since the result would be antidilutive. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYears ended December 31, \n \n  \n2022 \n  \n2021 \n  \n2020 \n \n \nnumber of shares in millions \nBasic WASO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   \n 157   \n 185   \n 182 \nPotentially dilutive shares . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   \n 1   \n 1   \n 1 \nDiluted WASO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   \n 158   \n 186   \n 183"

Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company \nconsiders (i) the application of the equity method of accounting for its affiliates, (ii) non-recurring fair value measurements of \nnon-financial instruments and (iii) accounting for income taxes to be its most significant estimates.  \nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements \nIn November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting guidance which will require \nannual disclosures about certain government transactions that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting \nmodel by analogy, including information about the nature of the transactions, the related policy used to account for the \ntransactions, the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item and any significant terms and conditions of the \ntransactions, including commitments and contingencies. This guidance is effective for annual financial statements issued for \nperiods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company adopted this guidance for the year ended December 31, 2022 (as \ndiscussed below). \nGovernment Assistance \nThe Company’s government assistance during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily consisted of a $25 million \ngrant made by the US Department of Agriculture – Rural Utilities Service as part of the ReConnect Program to bring 2,000 Mbps \ninternet speeds and affordable, unlimited data plans to a dozen Aleutian, Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak Island communities. For \naccounting purposes, this grant is accounted for using grant accounting model by analogy to International Accounting Standard \n20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. This grant is recorded as deferred revenue \nsince the primary conditions for the receipt of the grant are the build out and operation of the broadband services over the next \n19 years. During the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue recorded in the consolidated financial statements was not material.  \nBoth short-term and long-term deferred revenue have been recorded for the $25 million grant received, with approximately $24 \nmillion recorded as long-term."

Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets \nfor identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are \ninputs, other than quoted market prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or \nindirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The Company does not have any recurring assets or \nliabilities measured at fair value that would be considered Level 3. \nThe Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value are as follows: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 31, 2022 \n \nDecember 31, 2021 \n  \n \n  \n \n \nQuoted prices \n \nSignificant \n \n \n \nQuoted prices \n \nSignificant \n  \n \n  \n \n \nin active \n \nother \n \n \n \nin active \n \nother \n  \n \n  \n \n \nmarkets for \n \nobservable \n \n \n \nmarkets for \n \nobservable \n  \n \n  \n \n identical assets  \ninputs \n \n \n identical assets  \ninputs \n  \nDescription \n \nTotal \n \n(Level 1) \n \n(Level 2) \n \nTotal \n \n(Level 1) \n \n(Level 2) \n  \n \n \namounts in millions \n  \nCash equivalents . . . . . .  \n $ \n 288  \n 288  \n —  \n 118  \n 118  \n —  \nIndemnification \nobligation . . . . . . . . . .   $ \n 50  \n —  \n 50  \n 324  \n —  \n 324  \nExchangeable senior \ndebentures . . . . . . . . . .   $ \n 1,373  \n —  \n 1,373  \n 1,428  \n —  \n 1,428  \n \n Pursuant to an indemnification agreement initially entered into by GCI Liberty and assumed by Liberty Broadband in \nconnection with the Combination, Liberty Broadband has agreed to indemnify Liberty Interactive LLC (“LI LLC”), a subsidiary \nof Qurate Retail, for certain payments made to holders of LI LLC’s 1.75% exchangeable debentures due 2046 (the \n\"1.75% Exchangeable Debentures\"). An indemnity obligation in the amount of $336 million was recorded upon completion of \nthe Combination. The indemnification liability due to LI LLC pertains to the holders’ ability to exercise their exchange right \naccording to the terms of the 1.75% Exchangeable Debentures on or before October 5, 2023. Such amount will equal the \ndifference between the exchange value and par value of the 1.75% Exchangeable Debentures at the time the exchange occurs. \nThe indemnification obligation recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 \nrepresents the fair value of the estimated exchange feature included in the 1.75% Exchangeable Debentures primarily based on \nobservable market data as significant inputs (Level 2). As of December 31, 2022, a holder of the 1.75% Exchangeable Debentures \nhas the ability to exchange their debentures on October 5, 2023, and, accordingly, such indemnification obligation is included as \na current liability in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. \nThe Company’s exchangeable senior debentures are debt instruments with quoted market value prices that are not \nconsidered to be traded on “active markets”, as defined in GAAP, and are reported in the foregoing table as Level 2 fair value. \nOther Financial Instruments \nOther financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include trade receivables, trade payables, \naccrued and other current liabilities, current portion of debt (with the exception of the 1.25% Debentures, the 2.75% Debentures \nand the 1.75% Debentures (each as defined in note 8)) and long-term debt. With the exception of long-term debt, the carrying \namount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments as reported on our consolidated balance sheets. \nThe carrying value of the Margin Loan Facility, Senior Credit Facility and Wells Fargo Note Payable (each as defined in note \n8) all bear interest at a variable rate and therefore are also considered to approximate fair value."

Changes in the \nfair value of the exchangeable senior debentures recognized in the consolidated statements of operations are primarily \ndue to market factors driven by changes in the fair value of the underlying shares into which the debt is exchangeable. \nThe Company isolates the portion of the unrealized gain (loss) attributable to the change in the instrument specific credit \nrisk and recognizes such amount in other comprehensive income. The change in the fair value of the exchangeable senior \ndebentures attributable to changes in the instrument specific credit risk before tax was a loss of $7 million, a loss of $2 \nmillion and a gain of $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The cumulative \nchange was a gain of less than $1 million as of December 31, 2022.  \n(6) Investment in Affiliates Accounted for Using the Equity Method \nCharter \n \nThrough a number of prior years’ transactions and the Combination, Liberty Broadband has acquired an interest in \nCharter. The investment in Charter is accounted for as an equity method affiliate based on our voting and ownership interest and \nthe board seats held by individuals appointed by Liberty Broadband. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying and market value of \nLiberty Broadband’s ownership in Charter was approximately $11.4 billion and $16.0 billion, respectively. We own an \napproximate 30.9% economic ownership interest in Charter, based on shares of Charter’s Class A common stock issued and \noutstanding as of December 31, 2022. \nUpon the closing of the Time Warner Cable merger, the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated \nas of May 23, 2015, by and among Charter, Liberty Broadband and Advance/Newhouse Partnership, as amended (the \n“Stockholders Agreement”), became fully effective. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, Liberty Broadband’s equity \nownership in Charter (on a fully diluted basis) is capped at the greater of 26% or the voting cap (as defined below) (“Equity \nCap”). As of December 31, 2022, due to Liberty Broadband’s voting interest exceeding the current voting cap of 25.01%, our \nvoting control of the aggregate voting power of Charter is 25.01%. Under the Stockholders Agreement, Liberty Broadband has \nagreed to vote (subject to certain exceptions) all voting securities beneficially owned by it, or over which it has voting discretion \nor control that are in excess of the voting cap in the same proportion as all other votes cast by public stockholders of Charter with \nrespect to the applicable matter. \nIn February 2021, Liberty Broadband was notified that its ownership interest, on a fully diluted basis, had exceeded the \nEquity Cap set forth in the Stockholders Agreement. On February 23, 2021, Charter and Liberty Broadband entered into a letter \nagreement in order to implement, facilitate and satisfy the terms of the Stockholders Agreement with respect to the Equity Cap. \nPursuant to this letter agreement, following any month during which Charter purchases, redeems or buys back shares of its Class \nA common stock, and prior to certain meetings of Charter’s stockholders, Liberty Broadband will be obligated to sell to Charter, \nand Charter will be obligated to purchase, such number of shares of Class A common stock as is necessary (if any) to reduce \nLiberty Broadband’s percentage equity interest, on a fully diluted basis, to the Equity Cap (such transaction, a “Charter \nRepurchase”). The per share sale price for each share of Charter will be equal to the volume weighted average price paid by"

Subsequent to December 31, 2022, Liberty Broadband sold 120,149 shares of \nCharter Class A common stock to Charter for $42 million. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, Liberty Broadband exercised its preemptive right to purchase an aggregate \nof approximately 35 thousand shares of Charter’s Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $15 million. \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were dilution losses of $63 million, $102 million, and \n$184 million, respectively, in the Company’s investment in Charter.

The decrease in excess basis for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022 was primarily due to amortization, as well as the impact of Charter share issuances during the period. Included \nin our share of earnings from Charter of $1,326 million, $1,194 million and $713 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, \n2021 and 2020, respectively, are $232 million, $234 million and $144 million, respectively, of losses, net of taxes, due to the \namortization of the excess basis related to assets with identifiable useful lives and debt."

The Margin Loan \nAgreement provides for (x) a term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.15 billion (the “Term Loan Facility” \nand proceeds of such facility, the “Term Loans”), (y) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.15 billion \n(the “Revolving Loan Facility” and proceeds of such facility, the “Revolving Loans”; the Revolving Loans, collectively with the \nTerm Loans, the “Loans”) and (z) an uncommitted incremental term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $200 \nmillion (collectively, the “Margin Loan Facility”). No additional borrowings under the Margin Loan Agreement were made in \nconnection with the Sixth Amendment. SPV’s obligations under the Margin Loan Facility are secured by shares of Charter owned \nby SPV. Effective on October 3, 2022, pursuant to Amendment No. 5 to Margin Loan Agreement, an additional 6 million shares \nof Charter were voluntarily pledged as collateral, which improved the loan to value ratio. \nOutstanding borrowings under the Margin Loan Agreement were $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 \nand December 31, 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, SPV was permitted to borrow an additional $900 million under \nthe Margin Loan Agreement, subject to certain funding conditions, which may be drawn until five business days prior to the \nmaturity date. The maturity date of the loans under the Margin Loan Agreement is May 12, 2024 (except for any additional loans \nincurred thereunder to the extent SPV and the incremental lenders agree to a later maturity date). Prior to the completion of the \nCombination, borrowings under the Margin Loan Agreement bore interest at the three-month LIBOR rate plus a per annum spread \nof 1.5%, which increased to a per annum spread of 1.85% from and after the completion of the Combination until the Fourth \nAmendment effective date on May 12, 2021, when the per annum spread decreased to 1.5%. The Margin Loan Agreement also \nprovides for customary LIBOR replacement provisions. \n \nThe Margin Loan Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that restrict the activities of SPV (and, \nin some cases, the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to shares of Charter owned by the Company and its subsidiaries). \nThe Margin Loan Agreement does not include any financial covenants. The Margin Loan Agreement does contain restrictions \nrelated to additional indebtedness and events of default customary for margin loans of this type."

The \nMargin Loan Agreement indicates that no lender party shall have any voting rights with respect to the shares pledged as collateral, \nexcept to the extent that a lender party buys any shares in a sale or other disposition made pursuant to the terms of the loan \nagreement. As of December 31, 2022, 37.3 million shares of Charter common stock with a value of $12.7 billion were held in \ncollateral accounts related to the Margin Loan Agreement.  \nExchangeable Senior Debentures \nOn August 27, 2020, the Company closed a private offering of $575 million aggregate original principal amount of its \n2.75% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2050 (the “2.75% Debentures”), including debentures with an aggregate original \nprincipal amount of $75 million issued pursuant to the exercise of an option granted to the initial purchasers. Upon an exchange \nof 2.75% Debentures, the Company, at its election, may deliver shares of Charter Class A common stock, the value thereof in \ncash, or any combination of shares of Charter Class A common stock and cash. Initially, 1.1661 shares of Charter Class A \ncommon stock are attributable to each $1,000 original principal amount of 2.75% Debentures, representing an initial exchange \nprice of approximately $857.56 for each share of Charter Class A common stock. A total of 670,507 shares of Charter Class A \ncommon stock are attributable to the 2.75% Debentures. Interest is payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30 and \nDecember 31 of each year, commencing December 31, 2020. The 2.75% Debentures may be redeemed by the Company, in whole \nor in part, on or after October 5, 2023. Holders of the 2.75% Debentures also have the right to require the Company to purchase \ntheir 2.75% Debentures on October 5, 2023. The redemption and purchase price will generally equal 100% of the adjusted \nprincipal amount of the 2.75% Debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, plus any final period \ndistribution. As of December 31, 2022, a holder of the 2.75% Debentures has the ability to exchange their debentures on \nOctober 5, 2023 and, accordingly, the 2.75% Debentures have been classified as current within the consolidated balance sheet as \nof December 31, 2022. \nOn November 23, 2020, the Company closed a private offering of $825 million aggregate original principal amount of \nits 1.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2050 (the “1.25% Debentures”), including debentures with an aggregate original \nprincipal amount of $75 million issued pursuant to the exercise of an option granted to the initial purchasers. Upon an exchange \nof 1.25% Debentures, the Company, at its election, may deliver shares of Charter Class A common stock, the value thereof in \ncash, or any combination of shares of Charter Class A common stock and cash.

The redemption and purchase price will generally equal 100% of the adjusted principal \namount of the 1.25% Debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, plus any final period distribution. As \nof December 31, 2022, a holder of the 1.25% Debentures has the ability to exchange their debentures on October 5, 2023 and, \naccordingly, the 1.25% Debentures have been classified as current within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, \n2022. \nIn connection with the closing of the Combination on December 18, 2020, the Company assumed all of GCI Liberty’s \noutstanding 1.75% exchangeable senior debentures due 2046 (the “1.75% Debentures”) with an original outstanding principal \namount of $15 million at fair value. The total fair value of the acquired 1.75% Debentures was approximately $26 million. The \n1.75% Debentures were initially issued on June 18, 2018 by GCI Liberty.

As of December 31, 2022, a holder of the 1.75% \nDebentures has the ability to exchange their debentures on October 5, 2023 and accordingly, the 1.75% Debentures have been \nclassified as current within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. \nThe Company elected to account for all exchangeable senior debentures at fair value in its consolidated financial \nstatements. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in Realized and unrealized gains (losses) \non financial instruments, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See note 5 for information related to \nunrealized gains (losses) on debt measured at fair value. The Company reviews the terms of all the debentures on a quarterly \nbasis to determine whether an event has occurred to require current classification on the consolidated balance sheets. \nSenior Notes \nIn connection with the closing of the Combination on December 18, 2020, GCI, LLC became an indirect wholly owned \nsubsidiary of the Company. GCI, LLC is the issuer of $600 million 4.75% senior notes due 2028 (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior \nNotes were issued by GCI, LLC on October 7, 2020 and are unsecured. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in \narrears. The Senior Notes are redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price defined in the \nindenture, and accrued and unpaid interest (if any) to the date of redemption. The Senior Notes are stated net of an aggregate \nunamortized premium of $28 million at December 31, 2022. Such premium is being amortized to interest expense in the \naccompanying consolidated statements of operations. \nSenior Credit Facility \nIn connection with the closing of the Combination on December 18, 2020, GCI, LLC became an indirect wholly owned \nsubsidiary of the Company. GCI, LLC is the borrower under the Senior Credit Facility (as defined below). \nOn October 15, 2021, GCI, LLC entered into an Eighth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Senior Credit \nFacility”), which includes a $550 million revolving credit facility, with a $25 million sublimit for standby letters of credit, that \nmatures on October 15, 2026 and a $250 million Term Loan A (the “Term Loan A”) that matures on October 15, 2027. \nAdditionally, the $400 million Term Loan B (the “Term Loan B”) which existed prior to the amendment, was repaid in full using \nthe proceeds from the Term Loan A together with $150 million in borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The revolving \ncredit facility borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility that are alternate base rate loans bear interest at a per annum rate equal \nto the alternate base rate plus a margin that varies between 0.50% and 1.75% depending on GCI, LLC’s total leverage ratio. The \nrevolving credit facility borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility that are LIBOR loans bear interest at a per annum rate equal \nto the applicable LIBOR plus a margin that varies between 1.50% and 2.75% depending on GCI, LLC’s total leverage ratio. \nTerm Loan A borrowings that are alternate base rate loans bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the alternate base rate plus a \nmargin that varies between 1.00% and 2.25% depending on GCI, LLC’s total leverage ratio. Term Loan A borrowings that are \nLIBOR loans bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable LIBOR plus a margin that varies between 2.00% and 3.25% \ndepending on GCI, LLC’s total leverage ratio. Principal payments are due quarterly on the Term Loan A equal to 0.25% of the \noriginal principal amount, which may step up to 1.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan A depending on GCI, \nLLC’s secured leverage ratio. Each loan may be prepaid at any time and from time to time without penalty other than customary \nbreakage costs. Any amounts prepaid on the revolving credit facility may be reborrowed. The Senior Credit Facility also provides \nfor customary LIBOR replacement provisions. \nPrior to the amendment, the borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bore interest at either the alternate base rate or \nLIBOR (based on an interest period selected by GCI, LLC of one month, two months, three months or six months) at the election \nof GCI, LLC in each case plus a margin. The revolving credit facility borrowings that were alternate base rate loans bore interest \nat a per annum rate equal to the alternate base rate plus a margin that varied between 0.50% and 1.75% depending on GCI, LLC’s \ntotal leverage ratio. The revolving credit facility borrowings that were LIBOR loans bore interest at a per annum rate equal to the \napplicable LIBOR plus a margin that varied between 1.50% and 2.75% depending on GCI, LLC’s total leverage ratio.

At any time after the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior \nCredit Facility, the lenders may, among other options, declare any amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility \nimmediately due and payable and terminate any commitment to make further loans under the Senior Credit Facility. The \nobligations under the Senior Credit Facility are secured by a security interest on substantially all of the assets of GCI, LLC and \nthe subsidiary guarantors, as defined in the Senior Credit Facility, and on the stock of GCI Holdings. \nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $247 million outstanding under the Term Loan A, $150 million outstanding under \nthe revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facility and $3 million in letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility, leaving $397 \nmillion available for borrowing. \nWells Fargo Note Payable \nIn connection with the closing of the Combination on December 18, 2020, the Company assumed GCI Holdings’ \noutstanding $6 million under its Wells Fargo Note Payable (as defined below). Outstanding borrowings on the Wells Fargo Note \nPayable were $5 million and $6 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \nGCI Holdings issued a note to Wells Fargo that matures on July 15, 2029 and is payable in monthly installments of \nprincipal and interest (the \"Wells Fargo Note Payable\"). The interest rate is variable at one month LIBOR plus 2.25%. The note \nalso provides for customary LIBOR replacement provisions. \nThe note is subject to similar affirmative and negative covenants as the Senior Credit Facility. The obligations under the \nnote are secured by a security interest and lien on the building purchased with the note. \nDebt Covenants \nGCI, LLC is subject to covenants and restrictions under its Senior Notes and Senior Credit Facility. The Company and \nGCI, LLC are in compliance with all debt maintenance covenants as of December 31, 2022. \nFive Year Maturities \nThe annual principal maturities of debt, based on stated maturity dates, for each of the next five years is a follows \n(amounts in millions): \n \n \n \n \n \n2023 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    $ \n 3 \n2024 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    $ \n 1,403 \n2025 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    $ \n 3 \n2026 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    $ \n 153 \n2027 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    $ \n 238 \nFair Value of Debt \nThe fair value of the Senior Notes was $506 million at December 31, 2022 (Level 1). \nDue to the variable rate nature of the Margin Loan, Senior Credit Facility and Wells Fargo Note Payable, the Company \nbelieves that the carrying amount approximates fair value at December 31, 2022."

At the time, GCI Holdings determined that it was precluded from applying sales-leaseback \naccounting. We also considered whether the Combination resulted in a completed sale-leaseback transaction and concluded that \nthe transaction did not meet the criteria and should continue to be accounted for in the same manner as previously determined. \nGCI Holdings has entered into finance lease agreements with satellite providers for transponder capacity to transmit \nvoice and data traffic in rural Alaska. GCI Holdings is also party to finance lease agreements for an office building and certain \nretail store locations. GCI Holdings also leases office space, land for towers and communication facilities, satellite transponders, \nfiber capacity, and equipment. These leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and \noperating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments using our incremental borrowing \nrate at the commencement date of the lease.  \nThe Company has leases with remaining lease terms that range from less than one year up to 28 years. Certain of the \nCompany’s leases may include an option to extend the term of the lease with such options to extend ranging from 3 years up to \n36 years. The Company also has the option to terminate certain of its leases early with such options to terminate ranging from as \nearly as 30 days up to 15 years from December 31, 2022. \nThe components of lease cost during the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 and 2020 were as follows: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYears ended December 31, \n  \n \n \n2022 \n \n2021 \n \n2020 \n  \n \n \namounts in millions \n \nOperating lease cost (1) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   \n$ \n 59 \n 60 \n 3  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nFinance lease cost \n \n  \n  \n \nDepreciation of leased assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   \n$ \n 1 \n 1 \n 1  \nTotal finance lease cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   \n$ \n 1 \n 1 \n 1  \n \n(1) Included within operating lease costs were short-term lease costs and variable lease costs, which were not material to \nthe consolidated financial statements."

Of the $32 million, $14 million are carryforwards with no \nexpiration. The remaining carryforwards expire at certain future dates. These carryforwards are expected to be utilized prior to \nexpiration, except for $1 million which based on current projections, may expire unused and accordingly are subject to a valuation \nallowance.

However, because Liberty \nBroadband generated a net operating loss (“NOL”) in 2016, 2017, and 2018, utilization of the NOLs in future years is still subject \nto adjustment.  The IRS has completed its examination of Liberty Broadband’s 2019 tax year, however, 2019 remains open until \nthe statute of limitations lapses on October 15, 2023.  Liberty Broadband’s 2020 and 2021 tax years are not under IRS \nexamination.  Liberty Broadband’s 2022 tax year is being examined currently as part of the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Process \n(“CAP”) program.  Because Liberty Broadband’s ownership of Charter is less than the required 80%, Charter is not consolidated \nwith Liberty Broadband for federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2022, all GCI tax years prior to 2019 are closed.  \nHowever, because GCI generated NOLs in tax years prior to 2019, utilization of the NOLs in future years are subject to \nadjustment.  GCI Liberty’s 2019, and 2020 tax years are not currently under IRS examination, but remain “open” until the statute \nof limitations expires on October 15, 2023 and October 15, 2024, respectively.  Prior to the March 9, 2018 GCI Liberty split-off \nfrom Qurate Retail, certain GCI Liberty businesses were part of the Qurate Retail, Inc. consolidated federal tax group. Qurate \nRetail’s tax years prior to 2019 are closed for federal income tax purposes. Various states are currently examining Qurate’s prior \nyears’ state income tax returns."

The probability of satisfying the performance objectives is assessed at the end of each reporting \nperiod. \nThere were no options to purchase shares of Series A Liberty Broadband common stock (“LBRDA”) or Series B Liberty \nBroadband common stock (“LBRDB”) granted during 2022, 2021 and 2020. \nThe Company has calculated the GDFV for all of its equity classified awards and any subsequent re-measurement of its \nliability classified awards using the Black-Scholes Model. The Company estimates the expected term of the Awards based on \nhistorical exercise and forfeiture data. For grants made in 2022, 2021 and 2020, the range of expected terms was 5.1 to 5.3 years. \nThe volatility used in the calculation for Awards is based on the historical volatility of Liberty Broadband common stock. For \ngrants made in 2022, 2021 and 2020, the range of volatilities was 25.1% to 29.7%. The Company uses a zero dividend rate and \nthe risk-free rate for Treasury Bonds with a term similar to that of the subject option. \nIn connection with the Combination, on the Effective Date: \ni. \nEach outstanding stock option to purchase shares of Series A GCI Liberty common stock (“GLIBA”) or Series B \nGCI Liberty common stock (“GLIBB” and, together with GLIBA, “GLIBA/B”) was converted to 0.58 of a \ncorresponding stock option to purchase LBRDK or LBRDB (together, “LBRDK/B”), respectively, rounded down \nto the nearest whole share. Additionally, the exercise price of the GLIBA/B stock option was divided by 0.58, with \nthe resulting LBRDK/B exercise price rounded up to the nearest cent. Except as described above, all other terms \nand restrictions of the LBRDK/B stock options are the same as the corresponding original GLIBA/B stock options. \n \nii. \nEach outstanding GLIBA RSU was converted to 0.58 of a corresponding LBRDK RSU, rounded down to the nearest \nwhole LBRDK RSU. No cash was paid in lieu of fractional LBRDK RSUs. All terms of the LBRDK RSUs are \nsubject to the same terms and restrictions as those applicable to the corresponding original GLIBA RSUs.  \n \niii. \nEach outstanding GLIBA share of restricted stock (“RSA”) was converted to 0.58 of a corresponding LBRDK RSA, \nrounded down to the nearest whole LBRDK RSA. Cash was issued in lieu of fractional LBRDK RSAs. All terms \nof the LBRDK RSAs are subject to the same terms and restrictions as those applicable to the corresponding original \nGLIBA RSAs. \n \niv. \nEach outstanding GCI Liberty Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“GLIBP”) RSA was converted \ninto one Liberty Broadband Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“LBRDP”) RSA. All terms of the \nLBRDP RSAs are subject to the same terms and restrictions as those applicable to the corresponding original GLIBP \nRSAs."

In the event the Company is unable to provide \nthe minimum service levels, it may incur penalties or issue credits to customers. \nCharter and Liberty Broadband - Delaware Litigation \nIn August 2015, a purported stockholder of Charter, Matthew Sciabacucchi, filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of \nChancery, on behalf of a putative class of Charter stockholders, challenging the transactions involving Charter, Time Warner \nCable Inc., Advance/Newhouse Partnership, and Liberty Broadband announced by Charter on May 26, 2015. The lawsuit, which \nnamed as defendants Liberty Broadband, Charter and the board of directors of Charter, alleged that the transactions resulted from \nbreaches of fiduciary duty by Charter’s directors and that Liberty Broadband improperly benefited from the challenged \ntransactions at the expense of other Charter stockholders. In January 2023, and in advance of the expenditure of significant time \nand costs, the parties reached a tentative agreement to settle the lawsuit. The settlement is subject to preliminary and final approval \nby the court and will result in a net payment to Charter as a result of the settlement of the derivative claims by the plaintiffs. \nLiberty Broadband expects to pay approximately $38 million to Charter as a result of the tentative settlement, which has been \naccrued as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheet and recorded as a litigation settlement expense within operating \nincome in the consolidated statements of operations.  There can be no assurance that this tentative settlement will be finalized \nand approved by the court. Pending finalization of the settlement and in the event the settlement is not finalized and approved by \nthe court, Charter and Liberty Broadband will continue to vigorously defend this lawsuit. \nGeneral Litigation \nThe Company has contingent liabilities related to legal and tax proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary \ncourse of business. Although it is reasonably possible the Company may incur losses upon conclusion of such matters, an estimate \nof any loss or range of loss cannot be made. In the opinion of management, it is expected that amounts, if any, which may be \nrequired to satisfy such contingencies will not be material in relation to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. \nHollywood Firefighters’ Pension Fund, et al. v. GCI Liberty, Inc., et al. On October 9, 2020, a putative class action \ncomplaint was filed by two purported GCI Liberty stockholders in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware under the \ncaption Hollywood Firefighters’ Pension Fund, et al. v. GCI Liberty, Inc., et al., Case No. 2020-0880. A new version of the \ncomplaint was filed on October 11, 2020. The complaint named as defendants GCI Liberty, as well as the members of the GCI \nLiberty board of directors. The complaint alleged, among other things, that Mr. Gregory B. Maffei, a director and the President \nand Chief Executive Officer of Liberty Broadband and, prior to the Combination, GCI Liberty, and Mr. John C. Malone, the \nChairman of the board of directors of Liberty Broadband and, prior to the Combination, GCI Liberty, in their purported capacities \nas controlling stockholders and directors of GCI Liberty, and the other directors of GCI Liberty, breached their fiduciary duties \nby approving the Combination. The complaint also alleged that various prior and current relationships among members of the \nGCI Liberty special committee, Mr. Malone and Mr. Maffei rendered the members of the GCI Liberty special committee not \nindependent. \nThe complaint sought certification of a class action, declarations that Messrs. Maffei and Malone and the other directors \nof GCI Liberty breached their fiduciary duties and the recovery of damages and other relief.  \nOn December 23, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint, which, among other things, included a new \ncount of breach of fiduciary duty against Mr. Maffei and Mr. Gregg Engles, the other former member of the GCI Liberty special \ncommittee, and new allegations that the price of GCI Liberty was depressed as a result of statements and omissions by Mr. Maffei"

      "text": "LIBERTY BROADBAND CORPORATION \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 \n \nF-67 \nin November of 2019. During the first quarter of 2021, the parties were conducting discovery with the trial scheduled for \nNovember 2021. We believed the lawsuit was without merit.  \nDuring March 2021 and in advance of the expenditure of significant time and costs to conduct the depositions proposed \nto have been taken in this action, the parties began negotiations with the class of plaintiffs for a potential settlement of this action. \nOn May 5, 2021, the plaintiffs (on behalf of themselves and other members of a proposed settlement class) and defendants entered \ninto an agreement in principle to settle the litigation pursuant to which the parties agreed that the plaintiffs will dismiss their \nclaims with prejudice, with customary releases, in return for a settlement payment of $110 million to be paid by Merger LLC (as \nsuccessor by merger to GCI, Liberty, Inc.) and/or insurers for the defendants and for GCI Liberty, which was recorded as a \nlitigation settlement expense within operating income in the consolidated statements of operations. During the second half of the \nyear, the Company made a payment of $110 million in accordance with the settlement agreement. \nOn June 17, 2021, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise, and Release. On June 30, \n2021, the Court preliminarily certified, solely for purposes of effectuating the proposed settlement, the action as a non-opt out \nclass action on behalf of a settlement class consisting of all holders of GCI Liberty Series A common stock as of December 18, \n2020. The Court set a settlement hearing for October 5, 2021, to determine whether to permanently certify the class, whether the \nproposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to the settlement class, and whether to enter a judgment dismissing the \naction with prejudice, among other things. On October 18, 2021, subsequent to that hearing, the Court issued a final order \npermanently certifying the Class and approving the settlement. The Court also awarded Plaintiffs’ Counsel $22 million in \nattorneys’ fees, which shall be paid out of the settlement fund. Plaintiffs also requested that the Court issue an additional fee \naward, which Defendant opposed, not to be paid out of the settlement fund, in connection with a certain claim that was mooted \nearlier in the case (a “mootness fee”). On November 8, 2021, the Court awarded Plaintiffs’ Counsel a $9 million mootness fee, \nwhich Defendant subsequently paid and recorded as a litigation settlement expense within operating income in the consolidated \nstatements of operations. \nIn addition, during the third quarter of 2021, the Company agreed to final settlement amounts with all five of its insurance \ncarriers for insurance recoveries of approximately $24 million, which is recorded net of the litigation settlement expense on the \nconsolidated statement of operations. \nRural Health Care (“RHC”) Program \n \nGCI Holdings receives support from various USF programs including the RHC Program. The USF programs are subject \nto change by regulatory actions taken by the FCC, interpretations of or compliance with USF program rules, or legislative actions. \nChanges to any of the USF programs that GCI Holdings participates in could result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts \nreceivable, which could have an adverse effect on GCI Holdings' business and the Company's financial position, results of \noperations or liquidity. The following paragraphs describe certain separate matters related to the RHC Program that impact or \ncould impact the revenue earned and receivables recognized by the Company. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had net \naccounts receivable from the RHC Program in the amount of approximately $80 million, which is included within Trade and \nother receivables in the consolidated balance sheets.  \nFCC Rate Reduction. In November 2017, the Universal Service Administrative Company requested further information \nin support of the rural rates charged to a number of GCI Holdings' RHC customers in connection with the funding requests for \nthe year that runs July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018. On October 10, 2018, GCI Holdings received a letter from the FCC's \nWireline Competition Bureau (“Bureau”) notifying it of the Bureau’s decision to reduce the rural rates charged to RHC customers \nfor the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018 by approximately 26% resulting in a reduction of total support payments of $28 \nmillion. The FCC also informed GCI Holdings that the same cost methodology used for the funding year that ended on June 30, \n2018 would be applied to rates charged to RHC customers in subsequent funding years. In response to the Bureau’s letter, GCI \nHoldings filed an Application for Review with the FCC.  \nOn October 20, 2020, the Bureau issued two separate letters approving the cost-based rural rates GCI Holdings \nhistorically applied when recognizing revenue for services provided to its RHC customers for the funding years that ended on"

      "text": "LIBERTY BROADBAND CORPORATION \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 \n \nF-68 \nJune 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020. GCI Holdings collected approximately $175 million in accounts receivable relating to these \ntwo funding years during the year ended December 31, 2021. GCI Holdings also filed an Application for Review of these \ndeterminations. Subsequently, GCI identified rates for similar services provided by a competitor that would justify higher rates \nfor certain GCI satellite services in the funding years that ended on June 30, 2018, June 30, 2019, and June 30, 2020. GCI \nsubmitted that information to the Bureau on September 7, 2021. The Applications for Review remain pending. \nOn June 25, 2020, GCI Holdings submitted cost studies with respect to a number of its rates for services provided to its \nRHC customers for the funding year ended June 30, 2021, which require approval by the Bureau. GCI Holdings further updated \nthose studies on November 12, 2020, to reflect the completion of the bidding season for that funding year. On May 24, 2021, the \nFCC approved the cost studies submitted by GCI Holdings for the funding year ended June 30, 2021. Subsequently, on August 16, \n2021, GCI submitted a request for approval of rates for 17 additional sites, 13 of which the FCC approved on December 22, 2022. \nThe rest remain pending. \nRHC Program Funding Cap. The RHC program has a funding cap for each individual funding year that is annually \nadjusted for inflation, and which the FCC can increase by carrying forward unused funds from prior funding years. In recent \nyears, including the current year, this funding cap has not limited the amount of funding received by participants; however, \nmanagement continues to monitor the funding cap and its potential impact on funding in future years.  \nEnforcement Bureau and Related Inquiries. On March 23, 2018, GCI Holdings received a letter of inquiry and request \nfor information from the Enforcement Bureau of the FCC relating to the period beginning January 1, 2015 and including all \nfuture periods. This includes inquiry into the rates charged by GCI Holdings and other aspects related to the Enforcement Bureau’s \nreview of GCI Holdings’ compliance with program rules, which are discussed separately below. The ongoing uncertainty in \nprogram funding, as well as the uncertainty associated with the rate review, could have an adverse effect on its business, financial \nposition, results of operations or liquidity. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, GCI Holdings became aware of potential RHC Program compliance issues related to \ncertain of GCI Holdings’ currently active and expired contracts with certain of its RHC customers. The Company and its external \nexperts performed significant and extensive procedures to determine whether GCI Holdings’ currently active and expired \ncontracts with its RHC customers would be deemed to be in compliance with the RHC Program rules. GCI Holdings notified the \nFCC of the potential compliance issues in the fourth quarter of 2019.  \nOn May 28, 2020, GCI Holdings received a second letter of inquiry from the Enforcement Bureau in the same matter \nnoted above. This second letter, which was in response to a voluntary disclosure made by GCI Holdings to the FCC, extended \nthe scope of the original inquiry to also include various questions regarding compliance with the records retention requirements \nrelated to the (i) original inquiry and (ii) RHC Program.  \nOn December 17, 2020, GCI Holdings received a Subpoena Duces Tecum from the FCC’s Office of the Inspector \nGeneral requiring production of documents from January 1, 2009 to the present related to a single RHC customer and related \ncontracts, information regarding GCI Holdings’ determination of rural rates for a single customer, and to provide information \nregarding persons with knowledge of pricing practices generally. \nOn April 21, 2021, representatives of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) informed GCI Holdings that a qui tam action \nhas been filed in the Western District of Washington arising from the subject matter under review by the Enforcement Bureau. \nThe DOJ is investigating whether GCI Holdings submitted false claims and/or statements in connection with GCI’s participation \nin the FCC’s RHC Program. On July 14, 2021, the DOJ issued a Civil Investigative Demand with regard to the qui tam action.  \nThe FCC’s Enforcement Bureau and GCI Holdings held discussions regarding GCI Holdings potential RHC Program \ncompliance issues related to certain of its contracts with its RHC customers for which GCI Holdings had previously recognized \nan estimated liability for a probable loss of approximately $12 million in 2019 for contracts that were deemed probable of not \ncomplying with the RHC Program rules.

GCI Holdings also identified certain contracts where additional loss was reasonably possible and such \nloss could range from zero to $30 million, which is a reduction of the reasonably possible loss range as previously disclosed in \nour December 31, 2021 Form 10-K given the settlement offer made during 2022. An accrual was not made for the amount of the \nreasonably possible loss in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. GCI Holdings could also be assessed fines and \npenalties but such amounts could not be reasonably estimated. \nThe DOJ and GCI Holdings held discussions regarding the qui tam action whereby the DOJ clarified that its investigation \nrelates to the years from 2010 through 2019 and alleged that GCI Holdings had submitted false claims under the RHC Program \nduring this time period. GCI Holdings continues to work with the DOJ related to this matter and has recorded a $14 million \nestimated settlement expense during the year ended December 31, 2022 to reflect discussions and settlement offers that GCI \nHoldings made to the DOJ during 2022. However, the Company is unable to assess the ultimate outcome of this action and is \nunable to reasonably estimate any range of additional possible loss beyond the $14 million estimated settlement liability, including \nany type of fine or penalty that may ultimately be assessed as permitted under the applicable law. \nSeparately, during the third quarter of 2022, GCI Holdings became aware of possible RHC Program compliance issues \nrelating to potential conflicts of interest identified in the historical competitive bidding process with respect to certain of its \ncontracts with its RHC customers. GCI Holdings notified the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau of the potential compliance issues; \nhowever, the Company is unable to assess the ultimate outcome of the potential compliance issues and is unable to reasonably \nestimate any range of loss or possible loss. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \nLiberty Broadband did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, except for those matters discussed above, that have, \nor are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, \ncapital expenditures or capital resources. \n(15) Segment Information  \nLiberty Broadband identifies its reportable segments as (A) those consolidated companies that represent 10% or more \nof its consolidated annual revenue, annual Adjusted OIBDA or total assets and (B) those equity method affiliates whose share of \nearnings or losses represent 10% or more of Liberty Broadband’s annual pre-tax earnings (losses). \nLiberty Broadband evaluates performance and makes decisions about allocating resources to its operating segments \nbased on financial measures such as revenue and Adjusted OIBDA. In addition, Liberty Broadband reviews nonfinancial \nmeasures such as subscriber growth. \nFor segment reporting purposes, Liberty Broadband defines Adjusted OIBDA as revenue less operating expenses and \nselling, general and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and transaction costs). Liberty Broadband \nbelieves this measure is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those \nitems that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this \nmeasure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses \nand identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes depreciation and amortization, stock based \ncompensation, transaction costs, separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges that are \nincluded in the measurement of operating income pursuant to GAAP. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in \naddition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net earnings, cash flow provided by operating activities and other \nmeasures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Liberty Broadband generally accounts for intersegment \nsales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties, that is, at current prices."
