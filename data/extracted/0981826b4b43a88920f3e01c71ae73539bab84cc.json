Business.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a clinical-stage, research and development biotechnology company focused on developing novel immunotherapy candidates for the \ntreatment of different forms of cancer. We have developed two versatile and enabling platform technologies for rational design of precision immune \nmodulatory drugs. Our lead clinical candidates, APVO436 and ALG.APV-527, and preclinical candidates, APVO603 and APVO711, were developed using \nour ADAPTIR™ modular protein technology platform. Our preclinical candidate APVO442 was developed using our ADAPTIR-FLEX™ modular protein \ntechnology platform.\n  \nOur ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms are designed to generate monospecific, bispecific, and multi-specific antibody candidates capable \nof enhancing the human immune system against cancer cells. ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX are both modular platforms, which gives us the flexibility \nto potentially generate immunotherapeutic candidates with a variety of mechanisms of action. This flexibility in design allows us to generate novel \ntherapeutic candidates that may provide effective strategies against difficult to treat, as well as advanced forms of cancer. We have successfully designed \nand constructed numerous investigational-stage product candidates based on our ADAPTIR platform. The ADAPTIR platform technology is designed to \ngenerate monospecific and bispecific immunotherapeutic proteins that specifically bind to one or more targets, for example, bispecific therapeutic \nmolecules, which may have structural and functional advantages over monoclonal antibodies. The structural differences of ADAPTIR molecules over \nmonoclonal antibodies allow for the development of ADAPTIR immunotherapeutics that are designed to engage immune effector cells and disease targets \nto produce signaling responses that modulate the immune system to kill tumor cells.\n  \nWe believe we are skilled at candidate generation, validation, and subsequent preclinical and clinical development using the ADAPTIR platform and \nthe ADAPTIR-FLEX platform to generate multi-specific candidates or other candidates to our platform capabilities.  We have developed a preclinical \ncandidate based on the ADAPTIR-FLEX platform which is advancing in our pipeline. We are developing our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX molecules \nusing our protein engineering, preclinical development, process development, and clinical development capabilities.\n1"

      "text": "STRATEGY\nWe seek to grow our business by, among other things: \nAdvancing our lead clinical stage candidate, APVO436, through clinical development to evaluate its therapeutic potential alone and in \ncombination with other therapies. Based on the positive results from our Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 \nclinical trial in the second half of 2023 to continue to assess efficacy of APVO436 in combination with Venetoclax and Azacitidine for the treatment of \nacute myelogenous leukemia (AML). \nAdvancing our solid tumor candidate, ALG.APV-527, developed in partnership with Alligator Bioscience AB (Alligator), further in the clinic. \nAptevo and Alligator continue to investigate ALG.APV-527 for the treatment of multiple 5T4-tumor expressing antigens in multiple solid tumor \nindications in a first-in-human Phase I clinical study that started in the first quarter of 2023. We are currently enrolling new patients. ALG.APV-527 targets \nthe 4-1BB co-stimulatory receptor (on T lymphocytes and NK cells) and 5T4 (solid tumor antigen) and is designed to promote anti-tumor immunity.\nContinued development and advancement our preclinical candidates, APVO603 (targeting 4-1BB (CD137) and OX40 (CD134), both members of \nthe TNF-receptor family), APVO442 (targeting Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), a tumor antigen that is highly expressed on prostate \ncancer cells and CD3), and APVO711 (an anti-PD-L1 x anti-CD40 compound). We continue advance APVO603 and APVO442 through preclinical and \nIND-enabling studies. In January 2023, we filed a provisional patent with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) pertaining to APVO711, with the\npotential to treat a range of solid malignancies such as head and neck cancer. APVO711 is a dual mechanism bispecific antibody candidate that is designed \nto provide synergistic stimulation of CD40 on antigen presenting cells while simultaneously blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway to potentially \npromote a robust anti-tumor response. Preclinical studies are planned to further evaluate the mechanism of action and efficacy of APVO711.\nDevelopment of novel bispecific and multi-specific proteins for the treatment of cancer using our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms. \nWe have expertise in molecular and cellular biology, immunology, oncology, pharmacology, translational sciences, antibody engineering and the \ndevelopment of protein therapeutics. This includes target validation, preclinical proof of concept, cell line development, protein purification, bioassay and \nprocess development and analytical characterization. We focus on product development using our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms. We plan to \ngenerate additional monospecific, bispecific, and multi-specific protein immunotherapies for development, potentially with other collaborative partners, to \nexploit the potential of the ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms. We will select novel candidates that have the potential to demonstrate proof of \nconcept early in development. We expect to continue to expand the ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX product pipelines to address areas of unmet medical \nneed. \nEstablishing collaborative partnerships to broaden our pipeline and provide funding for research and development. We intend to pursue \ncollaborations with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academia, and non-governmental organizations to advance our product portfolio. \nPLATFORM TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES \n \nCharacteristics\nTechnology\nADAPTIR\nADAPTIR-FLEX\nDrug Targeting\nBind up to two targets\nBind up to four targets\nGenetic and Structural Format\nSingle gene that assembles into a homodimer based on an \nantibody backbone\nTwo genes that assemble into a heterodimer based on a mutated \nantibody backbone\nHalf-life\nContains Immunoglobulin Gamma 1 Fc\nDemonstrated antibody-like half-life in mice\nEffector Function\nFc mutations may be utilized to eliminate binding to Fc Gamma Receptors or to enhance effector function\nManufacturing\nAntibody-like manufacturing processes\nCurrent Pipeline Candidates\nAPVO436 (CD123 x CD3)\nALG.APV-527 (41BB x 5T4)\nAPVO603 (41BB x OX40)\nAPVO711 (PD-L1 x CD40)\nAPVO442 (PSMA x CD3)\n \n2"

      "text": "Platform Technology \nADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX Platform Technologies. The ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technologies can be used to produce \nmonospecific, bispecific, and multi-specific immunotherapeutic proteins. These protein candidates bind to one or more targets on tumor cells, immune \ncells, or other cells in circulation to either amplify, suppress, or otherwise regulate the body’s defense mechanisms to treat cancer. We focus on developing \ndrugs for treatment of oncology indications, but also may pursue other indications, including inflammatory diseases. We believe we are well positioned for \nthe development of monospecific, bispecific, and multi-specific therapeutics, which are antibody-based molecules that can bind one or more targets of \ntherapeutic interest, utilizing our innovative ADAPTIR (modular protein technology) and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technologies. This allows us to take \nan innovative approach to cancer immunotherapy or treatment of other diseases.\nADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX molecules are similar to antibodies; they can exhibit similar therapeutic properties to an antibody but can be easily \nmodified to either eliminate or incorporate activities, while maintaining a similar size, stability, half-life and manufacturing advantages of a monoclonal \nantibody. The ADAPTIR molecules are single-chain polypeptides comprising customized elements, including a protein domain that binds to one or more \ntargets connected to the hinge domain and a set of antibody constant domains known as the fragment crystallizable region, or Fc region of a human \nantibody. A second protein binding domain can be connected to the Fc region using a linker.  The antibody Fc region can elicit an immune response by \nbinding to the corresponding Fc receptors found on various immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, and other cells bearing Fc receptors to mediate \nantibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity resulting in killing the target. With the ADAPTIR platform, the Fc region can be modified to enhance or eliminate \nthese functions. Incorporation of the Fc region into the ADAPTIR platform also provides for an extended serum half-life by engaging recycling via the\nneonatal Fc receptor or FcRn. A longer serum half-life could potentially reduce dosing frequency and dose quantity. The ADAPTIR-FLEX molecules are \ncomprised of at least two polypeptides that are comprised of customized elements similar to ADAPTIR candidates. The Fc region of these molecules can \nbe modified to enable formation of a stable heterodimer. These candidates have similar mutations in the Fc region as ADAPTIR candidates to enable or \neliminate binding to Fc receptors but retaining binding to FcRn to provide for an extended serum half-life.\n3"

We have created several bispecific molecules that are able to redirect T cell cytotoxicity (RTCC). T \ncells are white blood cells that fight infections and tumor cells. RTCC ADAPTIR molecules are designed to activate T cells to specifically kill  tumor cells. \nThe RTCC ADAPTIR does so by binding to a common T cell component CD3, a receptor complex that activates T cells, when engaging a specific tumor \nantigen on a specific tumor via the second binding domain, thereby activating the T cell to kill the tumor cell.\n4"

      "text": "Our ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technology extends advantages of ADAPTIR technology to create protein therapeutics with varied specificity and \nvalency and potentially new modes of action.\n \n \nADAPTIR-FLEX molecules are composed of two different polypeptides that form a hetero-dimer through modifying specific sequences in the Fc \nregion of each polypeptide. Each end of the polypeptide may contain one or two different binding domains, enabling the ADAPTIR-FLEX molecules to \nbind up to four targets. In addition, the ADAPTIR-FLEX platform can be used to modify the valency of binding to each target, which means it can bind a \ntarget, through one binding domain or through multiple binding domains, to a specific target to enable modifying the strength of binding to a specific target.  \nWe believe that ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX are promising platform technologies within the rapidly growing field of immuno-oncology \ntherapeutics. The structural differences between ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX molecules and monoclonal antibodies allow for the development of new \nimmunotherapeutics that engage disease targets in a novel manner and produce a unique signaling response. By customizing the binding domains of our \nmolecules, we can select the desired potency, half-life, toxicity and stability/manufacturability. We have the potential to develop products with mechanisms \nof action including, but not limited to, redirected T cell cytotoxicity (RTCC), modulating signals through immunostimulatory or immunoinhibitory \nreceptors and targeted cytokine delivery. We believe we can expand our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms to generate monospecifics, bispecifics, \nor multi-specifics that target tumor antigens in combination with co-stimulatory molecules, including TNF-Receptor family members and other activating \nor inhibitory signaling receptors. We believe the ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technologies may prove to have advantages over other \nimmunotherapeutics and other bispecific T cell engaging technologies. In preclinical studies, our data indicates that APVO436, a RTCC ADAPTIR \nbispecific that binds CD123, may have high potency and activity at low doses with reduced cytokine release compared to other bispecifics targeting the \nsame tumor antigen and CD3. The ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX monospecifics, bispecifics, and multi-specifics can be produced using standard \nmanufacturing practices. Further clinical and preclinical studies may not confirm the anticipated benefits of this platform.\nOur ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform intellectual property (IP) portfolio consists of IP that we solely own and control, with the exception \nof non-exclusive licenses to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines and related expression systems, and a non-exclusive license to certain transgenic \nrodents of Open Monoclonal Technology, Inc.’s (OMT) OmniAb platform, which we non-exclusively license from various third parties.

APVO436 is a bispecific ADAPTIR that is designed to engage CD3 and CD123 to redirect T-cells to destroy leukemia cells expressing \nthe target CD123 molecule on their surface. We have finished enrollment into a multi-center, multi-cohort Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate APVO436 in \nadult patients with AML both as monotherapy and in combination with current standard-of-care therapies (APVO436-5001). This antibody-like \nrecombinant protein therapeutic candidate is designed to engage both leukemia cells and T-cells of the immune system and activate T cells via CD3 only \nwhen engaging CD123 to trigger the destruction of leukemia cells as well as leukemic stem cells. Importantly, CD123 is not only expressed on the \nleukemic blast cells but is also expressed on leukemic stem cells. APVO436 has been engineered using our proprietary ADAPTIR platform technology and \nis uniquely designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). APVO436 has received orphan drug designation (\"orphan \nstatus\") for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \nIn Part 2 of APVO436-5001, which was the dose expansion part of this Phase 1b multi-center study, 5 cohorts of AML patients were planned to be \nenrolled to evaluate safety and efficacy. Cohorts included both monotherapy and combination therapy protocols. The dose expansion part of the trial \nevaluated the safety and tolerability of APVO436 when used as an adjunct to other therapies with MEC (Mitoxantrone, Etoposide, Cytarabine) or \nVenetoclax plus Azacitidine, and as a monotherapy, and to obtain a preliminary assessment of the anti-leukemia activity of APVO436 in both modalities. \nAptevo has concluded enrollment and presented preliminary data at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting on December 11, \n2022 for those cohorts where enrollment of patients occurred.\n6"

At the 64th annual ASH meeting, data from cohorts with enrollment were presented. \nFollowing the analysis of promising data in Cohort 2, Aptevo decided to conclude enrollment and move forward with a Phase 2 study and explore \nAPVO436 combination therapy with venetoclax and azacitidine in AML patients. The table below shows the originally planned Phase 1b cohort treatment \nparadigms.\n \nPatients received APVO436 by intravenous dosing for up to four 28-day cycles. The objective of the trial was to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, \nand pharmacodynamics of APVO436. Forty-four AML patients were enrolled in the dose expansion part of the study across three cohorts.\nThe Company observed positive clinical data from its Phase 1b trial and summarized the safety profile and efficacy data in a heavily pretreated \npopulation in the table below. APVO436 was generally well tolerated, with the highest response rate of 82% composite clinical remission (Composite CR) \nand 73% complete remission/complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi) observed in Cohort 2 in Venetoclax naïve patients,\nwhere we saw 91% clinical benefit.\nThe table below shows the patient response rate to APVO436 treatment as of February 21, 2023 for patients enrolled in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3:\n \n \nCohort 1\nCohort 2 \nCohort 2 (Venetoclax \nnaïve)\nCohort 3\nCohort Description\nAPVO436 + MEC\nAPVO436 + Ven/Aza\nAPVO436 + Ven/Aza\nAPVO436 only after CT \ninduction\nPatients enrolled, n\n18\n19\n12\n7\nPatients evaluable, n\n11\n16\n11\n4\nCR, n\n5\n5\n5\n0\nCRi, n\n0\n3\n3\n0\nMLFS, n\n1\n1\n1\n1\nSD, n\n3\n3\n1\n2\nCBR, %\n82\n75\n91\n75\nComposite CR, %\n55\n56\n82\n25\nCR/Cri %\n45\n50\n73\n0\nOverall, patients had a median age of 63.5 years (range 25–84).

      "text": "A potential complication associated with treatment using bispecific, T cell engaging antibodies is a systemic inflammatory syndrome known as \nCRS. CRS may occur within minutes to hours after infusion of the bispecific T cell engaging antibody or emerge as a delayed onset complication after \nseveral days. Clinical manifestations of CRS may range from mild to severe including hypotension, hypoxia, and uncontrolled systemic inflammatory \nresponse with circulatory collapse, vascular leakage, peripheral and/or pulmonary edema, renal failure, cardiac dysfunction, and fatal multiorgan system \nfailure.  Heart failure can also be a consequence of the systemic inflammatory syndrome of CRS. Another form of systemic inflammation a bispecific T cell \nengaging antibody can cause is Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) which shares many clinical and \nlaboratory features with CRS.  HLH/MAS is considered a form of CRS when it occurs after treatment with a bispecific T cell engaging antibody.  \nCRS cases occurred in some APVO436 patients in both the dose escalation as well as the dose expansion phases. These patients were effectively \ntreated using the generally recommended standard CRS treatment, which includes the use of tocilizumab and dexamethasone, combined with standard \nsupportive care. This has been confirmed to be generally effective in the APVO436 patients that have experienced CRS.\nOn November 26, 2019, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia to APVO436, which grants us \npotential exclusive marketing and development rights, as well as eligibility for market exclusivity upon FDA approval of APVO436.\nALG.APV-527. ALG.APV-527 is a novel investigational bispecific ADAPTIR candidate, developed in partnership with Alligator Bioscience AB \n(Alligator), featuring a mechanism of action designed to simultaneously target 4-1BB (CD137) and 5T4, a tumor antigen overexpressed in several different \ntypes of cancer. 4-1BB, a co-stimulatory receptor on T cells, is known to enhance the immune response to cancer through activation of tumor-specific T \ncells and is believed to be a promising target for new immunotherapeutic approaches. ALG.APV-527 could potentially have utility in the treatment of a \nbroad spectrum of cancers over-expressing the 5T4 tumor antigen, including malignant pleural mesothelioma, non-small cell lung, gastric/gastro-\nesophageal, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic, renal, ovarian, prostate, breast, cervical, colorectal, endometrial, and bladder cancers. \nAptevo and Alligator continue to advance ALG.APV-527 for the treatment of solid tumors and commenced a first-in-human study started in the first \nquarter of 2023. We continue to enroll new patients across the United States.\nAPVO603. APVO603 is a preclinical dual agonist bispecific ADAPTIR candidate designed to simultaneously target 4-1BB (CD137) and OX40 \n(CD134), both members of the TNF-receptor family.  Dual targeting of 4-1BB and OX40 provides synergistic co-stimulation of T cells with the potential to \namplify the cytotoxic function of activated T cells and NK cells, potentially leading to robust anti-tumor responses. APVO603’s combined activation of \nboth the 4-1BB and OX40 TNF receptors represents an attractive approach in potentially overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. \nThe targeted co-stimulation of 4-1BB and OX40 has the potential to promote an important immunological cascade, enhancing T cell activation, prolonging \nT cell survival, and improving tumor cell killing. Of note, this product candidate is not dependent on any one tumor antigen and has the potential to treat \nmultiple solid tumors. IND-enabling studies continue for APVO603.\nAPVO442. APVO442 is a novel bispecific candidate based on the ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technology that binds to PSMA with two identical \nbinding domains and with one binding domain to CD3 with reduced binding affinity. This candidate was designed to increase biodistribution of drugs to \nPSMA positive tumors for treatment of prostate cancer. The low-affinity single binding domain to CD3 has the potential to allow for increased \nconcentrations at the tumor due to reduced binding of the drug by circulating peripheral T cells.  Preclinical studies are being concluded and demonstrate in \nvitro RTCC that is directed to PSMA bearing tumor cell lines in vitro and in animal tumor models. IND-enabling studies are beginning.\nAPVO711. APVO711 is a preclinical dual mechanism bispecific ADAPTIR candidate that is designed to provide synergistic stimulation of CD40 on \nantigen presenting cells while simultaneously blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway to potentially promote a more robust anti-tumor response. \nPreclinical studies both in vitro and in vivo will continue to provide us a better understanding of the mechanism of action and the efficacy of APVO711.\n8"

      "text": "Competition \nWe face, and will continue to face, intense competition from both U.S.-based and foreign producers of both large and small molecule \nimmunotherapeutic products, some of which have lower cost structures, greater access to capital, greater resources for research and development, and \nsophisticated marketing capabilities. Any product candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize is likely to compete with currently marketed \nproducts, as well as other novel product candidates that are in development for the same indications. \nAPVO436: We anticipate that APVO436 would compete with other agents targeting both CD123 and non-CD123 that are in development if they are \nalso approved. Antibody therapies in development targeting CD123 include: MGD024 (Macrogenics & Gilead), and IMGN632 (ImmunoGen & Jazz). \nThere are numerous CAR-T therapies in development: CART123 (University of Penn.), CARTCD123 (NCI/City of Hope), UCART123 (Cellectis), MB-\n102 (Mustang Bio) and several others in development in China. Other competitive products targeting CD123 are: tagraxofusp (formerly SL-401, an \nantibody immunotoxin, Stemline), KHK2833 (monoclonal antibody, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Pharma), CSL362 (monoclonal antibody, CSL/Janssen), AVC-\n101 (VenCell Therapeutics), and IPH6101 (Innate Pharma).\nALG.APV-527:  This asset targets 4-1BB in a bispecific format when cross-linked with the tumor antigen 5T4.  We anticipate that ALG.APV-527 \nwould compete with bispecifics targeting 5T4 and 4-1BB, which are currently in preclinical development (Crescendo Biologics). Bispecific in the clinic \ntargeting 5T4 include GenMab and Abbvie’s (GEN1044), a 5T4 x CD3 DuoBody, in Phase 1/2 trials. In addition, other competitors include bispecifics \ntargeting 4-1BB in combination with other targets such as 4-1BB x FAP (FAP is expressed on tumor associated stromal fibroblasts).  4-1BB x FAP is \ncurrently in phase 1 clinical development by Molecular Partners and Amgen (AMG506) and Hoffmann-La Roche (RO7122290) for treatment of advanced \nsolid tumors. Another bispecific targets 4-1BB x HER (Cinrebafusp Alfa, PRS343) which is in phase 2 clinical development by Pieris for treatment of \nHER2+ solid tumors.\nFurthermore, we face significant competition in the oncology market in general, including from: AbbVie Inc., Affirmed, Amgen Inc., AnaptysBio, \nInc., Astellas Pharma Inc., Bayer AG, Biogen Idec Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Bristol Myers Squibb, F-Star Biotechnology Ltd., Genentech Inc.

Y-mAbs Therapeutics, Inc., and Zymeworks Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. \nAdditionally, there may be other potential competitors or companies developing competitive products that may not be known to us at this time.\nCOLLABORATIONS WITH ALLIGATOR BIOSCIENCE \nOn July 20, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary Aptevo Research and Development LLC (Aptevo R&D), entered into a collaboration and option \nagreement (the Collaboration Agreement) with Alligator Bioscience AB, (Alligator), pursuant to which Aptevo R&D and Alligator are collaboratively \ndeveloping ALG.APV-527, a lead bispecific antibody candidate simultaneously targeting 4-1BB (CD137), a member of the TNFR superfamily of a co-\nstimulatory receptor found on activated T cells, and 5T4 a tumor antigen overexpressed in a number of different types of cancer. This product candidate is \nbuilt on our novel ADAPTIR platform. A first-in-human clinical study of ALG.APV-527 started in the first quarter of 2023. We continue to enroll new \npatients across the United States. ALG.APV-527 targets 4-1BB (T lymphocyte co-stimulatory receptor) and 5TA (tumor antigen) and is designed to \nreactivate antigen-primed T cells.\nSubject to certain exceptions for Aptevo R&D’s manufacturing and platform technologies, the parties jointly own intellectual property generated in \nthe performance of the development activities under the Collaboration Agreement. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, the parties intend to \nshare revenue received from a third-party commercialization partner equally, or, if the development costs are not equally shared under the Collaboration \nAgreement, in proportion to the development costs borne by each party. \nThe Collaboration Agreement also contains several points in development at which either party may elect to “opt-out” (i.e., terminate without cause) \nand, following a termination notice period, cease paying development costs for this product candidate, which would be borne fully by the continuing party. \nFollowing an opt-out by a party, the continuing party will be granted exclusive rights to continue the development and commercialization of this product \n9"

We own or exclusively license the patents and patent applications in our patent portfolio that support the \nADAPTIR-FLEX platform, ADAPTIR platform and pipeline products with the exception of certain cell line rights and other research tools, which we \nlicense on a non-exclusive basis. We practice patent life cycle management by filing patent applications to protect new inventions relating to meaningful \nimprovements to our products and related methods. We primarily seek patent protection for inventions that support our products and product candidates, \nbut from time to time, we may seek patent protection for inventions that could, for instance, support a potential business opportunity or block a competitor \nfrom designing around our existing patents.\nIn general, and where possible, we pursue patent protection in countries where we believe there will be a significant market for the corresponding \nproduct or product candidate. We generally do not seek patent protection in countries where we have reason to believe we would not be able to enforce \npatents. For instance, we tend to not file in countries that are frequently listed on the Priority Watch List of the Special 301 Report prepared by the Office of \nthe United States Trade Representative, with the exception that we typically file patent applications in China, Russia and India. We may also decide to take \na narrower filing approach for secondary and improvement type inventions as compared to inventions that are more foundational to our products. We do \nnot seek patent protection in countries that are on the United Nations, or U.N., list of Least Developed Countries. \nThe term of protection for various patents associated with, and expected to be associated with, our marketed product and product candidates is \ntypically twenty years from the filing date, but may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the date of filing of the patent application or the date \nof patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. The protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-\nproduct basis and country-to-country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of \nregulatory-related extensions, the necessity for terminal disclaimers, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and \nenforceability of the patents. \nIn some cases, we may decide that the best way to protect our intellectual property is to retain proprietary information as trade secrets and \nconfidential information, rather than to apply for patents, which would involve disclosure of proprietary information to the public. When determining \nwhether to protect intellectual property as a trade secret, we consider many factors including, for instance, our ability to maintain the trade secret, the \nlikelihood that a competitor will independently develop the information, our ability to patent protect the intellectual property and the likelihood we would \nbe able to enforce a resulting patent. \nWe are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property. These \nagreements impose various commercial diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license \nagreements in the future. \nADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX Platforms. We protect the ADAPTIR platform technology through a combination of patents and trade secrets. We \nown all ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform intellectual property, with the exception that we have licenses to certain intellectual property related to \nthird party research tools that we use in conjunction with our ADAPTIR platform technology such as cell lines, vectors, expression systems, and transgenic \nrodents.  For instance, we have a non-exclusive commercial license and research license with Lonza Group AG (Lonza) related to its CHO cell lines and \nvectors. Under our Lonza research license, we have an option to take a license to use the GS System to develop and manufacture therapeutic proteins for \nour commercial purposes. We also have a non-exclusive license to certain transgenic rodents of OMT’s OmniAb platform.\n10"

      "text": "The initial version of the ADAPTIR platform technology was originally developed by Trubion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Trubion) prior to its \nacquisition by Emergent BioSolutions Inc (Emergent). A patent family supporting use of unique linkers in the homodimer (a molecule consisting of two \nidentical halves) version of the ADAPTIR platform was invented jointly by Trubion and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Wyeth) as part of a collaboration \nbetween the two companies. Wyeth assigned the rights it had in that platform patent family to Trubion. We subsequently received the rights to the platform\npatent family upon our spinoff from Emergent. \nIn order to differentiate our platform inventions from antibodies and other antibody-like constructs that have been publicly disclosed, many of our \npatents and patent applications are directed to unique aspects or components of our platform such as linkers, targets, or binding domains. \nWe have patents relating to the ADAPTIR platform issued in the United States, Australia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, \nPhilippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, and Vietnam. We also have applications pending in various territories including Brazil, Canada, \nand Norway. We plan to continue to improve our ADAPTIR platform and to file patent applications on those improvements. Our decision as to where to \nfile any new ADAPTIR improvement inventions will be based in part on the significance of the improvement. If patents issue on the pending ADAPTIR \npatent applications, the patent term for those patents are estimated to expire between 2027 and 2036.  As our ADAPTIR platform technology evolves, we \nmay decide to allow patent applications and patents to expire if they contain claims that are limited to aspects of the platform that are no longer of value to \nAptevo.  \nADAPTIR-FLEX, our heterodimer platform, is covered by patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) that we filed in 2021. The \nPCT patent application allows us to file patent applications in PCT member state countries including, for instance, the United States, Europe, Japan, China, \nAustralia, and Canada. If patents claiming priority to the pending ADAPTIR-FLEX patent application are issued, the resulting patents are estimated to \nexpire in 2041.\nWe own patent families directed to use of particular binding domains in the ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms.  For instance, we have \nsome patents that cover the use of an ADAPTIR therapeutic to target CD3.  We also have pending patent applications that cover ADAPTIR therapeutics \ncontaining our preferred humanized CD3 binding domain polypeptide sequences.   \nAPVO436. We nationalized our core patent family, which covers the APVO436 product candidate in various countries and territories including the \nU.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, \nPhilippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Ukraine, and Vietnam.\nALG.APV-527. We co-own with Alligator a patent family corresponding to PCT application PCT/EP2018/069850, which covers the ALG.APV-527 \nproduct candidate. In January and February of 2020, this patent family was nationalized in various countries. Aptevo and Alligator also co-own U.S. patent \n10,239,949, which relates to protein molecules that specifically bind to 5T4 and/or 4-1BB and U.S. patent 11,312,786, which relates to the 4-1BB binding \ndomain.  \nIn addition to the co-owned assets, Alligator owns a patent family corresponding to PCT application PCT/EP2017/059656, which also covers \nALG.APV-527. Aptevo has an exclusive license from Alligator to this patent family for the development of the ALG.APV-527 product candidate.\nPreclinical Therapeutic Candidates. We routinely file United States provisional patent applications and/or Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent \napplications on our preclinical therapeutic assets when we believe we have sufficient data to support a patent application filing.  Aptevo owns pending \npatent applications for its APVO603 therapeutic candidate, which was nationalized in various countries and territories, as well as APVO442 and APVO711 \ntherapeutic candidates.\nTrademarks owned by Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. and its subsidiaries. Where possible, we pursue registered trademarks for our marketed products \nin significant markets.

      "text": "REGULATION\nRegulations in the United States and other countries have a significant impact on our product development, manufacturing, and marketing activities. \nGovernment authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the \nresearch, development, testing, approval, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import, \nand export of biopharmaceutical products. In addition, sponsors of biopharmaceutical products participating in Medicaid and Medicare are required to \ncomply with mandatory price reporting, discount, and rebate requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in \nforeign countries, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In the \nUnited States, the FDA regulates biopharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Services Act, \nor PHSA, and their implementing regulations. FDA’s requirements and expectations with respect to product development are constantly evolving. \nU.S. Product Development for Therapeutics\nThe process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n•\ncompletion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP;\n•\nsubmission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may \nbegin;\n•\nperformance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and \nefficacy of the proposed drug or safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic, for the intended use;\n•\npreparation and submission to the FDA of biologics license application, or BLA;\n•\na determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;\n•\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are \nproduced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP;\n•\nreview of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;\n•\npayment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies);\n•\nFDA audits of some clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCP; and\n•\nFDA review and approval of the BLA.\n \nPreclinical Testing. Before beginning testing of any compounds with potential therapeutic value in human subjects in the United States, stringent \ngovernment requirements for preclinical data must be satisfied. Preclinical testing includes both in vitro, or in an artificial environment outside of a living \norganism, and in vivo, or within a living organism, laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation, as \nwell as its chemistry, pharmacology, and toxicity. We perform preclinical testing on all of our product candidates before we initiate any human trials.\nInvestigational New Drug Application. Before clinical testing may begin, the results of preclinical testing, together with manufacturing \ninformation, analytical data and any other available clinical data or literature, must be submitted to the FDA, as part of an IND. The sponsor must also \ninclude an initial protocol detailing the first phase of the proposed clinical investigation, together with information regarding the qualifications of the \nclinical investigators. The provided data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical \nstudies in human volunteers. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA imposes a clinical hold within that \n30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds \nalso may be imposed by \n12"

As a result, submission of an IND may not result in FDA \nauthorization to commence a clinical trial.\nClinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers, or to patients with the target disease or disorder \nunder the supervision of a qualified physician (also called an investigator) pursuant to an FDA-reviewed protocol. Human clinical trials typically are \nconducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the \nobjectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent \namendments, must be submitted to the FDA, as part of the IND, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\n•\nPhase 1 clinical trials test for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, bio-distribution, metabolism, excretion, structure activity relationships, \nmechanism of action, and clinical pharmacology and, if possible, for early evidence regarding efficacy. Phase 1 studies may be conducted in \nhealthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. Phase 1a is typically a dose escalation trial. Phase 1b may involve \ncohort expansion at one or more dose levels combinations, or in different populations to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose and \nstrategy.\n•\nPhase 2 clinical trials are controlled studies that involve a small sample of individuals with the target disease or disorder and seek to assess \nthe efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications to determine dose response and the optimal dose range and dose regimen and to \ngather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.\n•\nPhase 3 clinical trials are adequate and controlled studies that consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients, at geographically dispersed \nsites, with the target disease or disorder to obtain definitive statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the proposed product and dosing \nregimen. The safety and efficacy data generated from Phase 3 clinical trials typically form the basis for FDA or comparable foreign \nregulatory authority approval of the product candidate, as well as product labeling. Typically, two Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for \nproduct approval. Under some limited circumstances, however, the FDA may approve a BLA based upon a single Phase 3 clinical study plus \nconfirmatory evidence or a single large multicenter trial without confirmatory evidence.\n•\nPhase 4 clinical trials, if conducted, are conducted after a product has been approved. These trials can be conducted for a number of purposes, \nincluding to collect long-term safety information or to collect additional data about a specific population. As part of a product approval, the \nFDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require that certain Phase 4 studies, which are called post-marketing commitment \nstudies, be conducted post-approval.  The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm or refute the effectiveness of a product candidate, and can \nprovide important safety information.\nIn March 2022, the FDA released a final guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of \nOncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in \nearly stages of oncology drug development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial \ncalled an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. \nExpansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to drug development and reduce developmental costs and time.\nAdditional kinds of data may also help to support a BLA or product development, such as patient experience and real-world evidence.  For \nappropriate indications sought through supplemental BLAs, data summaries may provide marketing application support. For genetically targeted products \nand variant protein targeted products intended to address an unmet medical need in one or more patient subgroups with a serious or life threatening rare \ndisease or condition, the FDA may allow a sponsor to rely upon data and information previously developed by the sponsor or for which the sponsor has a \nright of reference, that was submitted previously to support an approved application for a product that incorporates or utilizes the same or similar \ngenetically targeted technology or a product that is the same or utilizes the same variant protein targeted drug as the product that is the subject of the \napplication.\n13"

The FDA \nmay grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biologic \nfor an indication for which orphan designation has been granted for the relevant indication except that PREA will apply to an original BLA for a new active \ningredient that is orphan-designated if the biologic is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a \nmolecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.\nGood Clinical Practice. All of the phases of clinical studies must be conducted in conformance with the FDA’s GCP or equivalent standards from \ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities, which are ethical and scientific quality standards for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure \nthat the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected. GCP include \nrequirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Investigators must also provide \ncertain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. In addition, an Institutional Review \nBoard, or IRB, at each study site participating in the clinical trial or a central IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, informed consent \nforms, and communications to study subjects before a study commences at that site. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals \nparticipating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, and whether the planned human subject protections are \nadequate. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any \namendments to the protocol must be submitted to FDA for review, and to the IRB for approval. If a product candidate is being investigated for multiple \nintended indications, separate INDs may also be required. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must also be submitted at least annually \nto the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious and unexpected suspected adverse events are observed or other significant safety information is \nfound, such as any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product. The sponsor \nmust submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must \nnotify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the \ninformation.\nInformation about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the \nNational Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website. Sponsors or distributors of investigational products for the \ndiagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding \nto requests for expanded access requests.\nThe manufacture of investigational biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice, or \ncGMP requirements. Investigational biologics and therapeutic substances imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA. \nFurther, the export of investigational products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. \nexport requirements under the FDCA.\nConcurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the \nchemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in \naccordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, \namong other things, manufacturers must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final product. Additionally, \nappropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo \nunacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\nThe FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the \nclinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may\nalso require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or if the trial poses \nan unexpected serious harm to subjects. The FDA or an IRB may also impose conditions on the conduct of a clinical trial. Clinical trial sponsors may also \nchoose to discontinue clinical trials as a result of risks to subjects, a lack of favorable results, or changing business priorities.\n14"

      "text": "Marketing Approval - Biologics\nBiologics License Application. All data obtained from a comprehensive development program, including research and product development, \nmanufacturing, preclinical and clinical trials, labeling and related information are submitted in a biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA and in \nsimilar regulatory filings with the corresponding agencies in other countries for review and approval. In most cases, the submission of a marketing \napplication is subject to a substantial application user fee. These user fees must be paid at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the \napplication is being submitted on a rolling basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances.  By example, product candidates that are \ndesignated as orphan products, which are further described below, are not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other \nthan the orphan indication.\nThe submission of an application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may refuse to \nfile the application and request additional information rather than accept the application for filing, in which case the application must be resubmitted with \nthe supplemental information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has two months to \nreview an application for its acceptability for filing. \nOnce an application is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.  The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, \nestablishes a two-tiered review system: Standard Review and Priority Review. When conducting Priority Review, the FDA has a goal to review and act on \nBLA submissions within six months from the date of the FDA’s acceptance for filing of the application, rather than the ten-month goal under a Standard \nReview. The FDA gives Priority Review status to product candidates that provide safe and effective therapies where no satisfactory alternative exists or to a \nproduct candidate that are intended to treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the \ntreatment, diagnosis, or prevention of the serious condition. The PDUFA date is only a goal, thus, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. The \nreview process and the PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the sponsor otherwise provides substantial additional information or \nclarification regarding the submission.\nThe FDA may refer certain applications to an advisory committee. Before approving a product candidate for which no active ingredient (including \nany ester or salt of active ingredients) has previously been approved by the FDA, the FDA must either refer that product candidate to an external advisory \ncommittee or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why the FDA did not refer the product candidate to an advisory committee. The FDA \nmay also refer other product candidates to an advisory committee if FDA believes that the advisory committee’s expertise would be beneficial. An advisory \ncommittee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, which review, evaluate, and make a recommendation as to whether the application \nshould be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such \nrecommendations carefully when making decisions.\nThe FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product candidate meets the agency’s approval standards and whether \nthe manufacturing methods and controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity. Before approving\na marketing application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection. \nThe FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and \nsubcontractors, are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. \nAdditionally, before approving a marketing application the FDA will inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP.\nIn reviewing a BLA, the FDA may grant approval or deny the application through a complete response letter, or CRL, if it determines the \napplication does not provide an adequate basis for approval requesting additional information. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is \ncomplete and the application is not ready for approval and describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified. A CRL generally contains a \nstatement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the marketing application, and may require additional clinical or \npreclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or \nmajor, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either: resubmit the marketing application, addressing all of the \ndeficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing.  Even if additional information outlined in a CRL is \nsubmitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. \n15"

      "text": "The receipt of regulatory approval often takes many years, involving the expenditure of substantial financial resources. The speed with which \napproval is granted often depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments and the \nrisks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA may also impose conditions upon approval. For example, it may require a Risk Evaluation and \nMitigation Strategy, or REMS, for a product. This can include various required elements, such as publication of a medication guide, patient package insert, \na communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks and/or restrictions on distribution and use, such as limitations on who may \nprescribe or dispense the drug. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the \nFDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks.\nThe FDA may also significantly limit the indications or populations approved for a given product, require that contraindications, warnings, or \nprecautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning,  and/or require, as a condition of approval, enhanced labeling, special \npackaging or labeling, post-approval clinical trials, distribution or other risk management mechanisms, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-\napproval of promotional materials or restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, any of which could negatively impact the commercial success of a \ndrug. The FDA may also not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing.\nAfter approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling \nclaims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. The FDA may also withdraw the product approval if compliance with the \npre- and post-marketing regulatory standards are not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. Further, should new safety \ninformation arise, additional testing, product labeling, or FDA notification may be required.\nDesignated Platform Technology. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, a platform technology incorporated within \nor utilized by a biologic is eligible for designation as a designated platform technology if (1) the platform technology is incorporated in, or utilized by, a \nproduct approved under a BLA; (2) preliminary evidence submitted by the sponsor of the approved or licensed product, or a sponsor that has been granted a \nright of reference to data submitted in the application for such product, demonstrates that the platform technology has the potential to be incorporated in, or \nutilized by, more than one product without an adverse effect on quality, manufacturing, or safety; and (3) data or information submitted by the applicable \nperson indicates that incorporation or utilization of the platform technology has a reasonable likelihood to bring significant efficiencies to the drug \ndevelopment or manufacturing process and to the review process. A sponsor may request the FDA to designate a platform technology as a designated \nplatform technology concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND application for a product that incorporates or utilizes the platform \ntechnology that is the subject of the request. If so designated, the FDA may expedite the development and review of any subsequent original BLA for a \nproduct that uses or incorporates the platform technology. Designated platform technology status does not ensure that a product will be developed or \nreviewed by the FDA more quickly or receive FDA approval. In addition, the FDA may revoke a designation if the FDA determines that a designated \nplatform technology no longer meets the criteria for such designation.\nBreakthrough Therapy. Under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, the FDA may designate \na product as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening \ndisease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one \nor more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Products designated as breakthrough \ntherapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. A sponsor may request that a product candidate be designated as a breakthrough therapy concurrently \nwith, or at any time after, the submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 \ndays of receipt of the sponsor’s request. If so designated, the FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, \nintended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. The FDA may rescind breakthrough therapy \ndesignation if the product candidate does not continue to meet the criteria for such designation.\n16"

      "text": "Orphan Drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, an applicant can request the FDA to designate a product as an “orphan drug” in the United States if the \ndrug is intended to treat an orphan, or rare, disease or condition. A disease or condition is considered orphan if it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the \nUnited States, or affecting more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making \nthe product available in the United States will be recovered from United States sales. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical \nsuperiority to obtain orphan drug designation if there is a product already approved by the FDA that that is considered by the FDA to be the same as the \nalready approved product and is intended for the same indication. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug \ndesignation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for special grant funding for research and \ndevelopment, potential tax credits for research, waived user fees for marketing applications and a seven-year period of market exclusivity after marketing \napproval. The tax advantages, however, were limited in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \nOrphan drug exclusivity (afforded to the first applicant to receive approval for an orphan designated drug) prevents FDA approval of applications by \nothers for the same drug for the designated orphan disease or condition. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another applicant if the FDA \ndetermines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the \nholder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public’s need. A grant of an orphan \ndesignation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved. On November 26, 2019 FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to APVO436, a bispecific \nantibody candidate, for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. APVO436 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with \nAML and MDS.\nPost-Approval Requirements. Any biologic for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, \namong other things, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, reporting of deviations and shortages, providing the FDA with updated \nsafety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, cGMP, and restrictions on advertising and promotion. Adverse events that \nare reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product’s distribution or use and, potentially, withdrawal or \nsuspension of the product from the market. In addition, the FDA authority to require post-approval clinical trials and/or safety labeling changes if \nwarranted. In certain circumstances, the FDA may impose a REMS after a product has been approved. \nFacilities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain \nstate agencies, list their manufactured products, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other \nlaws. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing \nrequirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for \ndistribution in the United States. Recently, the information that must be submitted to FDA regarding manufactured products was expanded through the \nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act to include the volume of drugs produced during the prior year.  Manufacturers must \ncontinue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMP. Regulatory authorities may \nwithdraw product approvals, require label modifications, or request product recalls, among other actions, if a company fails to comply with regulatory \nstandards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.\n17"

      "text": "The FDA also closely monitors advertising and promotional materials we may disseminate for our products for compliance with restrictions on off-\nlabel promotion and other laws. We may not promote our products for conditions of use that are not included in the approved package inserts for our \nproducts. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, however, may prescribe legally available products for unapproved indications \nthat are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Certain additional restrictions on advertising and \npromotion exist for products that have boxed warnings in their approved package inserts.  The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and \nregulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to \nsignificant liability, including, but not limited to, criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal\nhealthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and \nrefusal of orders under existing government contracts.\nBiosimilars and Exclusivity. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway for \nbiological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to \nreference a prior FDA-approved product requires a high similarity to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive \ncomponents, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. \nBiosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical trial, absent a waiver by the FDA. There must be no \ndifference between the reference product and a biosimilar in mechanism of action, conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength. A \nbiosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to \nproduce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be \nswitched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference \nbiologic.\nA reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four \nyears from the date of licensure. However, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, \nmanufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the twelve-year exclusivity period. The first biologic product \nsubmitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product is eligible for a period of exclusivity \nagainst other biologics submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is \ninterchangeable with the same reference product for any condition of use. The FDA may approve multiple “first” interchangeable products so long as they \nare all approved on the same first day of marketing. This exclusivity period, which may be shared amongst multiple first interchangeable products, lasts for \nthe lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution \nin the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologic’s patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been \napproved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. The PHSA also includes provisions to protect reference products that have patent protection. \nThe biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may exchange certain patent and product information for the purpose of determining whether \nthere should be a legal patent challenge. Based on the outcome of negotiations surrounding the exchanged information, the reference product sponsor may \nbring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings against the biosimilar product sponsor. The biosimilar applicant may also be able to bring an \naction for declaratory judgment concerning the patent. \nIn an effort to increase competition in the biologic product marketplace, Congress, the executive branch, and  the FDA have taken certain legislative \nand regulatory steps. For example, in 2020, FDA finalized a guidance to facilitate drug and biologic product importation. Moreover, the 2020 Further \nConsolidated Appropriations Act included provisions requiring that sponsors of approved biologic products, including those subject to REMS, provide \nsamples of the approved products to persons developing biosimilar products within specified timeframes, in sufficient quantities, and on commercially \nreasonable market-based terms. Failure to do so can subject the approved product sponsor to civil actions, penalties, and responsibility for attorney’s fees \nand costs of the civil action. This same bill also includes provisions with respect to shared and separate REMS programs for reference and generic drug \nproducts.\nPatent Term Restoration.  If approved, biologic products may also be eligible for periods of U.S. patent term restoration. If granted, patent term \nrestoration extends the patent life of a single unexpired patent, that has not previously been extended, for a maximum of five years. The total patent life of \nthe product with the extension also cannot exceed fourteen years from the product’ approval date. Subject to the prior limitations, the period of the \n18"

This period may also be reduced by any time that the applicant did not act with due \ndiligence.\n \nRegulation in the European Union. Product development, the regulatory approval process and safety monitoring of medicinal products and their \nmanufacturers in the European Union proceed broadly in the same way as they do in the United States. Therefore, many of the issues discussed above \napply similarly in the context of the European Union. In addition, drugs are subject to the extensive price and reimbursement regulations of the various EU \nmember states. The Clinical Trial Regulation EU 536/2014 (CTR) repealed the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, as amended (CTD) on January 31, \n2022, subject to a three-year transition period. The CTR makes it possible within the EU for sponsors to submit a single harmonized electronic submission \nvia a single online platform known as the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) for approval to conduct a clinical trial in several European countries \nand have a single assessment process for clinical trials conducted in multiple member states. Under the CTR, sponsors can use the CTIS from January 31, \n2022 but are not obliged to use it immediately, in line with a three-year transition period.  Sponsors may use CTIS to apply to conduct a clinical trial under \nthe CTR or may choose to apply to conduct a trial under the CTD until January 30, 2023.  From January 31, 2023, sponsors will need to use CTIS to apply \nto start a new clinical trial in the EU/EEA.  From January 31, 2025, any trials approved under the CTD that continue running will need to comply with the \nCTR and their sponsors must have recorded information on such trials in CTIS.\nHealthcare Fraud and Abuse and Anti-Corruption Laws\nVarious federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse” exist, including state and federal anti-kickback laws false claims laws, and \npatent privacy and security laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a drug manufacturer to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any \nremuneration in exchange for, to induce, or in return for, the referral of business that may be reimbursed by a third party payor (including Medicare and \nMedicaid), including the purchase, prescribing or recommendation of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions, it is possible that our \npractices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Civil and criminal false claims laws, false statement laws and civil monetary penalty \nlaws prohibit, among other things, anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to third-party payors (including Medicare \nand Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for \nmedically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. \nPrivacy and security laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, create federal criminal and civil liability for \nexecuting a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making \nany materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Additionally, HIPAA, as amended by \nthe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose certain \nrequirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. \nIn addition, as part of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Manufacturers of drugs \nbiologics and devices that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to annually report to CMS \npayments and transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, \nand ownership or investment interest held by physicians and their family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include \ntransfers of value made to certain non-physician providers (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse \nanesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified-nurse midwives).\nOur operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals \nfrom directly or indirectly paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official or employee, or any \nforeign political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence such official, employee, party or candidate \nin his or her or its official capacity. Our operations are also subject to compliance with the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which applies to activities both in the \npublic and private sector, Canada’s Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and similar laws and industry codes in other countries where we do business.\n19"

Risk Factors. \nWe are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, \nincluding by causing our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties that \nare not currently known to the Company or management or that are not currently believed by the Company or management to be material may also harm \nthe Company’s business, financial condition and results of operation. You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual \nReport on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our common stock. \nRISK FACTOR SUMMARY\nThe following is a summary of the material risks to our business, operations, and ownership of our common stock:\n•\nWe have a history of losses and may not be profitable in the future. \n•\nWe will require additional capital and may be unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms. \n•\nOur success is dependent on our continued ability to attract, motivate and retain key personnel, and any failure to attract or retain key \npersonnel may negatively affect our business.\n•\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the commencement, site initiation, enrollment of patients or completion of our clinical trials, the \ntime to reach critical trial data and receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed.\n•\nOur long-term success depends, in part, upon our ability to develop, receive regulatory approval for and commercialize our product \ncandidates. \n•\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining collaborations that leverage our capabilities in pursuit of developing and \ncommercializing our product candidates.\n•\nWe face and will continue to face substantial competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant \nmarket penetration for our product candidates, if approved.\n•\nOur business is affected by macroeconomic conditions, including rising and fluctuating inflation, interest rates, market volatility, economic \nuncertainty, and supply chain constraints.\n•\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use and further develop our ADAPTIR or ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms.\n•\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual proprietary rights, our business could be harmed.\n•\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the identification of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, could adversely impact our business, \nincluding our clinical trials.\n•\nActions of activist stockholders against us have been and could be disruptive and costly and may cause uncertainty about the strategic \ndirection of our business.\n•\nOur future cash flow will depend, in part, on the ability of Pfizer to successfully sell RUXIENCE and our receipt of milestone payments from \nHCR in connection therewith. If Pfizer is unable, or does not devote sufficient resources, to maintain or continue increasing sales of \nRUXIENCE, or if HCR does not comply with the Royalty Purchase Agreement, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\n•\nThe results of our current and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or non-U.S. \nregulatory authorities. Results from early-preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of results from later-stage or other trials \nand interim or top line data may be subject to change or qualification based on the complete analysis of data.\n•\nSerious adverse events, undesirable side effects or other unexpected properties of our product candidates may be identified that could delay, \nprevent, or cause the withdrawal of regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences \nfollowing marketing approval.\n23"

If these third parties do not effectively carry out their contractual \nduties, comply with regulatory requirements or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or\ncommercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\n•\nOur stock price may be volatile.\n•\nOur common stock may be at risk for delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market in the future if we do not maintain compliance with Nasdaq’s \ncontinued listing requirements. Delisting could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock \ncould decrease.\n•\nWe may be subject to periodic litigation, which could result in losses or unexpected expenditure of time and resources. \n•\nOur future income will depend, in part, on the ability of Medexus to successfully further develop, market and commercialize IXINITY, \nresulting in milestone payments and deferred payments to the Company by Medexus. \nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nFinancial Risks\nWe have a history of losses and may not be profitable in the future. \nWe have experienced significant operating losses in the past and may not be profitable in the future. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had \nnet income of $8.0 million compared to $28.5 million net loss for the same period in 2021. The net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was due \nto a one-time $37.2 million gain recognized as a result of Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR. As of December 31, 2022, we had an \naccumulated deficit of $206.0 million. We expect to continue to incur annual net operating losses for the foreseeable future, and will require substantial \nresources over the next several years as we expand our efforts to discover, develop and commercialize immunotherapeutic candidates. While we believe \nour existing cash and cash equivalents and the funding provided by our IXINITY deferred payment streams, the ability to receive Milestone Amounts \nunder the Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR, access to credit under the Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial, our ability to issue securities under \nthe Equity Distribution Agreement with Piper Sandler and our Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park Capital, and exercises of warrants will provide us \nwith sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements through at least the next twelve months, our future success and ability to attain profitability will \ndepend upon our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe will require additional capital and may be unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms. \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in the amount of $22.6 million. We will require additional funding to \ngrow our business including to support the ongoing clinical development of APVO436, develop additional products, support commercial marketing \nactivities or otherwise provide additional financial flexibility. If we are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we may need to make reductions in \nspending. This may include extending payment terms with suppliers, liquidating assets, and suspending or curtailing planned programs. We may also have \nto delay, reduce the scope of, suspend or eliminate one or more research and development programs. We may also be forced to grant rights to develop and \nmarket our product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop or market ourselves or we may be unable to take advantage of future business \nopportunities. A failure to raise the additional funding or to effectively implement cost reductions could harm our business, results of operations and future \nprospects. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: \n•\nthe level, timing and receipt of any milestone or deferred payments under our agreement with Medexus with respect to the sales of IXINITY;\n•\nwhether and to what extent future milestone payments are received under our Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR; \n•\nthe extent to which we invest in products or technologies; \n•\nthe ability to satisfy the payment obligations and covenants under any future indebtedness;\n24"

If our capital \nresources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our cash needs through bank loans, public or private equity or \ndebt offerings, collaboration and licensing arrangements, or other strategic transactions. Our ability to raise future capital on acceptable terms or at all will \nbe impacted by the macroeconomic environment, including rising and fluctuating interest rates, economic uncertainty and volatility in the capital market, \ngeopolitical tensions, including the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, or other factors could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as\nand when needed or increase our costs in order to raise capital. Current capital market conditions, including the impact of inflation, have increased \nborrowing rates and can be expected to significantly increase our cost of capital as compared to prior periods. Future issuances of common stock may \ninclude, but not be limited to, (i) any sale of up to $50.0 million worth of shares of our common stock pursuant to our Equity Distribution Agreement with \nPiper Sandler, (ii) any sale of up to $35 million worth of shares of our common stock to issue from our Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park, (iii) the \nissuance of up to 350,589 remaining outstanding shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants issued in connection with our March 2019 public \noffering of common stock and warrants or (iv) the issuance of common stock in a firm commitment offering or private placement. Public or bank debt \nfinancing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional \ndebt, making capital expenditures, pursuing acquisition opportunities, declaring dividends, our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights \nand other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our \nstockholders will experience dilution. If we raise funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties or enter into other strategic \ntransactions, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable \nto us. If financing is unavailable or lost, our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial prospects would be adversely affected and we\ncould be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate many of our planned activities.\nFurther, SEC regulations limit the amount of funds we can raise during any 12-month period pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-\n3. On March 29, 2022, we filed an amendment to the prospectus related to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed on December 14, 2020 pursuant to \nGeneral Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 (General Instruction I.B.6), which updates the amount of shares that we are eligible to sell under the Equity \nDistribution Agreement.

The limitations of \nGeneral Instruction I.B.6 do not apply to sales of our shares under our Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park Financial LLC as those sales were \ncommitted prior to us being subject to the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6. If we are required to file a new registration statement on another form, \nwe may incur additional costs and be subject to delays in raising capital due to review by SEC staff.\nOur business is affected by macroeconomic conditions, including rising and fluctuating inflation, interest rates, market volatility, economic \nuncertainty, and supply chain constraints.  \nVarious macroeconomic factors have in the past and could adversely affect in the future our business and the results of our operations and financial \ncondition, including changes in inflation, interest rates and overall economic \n25"

For instance, inflation has \nnegatively impacted the Company by increasing our labor costs, through higher wages and higher interest rates, and operating costs. Supply chain \nconstraints have led to higher inflation, which if sustained could have a negative impact on the Company's product development and operations. If inflation \nor other factors were to significantly increase our business costs, our ability to develop our current pipeline and new therapeutic products may be negatively \naffected. Interest rates, the liquidity of the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the operation of our business and our \nability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all, in order to fund our operations. \nWe are susceptible to changes in the U.S. economy.  The U.S. economy has been affected from time to time by economic downturns or recessions, \nsupply chain constraints, rising and fluctuating inflation and interest rates, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in \ncredit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. For example, on March 10 and March 12, \n2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) took control and was appointed receiver of Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) and Signature Bank, \nrespectively, after each bank was unable to continue their operations. These events exposed vulnerabilities in the banking sector, including legal \nuncertainties, significant volatility and contagion risk, and caused market prices of regional bank stocks to plummet. As of the date of this filing, we don’t \nhave any exposure to SVB and Signature Bank, however, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of the impacts of these evolving circumstances at \nthis time. If, for example, other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions \naffecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments may be threatened. While it is \nnot possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact that the failure of SVB and Signature Bank or the high market volatility and instability of the \nbanking sector could have on economic activity and our business in particular, the failure of other banks and financial institutions and the measures taken \nby governments, businesses and other organizations in response to these events could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of \noperations.\nIn addition, any further deterioration in the U.S. economy would likely affect the operation of our business and ability to raise capital.  In addition, \nU.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of additional credit-rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a recession \nin the United States. Although U.S. lawmakers passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling on multiple occasions, ratings agencies have lowered or \nthreatened to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States. The impact of this or any further downgrades to the U.S. government’s \nsovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions. Similarly, \nthese macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers to manufacture clinical trial materials for our product \ncandidates.\nActions of activist stockholders against us have been and could be disruptive and costly and may cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our \nbusiness.\nStockholders have in the past and may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to \neffect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management. For example, on February 9, 2021, Tang Capital Partners LP, Tang Capital \nManagement, LLC and Kevin Tang (collectively, “Tang”) submitted an advisory stockholder proposal for consideration at our 2021 annual meeting of \nstockholders to commence a process to sell Aptevo to the highest bidder. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction or seek \nchanges in the composition of our board of directors or management could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A proxy \ncontest would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require \nsignificant time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy. Any perceived \nuncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior \nmanagement team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may result in\nthe loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives, or limit our ability to attract and retain qualified\npersonnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If individuals are ultimately elected to our board of \ndirectors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our \nstockholders. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of a proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which \nwould serve as a further distraction to our board of directors and management and would require us to incur \n26"

In addition, actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary \nor speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nOur future income will depend, in part, on the ability of Medexus to successfully further develop, market and commercialize IXINITY, resulting in \nmilestone payments and deferred payments to the Company by Medexus.\nOn February 28, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Medexus, pursuant to which we sold all of the issued and outstanding limited \nliability company interests of Aptevo BioTherapeutics, a subsidiary of Aptevo that wholly owns the IXINITY and related Hemophilia B business. We are \nentitled to receive future potential payments to the extent of the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones and through deferred \npayments based on net sales of IXINITY. Royalties were earned at the rate of 2% of net revenue through June 2022. As of June 30, 2022, the royalty rate \non net revenue of IXINITY increased to 5%. We no longer control the development, marketing, and commercialization of IXINITY and are dependent on \nMedexus to successfully do so.  Although Medexus has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize IXINITY in the ordinary course of \nbusiness in good faith, Medexus may not commit adequate resources to the further development, marketing, and commercialization of IXINITY, may \nexperience financial difficulties, may face competition, or may prioritize other products or initiatives.  Medexus’ ability to continue to successfully \ncommercialize the IXINITY business may be affected, and we may experience potential impacts on our future deferred payments from Medexus due to the \nmacroeconomic environment and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The failure of Medexus to successfully market and commercialize IXINITY, including \nbecause of factors outside of Medexus’ control, could result in lower than expected milestone or deferred payments to us and negatively impact our future \nfinancial and operating results.\nOur operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate.  \nOur operating results are difficult to predict and will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, as a result of a variety of factors, \nincluding:\n•\nthe level and timing of any milestone or deferred payments with respect to sales of IXINITY by Medexus;\n•\nwhether and to what extent future milestone payments are received under our Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR; \n•\nthe extent of any payments received from collaboration arrangements and development funding as well as the achievement of development \nand clinical milestones under collaboration and license agreements that we may enter into from time to time and that may vary significantly \nfrom quarter to quarter; and,\n•\nthe timing, cost, and level of investment in our research and development and clinical activities as well as expenditures we will or may incur \nto acquire or develop additional technologies, products and product candidates.\nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic environment, we may experience delays in opportunities to partner our product \ncandidates, due to financial and other impacts on potential partners. Additionally, we may experience potential impacts on our future milestone or deferred \npayments from Medexus, which may impact Medexus’ ability to continue to successfully commercialize the IXINITY businesses. These and other factors \nmay have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nOur future cash flow will depend, in part, on the ability of Pfizer to successfully sell RUXIENCE and our receipt of milestone payments from HCR in \nconnection therewith. If Pfizer is unable, or does not devote sufficient resources, to maintain or continue increasing sales of RUXIENCE, or if HCR \ndoes not comply with the Royalty Purchase Agreement, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOn June 25, 2020, we announced that we were entitled to royalty payments from Pfizer related to sales of a rituximab biosimilar product, \nRUXIENCE (Rituximab-pvvr), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2019 and launched by Pfizer in the United States \nand Japan in early 2020, and the European Union in the third quarter of 2020. The payments from Pfizer relate to a Collaboration and License Agreement \nacquired by us as part of our spin-off from Emergent in 2016, which applies a fixed royalty rate of 2.5% on global net sales of RUXIENCE. The agreement \nwas originally executed by Trubion Pharmaceuticals (which was subsequently acquired by Emergent) and Wyeth (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer). \n27"

Under the terms of the Royalty Purchase Agreement, \nwe received $35 million at closing and we were eligible to receive additional payments in aggregate of up to an additional $32.5 million based on the \nachievement of sales milestones in 2021, 2022 and 2023. The Company received the 2021 milestone payments in the collective amount of $10 million on \nMarch 8, 2022. The proceeds from these milestone payments, net of transaction costs, were recorded as an additional liability related to the sale of royalties \non the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022. In order to non-dilutively address a Nasdaq listing compliance matter, on June 7, 2022, we entered \ninto and closed an amendment to the Royalty Purchase Agreement (the Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement), pursuant to which we agreed to \nforego our right to receive 50% of incremental RUXIENCE royalty revenue after HCR received aggregate royalty payments totaling 190% of the \nInvestment Amount plus Milestone Amounts to the extent paid by HCR. We received 2022 milestone payment of $2.5 million on February 28, 2023. The \nproceed from 2022 milestone payment was recorded as other income in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. \nThe Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement continues to include the opportunity receive additional milestone payment of $10 million based on \nachievement of sales milestones in 2023.\nWe have no control over the sales of RUXIENCE and are therefore dependent on the efforts and ability of Pfizer to generate net sales of \nRUXIENCE sufficient for us to receive Milestone Payments under the Royalty Purchase Agreement.  The failure of Pfizer to successfully generate such net \nsales could negatively impact our future financial and operating results and our results of operations could therefore be adversely affected. Additionally, \neven if Pfizer is able to generate net sales of RUXIENCE sufficient for us to receive such milestone payments, if HCR breaches the Royalty Purchase \nAgreement (for example, by not making required payments when due, or at all), disputes or litigation may arise. Such disputes or litigation could be time-\nconsuming and expensive and could adversely affect our business.\nWe face product liability exposure, which could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and negatively affect our business, financial condition, and \nresults of operations. \nThe nature of our business exposes us to potential liability inherent in pharmaceutical products, including with respect to the testing of our product \ncandidates in clinical trials and any product candidates that we successfully develop. Product liability claims might be made by patients in clinical trials, \nconsumers, health care providers or pharmaceutical companies or others that sell any products that we successfully develop. These claims may be made \neven with respect to those products that are manufactured in licensed and regulated facilities or otherwise receive regulatory approval for study or \ncommercial sale. We cannot predict the frequency, outcome or cost to defend any such claims. \nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against future claims that our product candidates caused injuries, we may incur substantial liabilities. \nRegardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in: \n•\nadverse publicity and/or injury to our reputation; \n•\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants; \n•\ncosts to defend the related litigation; \n•\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; \n•\ndecreased demand or withdrawal of an approved product; \n•\nloss of revenue; and \n•\nan inability to commercialize products that we may develop. \n28"

Claims or losses in excess of our product liability insurance coverage could have a material \nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The cost of defending any product liability litigation or other proceeding, even \nif resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of product liability litigation or other proceedings \ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Product liability claims, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may \nabsorb significant management time and result in reputational harm, potential loss of revenue from decreased demand for any product candidates we \nsuccessfully develop, withdrawal of clinical trial participants and potential termination of clinical trial sites or entire clinical programs, and could cause our \nstock price to fall. \nOur success is dependent on our continued ability to attract, motivate and retain key personnel, and any failure to attract or retain key personnel may \nnegatively affect our business. \nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business, our ability to develop products and to compete with our current and future competitors \nlargely depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified managerial and key scientific and technical personnel. If we are unable to \nretain the services of one or more of the principal members of senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Marvin L. White, our Chief \nOperating Officer, Jeffrey G. Lamothe, our Chief Financial Officer, Daphne Taylor, our General Counsel, SoYoung Kwon, or other key employees, our \nability to implement our business strategy could be materially harmed. We face intense competition for qualified employees from biotechnology and \npharmaceutical companies, research organizations and academic institutions. Moreover, we have experienced increased levels of attrition. Attracting, \nretaining or replacing these personnel on acceptable terms may be difficult and time-consuming given the high demand in our industry for similar \npersonnel. We believe part of being able to attract, motivate and retain personnel is our ability to offer a competitive compensation package, including \nequity incentive awards. If we cannot offer a competitive compensation package or otherwise attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the \ncontinued development of our business, we may not be able to maintain our operations or grow our business. \nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the identification of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, could adversely impact our business, including \nour clinical trials.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe global economic and societal disruptions and uncertainties, and we have experienced disruptions that \nhave impacted our business and clinical trials. Although nearly all of the restrictions placed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have been lifted and \nCOVID-19 vaccines are available, we may continue to experience disruptions in the future, or additional disruptions that could severely impact our \nbusiness, such as delays or difficulties to the financing environment and raising capital due to economic uncertainty or volatility; supply constraints; delays \nin opportunities to partner our product candidates, due to financial and other impacts on potential partners; diversion of healthcare resources away from the \nconduct of clinical trials; potential impacts on our future deferred payments and milestones from Medexus due to the environment which may impact \nMedexus’ ability to continue to successfully commercialize the IXINITY business or Pfizer to successfully commercialize RUXIENCE; and negative \nimpacts on suppliers and licensees.\nThe extent to which the direct and indirect effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business and clinical trials will depend on \nfuture developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.  For example, new variants may emerge and may result in the \nneed to delay initiation of trial sites, suspend enrollment into studies, patient withdrawals, postponement of preclinical studies, study modification, \nsuspension, or termination, the introduction of remote study procedures and modified informed consent procedures, study site changes, direct delivery of \ninvestigational products to patient homes requiring state licensing, study deviations or noncompliance, and changes or delays in site monitoring.

Third party manufacturers may also need to implement measures and \nchanges, or deviate from typical requirements, pandemic that may otherwise adversely impact our supply chains or the quality of the resulting products or \nsupplies.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may result in changes in laws, policies, and regulations.  By example, due to the potential impact of the COVID-\n19 pandemic FDA issued guidance several times concerning how sponsors and investigators may address these challenges.  FDA’s guidance is continually \nevolving.  This and any future changes in law may require that we change our internal processes and procedures to ensure continued compliance.\nThe terms of our credit agreement may restrict the operation of our business and limit the cash available for investment in our business operations.\nIn August 2020, we entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement), by and among us and certain of our subsidiaries as \nborrowers, MidCap Financial, as agent, and the lenders from time-to-time party thereto. The terms of the Credit Agreement and borrowings we may make \nunder the Credit Agreement in the future, could have significant adverse consequences for our business, including:\n•\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to payment on our debt, which would reduce the amounts \navailable to fund other corporate initiatives;\n•\nincreasing the amount of interest that we have to pay on borrowings under the Credit Agreement if market rates of interest increase;\n•\nrequiring compliance with restrictive covenants restricting, among other things, certain indebtedness, liens, dividends and other distributions, \nrepayment of subordinated indebtedness, mergers, dispositions, investments, acquisitions, transactions with affiliates and modification of \norganizational documents or certain other agreements, subject to certain exceptions;\n•\nrequiring compliance with affirmative covenants including payment and reporting covenants; and\n•\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt, better debt servicing options or stronger debt \nservicing capacity.\nWe may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain additional financing to pay the amounts due under the Credit Agreement. In addition, failure \nto comply with the covenants under the Credit Agreement, including those outside of our control, could result in an event of default. An event of default \ncould result in the acceleration of amounts due under the Credit Agreement, and we may not be able to obtain additional financing to make any accelerated \npayments. Under these circumstances, our lenders could seek to enforce security interests in our assets securing our indebtedness, including our intellectual \nproperty.\nWe completed a Section 382 study and have concluded that we experienced an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the U.S. Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and thus the tax benefits of our pre-“ownership change” net operating loss carryforwards and certain \nother tax attributes will be subject to an annual limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code.  \nIn general, a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” under Section 382 of the Code if, among other things, the stockholders who own, \ndirectly or indirectly, 5% or more of the corporation’s stock (by value), or are otherwise treated as “5% stockholders” under Section 382 of the Code and \nthe Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, increase their aggregate percentage ownership (by value) of the corporation’s stock by more than 50 \npercentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by the 5% stockholders at any time during the applicable testing period, which is generally the \nrolling three-year period preceding the date of the potential ownership change testing event. Such potential ownership change testing events include \nchanges involving a stockholder becoming a 5% stockholder or arising from a new issuance of capital stock or share repurchases by the corporation, \nsubject to certain exceptions.\nIn the event of an “ownership change,” Sections 382 and 383 of the Code impose an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a \ncorporation may offset with pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and certain other \n30"

The annual limitation is generally equal to the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation immediately before the ownership change \n(excluding certain capital contributions), multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate as published by the IRS for the month in which the ownership change \noccurs (the long-term tax-exempt rate for November 2020 is 0.89%). Any unused annual limitation may generally be carried over to subsequent years until \nthe pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes expire or are fully utilized by the corporation. Similar provisions \nof state tax law may also apply to limit the use of state net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes.\nAdditionally, Section 382 of the Code includes special rules that apply to a corporation with a significant amount of net unrealized built-in gains or \nnet unrealized built-in losses in its assets immediately prior to ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. In general, certain built-in gains \nrecognized during the five-year period beginning on the date of the ownership change increases the corporation’s annual limitation under Sections 382 and \n383 of the Code in the taxable year that such built-in gains are recognized or deemed recognized (but only up to the amount of the net unrealized built-in \ngain), while certain built-in losses recognized during such five-year period are subject to the annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code (but only up \nto the amount of the net unrealized built-in loss). \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $156.2 million and $71.1 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, \nrespectively, available to reduce future taxable income that will begin to expire in 2037 for federal income tax purposes. We completed an IRC Section 382 \nstudy through December 31, 2021. The study concluded that we have experienced an ownership change in November of 2020 and December of 2020 and \n$162.6 of our NOL carry forwards are subject to an annual limitation. It is not expected that the annual limitations will result in the expiration of NOL \ncarryforwards prior to utilization assuming sufficient income.  \nWe cannot predict or control the occurrence or timing of another ownership change under Section 382 of the Code in the future. In addition, it is \npossible that any offering of securities by us could result in an ownership change. If another ownership change were to occur, future limitations could apply \nto our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes, which could result in a material amount of our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other \ntax attributes becoming unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.\nThe realization of all or a portion of our deferred income tax assets (including net operating loss carryforwards) is dependent upon the generation of \nfuture income during the statutory carryforward periods. Our inability to utilize our limited pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and \ncertain other tax attributes, or the occurrence of a future ownership change and resulting additional limitations to these tax attributes, could have a material \nadverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe change to the deductibility of our research and development expenditures enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) could increase the \namount of taxes to which we are subject and our effective tax rate. \nBeginning in 2022, the TCJA eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize \nand amortize these expenditures over five or fifteen years depending on the type of research and development expenditure pursuant to Section 174 of the \nCode. Such change to the deductibility of our research and development expenditures could increase the amount of taxes to which we are subject and our \neffective tax rate.\nOur investments are subject to market and credit risks that could diminish their value and these risks could be greater during periods of extreme \nvolatility or disruption in the financial and credit markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, \nliquidity and cash flows. \nOur investments are subject to risks of credit defaults and changes in market values. Periods of macroeconomic weakness or recession, heightened \nvolatility or disruption in the financial and credit markets, such as the current macroeconomic environment, increase these risks, potentially resulting in \nother-than-temporary impairment of assets in our investment portfolio. The impact of geopolitical tension, such as a deterioration in the bilateral \nrelationship between the US and China or Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including any additional sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions that \nmay be imposed by the United States and/or other countries against governmental or other entities in, for example, Russia, also could lead to disruption, \ninstability and volatility in the global markets, which may have an impact on our investments across negatively impacted sectors or geographies. \n31"

      "text": "Product Development Risks \n \nThe results of our current and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory \nauthorities.  Results from early preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of results from later-stage or other trials and interim or top \nline data may be subject to change or qualification based on the complete analysis of data. \nWe are conducting our Phase 1b clinical trial with APVO436 and first-in-human Phase 1 clinical study of ALG.APV-527. None of our other product \ncandidates have entered clinical development. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of preclinical or clinical development. Preclinical studies and clinical \ntrials may produce inconsistent, negative or inconclusive results. The FDA or a non-US regulatory authority may require us to conduct additional clinical \nor preclinical testing. Success in early preliminary data, preclinical studies and clinical trials does not mean that future larger registration clinical trials will \nbe successful and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to \ndemonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities despite having progressed through initial \nclinical trials. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product \ncandidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, \nchanges in adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. In addition, preclinical \nand clinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations and analyses, and many companies whose product candidates performed satisfactorily in \npreclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to \nshow the desired safety and efficacy profile despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the \npharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety \nprofiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even if early-stage clinical \ntrials are promising, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials of our product candidates in additional patient populations or under different \ntreatment conditions before we are able to seek approvals from the FDA and regulatory authorities outside the United States to market and sell these \nproduct candidates. Any of these events could limit the commercial potential of our product candidates and have a material adverse effect on our business, \nprospects, financial condition and results of operations. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and \nexperience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nIn addition, our APVO436 clinical trial is an open-label study and is conducted at a limited number of clinical sites on a limited number of patients.  \nAn “open-label” clinical trial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate or \nan existing approved drug.  Most typically, open-label clinical trials test only the investigational product candidate and sometimes may do so at different \ndose levels or in combination with other drugs. Open-label clinical trials are subject to various limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect as \npatients in open-label clinical trials are aware when they are receiving treatment. Open-label clinical trials may be subject to a “patient bias” where patients \nperceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. In addition, open-label clinical trials may \nbe subject to an “investigator bias” where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of which patients have \nreceived treatment and may interpret the information of the treated group more favorably given this knowledge. The results from these clinical trials may \nnot be predictive of future clinical trial results with APVO436 or other product candidates. In addition, although the FDA issued a “may proceed” \nnotification which allowed us and Alligator to initiate our Phase 1 clinical trial of ALG.APV-527, we cannot guarantee that this trial or future trials of \nALG.APV-527 will show the desired safety and efficacy.\nWe may publicly disclose top line or interim data from time to time, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results \nand related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. The \ntop line or interim results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such \nresults once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. For example, we released preliminary data regarding our APVO436 Phase 1b clinical\ntrial study which may change or be inconsistent with future results.  Even in situations where a clinical stage candidate appears to be benefiting a patient, \nthat benefit may not be of a permanent nature. Top line and interim data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures, that may result in the final \ndata being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published.

The FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree \nwith our trial design, and our interpretation of data from non-clinical studies and clinical trials. In particular, the FDA may not view our data as being \nclinically meaningful or statistically persuasive. The regulatory authorities and policies governing the development of our product candidates may also \nchange at any time. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may change requirements for the approval of a product candidate even after reviewing \nand providing comments or advice on a protocol for a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. Any of these regulatory authorities may also approve a product \ncandidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical \ntrials. The FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims that we believe would be necessary or desirable for the \nsuccessful commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe may not be able to file INDs or IND amendments to commence additional clinical trials on the timelines we expect, and even if we are able to, the \nFDA may not permit us to proceed.\nWe submitted an IND for ALG.APV-527 to the FDA in the second half of 2022 for which we received a “may proceed” notification from the FDA. \nHowever, we may not be able to file future INDs for our product candidates on the timelines we expect. For example, we may experience manufacturing \ndelays or other delays with IND-enabling studies. Moreover, we cannot be sure that submission of future INDs will result in the FDA allowing clinical \ntrials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate clinical trials. Additionally, even if such regulatory authorities agree with \nthe design and implementation of the clinical trials set forth in an IND, we cannot guarantee that such regulatory authorities will not change their \nrequirements in the future. These considerations also apply to new clinical trials we may submit as amendments to existing INDs or to a new IND. Any \nfailure to file INDs on the timelines we expect or to obtain regulatory approvals for our trials may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or \ncommercializing our products on a timely basis, if at all.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the commencement, site initiation, enrollment of patients or completion of our clinical trials, the time to reach \ncritical trial data and receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate, enroll and maintain a sufficient number \nof eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. In addition, some of our \ncompetitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that treat the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise \nbe eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors’ product candidates. Furthermore, APVO436 has received orphan \ndrug designation for acute myelogenous leukemia and thus has a relatively small patient population. Also, the eligibility criteria of our clinical trials may \nfurther limit the pool of available study participants as we require that patients have specific characteristics that we can measure to assure their disease is \neither severe enough or not too advanced to include them in a study. In addition, the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it more difficult to \ninitiate clinical trials and enroll patients and the process of finding and diagnosing eligible patients under these conditions may prove costly.\nPatient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n•\nthe severity of the disease under investigation; \n•\nthe design of the clinical trial, including the patient eligibility criteria for the study in question; \n•\nthe perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study; \n•\nour payments for conducting clinical trials; \n•\nthe patient referral practices of physicians; \n•\nour ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experiences;\n•\nour ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n•\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n34"

Site initiation and enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, \ndelays in the availability of preliminary or final results, and delays to commercially launching our product candidates, if approved, which may cause the \nvalue of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nSerious adverse events, undesirable side effects or other unexpected properties of our product candidates may be identified that could delay, prevent, or\ncause the withdrawal of regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing\napproval.\nSerious adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of any of our product candidates, either when used alone \nor in combination with other approved or investigational therapies, could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt our development \nactivities and manufacturing and distribution operations and could result in a more restrictive label, the imposition of a clinical hold, suspension, \ndistribution or use restrictions or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If any of our product \ncandidates are associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or have properties that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their \ndevelopment or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less \nsevere or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been \nfound to cause undesirable or unexpected side effects that prevented further development of the compound. \nAs we continue developing our product candidates and conduct clinical trials of our product candidates, serious adverse events, or SAEs, \nundesirable side effects, relapse of disease or unexpected characteristics may emerge causing us to abandon these product candidates or limit their \ndevelopment to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the SAEs or undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or \nmore acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective or in which efficacy is more pronounced or durable. Undesirable side effects, or other unexpected adverse \nevents or properties of any of our product candidates, could arise or become known either during clinical development or, if approved, after the approved \nproduct has been marketed. If such an event occurs during development, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could suspend or terminate a \nclinical trial or deny approval of our product candidates. Furthermore, we are currently and may in the future evaluate our product candidates in \ncombination with approved and/or experimental therapies. These combinations may have additional or more severe side effects than caused by our product \ncandidate as monotherapies. The uncertainty resulting from the use of our product candidate in combination with other therapies may make it difficult to \naccurately predict side effects or efficacy in potential future clinical trials. If our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later \nidentify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences may result, including: \n•\nregulatory authorities may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon our research efforts for our other product candidates;\n•\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or impose distribution or use restrictions; \n•\nregulatory authorities may require one or more post-market studies; \n•\nwe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients; \n•\nregulatory authorities may require implementation of a REMS, Field Safety Corrective Actions or equivalent, which may include safety \nsurveillance, restricted distribution and use, patient education, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of \ncertain adverse events, preapproval of promotional materials and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising; \n35"

If these third parties do not effectively carry out their contractual duties, \ncomply with regulatory requirements or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product \ncandidates and our business could be substantially harmed. \nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct the clinical and preclinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for our product \ncandidates. We depend on third parties, such as independent clinical investigators, research sites, contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third-\nparty service providers to conduct the clinical and preclinical trials of our product candidates, and we expect to continue to do so. For example, Dr. Dirk \nHuebner, Chief Medical Officer, is providing clinical trial and medical affairs oversight duties as an independent consultant. We rely heavily on Dr. \nHuebner and these other third parties for successful execution and oversight of our clinical and non-clinical trials, but we do not exercise day to day control \nover their activities. \nWhile we have agreements governing the activities of third parties, we have limited influence and control over their actual performance and \nactivities. For instance, our third-party service providers are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such \nthird parties we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, and non-clinical programs. Our third-party \nservice providers may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting trials or \nother therapeutic development activities that could harm our competitive position.  If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual \nduties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our non-clinical studies or clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, if \nthey need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory \nrequirements or for other reasons, our trials may be repeated, extended, delayed, or terminated, we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in \nobtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our \nproduct candidates, or we or they may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions. \nOur reliance on third-party service providers does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our trials are conducted in \naccordance with the FDA-approved good clinical practices, or GCPs, and the plans and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application. In \naddition, these organizations and individuals may not complete these activities on our anticipated or desired timeframe. We also may experience \nunexpected cost increases that are beyond our control. Problems with the timeliness or quality of the work of a contract research organization may lead us \nto seek to terminate the relationship and use an alternative service provider, which may prove difficult and/or costly and result in a delay of our trials. In \naddition, business disruptions arising from circumstances out of our control, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect the ability of \nsome of the independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers that conduct our clinical and \npreclinical trials of our product candidates. Any delay in or inability to complete our trials could delay or prevent the development, approval, and \ncommercialization of our product candidates. \nIf CROs or other third parties assisting us or our study sites fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may \nbe deemed unreliable and the FDA or its non-U.S. counterparts may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing \napplications. We or they may also face regulatory enforcement action.  We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory \nagencies will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under \nGMP and similar regulations outside of the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our product candidate manufacturers, to comply with these \nregulations may require us to repeat or redesign clinical trials, or conduct additional trials, which would increase our development costs and delay or impact \nthe conduct of our preclinical studies, clinical trials, and the likelihood of regulatory approval. \n36"

In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new third party commences work. As a result, if we need \nto enter into alternative arrangements, it could delay our product development activities and adversely affect our business. Though we carefully manage our \nrelationships with our third parties, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges \nwill not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects, and results of operations.\nIf any of these events occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates or succeed in our efforts to create approved \nline extensions for certain of our existing products or generate additional useful clinical data in support of these products.

In order to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates in a \ntimely manner, we and our third-party manufacturers must be able to develop and execute on manufacturing processes and reach agreement on contract \nterms.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or any product that we develop may \nadversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis. \nIn addition, any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval.\nIf these third-party manufacturers do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or manufacture our product \ncandidates in accordance with regulatory requirements, if there are disagreements between us and such parties, or if such parties are unable to expand \ncapacities to support commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, we may not be able to produce, or may \nbe delayed in producing sufficient product candidates to meet our supply requirements. Any delays in obtaining adequate supplies with respect to our \nproduct candidates and components may delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe may not succeed in our efforts to establish manufacturing relationships or other alternative arrangements for any of our product candidates, \ncomponents, and programs. Our product candidates may compete with other products and product candidates for access to manufacturing facilities.

These third-\nparty facilities may also be affected by natural disasters, such as floods or fire, or such facilities could face manufacturing issues, such as contamination or \nregulatory findings following a regulatory inspection of such facility.

The addition of a new or alternative \nmanufacturer may also require FDA approvals and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf for any reason we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates or the components used to manufacture them, it will be more \ndifficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively. Further, even if we do establish such collaborations or arrangements, our third-\nparty manufacturers may breach, terminate, or not renew these agreements.\nWe or our third-party manufacturers may also encounter shortages in the raw materials or therapeutic substances necessary to produce our product \ncandidates in the quantities needed for our clinical trials or, if our product candidates are approved, in sufficient quantities for commercialization or to meet \nan increase in demand. Such shortages may occur for a variety of reasons, including capacity constraints, delays or disruptions in the market, and shortages \ncaused by the purchase of such materials by our competitors or others. We may also not be able to obtain such materials on favorable terms as a result of \nglobal trade policies.  Our third-party manufacturers’ failure to obtain the raw materials, therapeutic substances, or active pharmaceutical ingredients \nnecessary to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAll of our current product candidates are biologics.

Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including obtaining \nmaterials, maintaining master seed or cell banks and preventing genetic drift, seed or cell growth, fermentation and contamination including from, among \nother things, particulates, filtration, filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control testing, may result in lot failures or manufacturing \nshut-down, delays in the release of lots, product recalls, spoilage or regulatory action. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our third-party \nmanufacturers may experience difficulties, such as supply shortages, that impact our product candidates and production timelines. \nAdditionally, our development and commercialization strategy involves entering into arrangements with corporate and academic collaborators, \ncontract research organizations, distributors, third-party manufacturers, licensors, licensees and others to conduct development work, manage or conduct \nour clinical trials, manufacture our product candidates and market and sell our products outside of the United States and maintain our existing arrangements \nwith respect to the commercialization or manufacture of our products. We may not have the expertise or the resources to conduct all of these activities for \nall products and product candidates on our own and, as a result, are particularly dependent on third parties in many areas. Any current or future \narrangements for development and commercialization may not be successful, as the amount and timing of resources that third parties devote to developing, \nmanufacturing, and commercializing our products candidates are not within our control. If we are not able to establish or maintain agreements relating to \nour product candidates in development, our results of operations and prospects would be materially and adversely affected. \nAny loss of a third-party manufacturer, any delays, or problems in the manufacture of our products, or termination of any arrangements for \ndevelopment and commercialization of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, results of operations and financial \ncondition. We may be required to replace our manufacturer and if this were to occur, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any \nsuch replacements. We may also not be able to enter into such arrangements on favorable commercial terms.\nChanges in product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.\nAs product candidates are developed through preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials toward approval and commercialization, it is common \nthat various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, manufacturing sites, and formulation, are altered along the way in an \neffort to optimize processes and results. Any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned \nclinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials.

If this were to occur, we may also never receive marketing approval, we may need to repeat clinical trials, \nwe may need to undertake costly corrective actions, including product recalls, we may risk harm to subjects or patients, and we may face enforcement \nactions.  \nWhile we are ultimately responsible for the manufacture of our product candidates, other than through our contractual arrangements, we have little \ncontrol over our manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve \nthese facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative \nmanufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain and maintain regulatory approval for or market our product \ncandidates, if approved. Additionally, we may be unable to contract with alternative manufacturers on favorable or reasonable terms. Any new \nmanufacturers would need to either obtain or develop the necessary manufacturing know-how, and obtain the necessary equipment and materials, which \nmay take substantial time and investment. In some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture our products or product candidates may be unique or \nproprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty, or there may be contractual restrictions prohibiting us from, transferring such skills to \na back-up or alternate supplier, or we may be unable to transfer such skills at all. In addition, if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we \nwill be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable \nregulations. We will also need to verify, such as through a manufacturing comparability study, that any new manufacturing process will produce our \nproduct candidate according to the specifications previously submitted to the FDA or any other regulatory authority. The delays associated with the \nverification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates or commercialize our products in a timely manner or \nwithin budget. Furthermore, a manufacturer may possess technology related to the manufacture of our product candidate that such manufacturer owns \nindependently. This would increase our reliance on such manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturer in order to have another \nmanufacturer produce our product candidates. In addition, changes in manufacturers often involve changes in manufacturing procedures and processes, \nwhich could require that we conduct bridging studies between our prior clinical supply used in our clinical trials and that of any new manufacturer. We may \nbe unsuccessful in demonstrating the comparability of clinical supplies which could require the conduct of additional clinical trials. We must also receive \nFDA approval for the use of any new manufacturers for commercial supply.\nWe and our third-party manufacturers may not be able to meet these manufacturing process requirements for any of our current product candidates, \nall of which have complex manufacturing processes, which make meeting these requirements even more challenging. Due to the direct and indirect effects \nof the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our third-party manufacturers may experience difficulties that impact our product candidates. If we are unable to \ndevelop manufacturing processes for our clinical product candidates that satisfy these requirements, we will not be able to supply sufficient quantities of \ntest material to conduct our clinical trials in a timely or cost-effective manner, and as a result, our development programs will be delayed, our financial \nperformance will be adversely impacted and we will be unable to meet our long-term goals. \n39"

However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to \nmaintain this designation, receive this designation for any of our other product candidates, or receive or maintain any corresponding benefits, \nincluding periods of exclusivity.\nCertain of our product candidates have received orphan drug designation. We may also seek orphan drug designation for our other product \ncandidates, as appropriate. While orphan drug designation does provide us with certain advantages, it neither shortens the development time or regulatory \nreview time of a product candidate nor gives the product candidate any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nGenerally, if a product candidate with orphan drug designation subsequently receives marketing approval before another product considered by the \nFDA to be the same for the same orphan indication, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving \nanother marketing application for the same drug or biologic for the same indication for a period of seven years in the United States.\nWe may not be able to obtain any future orphan drug designations that we apply for. Orphan drug designations do not guarantee that we will be able \nto successfully develop our product candidates, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain any orphan drug designations that we receive. For \ninstance, orphan drug designations may be revoked if the FDA finds that the request for designation contained an untrue statement of material fact or\nomitted material information, or if the FDA finds that the product candidate was not eligible for designation at the time of the submission of the request.\nMoreover, even if we are able to receive and maintain orphan drug designations, we may ultimately not receive any period of regulatory exclusivity \nif our product candidates are approved. For instance, we may not receive orphan product regulatory exclusivity if the indication for which we receive FDA \napproval is broader than the orphan drug designation. Orphan exclusivity may also be lost for the same reasons that orphan drug designation may be lost. \nOrphan exclusivity may further be lost if we are unable to assure a sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or \ncondition.\nEven if we obtain orphan exclusivity for any of our current or future product candidates, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product \nfrom competition as different products can be approved for the same condition or products that are the same as ours can be approved for different \nconditions. Even after an orphan product is approved, the FDA can also subsequently approve a product containing the same principal molecular features \nfor the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later product is clinically superior. The FDA may further grant orphan drug designation to multiple \nsponsors for the same compound or active molecule and for the same indication. If another sponsor receives FDA approval for such product before we do, \nwe would be prevented from launching our product in the United States for the orphan indication for a period of at least seven years, unless we can \ndemonstrate clinical superiority. Moreover, third-party payors may reimburse for products off-label even if not indicated for the orphan condition.\nWe may seek Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for a product candidate that we develop, and we may be unsuccessful. If we are \nsuccessful, the designation may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that \nour product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nWe may seek Breakthrough Therapy designation for any product candidate that we develop. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is \nintended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence \nindicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as \nsubstantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and \ncommunication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the \nnumber of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for accelerated approval \nand priority review.\nEven if we believe a product candidate we develop meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead \ndetermine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of Breakthrough Therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster \ndevelopment process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate \napproval \n40"

In addition, even if the product candidates we develop qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the drugs no longer \nmeet the conditions for qualification and rescind the designation.\nWe may seek designation for our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technologies as a designated platform technology, but we might not receive \nsuch designation, and even if we do, such designation may not lead to a faster development, regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may seek designation for our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technologies as a designated platform technology. Under the FDORA, a \nplatform technology incorporated within or utilized by a biologic is eligible for designation as a designated platform technology if (1) the platform \ntechnology is incorporated in, or utilized by, a product approved under a BLA; (2) preliminary evidence submitted by the sponsor of the approved or \nlicensed product, or a sponsor that has been granted a right of reference to data submitted in the application for such product, demonstrates that the platform \ntechnology has the potential to be incorporated in, or utilized by, more than one product without an adverse effect on quality, manufacturing, or safety; and \n(3) data or information submitted by the applicable person indicates that incorporation or utilization of the platform technology has a reasonable likelihood \nto bring significant efficiencies to the drug development or manufacturing process and to the review process. A sponsor may request the FDA to designate \na platform technology as a designated platform technology concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND application for a product that \nincorporates or utilizes the platform technology that is the subject of the request. If so designated, the FDA may expedite the development and review of \nany subsequent original BLA for a product that uses or incorporates the platform technology. Even if we believe our platform technology meets the criteria \nfor such designation, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to grant such designation. In addition, the receipt of such designation for a platform \ntechnology does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive a faster FDA review process or ultimate FDA approval. Moreover, the \nFDA may revoke a designation if the FDA determines that a designated platform technology no longer meets the criteria for such designation.\nWe have in the past and may in the future conduct clinical trials for our product candidates outside the United States, and the FDA or non-U.S. \nregulatory authorities may not accept data from such trials in the development or approval of our product candidates in those jurisdictions.\nWe have in the past and may in the future conduct clinical trials outside the U.S. and the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may not accept \nthose data in support of the further development or approval of our product candidates. The acceptance of trial data from clinical trials conducted outside \nthe United States by the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority may be subject to certain conditions. In cases where data from foreign clinical trials \nare intended to serve as the basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis of foreign \ndata alone unless (i) the data are applicable to the United States population and United States medical practice; (ii) the trials were performed by clinical \ninvestigators of recognized competence; and (iii) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA, or if the FDA \nconsiders such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Additionally, \nthe FDA’s clinical trial requirements, including sufficient size of patient populations and statistical powering, must be met. Many foreign regulatory bodies \nhave similar approval requirements.\nIn addition, such foreign trials will be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the trials are conducted. There can be no \nassurance that the FDA or any applicable foreign regulatory authority will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA or any \napplicable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would result in the need to conduct additional trials beyond those we have planned, \nwhich would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of our business plan, and which may result in our product candidates not receiving marketing \napproval for commercialization in the applicable jurisdiction.\nCommercialization Risks \nOur ability to grow revenues and execute on our long-term strategy depends heavily on our ability to discover, develop, and obtain marketing approval \nfor our product candidates. \nWe currently have no products approved for commercial distribution.

Our ability to generate revenues is substantially \ndependent on our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize our product candidates. Except for the revenues \nfrom previously sold products, we currently generate no revenues from sales of any products, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a \nmarketable product.\nIn order for us to achieve our long-term business objectives, we will need to successfully discover and/or develop and commercialize our product \ncandidates. Although we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development, we have had only a limited \nnumber of our internally-discovered product candidates reach the clinical development stage. We currently have two clinical-stage candidates, APVO436 \nand ALG.APV-527, which were built on the ADAPTIR platform. Drug discovery and development is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process \nthat is fraught with risk and a high rate of failure. Our product candidates are susceptible to the risks of failure inherent at any stage of product \ndevelopment, including the appearance of unexpected or unacceptable adverse events or failure to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials. Failure to \nsuccessfully discover and/or develop, obtain marketing approval for and commercialize additional products and product candidates would likely have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to grow revenues and improve our financial condition. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other \ntesting of our product candidates that we develop beyond those that we currently expect, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our \nproduct candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive, or if there are safety concerns, we may \nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates, not obtain marketing approval at all, obtain approval for limited indications or \npatient populations, with a label without claims necessary for us to successfully market our products, or with significant labeled warnings. We may also be \nsubject to additional post-marketing testing requirements, surveillance requirements, or REMS. To the extent any of the foregoing should occur, our \nbusiness may be materially harmed.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use and further develop our ADAPTIR or ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms.\nA key element of our strategy is to expand our product pipeline of immunotherapeutics based on our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform \ntechnologies. We plan to select and create product candidates for early development, potentially with other collaborative partners. We expect to continue to \ndevelop the platform to address unmet medical needs through directed cytokine delivery via monospecifics and bispecifics in areas including oncology, and \nmulti-specific molecules in oncology and other therapeutic areas. Our goal is to leverage this technology to make targeted investment in monospecific, \nbispecific, and multi-specific ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX therapeutics. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential \nproduct candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side effects or other \ncharacteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. If we do not \nsuccessfully develop and commercialize product candidates based on our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technologies, our ability to obtain \nproduct revenues in future periods may be adversely affected, which likely would result in harm to our financial position and our financial prospects, and \nadversely affect our stock price. \nWe face and will continue to face substantial competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market \npenetration for our product candidates, if approved.\nThe development and commercialization of new biotechnology products is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological advances. We may \nface future competition with respect to our current product candidates and any product candidates we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future \nobtained from other companies and governments, universities, and other non-profit research organizations. Our competitors may develop products that are \nsafer, more effective, more convenient, or less costly than any products that we may develop or market, or may obtain marketing approval for their products \nfrom the FDA, or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product candidates. Our competitors may have \ngreater resources and may devote greater resources to research and develop their products, research and development capabilities, adapt more quickly to \nnew technologies, scientific advances or patient preferences and needs, initiate or withstand substantial price competition or macroeconomic impacts more \nsuccessfully, or more effectively negotiate third-party licensing and collaborative arrangements. \n42"

We expect to compete on the basis of product efficacy, safety, ease of administration, price and economic value compared to drugs \nused in current practice or currently being developed. If we are not successful in demonstrating these attributes, physicians and other key healthcare \ndecision makers may choose other products over any products we successfully develop, switch from our products to new products or choose to use our \nproducts only in limited circumstances, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nAny of our product candidates, if approved, may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, \nwhich would harm our business.\nThe success of our product candidates, if approved, will depend upon, among other things, their acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party \npayors, and other members of the medical community as a therapeutic and cost-effective alternative to competing products and treatments. If any of our \nproduct candidates do not achieve and maintain an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate material revenues from sales of these products. The \ndegree of market acceptance of our products will depend on a number of factors, including: our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and \nefficacy; the prevalence and severity of any side effects; availability, relative cost and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments; the ability \nto offer our products for sale at competitive prices; our ability to continuously supply the market without interruption; the relative convenience and ease of\nadministration; the willingness of the target patient population to try new products and of physicians to prescribe these products; the strength of marketing \nand distribution support; publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and the sufficiency of coverage or reimbursement by \nthird parties. \nLegislative or healthcare reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, \nthe ACA was enacted, which substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted \nthe U.S. pharmaceutical industry. However, some provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented and certain provisions have been subject to legal \nand political challenges, as well as efforts to repeal, replace delay, circumvent, or loosen certain aspects of the ACA or mandates required thereby. \nAdditionally, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed \ncomprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA, such as removing penalties as of January 1, 2019 for not \ncomplying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, and increasing the \npoint-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court \ndismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. It is \nunclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our \nbusiness. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted: \n•\nOn August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of \n2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will \nremain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-\n19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction occurred beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the \n2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022.\n43"

The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients \nto access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA \napproval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA \npermission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products \navailable to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the \nBudget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, \ntasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby \ntriggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2 \npercent per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in \neffect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. \nAdditionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed \nproducts. For example, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among \nother things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government \nprogram reimbursement methodologies for drug products, including by tying reimbursement to the price of products in other developed countries. For \nexample, proposals have been made to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, \nincentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. Individual states \nin the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product \npricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and \ntransparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legislative and regulatory \nagendas, as they relate to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries and the economy as a whole, of the Biden administration and the U.S. Congress \ncurrently remain uncertain. One example of President Biden’s priorities came via an executive order that he issued on July 9, 2021 directing the FDA to, \namong other things, continue to clarify and improve the approval framework for biosimilars, including the standards for interchangeability of biological \nproducts, facilitate the development and approval of biosimilar and interchangeable products, clarify existing requirements and procedures related to the \nreview and submission of BLAs, and identify and address any efforts to impede biosimilar competition. Any new laws and initiatives may result in \nadditional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding or impose additional regulatory requirements on drug development or approval, which \ncould have a material adverse effect on our future customers and accordingly, our financial operations.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that \nfederal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for any product candidates we \nsuccessfully develop or additional pricing pressures. \nRegulatory and Compliance Risks \nOur long-term success depends, in part, upon our ability to develop, receive regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates. \nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development, including testing, manufacture, recordkeeping, storage, and approval, \nare subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. \nFailure to obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have limited resources for \nuse in preparing, filing, and supporting the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals and expect to rely on third-party contract research \norganizations and consultants to assist us in this process. \nThe FDA and other comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries impose substantial and rigorous requirements for the development, \nproduction, marketing authorization and commercial introduction of drug products. These requirements include non-clinical, laboratory and clinical testing \nprocedures, sampling activities, clinical trials, and other costly and time-consuming procedures.

Ordinarily, the FDA requires a sponsor to support a BLA with substantial evidence of the product’s safety, purity, and potency in treating the targeted \nindication based on data derived from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, including Phase 3 safety and efficacy trials conducted in patients with the \ndisease or condition being targeted. \nDeveloping and obtaining regulatory approval for product candidates is a lengthy process, often taking a number of years, is uncertain and \nexpensive. All of the product candidates that we are developing, or may develop in the future, require research and development, non-clinical studies, non-\nclinical testing, and clinical trials prior to seeking regulatory approval, and commencing commercial sales. In addition, we may need to address a number of \ntechnological challenges in order to complete development of our product candidates. As a result, the development of product candidates may take longer \nthan anticipated or not be successful at all. \nOur product candidate development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals, and we may not have sufficient funding \nto complete the testing and approval process for any of our product candidates. We may be required to obtain additional funds to complete clinical trials \nand prepare for possible commercialization of our product candidates. We do not know whether any non-clinical tests or clinical trials above what we \ncurrently have planned will be required, will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant delays \nrelating to any preclinical or clinical trials also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product \ncandidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do. This may prevent us from receiving marketing approvals and impair our \nability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that \ncause, or lead to, delays in clinical trials may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of any of our product candidates. If any of this occurs, our \nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be materially harmed.\nGenerally, no product can receive FDA approval, marketing authorization from the European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU \nMember States, or approval from comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries unless data generated in human clinical trials demonstrates both \nsafety and efficacy for each target indication in accordance with such authority’s standards. \nThe large majority of product candidates that begin human clinical trials fail to demonstrate the required safety and efficacy characteristics \nnecessary for marketing approval. Failure to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of our product candidates for each target indication in clinical trials\nwould prevent us from obtaining required approvals from regulatory authorities, which would prevent us from commercializing those product candidates. \nNegative or inconclusive results from the clinical trials or adverse medical events during the trials could lead to requirements that trials be repeated or \nextended, or that additional trials be conducted, any of which may not be clinically feasible or financially practicable, that the conduct of trials be \nsuspended, or that a program be terminated. \nAny regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may limit the indicated uses for the product or subject the product to restrictions or post-approval \ncommitments that render the product commercially non-viable. Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive non-clinical and clinical \ndata, information about product manufacturing processes and inspection of facilities and supporting information to the regulatory authorities for each \ntherapeutic indication to establish the product’s safety and efficacy. If we are unable to submit the necessary data and information, for example, because the \nresults of clinical trials are not favorable, or if the applicable regulatory authority delays reviewing or does not approve our applications, we will be unable \nto obtain regulatory approval. \nDelays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals may delay or prevent the successful commercialization of any of the products or \nproduct candidates in the jurisdiction for which approval is sought; diminish our competitive advantage; and defer or decrease our receipt of revenue. \nSome of our product candidates previously in development experienced regulatory and/or clinical setbacks. Clinical development has been \ndiscontinued for product candidates otlertuzumab, APVO414, and APVO210. Both APVO414 and APVO210 were discontinued after patients developed \nADA. Most recently, in 2019, we elected to discontinue the APVO210 development program following the review of data from the Phase 1 multiple \nascending \n45"

Specifically, the clinical data showed evidence of increasing titers of ADA with repeated doses of APVO210, which had varying impact \non APVO210 drug levels in subjects’ blood.  The cause of the ADA is uncertain; however, we believe that appearance of ADA is related to the mechanism \nof action of APVO210, and not due to the structure, or sequences characteristic of the ADAPTIR platform.   Although we have re-designed certain \ncomponents of the ADAPTIR platform based on what we have learned in prior clinical trials, there is no guarantee that the occurrence of ADA or other \nclinical setbacks will not occur in the development of our existing and future ADAPTIR product candidates.\nThe procedures to obtain marketing approvals vary among countries and can involve additional clinical trials or other pre-filing requirements. The \ntime required to obtain foreign regulatory approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The foreign regulatory approval process may \ninclude all the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval, or different or additional risks. Regulatory agencies may have varying interpretations of the \nsame data, and approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. Accordingly, approval by the \nFDA does not ensure approval by the regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval \nby the FDA or regulatory authorities in other foreign countries. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in one jurisdiction, however, may impact the decision \nof other jurisdictions.  We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products and \nproducts in development in any market on a timely basis, if at all.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies, including from government shutdowns, or other disruptions to these \nagencies’ operations, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being \ndeveloped or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the \noperation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, \nthe ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the \nagency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may \nrely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by \nnecessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the \nability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future \ngovernment shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our \noperations.\nOur product candidates are and will continue to be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant \nadditional expense.  We may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our \nproducts.\nWe and our product candidates are subject to extensive and ongoing requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, \nincluding requirements related to the conduct of clinical and non-clinical studies, manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, packaging, \ndistribution, adverse event reporting, storage, recordkeeping, export, import, advertising, marketing, and promotional activities for such products. These \nrequirements further include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information, including manufacturing deviations and reports, registration and \nlisting requirements, the payment of annual fees, continued compliance with GMP-requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality \nassurance, and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians. Manufacturers \nand manufacturers’ facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA, and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring \nthat quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to GMP requirements and applicable product tracking and tracing requirements.\nFDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities will continue to closely monitor the safety profile of any product even after approval.

For example, the current administration may implement new or revised laws, \nregulatory requirements, and associated compliance obligations, as well as postponed or frozen regulatory requirements.  Changes in medical practice and \nstandard of care may also impact the marketability of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements, \nstandards of care, or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing \napproval that we may have obtained and be subject to regulatory enforcement action.\nShould any of the above actions take place, they could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Further, the cost of compliance \nwith post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. \nIf we fail to comply with foreign, federal, state, and local healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, \nwe could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. \nAs a biotechnology company, even though we do not provide healthcare services or receive payments directly from or bill directly to Medicare, \nMedicaid, or other third-party payors for our products, certain federal, state, local and foreign healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse \nand patients’ rights are applicable to our business. We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal \ngovernment and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: \n•\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its \nbehalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce, or in return \nfor, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, prescribing or recommendation of an item, good, facility or service \nreimbursable by a federally funded healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid program. The term “remuneration” has been \ninterpreted broadly and may constrain our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare \nproviders or other entities, among other activities; \n•\nfederal civil and criminal false claims, including the federal False Claims Act, and false statement laws and civil monetary penalty laws, \nwhich impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, on individuals or entities for, among \nother things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal \nhealth care programs that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery or \npayment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n•\nthe U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil\nliability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit \nprogram or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under \nthe custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully \nfalsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the \ndelivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does \nnot need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n•\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, and their respective \nimplementing regulations mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in \ncommon healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health \ninformation, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other \nthings, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards directly applicable to \"business associates\", or independent contractors or agents of \ncovered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a \ncovered entity; \n48"

Moreover, recent health care reform \nlegislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute \nand criminal health care fraud statutes, so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In \naddition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback \nStatute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. \nRecently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under the federal false claims laws for allegedly inflating \ndrug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn are used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly \nproviding free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing \npractices, including off-label promotion, interactions with specialty pharmacies, and patient assistance programs may also violate fraud and abuse laws. To \nthe extent that any product we make is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations. \nIn addition, certain state and local laws mandate that we comply with a state code of conduct, adopt a company code of conduct under state criteria, \ndisclose marketing payments made to health care professionals and entities, disclose drug pricing information and/or report compliance information to the \nstate authorities. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply in multiple \njurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements increase the possibility that a pharmaceutical company may violate one or more of the \nrequirements. Any failure to comply with these reporting requirements could result in significant fines and penalties. \nThe risks of complying with these laws cannot be entirely eliminated. The risk of violation of such laws is also increased because many of them \nhave not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us \nfor violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s \nattention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign privacy, \nsecurity, fraud and transparency laws may prove costly. If our past or present operations, or those of our distributors are found to be in violation of any of \nthe laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to sanctions, including civil and administrative \npenalties, criminal fines, damages, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, individual imprisonment, \nintegrity obligations, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our \nbusiness and our financial results. Similarly, if healthcare providers, distributors or other entities with whom we do business are found to be out of \ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on us. \n49"

Misconduct by employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial \npartners, manufacturers, investigators, or CROs could include intentional, reckless, negligent, or unintentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or \napplicable fraud and abuse laws, provide accurate information to the FDA, properly calculate pricing information required by federal programs, comply \nwith federal procurement rules or contract terms, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. This misconduct \ncould also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions \nand serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter this type of misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent \nthis activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions \nor lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Moreover, it is possible for a whistleblower to pursue a False Claims \nAct case against us even if the government considers the claim unmeritorious and declines to intervene, which could require us to incur costs defending \nagainst such a claim. Further, due to the risk that a judgment in a False Claims Act case could result in exclusion from federal health programs or \ndebarment from government contracts, whistleblower cases often result in large settlements. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not \nsuccessful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, and results of \noperations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nOur operations, including our use of hazardous materials, chemicals, bacteria, and viruses, require us to comply with regulatory requirements and \nexpose us to significant potential liabilities. \nOur operations involve the use of hazardous materials, including chemicals, and may produce dangerous waste products. Accordingly, we, along \nwith the third parties that conduct clinical trials and manufacture our products and product candidates on our behalf, are subject to federal, state, local and \nforeign laws and regulations that govern the use, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, exposure, disposal and recordkeeping with respect to these \nmaterials. We are also subject to a variety of environmental and occupational health and safety laws. Compliance with current or future laws and \nregulations can require significant costs and we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties in the event of noncompliance. In addition, the risk of \ncontamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In such event, we could be held liable for substantial civil damages or costs \nassociated with the cleanup of hazardous materials. \nIntellectual Property Risks \nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual proprietary rights, our business could be harmed. \nOur commercial success will depend, in large part, on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and other countries for the \nintellectual property covering or incorporated into our technology, products and product candidates. Obtaining and maintaining this protection is very \ncostly. The patentability of technology in the biotechnology field generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and scientific questions. We \ncannot be certain that our patents and patent applications, including our own and those that we have rights through licenses from third parties, will \nadequately protect our intellectual property. Our success in protecting our intellectual property depends significantly on our ability to: \n•\nobtain and maintain U.S. and foreign patents, that are meaningful to our products, including defending those patents against adverse claims; \n•\nsecure patent term extension for the patents covering our approved products; \n•\nprotect trade secrets; \n•\noperate without infringing the proprietary rights of others; and,\n•\nprevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. \n50"

      "text": "We may not be able to obtain issued patents relating to our technology or product candidates. Even if issued, patents may inadvertently lapse or be \nchallenged, narrowed, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the duration \nof patent protection we may have for our product candidates. Further, patents may lapse prior to the regulatory approval of the underlying product in one or \nmore territories. In the past, we have abandoned the prosecution and/or maintenance of patent applications related to patent families in the ordinary course \nof business. In the future, we may choose to abandon such prosecution and/or maintenance in a similar fashion. If these patent rights are later determined to \nbe valuable or necessary to our business, our competitive position may be adversely affected. Changes in patent laws or administrative patent office rules or \nchanges in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and in other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope \nof our patent protection, or result in costly defensive measures. \nPatent and other intellectual property laws outside the United States are even more uncertain than in the United States and are continually \nundergoing review and revisions in many countries. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same \nextent as the laws of the United States. For example, certain countries do not grant patent claims that are directed to business methods and processes. In \naddition, we may have to participate in additional opposition proceedings, like the proceedings described above, to determine the validity of our foreign \npatents or our competitors’ foreign patents, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts.\nOur collaborative partners and licensors may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. These third parties may have the first right to \nmaintain or defend intellectual property rights in which we have an interest and, although we may have the right to assume the maintenance and defense of \nsuch intellectual property rights if these third parties do not do so, our ability to maintain and defend such intellectual property rights may be compromised \nby the acts or omissions of these third parties. \nThe cost of litigation to uphold the validity of patents, once obtained, to prevent infringement or to otherwise protect or enforce our proprietary \nrights could be substantial and, from time to time, our patents are subject to patent office proceedings. Some of our competitors may be better able to \nsustain the costs of complex patent litigation because they may have substantially greater financial resources. Intellectual property lawsuits are expensive \nand unpredictable and would consume management’s time and attention and other resources, even if the outcome were successful. In addition, there is a \nrisk that a court would decide that our patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions covered by or \nincorporating them. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of a patent were upheld, a court would refuse to stop the other party from using the \ninvention(s), including on the grounds that its activities do not infringe the patent. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and \noperating results could be materially and adversely affected. \nIn addition to patent litigation, we may be a party to adversarial proceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the USPTO, or the \nOpposition Division of the European Patent Office (EPO). Potential proceedings before the PTAB include inter partes review proceedings, post-grant \nreview proceedings and interference proceedings. Depending on our level of success at the PTAB and Opposition Division of the EPO, these proceedings \ncould adversely impact our intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. \nIn addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in \ncertain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the \nvalue of patents, once obtained, and with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal \ncourts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents \nor to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. Patent and intellectual property laws outside of the United States may also \nchange and be uncertain.\nOur patents, once obtained, also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology. Because patent applications in the United \nStates and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of \ndiscoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that others have not filed or maintained \npatent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of these applications.\nWe also will rely on current and future trademarks to establish and maintain recognized brands, including APTEVO THERAPEUTICS, APTEVO \nBIOTHERAPEUTICS, APTEVO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, the \n51"

If we fail to acquire and protect such trademarks, our ability to market and sell our \nproducts, if approved for marketing, will be harmed. In addition, our current and future trademarks may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared \ngeneric, lapsed or determined to be infringing on or dilutive of other marks and we may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks, which we need\nin order to build name recognition. Any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf approved, our products regulated as biologics may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway. \nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, \nincludes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for \nbiological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a \nbiosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In \naddition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first \nlicensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a \nBLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the \nsafety, purity, and potency of the other company’s product. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its \nultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. We believe that any of our product candidates approved as a biological product \nunder a BLA should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional \naction or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider our investigational medicines to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating \nthe opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, \nhave also been the subject of recent litigation. \nThere is a similar abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar products in the EU. Reference products in the EU benefit from an eight year \ndata exclusivity period during which the data included in the dossier for the reference product may not be referenced for the purposes of an abbreviated \nbiosimilar application. Following the expiration of the data exclusivity period, there is an additional two year period of market exclusivity during which a \nbiosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no product can be placed on the market \nuntil the expiration of such period. The overall 10-year period can be extended to a maximum of 11 years in certain circumstances. As in the U.S., there is \nno guarantee that a product will qualify for the prescribed period of exclusivity and, even if a product does qualify, another company may market a\ncompeting version of the reference product if such company obtained a marketing authorization with a complete independent data package of \npharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.\nMoreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once licensed, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to \ntraditional generic substitution for non-biological products, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. If \ncompetitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing any of our products, if approved, our products may become subject to \ncompetition from such biosimilars, which would impair our ability to successfully commercialize and generate revenues from sales of such products.\nThird parties may choose to file patent infringement claims against us. \nOur development and commercialization activities, as well as any product candidates or products resulting from these activities, may infringe or be \nclaimed to infringe patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties under which we do not hold sufficient licenses or other rights. Third parties \nmay be successful in obtaining patent protection for technologies that cover development and commercialization activities in which we are already \nengaged. These third parties may have substantially greater financial resources than us and could bring claims against us that could cause us to incur \nsubstantial expenses to defend against these claims and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. If a patent infringement or \nother similar suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that \nis the subject of the suit. Intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology industry is common, and we expect this trend to continue. \n52"

These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to \nobtain a license, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we \ncould be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened \npatent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms, if at all, or if an injunction is granted against us, which could harm our \nbusiness significantly. \nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and \nbiotechnology industries. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other adversarial proceedings \nsuch as proceedings before the Patent Trial Appeals Board and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights \nthat could impact our products and technology. \nPatent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, \neven if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more \neffectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent \nlitigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings \nmay also absorb significant management time. \nOur Aptevo trademarks may be opposed which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. \nWe have an application pending that covers the APTEVO THERAPEUTICS trademark and received a notice of allowance from the USPTO for the \nAPTEVO BIOTHERAPEUTICS and APTEVO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT trademarks in August 2022. We refer to these trademarks as our \nhouse marks. If a third party opposes any of these house marks and we are unable to reach settlement prior to the commencement of an opposition \nproceeding, we may incur significant expense in the course of participating in the opposition process, which can be expensive and lengthy. Any settlement \nwith a third party may result in our agreeing to be subject to restrictions on our use of the relevant house mark. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in an \nopposition against a house mark, we would lose the ability to obtain trademark registration for one or more uses of the relevant mark both in the United \nStates and in other territories which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. \nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers. \nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or \npharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently \nor otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these \nclaims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. \nFailure to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, could result in loss of license rights or other damages. \nWe are a party to a number of license agreements and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing licenses impose, \nand we expect future licenses will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with \nthese obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in whole or in part, terminate the exclusive nature of the license and/or sue us for \nbreach, which could cause us to not be able to market any product that is covered by the licensed patents and may be subject to damages. \nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and product candidates could \nbe adversely affected. \nIn addition to patented technology, we rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, information processes and know-how.

Our ability to enter into such \narrangements with respect to products in development that are subject to licenses may be limited by the terms of those licenses.\nOur collaboration agreement with Alligator, or any collaboration agreement we may consider entering into, may not be successful and the success of \nour collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborative partners. It is likely that our collaborative partners will \nhave significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. \nThe risks that we are subject to in any of our collaborations include, among others: \n•\nour collaborative partners may not commit adequate resources to the development, marketing and distribution of any collaboration products, \nlimiting our potential revenues from these products; \n•\nour collaborative partners may experience financial difficulties and may therefore be unable to meet their commitments to us; \n•\nour collaborative partners may pursue a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, \nincluding our competitors; and,\n•\nour collaborative partners may terminate our relationship. \nThe failure of any of our current or future collaboration partners to perform as expected could place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely \naffect us financially, including delay and increased costs of development, loss of market opportunities, lower than expected revenues and impairment of the \nvalue of the related product candidate. A loss of our collaboration agreement with Alligator would result in a burden of locating a replacement partner \nunder potentially less favorable terms at an additional cost. Collaborations are a critical part of our business strategy, and any inability on our part to \nestablish and successfully maintain such arrangements on terms favorable to us or to work successfully with our collaborative partners could have an \nadverse effect on our operations and financial performance. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic factors, we may experience \ndelays in opportunities to develop our product candidates, due to financial and other impacts on potential partners. \nIn addition, in the normal course of business, the Company engages in discussions with third parties regarding possible strategic alliances, joint \nventures, acquisitions, divestitures and business combinations to further develop or commercialize our product candidates. As a result of such transactions, \nour financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term. Furthermore, \nefforts to engage in such transactions require varying levels of management resources, which may divert the Company’s \n54"

Any transactions we engage in could result in our financial results differing materially from market expectations.\nIn connection with our separation from Emergent, we and Emergent agreed to indemnify the other party for certain liabilities. The Emergent \nindemnity may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which Emergent will be allocated responsibility, and \nEmergent may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future. \nPursuant to the separation agreement and certain other agreements with Emergent, Emergent has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and \nwe agreed to indemnify Emergent for certain liabilities. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Emergent are not subject to any cap, may be \nsignificant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the \ndistribution. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Emergent has agreed to retain. Any amounts we are required \nto pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance\nof our operating business. Further, the indemnity from Emergent may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and Emergent \nmay not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Emergent any amounts for \nwhich we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of \noperations and financial condition. \nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and General Risks\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past and is likely to be volatile in the future. Between August 1, 2016 and December 31, 2022, the reported \nclosing price of our common stock has fluctuated between $2.00 and $83.16 per share (as adjusted to reflect our 1-for-14 reverse stock split of our \noutstanding common stock that was effective on March 26, 2020). The stock market in general, and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, \nhave experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In particular, the stock market has \nexperienced extreme volatility in recent months as a result of the geopolitical climate, including the war in Ukraine, and macroeconomic conditions, \nincluding rising and fluctuating inflation and interest rates and reduced consumer confidence. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate \nsignificantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control or unrelated to our operations, including, among others: \n•\nchanges in earnings estimated by securities analysts or management, or our ability to meet those estimates; \n•\ninvestor perceptions or negative announcements by our competitors, suppliers, or partners regarding their own performance; \n•\nthe success of competitive products or technologies; \n•\nthe timing, expenses, and results of clinical and preclinical trials of our product candidates; \n•\nannouncements regarding clinical trial results and product introductions by us or our competitors; \n•\nannouncements of acquisitions, collaborations, financings or other transactions by us or our competitors; \n•\npublic concern as to the safety of our product candidates; \n•\ntermination or delay of a development program; \n•\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel; \n•\nestimated or actual sales of IXINITY by Medexus;\n55"

If the FDA’s or any foreign \nregulatory authority’s response to any application for approval is delayed or not favorable for any of our product candidates, our stock price could decline \nsignificantly. \nIn addition, when the market price of a company’s common stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits \nagainst the company. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other \nresources. \nIn the event that coverage under our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance is reduced or terminated as a result of an ownership change or \notherwise, our indemnification obligations and limitations of our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our \nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnder Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation, and our by-laws and certain indemnification agreements to which we are a party, we have an \nobligation to indemnify, or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify, certain of our current and former directors and officers with respect to past, current, and\nfuture investigations and litigation. In order to reduce the risk of expense of these obligations, we maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. A \nsignificant change in the Company’s risk profile, such as the Tang Ownership Change, could increase the cost to us of our directors’ and officers’ liability \ninsurance coverage or the coverage thereunder may be reduced or terminated in full. In the event that the coverage under our directors’ and officers’ \nliability insurance is reduced or terminated, we will be required to pay the expenses of indemnifying our current and former directors and officers in their \ndefense of current and future investigations and litigation, which expenses may be significant. The increased costs to us of our directors’ and officers’ \nliability insurance coverage, or our indemnification obligations if our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage is reduced or terminated, could \nresult in the diversion of our financial resources, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we do not maintain effective internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and our business could be harmed. \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and \nthe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, requires us to \nperform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent \nregistered public accounting firm potentially to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In the past, we were an emerging \ngrowth company and we currently are a non-accelerated filer and have availed ourselves of the exemption from the requirement that our independent \nregistered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. If we cease to be a non-\naccelerated filer and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to undertake an assessment of our internal control over financial \nreporting, the cost of our compliance with Section 404 will correspondingly increase.  Our compliance with applicable provisions of Section 404 will \nrequire that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues as we implement additional \ncorporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 \napplicable to us in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over \nfinancial reporting that are deemed to be material \n56"

On its annual report for the year \nended December 31, 2021, the Company reported stockholders’ equity of $1,216,000, and, as a result, did not satisfy Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). In the second \nquarter of 2022, the Company regained compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule.\nIn the future, if we fail to maintain such minimum requirements and a final determination is made by Nasdaq that our common stock must be \ndelisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease. In addition, if delisted, \nwe would no longer be subject to Nasdaq rules, including rules requiring us to have a certain number of independent directors and to meet other corporate \ngovernance standards.

In addition, our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an \nalternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising \nunder the federal securities laws of the United States against us, our officers, directors, employees or underwriters. These limitations on the forum in which \nstockholders may initiate action against us could create costs, inconvenience or otherwise adversely affect your ability to seek legal redress.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability \ncreated by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, a court may decline to enforce these exclusive forum provisions with \nrespect to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have \nconcurrent jurisdiction, and our stockholders may not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and \nregulations thereunder. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional \ncosts associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nWe may be subject to periodic litigation, which could result in losses or unexpected expenditure of time and resources. \nFrom time to time, we may be called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits relating to our business. Any litigation, regardless of its merits, could \nresult in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. Due to the inherent \nuncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome in any such proceedings \ncould have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

For example, European Union, or EU, member states and other foreign jurisdictions, including Switzerland, have adopted data protection laws \nand regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. Moreover, the collection and use of personal health data in the EU is now governed under \nthe EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposed several \nrequirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and \nconfidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The \nGDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the U.S., provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for \nnoncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is \ngreater. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including \nemployee information. The GDPR increases our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, including in clinical trials, and we \nmay be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management’s attention and increase our \ncost of doing business. In addition, new regulation or legislative actions regarding data privacy and security (together with applicable industry standards) \nmay increase our costs of doing business. However, despite our ongoing efforts, we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control, \nsuch as limited financial or human resources, or other factors outside our control. It is also possible that local data protection authorities may have different \ninterpretations of the GDPR, leading to potential inconsistencies amongst various EU member states.

This MD&A contains forward-looking \nstatements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, such as those set forth in the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K captioned “Cautionary \nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and elsewhere. As a result, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated \nin these forward-looking statements. \nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage, research and development biotechnology company focused on developing novel immunotherapy candidates for the treatment of \ndifferent forms of cancer. We have developed two versatile and enabling platform technologies for rational design of precision immune modulatory drugs. \nOur lead clinical candidates, APVO436 and ALG.APV-527 (in collaboration with Alligator), and preclinical candidates, APVO603 and APVO711, were \ndeveloped using our ADAPTIR™ modular protein technology platform. Our preclinical candidate APVO442 was developed using our ADAPTIR-FLEX™ \nmodular protein technology platform.    \n  \nThe versatile and robust ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms are designed to generate monospecific, bispecific, and multi-specific antibody \ncandidates capable of enhancing the human immune system against cancer cells. ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX are both modular platforms, which gives \nus the flexibility to generate immunotherapeutic candidates with a variety of mechanisms of action. This flexibility in design allows us to potentially \ngenerate novel therapeutic candidates that may provide effective strategies against difficult to treat, as well as advanced forms of cancer. We have \nsuccessfully designed and constructed numerous investigational-stage product candidates based on our ADAPTIR platform. The ADAPTIR platform \ntechnology is designed to generate monospecific and bispecific immunotherapeutic proteins that specifically bind to one or more targets, for example, \nbispecific therapeutic molecules, which may have structural and functional advantages over monoclonal antibodies. The structural differences of \nADAPTIR molecules over monoclonal antibodies allow for the development of ADAPTIR immunotherapeutics that are designed to engage immune \neffector cells and disease targets to produce signaling responses that modulate the immune system to kill tumor cells.\n  \nWe believe we are skilled at candidate generation, validation, and subsequent preclinical and clinical development using the ADAPTIR platform and the \nADAPTIR-FLEX platform to generate multi-specific candidates or other candidates to our platform capabilities. We have developed a preclinical candidate \nbased on the ADAPTIR-FLEX platform which is advancing in our pipeline. We are developing our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX molecules using our \nprotein engineering, preclinical development, process development, and clinical development capabilities.\n \nRecent Developments\nOn January 9, 2023, we filed a provisional patent with the USPTO pertaining to an anti-PD-L1 and anti-CD40 compound, APVO711, with the \npotential to fight a range of solid malignancies such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and carcinomas of the lung, gastrointestinal \ntract and colon. We initiated preclinical studies in the first quarter of 2023.\nIn December 2022 we announced that APVO436, in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine, demonstrated substantial clinical activity and a \nfavorable safety and tolerability profile in adult venetoclax treatment naïve AML patients.  More specifically:\n•\nThe combination of venetoclax and azacitidine with APVO436 in venetoclax treatment naïve response-evaluable patients in Cohort 2 of the \nPhase 1b study outperformed a composite benchmark across all clinical benefit categories (Benchmark Composite References:\n\nAldoss 2019, Maiti 2021, Morsia 2020, Garciaz 2022, Feld 2021)\n\n\n \n64"

A first-in-\nhuman study was initiated in the first quarter of 2023. \n•\nThe first patient in this trial was dosed in February 2023.  Patient recruitment is ongoing.   ALG.APV-527 targets 4-1BB co-stimulatory \nreceptor (on T lymphocytes and NK cells) and 5T4 (solid tumor antigen) and is designed to promote anti-tumor immunity. \nResults of Operations\nExcept as otherwise stated below, the following discussions of our results of operations reflect the results of our continuing operations, excluding the \nresults related to Aptevo BioTherapeutics LLC (Aptevo BioTherapeutics), which was sold in February 2020 to Medexus and has been separated from \ncontinuing operations and reflected as a discontinued operation.  See Note 2 – Discontinued Operations to the accompanying consolidated financial \nstatements for additional information.\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of $8.0 million compared to $28.5 million net loss for the same period in 2021. As of \nDecember 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $206.0 million. \nRoyalty Revenue\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded royalty revenue of $3.1 million and $12.3 million, respectively. Royalty revenue for \nthe period covered by this report reflects revenue recorded only prior to the second quarter of 2022 due to our Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement \nwith HCR (see Note 8). As a result of the amendment, we ceased reporting as royalty revenue, royalties paid by Pfizer to HCR related to Pfizer’s sales of \nRUXIENCE. The royalty revenue from Pfizer related to a Collaboration and License Agreement (Definitive Agreement) acquired by Aptevo as part of our \nspin-off from Emergent in 2016. The agreement was originally executed by Trubion Pharmaceuticals, which was subsequently acquired by Emergent, and \nWyeth, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. \nOn March 30, 2021, we entered into and closed a Royalty Purchase Agreement with an entity managed by HCR pursuant to which we sold to HCR \nthe right to receive royalty payments made by Pfizer in respect of net sales of RUXIENCE. Under the terms of the Royalty Purchase Agreement, the \nCompany received $35 million at closing and we are eligible to receive additional payments in the aggregate of up to an additional $32.5 million based on \nthe achievement of sales milestones in 2021, 2022 and 2023. We received the 2021 milestone payments in the collective amount of $10 million on March 8, \n2022. The proceeds from these milestone payments, net of transaction costs, were recorded as an additional liability related to the sale of royalties on the \nconsolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022. \nDue to the nature of the transaction, which included a cap on HCR’s rate of return, constituting continuing involvement under the Collaboration and \nLicense Agreement originally between Trubion and Wyeth, we recorded a liability related to the proceeds received from HCR of $35.0 million, net of \ntransaction costs of $1.1 million. Further, we received proceeds related to the 2021 milestone of $10.0 million, net of transaction costs of $0.5 million, and \nrecorded additional liability related to sale of royalties. We recognized royalty revenue on net sales of RUXIENCE and recorded the royalty payments to \nHCR as a reduction of the liability when paid.\nIn order to non-dilutively address a Nasdaq listing compliance matter, on June 7, 2022, we entered into and closed an amendment to the Royalty \nPurchase Agreement (the Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement), pursuant to which we agreed to forego our right to receive 50% of incremental \nRUXIENCE royalty revenue after HCR received aggregate royalty payments totaling 190% of the Investment Amount plus Milestone Amounts to the \nextent paid by \n65"

The Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement eliminated all of our continuing involvement with the cash generating activities related to the \nroyalties and removed all restrictions related to HCR’s rate of return and therefore was accounted for under ASC 610-20, Gains and Losses from \nDerecognition of Nonfinancial Assets and ASC 405-20, Liabilities – Extinguishment of Liabilities, resulting in recognition of  $37.2 million gain, which \nwas the total balance of the liability related to the sale of royalties on the closing date.

These expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with our research and development \nactivities, including conducting non-clinical studies and clinical trials, fees to professional service providers for analytical testing, consulting costs, \nindependent monitoring or other administration of our clinical trials and obtaining and evaluating data from our clinical trials and non-clinical studies, as\nwell as costs of contract manufacturing services for clinical trial material, and costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development.\nWe expect our research and development spending will be dependent upon such factors as the results from our clinical trials, the availability of \nreimbursement of research and development spending, the number of product candidates under development, the size, structure and duration of any clinical \nprograms that we may initiate, and the costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates on a large-scale basis for later stage clinical trials. We \nmay experience interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as site initiation, patient enrollment and clinical trial site monitoring, and key non-clinical \nactivities due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While a number of our programs are still in the preclinical trial phase, we do not provide a breakdown \nof the initial associated expenses as we are often evaluating multiple product candidates simultaneously.

The decrease was primarily due to lower spending on preclinical projects and employee costs. The decrease was partially \noffset by higher spending on our APVO436 Phase 1b clinical trial and getting ALG.APV-527 ready for entry into the clinic.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs and professional fees in support of our executive, business \ndevelopment, finance, accounting, information technology, legal and human resource functions. Other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in \nresearch and development expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.8 million, to $13.9 million from $14.7 million for the \nyear ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee and consulting costs and no costs related to responding to a stockholder \nactivism matter.\n66"

In exchange for removing the termination option, we received six months of free rent.  As a result, \nwe recorded an additional $4.4 million of lease liability and right-of-use asset on the consolidated balance sheet in May 2022.\nWe have a non-exclusive Commercial Platform License Agreement with OMT (OMT License Agreement\") for certain transgenic rodents of OMT's \nOmniAb platform. Our OMT License Agreement obligates us to make milestone and royalty payments upon achievement of certain regulatory approvals \nand commercialization of our product candidates. APVO436 and APVO603 are the product candidates currently subject to this agreement. Pursuant to our \nagreement, we expect to make $2,000,000 milestone payment upon dosing the first patient in our Phase 2 clinical trial of APVO436, which we expect to \ninitiate in the second half of 2023.\nOn August 5, 2020, we entered into a new Credit Agreement, with MidCap Financial which was subsequently amended. The Credit Agreement \nprovided us with up to $25 million of available borrowing capacity. The MidCap Financial loan has a 48 month term, is interest-only for the first 18 \nmonths, with straight-line amortization for the remaining 30 months and bears interest at a rate of one month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus \n6.25% per annum, subject to a 1.50% LIBOR floor and a 2.50% LIBOR cap. On March 30, 2021, we amended our Credit Agreement with MidCap \nFinancial and used $10 million of the proceeds received from the Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR to pay down the outstanding principal under this \nagreement from $25 million to $15 million. Additionally, the Company used the $10 million milestone payment received on March 8, 2022, pursuant to our \nRoyalty Purchase Agreement with HCR to further pay down the outstanding principal down to $5 million.\nOn June 7, 2022, the Company further amended its Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial to obtain MidCap Financial’s limited consent to \namend its Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR. The Limited Consent and Second Amendment to Credit Agreement did not change future cash flows or \nother terms of the Credit Agreement.\nAdditionally, on August 30, 2022, we amended our Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial to replace the LIBOR benchmark with Secured \nOvernight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Aptevo amended our Credit Agreement due to the United \nKingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) planned phase-out of one-month US Dollar LIBOR settings in 2023. Our Credit Agreement continues to \nbear base interest at a rate of 6.25% per annum plus SOFR, subject to a 1.50% SOFR floor and a 2.50% SOFR cap.\n72"

      "text": "Our principal commitments include obligations under vendor contracts to purchase research services and other purchase commitments with our \nvendors. In the normal course of business, we enter into services agreements with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations \nand other third parties. Generally, these agreements provide for termination upon notice, with specified amounts due upon termination based on the timing \nof termination and the terms of the agreement. The actual amounts and timing of payments under these agreements are uncertain and contingent upon the \ninitiation and completion of the services to be provided.\nCritical Accounting Policies, and Significant Judgments, and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) \nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our \nestimates on historical experience and on various other factors. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual results may \ndiffer materially from our estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. An accounting policy is considered critical if it is important \nto a company’s financial condition and results of operations and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of \nmanagement in its application. \nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in \nthis report, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated \nfinancial statements.\nLiability Related to Sale of Royalties and Other Income (Expense)\nOn June 7, 2022, we amended our Royalty Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to forego our right to receive 50% of incremental \nRUXIENCE royalty revenue after HCR received aggregate royalty payments totaling 190% of the Investment Amount plus Milestone Amounts to the \nextent paid by HCR. The Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement eliminated all of our continuing involvement with the cash generating activities \nrelated to the royalties and removed all restrictions related to HCR’s rate of return and therefore was accounted for under ASC 610-20, Gains and Losses \nfrom Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets and ASC 405-20, Liabilities – Extinguishment of Liabilities, resulting in recognition of a $37.2 million gain, \nwhich was the total balance of the liability related to the sale of royalties on the closing date.\nPrior to the Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement, we accounted for the Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR, including future milestone \npayments to be received, as a debt-like instrument within the scope of ASC 470-10-25, Debt – Sales of Future Revenues or Various Other Measures of \nIncome. We recorded the proceeds from the Royalty Purchase Agreement as a liability related to the sale of royalties, net of transaction costs, and \namortized the balance using the effective interest method. To determine the amortization of the liability, the Company estimated the total amount of future \nnet royalty payments over the life of the arrangement. The total amount of net royalty payments over the life of the arrangement, less the net proceeds \nreceived, were recorded as non-cash interest expense over the life of the arrangement using the effective interest method. The actual effective interest rate \nwas affected by the amount and timing of the net royalty payments received by HCR and changes in the Company’s royalty forecasts. The Company \nengaged third party consultant services in estimating total future net royalty payments and assessed the effective interest rate by comparing projected net \nroyalty payments to actual and adjusts the effective interest rate retrospectively. Milestone payments were recorded as additions to the liability related to the \nsale of royalties, net of transaction costs. While we believe our estimates were reasonable, there were differences between actual net royalty payments and \nour projections. Historically, differences between estimated and actual net royalty payments were not material.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs primarily consist of internal labor costs, fees paid to \noutside service providers and the costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development. Other research and development expenses include \nfacility, maintenance, and related support expenses.\nA substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical studies have been performed by third-party contract research organizations \n(CRO). We review the activities performed by the CROs each period. For preclinical studies, the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the \npercentage of work completed to date and \n73"

Our estimates are highly dependent upon the timeliness and accuracy of the data provided by our CROs regarding the status of each \nprogram and total program spending and adjustments are made when deemed necessary.\nStock-Based Compensation\nUnder ASC 718, Compensation—Stock-based Compensation, we measure and recognize compensation expense for restricted stock units (RSUs), \nand stock options granted to our employees and directors based as of the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is \nestimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that requires management to apply judgment and make estimates, including:\n•\nthe expected term of the stock option award, which we calculate using the simplified method, as permitted by the SEC Staff Accounting \nBulletin No. 110, Share-Based Payment, as we have insufficient historical information regarding our stock options to provide a basis for an \nestimate;\n•\nthe expected volatility of our underlying common stock, which we estimate based on the historical volatility of a representative group of \npublicly traded biopharmaceutical companies with similar characteristics to us, and our own historical and implied future volatility;\n•\nthe risk-free interest rate, which we based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury securities with periods commensurate with the expected term \nof the options being valued;\n•\nthe expected dividend yield, which we estimate to be zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present \nintention to pay cash dividends; and\n•\nthe fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.\nStock-based compensation expense for RSUs, and stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is \ngenerally the vesting period of the respective award. We are required to estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for our \nawards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures since the adoption of our equity award plan. We routinely evaluate the \nappropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and expectations of future option exercise \nbehavior.\nItem 7A.

      "text": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n \nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of \nAptevo Therapeutics Inc. \n \nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the \nrelated consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in stockholders’ equity for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively \nreferred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the \nconsolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the \nyears then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n \nBasis for Opinion\n \nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s \nconsolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \n(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the \napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable \nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not \nrequired to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an \nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal \ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n \nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or \nfraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and \ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis \nfor our opinion.\n \nCritical Audit Matter\n \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated \nfinancial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter \nin any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, \nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n \nLiability Related to Sale of Royalties and Other Income\n \nAs described in Note 8, the Company previously entered into a royalty purchase agreement (the Royalty Purchase Agreement) in 2021 with an entity \nmanaged by HealthCare Royalty Management, LLC (HCR), through which the Company sold the right to receive royalty payments made by Pfizer Inc. in \nrespect of global net sales of RUXIENCE. The Company initially received $35 million at the closing of the Royalty Purchase Agreement and was eligible \nto receive additional payments in aggregate of up to an additional $32.5 million based on the achievement of RUXIENCE sales milestones in 2021, 2022, \nand 2023. Due to the nature of the transaction, which included a cap on HCR’s rate of return which constituted continuing involvement, the Company \nrecorded a liability related to the proceeds (net of \n76"

      "text": "transaction costs) received from HCR, which was reduced by the royalty revenue recognized on net sales of RUXIENCE when received. On June 7, 2022, \nthe Company entered into an Amendment to the Royalty Purchase Agreement which eliminated all of the Company’s continuing involvement, resulting in \nthe Company derecognizing the liability and recognizing a $37.2 million gain, which represented the total balance of the liability on the closing date. \nFuture milestone payments are accounted for as variable consideration and recognized using the most likely method in accordance with ASC 610-20 Other \nIncome — Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets. The proceeds from 2022 milestones of $2.5 million were recorded as other \nincome in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n \nWe identified the Amendment to the Royalty Purchase Agreement as a critical audit matter given the Company applied significant judgment in determining \nthe appropriate accounting treatment for the transaction. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort, including the \nuse of individuals with specialized skill, in performing procedures and evaluating whether the transaction had been properly accounting for in accordance \nwith the relevant accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\n \nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n \n•\nObtaining and evaluating all relevant contract source documents.\n \n•\nIn consultation with our professional practice group, evaluating the accounting treatment for the Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement \nunder the relevant accounting guidance.\n \n•\nTesting the inputs to the calculation and the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations of the gain from extinguishment of the liability \nrelated to sale of royalties in the consolidated financial statements.\n \n•\nEvaluating all cash milestone payments received from HCR through issuance of the consolidated financial statements for proper inclusion as \nother income in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n \n \n/s/ Moss Adams LLP\n \nSeattle, Washington\nMarch 30, 2023\n \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.\n77"

Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Liquidity\nAptevo Therapeutics Inc. (Aptevo, we, us, or the Company) is a clinical-stage, research and development biotechnology company focused on \ndeveloping novel immunotherapy candidates for the treatment of different forms of cancer. We have developed two versatile and enabling platform \ntechnologies for rational design of precision immune modulatory drugs. Our lead clinical candidates, APVO436 and ALG.APV-527, and preclinical \ncandidates, APVO603 and APVO711, were developed using our ADAPTIR™ modular protein technology platform. Our preclinical candidate APVO442 \nwas developed using our ADAPTIR-FLEX™ modular protein technology platform.  \nWe are currently trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “APVO.”\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes we will continue as a going concern and which \ncontemplates the realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities, and commitments in the normal course of business. For the year ended December 31, \n2022, we had net income of $8.0 million. We had an accumulated deficit of $206.0 million as of December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, \n2022, net cash used in our operating activities was $21.0 million. We have suffered recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from \noperating activities. We have suffered recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities. We believe that our existing cash \nresources, milestone payments related to the Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR, funds available under the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park and \nthe Equity Distribution Agreement with Piper Sandler, cash to be generated from future deferred payments and milestones related to IXINITY sales and \nregulatory approvals achieved by Medexus, and contingent considerations to be received from Kamada Ltd. (previously Saol), will be sufficient to meet our \nprojected operating requirements and debt service for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. We may choose to raise\nadditional funds to support our operating and capital needs in the future.\nWe continue to face significant challenges and uncertainties and, as a result, our available capital resources may be consumed more rapidly than \ncurrently expected due to: (a) changes we may make to the business that affect ongoing operating expenses; (b) changes we may make in our business \nstrategy; (c) changes we may make in our research and development spending plans; (d) potential decreases in our expected milestone and deferred \npayments from Medexus with respect to IXINITY; (e) whether and to what extent future milestone payments are received under our Royalty Purchase \nAgreement; (f) macroeconomic conditions such as rising interest rates, inflation and costs; and (g) other items affecting our forecasted level of expenditures\nand use of cash resources. We may obtain additional funding through our existing equity Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park or our Equity Distribution \nAgreement with Piper Sandler, or attempt to obtain other public or private financing, collaborative or licensing arrangements with strategic partners, or \nthrough credit lines or other debt financing sources to increase the funds available to fund operations. However, we may not be able to secure such funding \nin a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may \nexperience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we \nraise additional funds through collaboration, licensing, or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our potential \nproducts or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Without additional funds, we may be forced to delay, scale \nback, or eliminate some of our research and development activities or other operations and potentially delay product development in an effort to provide \nsufficient funds to continue our operations. If any of these events occurs, our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals may be \nadversely affected. Given the continuing global economic and geopolitical climate, including rising interest rates and stock market volatility, we may \nexperience delays or difficulties in the financing environment and raising capital due to economic uncertainty. \n82"

      "text": "Basis of Presentation\n \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). \nThese consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the \nCompany’s financial position. \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \namounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. \nActual results could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our wholly owned subsidiary, Aptevo Research and Development \nLLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and \nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. \nEstimates are used for, but not limited to, forecasted royalties, effective interest rates, clinical accruals, useful lives of equipment, commitments and \ncontingencies, stock-based compensation, and incremental borrowing rate (IBR) used for our lease. Given the global economic climate and additional or \nunforeseen effects from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these estimates are becoming more challenging, and actual results could differ materially from \nthose estimates.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase and include time deposits and investments \nin money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions. \nRestricted Cash \nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had current restricted cash of $0 and $1.3 million related to securing letters of credit. We classify our \nrestricted cash as either current or non-current based on the term of the underlying letters of credit. \nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject Aptevo to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, certain \ninvestments and royalty and milestone receivable. Aptevo places its cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions and may maintain \ncash balances in excess of insured limits. Management believes that the financial risks associated with its cash and cash equivalents are minimal.\nThe royalty and milestone receivable relates to our Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR. We do not believe that Aptevo is \nexposed to significant credit risk related to royalty and milestone receivable due to the credit quality and history of collections from HCR.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\n \nFurniture and equipment\n7-10 years\nSoftware and hardware\n3-5 years or product life\nLeasehold improvements\nLesser of the asset life or the remaining lease term\n \n83"

      "text": "Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting \ngain or loss is credited or charged to operations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n \nLeases\n \nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception date. Leases are to be classified as finance or operating leases at the lease commencement \ndate, which affects the classification of expense recognition in the consolidated statement of operations. Right-of-use assets represent the right to use an \nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments, as agreed to in the lease. Operating lease liabilities \nand the corresponding right-of-use assets are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at \ncommencement date. An operating right-of-use asset is measured as the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, adjusted for prepaid or \naccrued lease payments, the remaining balance of any lease incentive received, unamortized initial direct costs, and any impairment of the right-of-use \nasset. The initial measurement of the lease liabilities and right-to-use assets of finance leases is the same as for operating leases. We include options to \nextend the lease and certain termination options in our lease liability and right-of-use asset when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options.\nAs our existing leases do not contain an implicit interest rate, we estimate our IBR based on information available at commencement date in \ndetermining the present value of future payments. Due to the significant judgment involved and the complex analysis needed to determine this discount \nrate, we engaged a third-party valuation specialist to advise us in our determination of our IBR for the initial adoption of the standard and subsequent \namendment of our office lease. \nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of our selling, general and administrative \nexpenses and our research and development expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. Lease expense for financing leases consists of \namortization of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease liability as part of our research and development expenses on our consolidated statements of \noperations.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe measure and record cash equivalents at fair value in the accompanying financial statements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that \nwould be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, an exit price, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly \ntransaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable \ninputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThe carrying amounts of our short-term financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, royalty and milestone receivable and \naccounts payable, approximate their fair value due to their short maturities.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nAptevo defers costs related to debt issuance and amortizes these costs to interest expense over the term of the debt, using the effective interest \nmethod. Debt issuance costs are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of the carrying amount of the debt liability.\nDebt Modification\nOn March 30, 2021, we amended our Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial (First Amendment to Credit Agreement) and used $10 million of the \nproceeds received from the Royalty Purchase Agreement to pay down the outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement from $25 million to $15 \nmillion. The amended Credit Agreement was accounted for under ASC 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments as a debt modification, rather than \nan extinguishment, based on a comparison of the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the debt immediately before and after the amendment, \nwhich resulted in a change of less than 10%. Unamortized issuance costs as of the date of modification will be amortized to interest expense using the \neffective interest method over the repayment term. \n84"

      "text": "On June 7, 2022, we further amended the Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial (Limited Consent and Second Amendment to Credit \nAgreement) to obtain MidCap Financial’s limited consent to amend the Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR. The Limited Consent and Second \nAmendment to Credit Agreement did not change future cash flows or other terms of the Credit Agreement.\nAdditionally, on August 30, 2022, we amended our Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial (Third Amendment to Credit Agreement) to replace \nthe LIBOR benchmark with SOFR, which is regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We amended our Credit Agreement due to FCA's \nplanned phase-out of one-month US Dollar LIBOR settings in 2023. Our Credit Agreement continues to bear base interest at a rate of 6.25% per annum \nplus SOFR, subject to a 1.50% SOFR floor and a 2.50% SOFR cap.\nLiability Related to Sale of Royalties and Other Income (Expense)\n \nOn March 30, 2021, we entered into and closed a Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR pursuant to which we sold to HCR the right to receive \nroyalty payments made by Pfizer in respect of net sales of RUXIENCE. Under the terms of the Royalty Purchase Agreement, we received $35 million at \nclosing and we are eligible to receive additional payments in the aggregate of up to an additional $32.5 million based on the achievement of sales \nmilestones in 2021, 2022 and 2023. \nOn the date we entered into the transaction, we accounted for the Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR as a debt-like instrument, amortized under \nthe effective interest rate method over the life of the related expected royalty stream. The liabilities related to the sale of royalties and the debt amortization \nwere based on our estimates of royalties expected to be paid over the life of the arrangement. We received the 2021 milestone payments in the collective \namount of $10 million on March 8, 2022. The proceeds from these milestone payments, net of transaction costs, were recorded as an additional liability \nrelated to the sale of royalties on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022 pursuant to ASC 470-10-25, Debt – Sales of Future Revenues or \nVarious Other Measures of Income. \nOn June 7, 2022, we entered into and closed an amendment to the Royalty Purchase Agreement (the Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement) \n(see Note 8) which removed all restrictions related to HCR’s rate of return, and it is no longer a sale of a specified percentage of royalty revenue. The \nAmendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement was accounted for under ASC 610-20, Gains and Losses from Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets and ASC \n405-20, Liabilities – Extinguishment of Liabilities and the transaction is no longer considered a debt-like financing. \nAs a result of the Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement, the Company recognized a gain of $37.2 million, which was the total balance of \nliability related to the sale of royalties on the closing date. The Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement allowed us to regain full compliance with \nNasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) in a way that was non-dilutive for our shareholders. No royalty revenue on net sales of RUXIENCE that are paid by Pfizer \nto HCR has been recognized subsequent to when we entered into the Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement. The royalty revenue included in the\nconsolidated statements of operations reflects revenue recorded only prior to the second quarter of 2022 due to our Amendment to Royalty Purchase \nAgreement. Future Milestone Amounts will be accounted for as variable consideration and recognized as other income when such milestones are earned \nusing the most likely method in accordance with ASC 610-20 Other Income — Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets. We \nreceived 2022 milestone payment of $2.5 million on February 28, 2023. The proceed from 2022 milestone payment was recorded as other income in the \nconsolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company is eligible to receive additional milestone payment of $10 \nmillion based on achievement of sales milestones in 2023.\nRoyalty Revenue\nWe recognized revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). \nUnder ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration \nthat the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are \nwithin the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance \nobligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) \nrecognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\n85"

      "text": "RUXIENCE Royalty Revenue\nAptevo’s royalty revenue exclusively related to royalties on Pfizer’s net sales of RUXIENCE. Royalty revenue for the period covered by this report \nreflects revenue recorded only prior to the second quarter of 2022 due to our Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR (see Note 8). As a \nresult of the Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement, we ceased reporting as royalty revenue, royalties paid by Pfizer to HCR related to Pfizer’s sales \nof RUXIENCE. \nWe recognized royalty revenue under ASC 606, which provides revenue recognition constraints by requiring the recognition of revenue at the later \nof the following: (1) when the subsequent sale or usage occurs or (2) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-\nbased royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).  We satisfied our performance obligation prior to the period covered by this \nreport, specifically in May 2011 when the original Collaboration and License Agreement between Trubion Pharmaceuticals and Wyeth was amended to \nremove the exclusivity/non-compete restrictions so that Pfizer could develop a CD20 biosimilar product in exchange for a one-time payment of $2.5 \nmillion and future royalties of 2.5% on any CD20 biosimilar product commercialized by Pfizer in the future. We do not have future performance \nobligations under this agreement. We applied the royalty recognition constraint required under the guidance for sales-based royalties, which requires a \nsales-based royalty to be recorded no sooner than the underlying sale. Therefore, royalties on sales of products commercialized by Pfizer were recognized \nin the quarter the product is sold.\nGiven the royalty revenues were based on 2.5% of global net sales of RUXIENCE, the considerations were considered variable. Pfizer generally \nreported sales information to us within 60 days of quarter end. Unless we received finalized sales information for the respective quarter, we estimated the \nexpected royalty proceeds based on an analysis of historical experience, analyst expectations, interim data provided by Pfizer, including their publicly \nannounced sales, and other publicly available information. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenues were adjusted for in the period in \nwhich they became known, typically the following quarter. Revenue recorded in the period covered by this report represents actual royalty revenue given \nthe timing of RUXIENCE sales reports received from Pfizer.  There was no significant financing component to the contract.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs primarily consist of internal labor costs, fees paid to \noutside service providers and the costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development. Other research and development expenses include \nfacility, maintenance, and related support expenses.\nA substantial portion of Aptevo’s preclinical studies and all of its clinical studies have been performed by third-party CROs. The Company reviews \nthe activities performed by the CROs each period. For preclinical studies, the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the percentage of work \ncompleted to date and contract milestones achieved. For clinical study expenses, the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of \npatients enrolled and services provided but not yet invoiced. The Company’s estimates are highly dependent upon the timeliness and accuracy of the data \nprovided by its CROs regarding the status of each program and total program spending and adjustments are made when deemed necessary.\n86"

      "text": "General and Administrative Expenses \nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs and professional fees in support of our executive, business \ndevelopment, finance, accounting, information technology, legal and human resource functions. Other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in \nresearch and development expense.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for restricted stock units (RSUs), and stock options granted to our employees and directors based \non the fair value of the awards as of the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing \nmodel that requires management to apply judgment and make estimates, including:\n•\nthe expected term of the stock option award, which we calculate using the simplified method, as we have insufficient historical information \nregarding our stock options to provide a basis for an estimate;\n•\nthe expected volatility of our underlying common stock, which we estimate based on the historical volatility of the historical and implied \nfuture volatility of our common stock;\n•\nthe risk-free interest rate, which we based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury securities with periods commensurate with the expected term \nof the options being valued;\n•\nthe expected dividend yield, which we estimate to be zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present \nintention to pay cash dividends; and\n•\nthe fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.\nStock-based compensation expense for RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the respective award. Stock-based \ncompensation expense for our stock options, both converted and Aptevo granted, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the \nrespective award. \nWe routinely evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and \nexpectations of future option exercise behavior.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable \nto differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss and tax \ncredit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those \ntemporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nAptevo’s ability to realize deferred tax assets depends upon future taxable income, as well as the limitations discussed below. For financial reporting \npurposes, a deferred tax asset must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will \nnot be realized prior to expiration. Aptevo considers historical and future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable \nincome in prior carryback years, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances. In general, if Aptevo determines that it \nis more likely than not to realize more than the recorded amounts of net deferred tax assets in the future, Aptevo will reverse all or a portion of the \nvaluation allowance established against its deferred tax assets, resulting in a decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period in which the \ndetermination is made. Likewise, if Aptevo determines that it is not more likely than not to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, \nAptevo will establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, with an offsetting increase to the provision for income taxes, in the period in which \nthe determination is made.\n87"

As a result, Aptevo makes certain estimates \nand assumptions, in (1) calculating Aptevo’s income tax expense, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, (2) determining any valuation allowance \nrecorded against deferred tax assets and (3) evaluating the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the interest and penalties related to such \nuncertain tax positions. Aptevo’s estimates and assumptions may differ significantly from tax benefits ultimately realized.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are identified as components of an entity about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the \nchief operating decision maker (CODM), or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The \nCompany's CODM is the Chief Executive Officer, who views the Company's operations as one operating segment, which is discovery and development of \nnovel oncology therapeutics.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform \n(ASC 848) to provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to loan and lease agreements, derivative contracts, and other transactions \naffected by the anticipated transition away from LIBOR toward new interest rate benchmarks. The FCA, which regulates LIBOR, phased out one-week and \ntwo-month US Dollar LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021. All other US Dollar LIBOR settings, including the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-\nmonth and twelve-month, will be phased out on June 30, 2023.\nWe evaluated ASC 848, Reference Rate Reform, as part of our August 30, 2022 amendment to Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial (see Note \n7). The adoption of ASC 848 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2. Discontinued Operations \nThe accompanying financial statements include discontinued operations from two separate transactions: the sale of our hyperimmune business in \n2017, from which we received a payment in March 2021 related to the collection of a certain accounts receivable, and the sale of our Aptevo \nBioTherapeutics LLC business in February 2020.\nOn February 28, 2020, we entered into an LLC Purchase Agreement with Medexus, pursuant to which we sold all of the issued and outstanding \nlimited liability company interests of Aptevo BioTherapeutics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aptevo.

As such the \narrangement is not in the scope of ASC 606 and is instead treated as a collaborative agreement under ASC 808 – Collaborative Arrangements (ASC 808). \nIn accordance with ASC 808, we concluded that because the Collaboration Agreement is a cost sharing agreement, there is no revenue. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded approximately $1.7 million and $0.1 million in our research and development \nexpense related to the collaboration arrangement, respectively.  \nNote 4. Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company’s estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value \naccounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that \nobservable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based \non whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest \npriority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s significant market \nassumptions. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant \nto the measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1— Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\nLevel 2— Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets, that are either directly or indirectly observable; and,\nLevel 3— Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n \nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $21.6 million and $41.2. million in money market funds, respectively. The carrying amounts of our money \nmarket funds approximate their fair value. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities.\nNote 5. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nThe Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase and investments in money \nmarket funds. Restricted cash are time deposits, which include securing letters of credit.\nThe following table shows our cash, cash equivalents and current restricted cash as of December 31, 2022 and  2021:\n \n \n \nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n \n(in thousands)\n \n2022\n   \n2021\n \nCash\n  $\n1,066    $\n3,841 \nCash equivalents\n   \n21,569     \n41,203 \nRestricted cash\n   \n—     \n1,259 \nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n  $\n22,635    $\n46,303 \n \n89"

Our 2020 Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial originally referenced one-month LIBOR and also provided that we may amend \nthe Credit Agreement to reflect an alternative rate of interest upon the phase out of LIBOR. \nOn November 6, 2020, Kevin Tang and his related entities filed a statement on Schedule 13D to report the purchase of 1,760,000 shares of the \nCompany’s common stock, which at the time represented approximately 54% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common \nstock. This acquisition of voting stock triggered a change in control, resulting in an Event of Default under Section 10.1(a)(ii) of the Credit Agreement. On \nNovember 10, 2020, the Company obtained a waiver from MidCap Financial pursuant to which, among other things, MidCap Financial waived such Event \nof Default and MidCap Financial and the Company agreed that an immediate event of default under the Credit Agreement will be deemed to have occurred \nin the event that (a) a majority of the seats on the Company’s board of directors are occupied by persons who were neither (i) nominated by the Company’s \nboard of directors nor (ii) appointed by the directors so nominated, and (b) Tang has appointed the majority of the Company’s board of directors. No other \nevents of default have occurred with respect to the Credit Agreement. \nOn March 30, 2021, we amended our Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial and used $10.0 million of the proceeds received from the Royalty \nPurchase Agreement to pay down the outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement from $25.0 million to $15.0 million. A fee of $0.6 million was paid \nby the Company to MidCap Financial in connection with the amendment in lieu of the formula-based fee previously required. $10.0 million of the \nremaining $15.0 million principal balance was paid on March 29, 2022 and we incurred additional $0.6 million prepayment fees. Beginning March 1, 2022, \nmonthly repayment of the remaining $5.0 million of principal commenced and will continue for the final 30 months of the loan term. The term loan facility \nincludes additional payment provisions if milestones related to IXINITY under the LLC Purchase Agreement with Medexus or royalties related to \nRUXIENCE under the Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR are sold during the term of the loan. If the Company sells the IXINITY deferred payment \nstream and milestones prior to full repayment of this $5.0 million principal amount, under the agreement with MidCap Financial, we will be required to use \nthe proceeds from the sale to pay down the outstanding loan principal balance. MidCap Financial also released its security interest in the RUXIENCE \nroyalty payments. \nThe amended Credit Agreement was accounted for as a debt modification, rather than an extinguishment, based on a comparison of the present \nvalue of the cash flows under the terms of the debt immediately before and after the \n90"

The Limited Consent and Second Amendment to Credit Agreement did not change future cash flows or other \nterms of the Credit Agreement.\nAdditionally, on August 30, 2022, we amended our Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial to replace the LIBOR benchmark with SOFR, which \nis regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We amended our Credit Agreement due to FCA’s planned phase-out of one-month US Dollar \nLIBOR settings in 2023. Our Credit Agreement continues to bear base interest at a rate of 6.25% per annum plus SOFR, subject to a 1.50% SOFR floor and \na 2.50% SOFR cap.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we classified $2.0 million of the $3.5 million principal of the amended Credit Agreement to current portion of long-term \ndebt on the consolidated balance sheet.

Liability Related to Sale of Royalties\nIn March 2021, we entered into and closed the Royalty Purchase Agreement with HCR pursuant to which we sold to HCR the right to receive \nroyalty payments made by Pfizer in respect of global net sales of RUXIENCE. Under the terms of the agreement, we received $35.0 million at closing and \nwe are eligible to receive additional payments in the aggregate of up to an additional $32.5 million based on the achievement of sales milestones in 2021, \n2022 and 2023 (up to $10 million and $12.5 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively and $10 million in 2023).\nDue to the nature of the transaction, which included a cap on HCR’s rate of return, constituting continuing involvement under the Collaboration and \nLicense Agreement originally between Trubion and Wyeth, we recorded a liability related to the proceeds received from HCR of $35.0 million, net of \ntransaction costs of $1.1 million. Further, we received proceeds related to the 2021 milestone of $10.0 million, net of transaction costs of $0.5 million, and \nrecorded additional liability related to sale of royalties. We recognized royalty revenue on net sales of RUXIENCE and recorded the royalty payments to \nHCR as a reduction of the liability when paid. We received the 2021 milestone payments in the collective amount of $10.0 million on March 8, 2022. The \nproceeds from these milestone payments, net of transaction costs, were recorded as an additional liability related to the sale of royalties on the consolidated \nbalance sheet as of March 31, 2022 pursuant to ASC 470-10-25, Debt – Sales of Future Revenues or Various Other Measures of Income.\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). On \nJune 7, 2022, we entered into and closed an amendment to our Royalty Purchase Agreement, resulting in the Company recognizing a $37.2 million gain, \nwhich was the total balance of liability related to the sale of royalties on the closing date. The Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement allowed us to\nregain full compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) in a way that was non-dilutive for our shareholders. Pursuant to the Amendment to Royalty \nPurchase Agreement, we agreed to forego our right to receive 50% of incremental RUXIENCE royalty revenue after HCR received aggregate royalty \npayments totaling 190% of the Investment Amount plus Milestone Amounts to the extent paid by HCR. The Amendment to Royalty Purchase Agreement \neliminated all of our continuing involvement with the cash generating activities related to the royalties and removed all restrictions related to the rate of \nreturn and was therefore accounted for under ASC 610-20, Gains and Losses from Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets and ASC 405-20, Liabilities – \nExtinguishment of Liabilities.\n91"

Leases and Contingencies\nOffice Space Lease – Operating\n \nWe have an operating lease related to our office and laboratory space in Seattle, Washington. This lease was amended in March 2019 to extend the \nterm through April 2030 and provide two options to extend the lease term, each by five years, as well as a one-time option to terminate the lease in April \n2023, with nine months’ notice, or by July 2022. We had previously determined to record lease liability and ROU asset through April 30, 2023 given we \nwere not reasonable certain to not exercise the termination option.\nOn May 26, 2022, we amended our office and laboratory lease to remove the one-time termination option. In exchange for removing the termination \noption, we received six months of free rent. As a result, we recorded an additional $4.4 million of lease liability and right-of-use asset on the consolidated \nbalance sheet on the date of the amendment. As of December 31, 2022, we are not reasonably certain to exercise the two options to extend the lease term.\nTherefore, pursuant to our May 26, 2022, amendment, we recorded our lease liability through April 30, 2030.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively, related to variable expense due to true \nups of operating costs or real estate taxes.\nEquipment Leases - Operating and Financing\nAs of December 31, 2022, we did not have any operating or financing leases for equipment.\n92"

      "text": "Warrants\nIn March 2019, as part of a public offering, we issued warrants to purchase up to 1,725,000 shares of our common stock, 1,571,429 of which have \nan exercise price of $18.20 per share and have a five-year life, and 153,571 of pre-funded warrants with an exercise price of $0.14 per share. The pre-\nfunded warrants had a ten-year life and would have expired on March 11, 2029; however, all of the pre-funded warrants were exercised in March 2019. We \ndetermined the warrants do not meet liability classification pursuant to ASC 480 – Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. These are therefore included \nwithin equity on our consolidated balance sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any of its warrants exercised. For the \nyear ended December 31, 2021, certain of the holders of the Company’s warrants exercised warrants with a strike price of $18.20 per share, resulting in the \nissuance of 54,105 shares of the Company’s common stock and aggregate proceeds to the Company of approximately $1.0 million. As of December 31, \n2022, there were warrants to purchase 350,589 shares of common stock outstanding. \nNote 12. 401(k) Savings Plan\nAptevo has established a defined contribution savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. The 401(k) Plan covers \nall employees. Under the 401(k) Plan, employees may make elective salary deferrals. Aptevo currently provides for matching of qualified deferrals up to \n50% of 401(k) employee deferral contributions, based on a maximum employee deferral rate of 6% of compensation. During the year ended December 31, \n2022 and 2021, Aptevo’s related share of matching contributions was approximately $0.2 million. \nNote 13.

Based on the Company’s history \nof operating losses, including a three-year cumulative loss position as of December 31, 2022, the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that \nthe benefit of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company provided a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. The valuation allowance decreased by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in the valuation \nallowance during the year ended December 31, 2022 was due primarily to a decrease in deferred tax assets resulting from the current year write-off of DTA \nrelated to the sale of the Company’s RUXIENCE royalty rights to HCR and decrease in Section 163(j) limitation, which was utilized at return time, the \nimpact of which was partially offset by orphan drug credit generated during the period, Section 174 capitalized research expenditures, and the generation of \nfederal and state NOLs during the period.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have recorded gross federal net operating losses (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $156.2 and $159.6 \nmillion, respectively, gross state NOL carryforwards of approximately $71.1 and $70.3 million, respectively, and tax credit carryforwards of $4.9 million \nand $3.3 million, respectively. Approximately $15.1 million of  federal losses and credits would begin to expire in 2037, while $141.1 million of federal \nlosses may be carried forward indefinitely. The state net operating losses will begin to expire in varying periods.\nThe Company completed an IRC Section 382/383 study on its federal and state tax attributes based on an ownership change that occurred during \n2021. Based on the study, there are not any permanent limitations on our ability to use federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. We \nmay experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an \nownership change occurs in the future, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and credits could be limited.\n99"
