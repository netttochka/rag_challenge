The remarkable achievement is even \nmore important as it coincided with the Group’s fifti-\neth-anniversary celebration and was accomplished \namidst significant market uncertainties that surfaced \nover the past year. The Group’s growth was well-bal-\nanced across all its geographies and key business \nsegments. Highlights show a positive performance in \nthe Americas region, up by over 18%, followed by a \nrobust growth in EMEAI and APAC.\nThe Retail industry, where the Group boasts a promi­\nnent global position, stands out for its impressive \nresults. Revenue in the segment increased by 12.5% \nYoY, with a strong rise in Asia (+33.9%) and in Amer-\nicas (+29.4%), driven mainly by the investments in \nself-checkout systems by large retailers. Manufac-\nturing also delivered a strong performance, achieving \na YoY growth of 8.4% overall, thanks to the expansion \nof the range of sensors and safety devices, resulting \nfrom the acquisition of the MD Group in 2021. Amer-\nicas (+28.1%) and EMEAI (+11.4%) highly contributed \nto this performance. Lastly, Transportation & Logis-\ntics grew by 12.9% versus 2021, with growth rates of \n+26.5% in the Americas and +13.1% in EMEAI, thanks \nto relevant orders from major shipping and logistics \ncompanies.\nAlthough the year was marked by geopolitical ten-\nsions, a severe energy crisis, electronic component \nshortages and rapidly increasing global inflation, the \nGroup’s year-end results were remarkably ­positive, \nachieved through tenacity and competence.

These trends, while gradually easing in the second half of the year, basically increased production and dis-\ntribution costs for the entire year and deteriorated the Group’s industrial margins, despite the partial mitigation \nresulting from gradual sales price adjustment actions.\nOwing to the abovementioned trends, adjusted EBIT stood at 7.5% of revenue and amounted to €49.1 million \n(€58.2 million at December 31, 2021). \nNet profit for the year amounted to €30.1 million (4.6% of revenue) versus €39.5 million in the prior year (6.6% \nof revenue). \nNet Financial Debt stood at €42.0 million at December 31, 2022 (€26.1 million at December 31, 2021), deterio-\nrating by €15.9 million. \nAlternative performance indicators (NON-GAAP measures)\nManagement uses certain performance indicators, not identified as accounting measures under IFRS (NON-\nGAAP measures), to provide a clearer picture of the Group’s performance.

This assessment is updated periodically and is \ngrounded in the type of activities carried out (basically components assembly) at the Group’s factories, as well as \nin the maturity of the Environmental Management Systems implemented at all major production sites (Italy, Viet-\nnam, Slovakia and Hungary). Mention should also be made that to date, the Group’s production sites have never \nbeen affected or damaged by natural phenomena attributable to ongoing climate change. To date therefore, the \nGroup does not envision a high risk profile from climate change.

To cope with this risk, the \nPurchasing department constantly monitors the market in order to identify alternative suppliers, providing where \npossible potential replacements for supplies deemed strategic (supplier risk management program).

Datalogic \nhas therefore strengthened the mitigation process with the planning of loss prevention engineering activities on \nthe basis of internationally recognised standards, aimed at reducing the risk of such events as much as possible, \nas well as implementing protections aimed at limiting their impacts, with the continuous consolidation of the \ncurrent operational continuity in the Group’s production sites.\nInformation Technology\nDatalogic considers the operational continuity of IT systems to be crucial and has implemented risk mitigation \nmeasures to ensure network connectivity, data availability and security, while ensuring the processing of per-\nsonal data in relation to the European GDPR and the national regulations applicable in the individual EU member \ncountries. To this end, Datalogic has implemented an Information Security Management System (ISMS) and ob-\ntained two ISO 27001 certificates.\nDatalogic also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Postal Police for the purpose of combating \ncybercrime and sharing information and set up an interdepartmental committee (Cybersecurity Committee), \ncomposed of representatives of various company functions, for analysis and management of cyber risks linked \nto products and business areas. Additionally, to ensure compliance with the data and information protection \nrequirements along the entire value chain, Datalogic has adopted a supplementary document (SAA - Security \nAccess Agreement) for supply contracts, with the security requirements for guaranteeing company resources, to \nensure proper management of IT risks associated with critical suppliers.\nEnvironment, Safety and Health\nThe Group is exposed to risks related to health, safety in the workplace, and the environment, which can fall into \nthe following cases:\n \n\u001f poor protection of the health and safety of employees, which can materialise with the occurrence of serious \naccidents or occupational diseases;\n \n\u001f environmental pollution linked, for example, to uncontrolled emissions, inadequate waste disposal or the \nspillage of hazardous substances on land;\n \n\u001f non-compliance or incomplete compliance with sector regulations and laws, also in relation to the regulatory \nvolatility of some countries.\nAny occurrence of these events may result in penal and/or administrative sanctions or financial outlays for Data-\nlogic, the amount of which could be significant. Additionally, in particularly critical cases, the actions of the con-\ntrolling public bodies may interfere with normal production activities, even potentially stopping the production \nlines or closing the production site itself. Datalogic addresses this type of risk with a continuous and systematic \nassessment of its specific risks and with the consequent reduction and elimination of those deemed unaccept-\nable. All this is organized within a Management System (which refers to the international standards ISO 14001 \nand OHSAS 18001 and is certified by an independent third party) that includes both health and safety in the work-\nplace and environmental matters.\nWith regard to other compliance risks, reference is made to the Datalogic Report on Corporate Governance and \nOwnership Structure available on the Datalogic website."

The Group has no offices in the countries currently directly affected by the conflict, nor do they represent \nsignificant outlet or supply markets for it. The conflict contributed, however, to the increase in inflationary pres-\nsure in 2022, with particular regard to energy and certain commodity prices, and to market uncertainty, with a \nreflection on rising interest rates. \nThe increase in the energy component had a minor impact on the Group’s results, as the related production pro-\ncesses are mainly assembly-related and therefore not marked by high energy consumption. Mention should also \nbe made that the Group’s debt is mostly fixed-rate.\nThe potential effects of this situation on the Group’s income and financial results are constantly monitored.\nSince the outbreak of the conflict and the adoption of sanctions by the EU against Russia, a cross-functional \nworking group has been established to assess and ascertain (including monitoring of “Denied Parties”), from a \ntechnical point of view, which Datalogic products and which business partner relationships could potentially be \nsubject to sanctions. Following entry into force of the ninth European sanctions package, the Group companies \nhave suspended all sales and post-sales activities with Russia (trade with Belarus had already been blocked) and \nimplemented control systems in order to prevent business transactions with sanctioned countries."

Reference is made \nto the section describing the main estimates made in these Consolidated financial statements.\n \nThe Accounting Standards were uniformly applied to all Group companies and for all periods presented.\nThis Consolidated Annual Financial Report is drawn up in Euro thousands, which is the Group’s “functional” and \n“presentation” currency as envisaged by IAS 21.\n3) Consolidation standards and policies \nSubsidiaries\nControl is obtained when the Group is exposed or entitled to variable returns, arising from its relationship with \nthe investee and, concurrently, has the ability to affect those returns by exercising its power over that entity, as \nenvisaged by IFRS 10. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if the Group has:\n \n\u001f power over the investee (i.e., holds valid rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities \nof the investee);\n \n\u001f exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee;\n \n\u001f the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of its returns. \nThere is generally the assumption that a majority of voting rights involves control. To corroborate this assump-\ntion, and when the Group holds less than the majority of voting rights (or similar rights), the Group considers all \nrelevant facts and circumstances in order to define whether it controls the investee, including: \n \n\u001f contractual arrangements with other vote holders; \n \n\u001f rights arising from contractual agreements; \n \n\u001f voting rights and potential voting rights of the Group."

An investee is consolidated when \nthe Group obtains its control and the consolidation ends when the Group loses control. Assets, liabilities, revenue \nand costs of the investee acquired or sold during the year are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements \nat the date on which the Group obtains control until the date on which the Group no longer exercises control over \nthe entity.\nIn order to ensure consistency with the Group accounting criteria, when necessary, the financial statements of \nthe investees are adequately adjusted. All assets and liabilities, Equity, revenue, costs and intercompany cash \nflows related to transactions between Group entities are entirely derecognised when consolidated.\nChanges in interests in a subsidiary that do not result in loss of control are accounted for in Equity.\nIf the Group loses control over an investee, all related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling in-\nterests and other items in Equity must be derecognised, while any possible profit or loss will be recognised in the \nIncome Statement. Any retained interest must be recognised at fair value.\nMutual debt and credit and cost and revenue transactions, between companies within the consolidation scope, as \nwell as the effects of all significant transactions between them, are derecognised. Specifically, unrealized gains \nwith third parties from transactions between Group companies, including those arising from the valuation at the \nbalance sheet date of inventory, were derecognised, if any.\nBusiness combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted through the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is the acqui-\nsition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the amount of the non-controlling interest held. For \neach business combination, the Group assesses whether to measure any non-controlling interest in the acquiree \nat fair value or in proportion to the non-controlling interest’s share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The \nacquisition costs are recognised in the year and classified under administrative expense.\nIf the business combination is carried out in more than one step, the investment previously held is recalculated at \nfair value at the acquisition date and any resulting profit or loss is recognised in the Income Statement. \nAny contingent consideration, to be recognised, is measured by the purchaser at fair value on the acquisition \ndate. The change in fair value of the contingent consideration classified as financial asset or liability must be rec-\nognised in the Income Statement. \nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, which is the excess of the consideration paid, as compared to the fair value \nof the net identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities undertaken by the Group. If the fair value of the net as-\nsets acquired exceeds the total consideration paid, the Group checks again whether it has correctly identified all \nthe assets acquired and liabilities incurred and reviews the procedures adopted to determine the amounts to be \nrecorded at the acquisition date. If the new measurement still shows a fair value of the net assets acquired that \nis higher than the consideration, the difference (profit) is recognised in the Income Statement. \nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the \npurpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, from the acqui-\nsition date, to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies \nof the combination, regardless of whether other assets or liabilities of the target company are assigned to \nthose units."

Significant influence is presumed to apply when the Group holds 20% to 50% of \nvoting rights at Shareholders’ Meetings. Failing so, the Group assesses specific facts and circumstances to verify \nthe presence of significant influence.\nInvestments in associates are measured at equity. Under this method, the investment in an associate is initially \nrecognised according to the above acquisition method and the book value is increased or decreased to recognise \nthe investor’s share of the profit and loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. Goodwill related to the as-\nsociate is included in the book value of the investment and is not subject to amortisation.\nThe Group’s share of associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the Income Statement, where-\nas its post-acquisition share of changes in reserves is recognised in reserves. Cumulative post-acquisition chang-\nes are included in the book value of the investment. \nUnrealized profits relating to transactions between the Group and its associates are derecognised in proportion \nto the Group’s interests in such associates. Unrealized losses are also derecognised unless the loss is considered \nto represent impairment of the assets transferred. The accounting standards adopted by associates are adapted \nwhen necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\nUpon losing significant influence over an associate, the Group measures and recognises the residual investment \nat fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the investment on the date that significant influence \nis lost, as well as the fair value of the residual investment and the consideration received must be recognised in \nthe Income Statement.\n4) Translation criteria of foreign currency financial statements\nFinancial statements prepared in currencies other than the currency in which the Group’s consolidated financial \nstatements are presented, i.e. the Euro, are consolidated using the method described above, subject to transla-\ntion into Euro. The translation is carried out as follows:\n \n\u001f the assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rates in force at the consolidated balance sheet \ndate;\n \n\u001f costs and revenue are translated at the average exchange rate for the year;\n \n\u001f exchange rate differences generated from the translation of income statement items at a rate different from \nthe closing rate and from the translation of opening equity at an exchange rate different from the closing \nrate of the reporting year, are recognised as an item of comprehensive income under “Translation Reserve”; \nthis reserve is recognised in full in the income statement in the year in which the Group relinquishes or loses \ncontrol of the investee; \n \n\u001f goodwill and fair value adjustments related to the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and \nliabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing exchange rate for the year."

Specifically, assets are \nrecognised at a value equal to the present value of future payments at the date of signing of the contract, dis-\ncounted using the applicable incremental borrowing rate for each contract, and depreciated over the duration of \nthe underlying contract, taking account of the effects of any extension or early termination clauses whose exer-\ncise was deemed reasonably certain.\nIn compliance with the provisions of IFRS 16, starting from January 1, 2019, the Group identifies contracts for \nwhich it obtains the right to use an identifiable asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration as leases.\nFor each lease contract, starting from the commencement date, the Group recognises an asset (right of use of \nthe asset) under tangible assets as a balancing entry to a corresponding financial liability (lease payable), with \nthe exception of the following cases: (i) short-term lease contracts; (ii) low-value lease contracts applied to situ-\nations in which the leased asset has a value not exceeding €5 thousand (new value). \nFor short-term and low-value lease contracts, the financial liabilities related to the leases and corresponding \nright of use are not recognised, but the lease payments are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line \nbasis for the duration of the respective contracts. \nIn the case of a complex contract that includes a lease component, the latter is always managed separately from \nthe other services included in the contract.\nRights of use are shown in a specific item of the financial statements. At the time of initial recognition of the lease \ncontract, the right of use is recognised at a value corresponding to the lease payable, determined as described \nabove, increased by the instalments paid in advance and the ancillary expense and net of any incentives received. \nWhere applicable, the initial value of the rights of use also includes the related costs of dismantling and restoring \nthe area. \nThe situations involving the recalculation of the lease payable imply a corresponding change in the value of the \nright of use.\nAfter initial recognition, the right of use is depreciated on a straight-line basis, starting from the commencement \ndate, and subject to write-downs in the event of impairment. Depreciation is carried out over the shorter of the \nlease term and the useful life of the underlying asset; however, in cases where the lease contract envisages the \ntransfer of ownership, possibly also as a result of the use of redemption options included in the value of the right \nof use, depreciation is carried out over the useful life of the asset.\nLease payables are shown in the financial statements under current and non-current financial liabilities, together \nwith the other financial payables of the Group. At the time of initial recognition, the lease payable is recorded on \nthe basis of the present value of the lease instalments to be settled determined using the implicit interest rate of \nthe contract (i.e. the interest rate that forms the present value of the sum of the payments and the residual value \nequal to the sum of the fair value of the underlying asset and the initial direct costs incurred by the Group); if this \nrate is not indicated in the contract or easily determinable, the present value is determined using the “incremen-\ntal borrowing rate”, i.e. the incremental interest rate that, in a similar economic context and in order to obtain \nan amount equal to the value of the right of use, the Group would have paid for a loan with similar duration and \ncollateral.\nThe lease payments subject to discounting include fixed payments; variable fees due to an index or a rate; \nthe redemption price, if any and if the Group is reasonably certain to use it; the amount of payment envis-\naged for any issue of collateral on the residual value of the asset; the amount of penalties to be paid in the"

Specifically, in the presence of situations that involve a change in the estimate of the \nprobability of exercise (or non-exercise) of the options for renewal or early termination of the contract or in the \nredemption (or not) provisions of the asset upon expiry of the contract, the lease payable is restated by discount-\ning the new value of the instalments to be paid on the basis of a new discount rate.\nIntangible fixed assets \nIntangible assets are recognised under assets in the statement of financial position when it is likely that use of \nthe asset will generate future economic benefits and when the asset’s costs can be reliably determined. They \nare initially recognised at the value of contribution or at acquisition or production cost, inclusive of any ancillary \nexpense.\nIf tangible and intangible fixed assets are sold, the date of disposal will be the date when the purchaser obtains \nthe control of the assets, pursuant to requirements set forth on performance obligations by IFRS 15. The profit \nor loss generated by the consideration is accounted for in the Income Statement and is determined according \nto requirements to determine the transaction price envisaged by IFRS 15. Subsequent changes to the estimated \namount of consideration used to determine profit or loss must be accounted for in accordance with the require-\nments for changes in transaction pricing in IFRS 15.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is recognised in accordance with what was stated above with regard to business combinations in Note \n3) Consolidation standards and policies. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumu-\nlated impairment losses.\nGoodwill is allocated to the cash generating units (CGUs) and is tested for impairment annually or more frequent-\nly, if specific events or changes in circumstances suggest possible impairment, pursuant to IAS 36 – “Impairment \nof Assets”. \nIf goodwill has been allocated to a cash generating unit (CGU) and the entity disposes of part of this unit, goodwill \nassociated with the sold unit must be included in the book value of the asset when the profit or loss on disposal is \ndetermined. Goodwill associated with the discontinued operation must be calculated on the basis of the relating \nvalues of the discontinued operation and the retained portion of the cash-generating unit. The same criterion of \nrelated values is applied also when the format of the internal reporting is changed and affects the composition of \nthe cash generating units that received the goodwill, in order to define its new allocation.\nResearch and Development expense\nUnder IAS 38, research expense is charged to the Income Statement at the time the cost is incurred.\nDevelopment costs for projects concerning significantly innovative products or processes are capitalised only if \nthe following can be shown:\n \n\u001f the technical possibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;\n \n\u001f the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;\n \n\u001f the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;"

The residual \nvalues, the useful lives and the amortisation of intangible fixed assets are reviewed at each year end and, \nwhere appropriate, adjusted prospectively. The useful lives shown remained unchanged versus the prior \nyear.\nImpairment \nWhen there are specific indicators of impairment, and at least annually, with regard to intangible fixed assets and \ngoodwill, tangible and intangible fixed assets are subject to an impairment test.\nThe aim of this impairment test is to ensure that tangible and intangible fixed assets are not carried at a value \nexceeding their recoverable value, consisting of the higher of fair value, less costs to sell and the value in use.\nValue in use is determined based on the future cash flows expected to originate from the asset or cash-gener-\nating unit (hereafter also CGU) to which the asset belongs. Expected cash flows are discounted using a discount \nrate that reflects the current market estimate referring to the time-related cost of money and the risks specific to \nthe asset or cash generating unit to which the assumed realizable value refers.\nIf the recoverable value of the asset or CGU, to which it belongs, is less than the net book value, the asset in ques-\ntion is written down to reflect its impairment, with recognition of the latter in the Income Statement for the year.\nImpairment losses relating to CGUs are allocated firstly to goodwill and, for the remaining amount, to the other \nassets on a proportional basis.\nAn impairment loss, in the event that the assumptions that generated it no longer apply, is reinstated, up to the \namount corresponding to the book value that would have been determined, net of depreciation calculated on the \nhistorical cost, if no impairment loss had ever been recognised.\nAny reinstatements are recognised in the Income Statement. The value of goodwill previously written down can-\nnot be reinstated, as required by International Accounting Standards.\nFinancial assets and liabilities \nThe Group measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be re-\nceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the \nmeasurement date.\nA fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n \n\u001f in the principal market of the asset or liability; or\n \n\u001f in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\nThe principal market or most advantageous market must be accessible for the Group. The fair value of an \nasset or liability is measured by using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing \nthe asset or liability, assuming that they act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a \nnon-financial asset takes account of a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the \nasset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its \nhighest and best use."

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial \nstatements are categorized according to the fair value hierarchy, as described below:\n \n\u001f Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can \naccess at the measurement date;\n \n\u001f Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, \neither directly or indirectly;\n \n\u001f Level 3 - measurement techniques for which input data are unobservable for the asset or liability.\nThe fair value measurement is classified in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest \nlevel input used for the measurement.\nAs regards assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, \nthe Group determines whether transfers between hierarchy levels occurred while revising the classification at \neach annual reporting date.\nFinancial instruments\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset for one entity and a financial liability or \nequity instrument for another entity.\nFinancial assets\nFinancial assets are initially recognised at their fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value \nthrough profit or loss, any ancillary expense. Exceptions are trade receivables that do not contain a significant \nfinancing component for which the Group applies the practical expedient by measuring them at the transaction \nprice determined in accordance with IFRS 15. \nUpon recognition, for subsequent measurement purposes, financial assets are classified according to the four \npossible measurement methods described below:\n \n\u001f Financial assets at amortized cost;\n \n\u001f Financial assets at fair value through OCI with reclassification of cumulative gains and losses;\n \n\u001f Financial assets at fair value through OCI without reversal of cumulative gains and losses on derecognition \n(equity instruments); \n \n\u001f Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\nThe selection of the classification of financial assets depends on the following:\n \n\u001f nature of financial assets, determined primarily by the characteristics of expected contractual cash flows;\n \n\u001f business model that the Group applies to the management of the financial assets in order to generate cash \nflows, which may result from the collection of contractual cash flows, as well as from the sale of financial \nassets or from both.\nFor a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at fair value through OCI, it must gener-\nate cash flows that depend solely on the principal and interest on the amount of principal to be repaid (so-called \nsolely payments of principal and interest - SPPI).

If there is objective evidence, the impairment is recognised as \na cost in the income statement for the year.\nFor trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach to the calculation of expected \nlosses. Therefore, the Group does not monitor changes in credit risk, but the expected loss is fully recognised \nat each reporting date. The Group has established a matrix system based on historical information, reviewed to \nconsider prospective elements with regard to the specific types of debtors and their economic environment, as a \ntool for determining expected losses.\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are measured using the amortised cost method, recognising expense through the effective \ninterest rate method in the income statement, except for financial liabilities acquired for trading purposes or \nderivatives (see next paragraph), or those designated at FVTPL by Management on the date of initial recognition, \nwhich are measured at fair value with a balancing entry in the income statement.\nFinancial guarantees payable are contracts that require a payment to reimburse the holder of a debt security for \na loss incurred by it as a result of the debtor’s failure to make payment on the contractually stipulated due date. If \nthe financial guarantees are issued by the Group, they are initially recognised as liabilities at fair value, increased \nby transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the guarantee itself. The liability is then measured \nat the higher of the best estimate of the outlay required to meet the guaranteed obligation at the balance sheet \ndate and the amount initially recognised, net of accumulated amortisation.\nA financial liability is removed from the balance sheet when the obligation underlying the liability has been \ndischarged, cancelled or satisfied. Where an existing financial liability is exchanged for another from the same \nlender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially changed, such \nan exchange or change is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and a recognition of a new liabil-\nity, with any differences between the carrying amounts recognised in the Income Statement. In the event of \namendments on financial liabilities defined as irrelevant, the income effects of renegotiation are recognised in \nthe Income Statement.\nOffsetting of financial instruments\nA financial asset and liability can be offset and the net balance can be shown in the Statement of Financial Po-\nsition if there is a current legal right to offset the amounts recognised and there is the intention to settle the net \nremainder, or realize the asset and at the same time settle the liability."

Cost is calculated using the weighted aver-\nage cost method. Finished and semi-finished product costs include the cost of raw materials, direct labour, and \nother directly and indirectly attributable production costs (charged back based on normal production capacity). \nFor raw and ancillary materials and consumables, the net presumable realisable value is represented by the \nreplacement cost. For finished and semi-finished products, the net presumable realisable value is the estimated \nselling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the costs necessary \nto make the sale.\nObsolete and slow turnover inventory is written-down based on its estimated possible use or future sale, through \nentry in a special provision, adjusted by the value of inventory.\nNon-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations\nThe Group classifies non-current assets held for sale as held for sale if their book value will be recovered primar-\nily through a sale transaction, rather than through their continued use. These non-current assets held for sale \nclassified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their book value and their fair value less costs to sell. \nCosts to sell are any additional costs directly attributable to the sale, excluding financial expense and tax.\nThe condition for classifying an asset as held for sale is considered met only when the sale is highly probable \nand the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its current condition. The actions required to \nconclude the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes in the sale will occur or that the sale \nwill be cancelled. Management must be engaged in the sale, whose completion should be planned within one \nyear from the date of classification. \nThe depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortisation of intangible assets ceases when they are \nclassified as available for sale."

When a defined-benefit plan is entirely or partly financed by contributions paid to a fund, \nlegally separate from the company, or to an insurance company, the plan assets are measured at fair value. The \namount of the obligation is thus accounted for, net of the fair value of the plan assets that will be used to settle \nthat obligation directly.\nRevaluations, which include actuarial gains and losses, changes in the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding net \ninterest), and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognised immediately in the Statement of \nFinancial Position by debiting or crediting retained earnings through the other items of the Statement of Compre-\nhensive Income in the year in which they arise. Revaluations are not reclassified in the Income Statement in sub-\nsequent years. Other long-term benefits are employee benefits other than post-employment benefits. Accounting \nis similar to defined-benefit plans.\nProvisions for risks and charges \nProvisions for risks and charges are set aside to cover liabilities of uncertain amount or due date that must be \nrecognised in the financial statements when the following concurrent conditions are met:\n \n\u001f the entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive), i.e. under way at the reporting date, as a result of \na past event;\n \n\u001f it is likely that economic resources will be required to fulfil the obligation;\n \n\u001f the amount needed to fulfil the obligation can be reliably estimated;\n \n\u001f risks for which the onset of a liability is merely potential are shown in the notes to the financial statements, \nin the commentary part of the provisions, without making a provision.\nIn the case of events that are only remote, i.e., events that have minor chances of occurring, no provision is ac-\ncounted for, nor is additional or supplementary information provided.\nAllocations are booked at the amount representing the best estimate of the amount that the company would pay \nto pay the obligation or to transfer it to third parties at the reporting date. If the effect of discounting the value of \nmoney is significant, allocations are determined by discounting expected future cash flows at a pre-tax discount \nrate that reflects the current market valuation of the time value of money. When discounting is carried out, the \nincrease in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a financial expense.\nProvisions are recorded at the present value of the expected financial resources to be used against the ob-\nligation. Provisions are periodically updated to reflect changes in cost estimates, timing of implementation, \nand discounted value, if any; revisions in provision estimates are charged to the same line item in the Income \nStatement that previously included the allocation and to the Income Statement for the year in which the change \noccurred.\nThe Group recognises restructuring provisions if there is an implied obligation to restructure and there is a \nformal plan for restructuring, which has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the \nrestructuring either by starting to implement that plan or because it has announced its main features to those \naffected by it."

The cumulative costs recorded for such transactions at the end of each financial year up to the vesting date \nare commensurate with the expiry of the vesting period and the best estimate of the number of equity instru-\nments that will actually vest. \nService or performance conditions are not taken into account when defining the fair value of the plan at the grant \ndate. However, the probability of these conditions being met is taken into account when defining the best esti-\nmate of the number of equity instruments that will vest. Arm’s length conditions are reflected in the fair value at \nthe grant date. Any other conditions attached to the plan that do not involve a service obligation are not consid-\nered to be a vesting condition. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of the plan and result in the \nimmediate recognition of the cost of the plan, unless there are also service or performance conditions.\nNo cost is recognised for rights that do not ultimately vest because the performance and/or service conditions \nhave not been met. When rights include a market condition or a non-vesting condition, they are treated as if they \nhad vested regardless of whether the market conditions or other non-vesting conditions they are subject to are \nmet or not, with the understanding that all other performance and/or service conditions must be met.\nIf the conditions of the plan are changed, the minimum cost to be recognised is the fair value at the grant date in \nthe absence of the plan change, assuming that the original conditions of the plan are met. Additionally, a cost is \nrecognised for any change that results in an increase in the total fair value of the payment plan, or is otherwise \nfavourable to employees; this cost is measured by reference to the date of change. When a plan is cancelled by the \nentity or the counterpart, any remaining fair value element in the plan is immediately transferred to the income \nstatement.\nIncome tax\nIncome tax includes current and deferred tax. Income tax is generally charged to the Income Statement, except \nwhen it relates to cases recognised directly in Equity, in which case the tax effect is recognised directly in Equity.\nCurrent income tax is calculated by applying to taxable income the tax rate in force at the reporting date and in-\ncludes the adjustments to tax related to prior periods.\nDeferred tax is calculated using the liability method applied to temporary differences between the amount of \nassets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding amounts recognised for tax \npurposes.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised against all deductible temporary differences and unused tax receivables \nand losses carried forward, to the extent that it is probable that there will be adequate future taxable profits \nthat may make the use of deductible temporary differences and tax receivables and losses carried forward \napplicable."

The IASB developed the \nstandard to eliminate the inconsistencies and weaknesses of the existing accounting standards, providing a \nsingle principle-based framework to take account of all types of insurance contracts, including reinsurance \ncontracts that an insurer holds. The new standard also sets out reporting and disclosure requirements in \norder to improve comparability between entities from the same sector. The new standard measures an in-\nsurance contract based on a General Model or a simplified version, called the Premium Allocation Approach \n(“PAA”).

The application of these \nestimates and assumptions affects the amounts of revenue, expense, assets and liabilities and their disclosure, \nas well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The results of financial statement items for which the above \nestimates and assumptions were used may differ from those shown owing to the uncertainty surrounding the \nassumptions and conditions on which the estimates are based.\nFollowing are the assumptions regarding the future and other main causes of uncertainty in estimates that, at \nthe reporting date, show a risk of resulting in adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within \nthe next year. The Group has based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when preparing the \nConsolidated Financial Statements. The current circumstances and assumptions on future developments may \nhowever change upon occurrence of market changes or events beyond the Group’s control. Upon their occur-\nrence, these changes are reflected in the assumptions.\nImpairment of non-financial assets (Goodwill, Tangible and Intangible Fixed Assets and Rights of Use)\nAn impairment occurs when the book value of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable value, which is the higher \nof its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from \nthe sale of an asset or cash-generating unit in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing par-\nties, less the costs to sell. The value in use is calculated by using a discounted cash-flow model. Cash flows result \nfrom plans. The recoverable value depends significantly on the discounting rate used in the discounted cash flow \nmodel, as well as on expected future cash flows and the growth rate used for extrapolation. Key assumptions \nused to determine the recoverable value for the various cash generating units, including a sensitivity analysis, \nare described in Note 2.\nTax \nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be a taxed profit in the future \nsuch that they can be used.

Evaluation processes and manners, as well as the determination of the abovementioned estimates, \nare based on assumptions that, for their nature, involve reliance on the judgement of the Directors.\nOther (Provisions for risks and charges, doubtful accounts, inventory write-down, revenue, discounts \nand returns)\nProvisions for risks are based on assessments and estimates based on historical experience and assumptions \nthat are deemed reasonable and realistic from time to time depending on the relevant circumstances. \nThe recognition process of Group revenue includes estimates related to both the amount of revenue, based on \nthe criterion of completion percentage, and the determination of discounts and returns granted to customers, but \nstill unclaimed. Evaluation processes and manners, as well as the determination of such estimates, are based on \nassumptions that, for their nature, involve reliance on the judgement of the Directors."

Mar-\nket and liquidity risk management is carried out centrally by the Parent Company through the central treasury, \nwhich acts directly on the market possibly also on behalf of subsidiaries and investees. Credit risk management \nis instead assigned to the Group’s operating units. \nMarket risk\nForeign exchange risk \nDatalogic operates internationally and is exposed to translational and transactional foreign exchange risk. Transla-\ntional risk refers to the translation into Euro during consolidation of the financial statements of foreign companies \nthat have not adopted the Euro as functional and presentation currency. The key currencies are the US dollar, the Chi-\nnese Renminbi and the British pound. Transactional risk refers to trade transactions (foreign currency receivables/\npayables) and financial transactions (foreign currency borrowings or loans) of Group companies in currencies other \nthan their functional and presentation currency. The currency to which the Group is most exposed is the US dollar.\nTo enable full understanding of the impact of foreign exchange risk on the Group’s consolidated financial state-\nments, a sensitivity analysis of foreign exchange balances to changes in the exchange rate was conducted. The \nvariability parameters applied were identified among the foreign exchange rate differences considered reason-\nably possible, with all other variables remaining equal. \nThe following table shows the results of the analysis at December 31, 2022:\nUSD\nNominal value\nPortion exposed to \nexchange rate risk\n5%\n-5%\nExchange rates\n                     1.0666 \n1.1199\n1.0133\nFinancial assets \n \n \n \n \nCash and cash funds\n107,482\n29,852\n(1,422)\n1,571\nTrade and other receivables\n110,613\n39,604\n(1,886)\n2,084\nFinancial liabilities\n \n \n \n \nLoans\n149,489\n615\n29\n(32)\nTrade and other payables\n187,473\n87,439\n4,164\n(4,602)\nNet impact on Income Statement \n \n \n886\n(979)"

Much of Datalogic’s business is conveyed on a network of well-known customers/distributors, who \nstatistically have no credit recoverability issues. Customers requesting deferred conditions of payment are sub-\nject to screening procedures concerning their creditworthiness (degree of solvency and reliability). Trade receiv-\nables are subject to individual impairment testing if they show potential and significant impairment indicators.\nThe Group protects itself against credit risk also through factoring instruments without recourse. At December \n31, 2022, factored trade receivables amounted to €29,877 thousand (versus €33,052 thousand at end 2021). \nThe maximum exposure to credit risk on the balance sheet date is the book value of each class of financial asset \npresented in Note 5.\nLiquidity risk\nThe Datalogic Group’s liquidity risk is minimized by the timely management by the Parent Company’s treasury de-\npartment. Bank debt and liquidity are managed centrally through financial resource optimization tools, including \ncash pooling. The Parent Company manages and negotiates medium/long-term loans and credit lines to meet \nthe Group’s requirements. Centralized negotiation of credit lines and loans, together with management of the \nGroup’s cash resources, are aimed at optimizing financing costs.\nMention should also be made that at December 31, 2022, the Group’s liquidity reserve – which includes uncom-\nmitted but undrawn credit lines of €40 million – is considered adequate to meet commitments existing on the \ndate of preparation of the financial statements."

Value in use was calculated by discounting at a given discount rate the future cash \nflows expected to be generated by the CGU, in the production phase and at the time of its disposal, based on the \nDiscounted Cash Flow method.\nThe cash flows of the individual CGUs are estimated based on forward-looking plans prepared by Management. \nThese plans represent the best estimate of the foreseeable outlook, based on the business strategies and growth \nindicators of the relevant industry and markets.\nThe assumptions used for the purposes of impairment were approved by the Board of Directors and the Control, \nRisks, Remuneration and Appointments Committee of Datalogic S.p.A. on February 2, 2023.\nBased on an Unlevered approach, the Group used, through the DCF method, Unlevered Free Cash Flows from Op-\nerations (FCFO). The flows expected for the period 2023 - 2027, subject to an explicit forecast, are complemented \nby the flows related to so-called Perpetuity, which is representative of the Terminal Value. This was calculated \nusing a 3% growth rate g, which represents the long-term expectations for growth.\nThe discount rate, consisting of the weighted average cost of invested capital (WACC), was estimated before tax \nand based on the financial structure of the Datalogic Group’s industry. The WACC used, ranging from 9.55% to \n9.78% for the respective CGUs measured, reflects the return-opportunity for all capital contributions, in whatever \ncapacity made.\nThe following table shows the values of Goodwill and the discount (WACC) and long-term growth (g) rates used \nfor testing purposes at year-end:\n \nCGU Datalogic\nInformatics\nGoodwill\n197,989\n14,054\nWeighted average cost of capital (WACC)\n9.55%\n9.78%\nLong-term growth rate (G)\n3%\n3%\nThe impairment tests carried out according to the above methods did not indicate any impairment losses, as the \nrecoverable value of the CGUs at December 31, 2022 was higher than the corresponding net capital employed \n(carrying amount). \nSince the market capitalisation of Datalogic S.p.A. is higher than the consolidated equity of the Group, the Direc-\ntors did not deem it necessary to prepare a second level impairment test on the entire Datalogic Group."

The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 9.55% (5.99% in 2021), and cash \nflows beyond five years were estimated using a 3% growth rate (1% in 2021). During testing for impairment, \ngoodwill of the Datalogic CGU confirmed its carrying amount.\nInformatics CGU\nGoodwill attributed to the Informatics CGU results from the acquisition of the investee Informatics Inc. in 2005. \nThe recoverable amount of the Informatics CGU was determined on the basis of the calculation of the value in use, \nadopting the cash flow projections from the plan prepared by Management based on the assumptions approved \nby the Board of Directors. The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 9.78% (6.80% in 2021), and cash \nflows beyond five years were drawn using a 3% growth rate (1% in 2021). During testing for impairment, goodwill \nof the Informatics CGU confirmed its carrying amount.\nSensitivity to changes in assumptions\nThe calculation of value in use for selected CGUs is related to the following assumptions: \n \n\u001f gross margin;\n \n\u001f discount rates;\n \n\u001f growth rate used to calculate cash flows after the forecast period.\nGross margin - The forecast of gross margin over the plan years was prepared by the Directors based on his-\ntorical data of the Group’s CGUs and taking account of expectations of trends in the relevant markets and the \neffects of planned strategies. A decrease in demand and deteriorating economic conditions, for example due to \ninflationary effects, can lead to a reduction in gross margin, and impairment.\nDiscount rates – Discount rates reflect the market assessment of the specific risk of each cash-generating unit, \nconsidering the time value of money and the specific risks of the underlying assets that have not already been \nincluded in the cash flow estimate. The calculation of the discount rate is based on Group specific circumstances \nand its operating segments, and it derives from its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). \nEstimates of growth rates – The rates are based on business sector analyses. Management acknowledges that \nthe speed of technological development and the possible entry of new players in the market may have a signifi-\ncant impact on the growth rate. \nThe sensitivity analyses were carried out assuming changes in the abovementioned key assumptions. Sensitiv-\nity analyses were based on the changes occurring in certain key assumptions, keeping all other assumptions \nunchanged. Specifically, the Directors point out that the sensitivity analyses carried out did not show any critical \nsituations."

(the “Company” or the “Parent Company”) is a joint-stock company listed on Euronext STAR \nMilan of Borsa Italiana S.p.A. and is headquartered in Italy. The registered office is in Via Candini 2, Lippo di Cal-\nderara (BO). The Company is a subsidiary of Hydra S.p.A., also based in Bologna.\nDatalogic S.p.A. is the Parent Company of the Datalogic Group (“Group”), a global technological leader in the data \ncapture and process automation markets. The Company is specialized in the design and production of barcode read-\ners, mobile computers, detection, measurement and safety sensors, vision and laser marking systems and RFID.\nThe publication of the Company’s Financial Statements at December 31, 2022 was authorized by resolution of the \nBoard of Directors of March 9, 2023.\nBasis of presentation\n1) General criteria\nIn compliance with European Regulation no. 1606/2002, the Financial Statements were prepared in accordance \nwith the International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRS) issued by the IASB - International Accounting Standard \nBoard and endorsed by the European Union pursuant to European Regulation 1725/2003 and subsequent up-\ndates, with all the interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Standard Interpretations Committee \n(“IFRS-IC”), formerly known as the Standing Interpretations Committee (“SIC”) endorsed by the European Com-\nmission at the date of approval of the draft Financial Statements by the Board of Directors and contained in the \nrelevant E.U. Regulations published on that date and in compliance with the provisions set forth in CONSOB \nRegulation 11971 of 14/05/99 and subsequent updates.  \nThese Financial Statements were drawn up in Euro thousands, which is the Company’s “functional” and “pres-\nentation” currency.\n2) Reporting formats\nThe reporting formats adopted comply with those required by IAS 1 and were used in the Financial Statements \nfor the year ended December 31, 2021, in particular: \n \n\u001f current and non-current assets, as well as current and non-current liabilities are shown separately in the \nStatement of Financial Position. Current assets, which include cash and cash equivalents, are those intended \nto be realized, sold or consumed in the Group’s normal operating cycle; current liabilities are those expected \nto be settled in the Group’s normal operating cycle or in the twelve months following the end of the period;\n \n\u001f with regard to the Income Statement, cost and revenue items are shown based on grouping by function, as \nthis classification was deemed more explanatory for understanding the Group’s results of operations;\n \n\u001f the Statement of Comprehensive Income shows the items that determine profit/(loss) for the period, consid-\nering income and expense recognised directly in equity;\n \n\u001f the Statement of Cash Flows is presented using the “indirect method”.\nThe Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with the general criterion of reliable and truthful pres-\nentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows, in compliance with the general \nprinciples of going concern, accrual basis, consistency of presentation, materiality and aggregation, prohibition \nof offsetting and comparability of information."

Reference is made \nto the section describing the main estimates made in these Financial Statements.\n3) Accounting policies and standards applied\nThe policies adopted for the preparation of the Company’s financial statements at December 31, 2022 are shown \nbelow.\nTangible fixed assets \nOwned tangible fixed assets are recognised at the cost of contribution, purchase, or internal construction. The \ncost includes all directly attributable costs required to make the asset available for use (including, when relevant \nand where there are present obligations, the present value of estimated costs for decommissioning, asset re-\nmoval, and site remediation), net of trade discounts and rebates.\nCertain tangible fixed assets in the “Land and buildings” categories were measured at fair value (market value) \nat January 1, 2004 (date of first-time adoption of IFRS) and this value was used as the deemed cost. The cost of \nbuildings is depreciated net of the residual value estimated as the realization value obtainable through sale at the \nend of the useful life of the building.\nCosts incurred after purchase are accounted for in the book value of the asset, or are recognised as a separate \nasset, only if it is believed likely that the future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the entity \nand the asset’s cost can be reliably measured. Maintenance and repair costs or replacement costs that do not \nhave the above characteristics are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.\nFixed assets are systematically depreciated in each year from the time the fixed asset is available for use, or is \npotentially able to provide the associated economic benefits, based on economic-technical rates determined with \nregard to the remaining possibility of use of the assets and taking account of the month of availability for the first \nyear.\nLand is considered to be an asset with indefinite life and therefore not subject to depreciation."

At the time of initial recognition of the lease \ncontract, the right of use is recognised at a value corresponding to the lease payable, determined as described \nabove, increased by the instalments paid in advance and the ancillary expense and net of any incentives received. \nWhere applicable, the initial value of the rights of use also includes the related costs of dismantling and restoring \nthe area. \nThe situations involving the recalculation of the lease payable imply a corresponding change in the value of the \nright of use.\nAfter initial recognition, the right of use is depreciated on a straight-line basis, starting from the commencement \ndate, and subject to write-downs in the event of impairment. Depreciation is carried out over the shorter of the \nlease term and the useful life of the underlying asset; however, in cases where the lease contract envisages the \ntransfer of ownership, possibly also as a result of the use of redemption options included in the value of the right \nof use, depreciation is carried out over the useful life of the asset.\nLease payables are shown in the financial statements under current and non-current financial liabilities, together \nwith the Company’s other financial payables.

Specifically, in the presence of situations that involve a change in the estimate of the \nprobability of exercise (or non-exercise) of the options for renewal or early termination of the contract or in the \nredemption (or not) provisions of the asset upon expiry of the contract, the lease payable is restated by discount-\ning the new value of the instalments to be paid on the basis of a new discount rate."

This measurement is re-\nferred to as a SPPI test and is performed at the level of each instrument.\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash ceases to exist, the Company has transferred to \na third party the right to receive cash flows from the asset or has a contractual obligation to pay them in full and \nwithout delay, and (1) has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset or \n(2) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred \ncontrol of the asset.\nIn the cases where the Company has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has signed an \nagreement based on which it retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but un-\ndertakes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more beneficiaries (pass-through), it assesses \nwhether and to what extent it has retained the risks and benefits pertaining to ownership.\nValuations are regularly carried out in order to verify whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or \na group of assets may have suffered impairment. If there is objective evidence, the impairment is recognised as \na cost in the income statement for the year.\nAs regards trade receivables, the Company applies a simplified approach in calculating the expected losses. \nTherefore, the Company does not monitor changes in credit risk, but the expected loss is fully recognised at each \nreporting date. The Company has established a matrix system based on historical information, reviewed to con-\nsider prospective elements with regard to the specific types of debtors and their economic environment, as a tool \nfor determining expected losses.\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are measured using the amortised cost method, recognising expense through the effective \ninterest rate method in the income statement, except for financial liabilities acquired for trading purposes or \nderivatives (see next paragraph), or those designated at FVTPL by Management on the date of initial recognition, \nwhich are measured at fair value with a balancing entry in the income statement.\nFinancial guarantees payable are contracts that require a payment to reimburse the holder of a debt security for \na loss incurred by it as a result of the debtor’s failure to make payment on the contractually stipulated due date. \nWhen issued by the Company, financial guarantee contracts are initially recognised as liabilities at fair value, \nincreased by transaction costs directly attributable to issuance of the guarantee. The liability is then measured at \nthe higher of the best estimate of the outlay required to meet the guaranteed obligation at the balance sheet date \nand the amount initially recognised, net of accumulated amortisation.\nA financial liability is removed from the balance sheet when the obligation underlying the liability has been \ndischarged, cancelled or satisfied. Where an existing financial liability is exchanged for another from the same \nlender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially changed, such \nan exchange or change is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and a recognition of a new liabil-\nity, with any differences between the carrying amounts recognised in the Income Statement.

Cumulative costs and \nincreases in investments recognised in respect of such transactions at the reporting date of each year to the vest-\ning date are commensurate with the maturity of the vesting period and the best estimate of the number of equity \ninstruments that will actually vest. \nService or performance conditions are not taken into account when defining the fair value of the plan at the grant \ndate. However, the probability of these conditions being met is taken into account when defining the best esti-\nmate of the number of equity instruments that will vest. Arm’s length conditions are reflected in the fair value at \nthe grant date.

When rights include a market condition or a non-vesting condi-\ntion, they are treated as if they had vested regardless of whether the market conditions or other non-vesting \nconditions they are subject to are met or not, with the understanding that all other performance and/or service \nconditions must be met.\nIf the conditions of the plan are changed, the minimum cost to be recognised is the fair value at the grant date in \nthe absence of the plan change, assuming that the original conditions of the plan are met. Additionally, a cost is \nrecognised for any change that results in an increase in the total fair value of the payment plan, or is otherwise \nfavourable to employees; this cost is measured by reference to the date of change.

The IASB developed the standard to \neliminate the inconsistencies and weaknesses of the existing accounting standards, providing a single prin-\nciple-based framework to take account of all types of insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts \nthat an insurer holds.\nThe new standard also sets out reporting and disclosure requirements in order to improve comparability \nbetween entities from the same sector.\nThe new standard measures an insurance contract based on a General Model or a simplified version, called \nthe Premium Allocation Approach (“PAA”).\nThe entity must apply the new standard to insurance contracts issued, including reinsurance contracts issued, \nreinsurance contracts held and also investment contracts with a discretionary participation feature (DPF).\nThe standard applies as of January 1, 2023, but early application is permitted only for those entities that adopt \nIFRS 9 – Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

The amendment is a transition \noption related to comparative information on financial assets presented at the date of initial application of \nIFRS 17. The amendment is intended to avoid temporary accounting mismatches between financial assets \nand insurance contract liabilities, and thus improve the usefulness of comparative information for financial \nstatement readers.

The application of these \nestimates and assumptions affects the amounts of revenue, expense, assets and liabilities and their disclosure, \nas well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The results of financial statement items for which the above \nestimates and assumptions were used may differ from those shown owing to the uncertainty surrounding the \nassumptions and conditions on which the estimates are based.\nFollowing are the assumptions regarding the future and other main causes of uncertainty in estimates that, at \nthe reporting date, show a risk of resulting in adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within \nthe next year. The Company has based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when preparing \nthe Financial Statements. The current circumstances and assumptions on future developments may however \nchange upon occurrence of market changes or events beyond the Company’s control. Upon their occurrence, \nthese changes are reflected in the assumptions."

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a \nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will \nalways detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and \nare considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. \n \nAs part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:  \n \n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, \nwhether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and \nobtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of \nnot detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from \nerror, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the \noverride of internal control. \n \n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \neffectiveness of the Group’s internal control. \n \n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by the Directors."

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. \n \nAs part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n \n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to \nfraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting \na material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol. \n \n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \neffectiveness of the Company's internal control. \n \n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by the Directors. \n \n• Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
