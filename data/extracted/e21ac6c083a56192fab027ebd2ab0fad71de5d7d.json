Cost-of-service utilities provide essential electric and gas services in designated territories \nunder franchises and are overseen by regulatory authorities. Emera’s strategic focus continues to be safely delivering cleaner, \naffordable and reliable energy to its customers.\nThe majority of Emera’s investment in rate-regulated businesses are located in Florida with other investments in Nova Scotia, \nNew Mexico and the Caribbean. Emera’s portfolio of regulated utilities provides reliable earnings, cash flow and dividends. \nEarnings opportunities in regulated utilities are generally driven by the magnitude of net investment in the utility (known as \n“rate base”), and the amount of equity in the capital structure and the return on that equity (“ROE”) as approved through \nregulation. Earnings are also affected by sales volumes and operating expenses."

      "text": "Management’s Discussion & Analysis\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n12\nEmera’s capital investment plan is $8 – 9 billion over the 2023-to-2025 period (including a $240 million equity investment in \nthe LIL in 2023), mainly focused in Florida. This results in a forecasted rate base growth of approximately 7 per cent to 8 per cent \nthrough 2025. The capital investment plan continues to include significant investments across the portfolio in renewable and \ncleaner generation, reliability and integrity investments, infrastructure modernization, and customer-focused technologies. \nEmera’s capital investment plan is being funded primarily through internally generated cash flows and debt raised at the \noperating company level. Equity requirements in support of the Company’s capital investment plan are expected to be funded \nthrough the issuance of preferred equity and the issuance of common equity through Emera’s dividend reinvestment plan \n(“DRIP”) and at-the-market program (“ATM program”). Maintaining investment-grade credit ratings is a priority of the Company.\nEmera has provided annual dividend growth guidance of four to five per cent through 2025. The Company targets a long-term \ndividend payout ratio of adjusted net income of 70 to 75 per cent and, while the payout ratio is likely to exceed that target through \nand beyond the forecast period, it is expected to return to that range over time. For further information on the non-GAAP measure \n“Dividend Payout Ratio of Adjusted Net Income”, refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Ratios” section.\nSeasonal patterns and other weather events affect demand and operating costs. Similarly, mark-to-market adjustments and \nforeign currency exchange can have a material impact on financial results for a specific period. Emera’s consolidated net income \nand cash flows are impacted by movements in the USD relative to the Canadian dollar. Emera may hedge both transactional and \ntranslational exposure. These impacts, as well as the timing of capital investments and other factors, mean results in any one \nquarter are not necessarily indicative of results in any other quarter, or for the year as a whole.\nEnergy markets worldwide are facing significant change and Emera is well positioned to respond to shifting customer demands, \ndigitization, decarbonization, complex regulatory environments, and decentralized generation. \nCustomers are looking for more choice, better control, and enhanced reliability in a time where costs of decentralized generation \nand storage have become more competitive in some regions. Advancing technologies are transforming the way utilities interact \nwith their customers and generate and transmit energy. In addition, climate change and extreme weather are shaping how \nutilities operate and how they invest in infrastructure. There is also an overall need to replace aging infrastructure and further \nenhance reliability. Emera will play a role in all of these trends. Emera’s strategy is to fund investments in renewable energy and \ntechnology assets which protect the environment and benefit customers through fuel or operating cost savings. \nFor example, significant investments to facilitate the use of renewable and low-carbon energy include the Maritime Link in \nAtlantic Canada, and the ongoing construction of solar generation and modernization of the Big Bend Power Station at Tampa \nElectric. Emera’s utilities are also investing in reliability projects and replacing aging infrastructure. All of these projects \ndemonstrate Emera’s strategy of safely delivering cleaner, reliable, and affordable energy for its customers.\nBuilding on its decarbonization progress, Emera is continuing its efforts by establishing clear carbon reduction goals and a vision \nto achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.\nThis vision is inspired by Emera’s strong track record, the Company’s experienced team, and a clear path to Emera’s interim \ncarbon goals. With existing technologies and resources, and subject to supportive government and regulatory decisions, Emera is \nworking to achieve the following goals compared to corresponding 2005 levels: \n•\t A 55 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2025.\n•\t The retirement of Emera’s last existing coal unit no later than 2040.\n•\t An 80 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2040. \nAchieving the above climate goals on these timelines is subject to the Company’s regulatory obligations and other external \nfactors beyond Emera’s control.\nEmera seeks to deliver on its Climate Commitment while maintaining its focus on investing in reliability and staying focused on the \ncost impacts for customers. Emera is also committed to identifying emerging technologies and continuing to work constructively \nwith policymakers, regulators, partners, investors and customers to achieve these goals and realize its net-zero vision.\nEmera is committed to world-class safety, operational excellence, good governance, excellent customer service, reliability, being \nan employer of choice, and building constructive relationships."

The MTM adjustments are related to the following:\n•\t held-for-trading (“HFT”) commodity derivative instruments, including adjustments related to the price differential between \nthe point where natural gas is sourced and where it is delivered, and the related amortization of transportation capacity \nrecognized as a result of certain Emera Energy marketing and trading transactions;\n•\t the business activities of Bear Swamp Power Company LLC (“Bear Swamp”) included in Emera’s equity income;\n•\t equity securities held in BLPC and a captive reinsurance company in the Other segment; and\n•\t FX hedges entered into to hedge USD denominated operating unit earnings exposure.\nFor further detail on MTM adjustments, refer to the “Consolidated Financial Review”, “Financial Highlights – Other Electric \nUtilities”, and “Financial Highlights – Other” sections.\nIn Q4 2022, the Company recognized a $73 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to GBPC due to a decline in the \nfair value of the reporting unit. The fair value decline was driven by the effects of macro-economic factors on the discount rate \ncalculation, including the risk-free rate assumption. Management believes excluding from net income the effect of this charge \nbetter distinguishes ongoing operations of the business and allows investors to better understand and evaluate the Company. \nFor further details on this GBPC impairment charge, refer to “Significant Items Impacting Earnings”, and “Financial Highlights – \nOther” sections.\nIn February 2022, the UARB issued a decision to disallow the recovery of $9 million in costs ($7 million after-tax) included in \nNSPML’s final capital cost application. The after-tax unrecoverable costs were recognized in “Income from equity investments” \nin Emera’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Management believes excluding these unrecoverable costs from the calculation \nof adjusted net income better reflects the underlying operations in the period. For further details on the NSPML unrecoverable \ncosts, refer to the “Business Overview and Outlook – Canadian Electric Utilities” and “Financial Highlights – Canadian Electric \nUtilities” sections.\nIn 2020, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of Emera Maine and certain non-cash impairment charges. Management \nbelieves excluding these from net income better distinguishes ongoing operations of the business and allows investors to better \nunderstand and evaluate the business.\nAdjusted EPS – basic and dividend payout ratio of adjusted net income are non-GAAP ratios which are calculated using adjusted \nnet income, as described above. For further details on dividend payout ratio of adjusted net income, see the “Dividend Payout \nRatio” section.\nEmera calculates adjusted net income for the Canadian Electric Utilities, Other Electric Utilities, and Other segments. \nReconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure is included in each segment. Refer to “Financial Highlights – Canadian Electric \nUtilities”, “Financial Highlights – Other Electric Utilities” and “Financial Highlights – Other” sections."

Although the cash flows of GBPC have not changed significantly compared to previous \nperiods, the decline in the fair value was driven by the effects of macro-economic factors on discount rate calculations, including \nthe risk-free rate assumption. This non-cash charge was recorded in “Impairment charge” on the Consolidated Statements of \nIncome and reduced the GBPC goodwill balance to nil. For further details, refer to note 22 in the consolidated financial statements.\nTECO Guatemala Holdings (“TGH”) International Arbitration and Award\nOn December 15, 2022, a payment of $63 million ($45 million after tax and legal costs, or $0.17 per common share), was made \nby the Republic of Guatemala to TECO Energy in satisfaction of the second and final award issued by the International Centre \nof the Settlement of Investment Disputes tribunal regarding a dispute over an investment of TGH, a wholly owned subsidiary of \nTECO Energy. The dispute related to the 2007 intervention by the government of Guatemala in an ongoing independent rate-\nsetting process to unilaterally set a new and lower tariff. The payment was recognized in “Other income, net” on the Consolidated \nStatements of Income. For further details, refer to note 27 in the consolidated financial statements.\nEarnings Impact of MTM Gain (Loss), After-Tax\nMTM gain, after-tax increased $151 million to $307 million in Q4 2022, compared to $156 million in Q4 2021, and for the year \nended December 31, increased $388 million to $175 million compared to a MTM loss, after-tax of $213 million for the same period \nin 2021. These increases were due to changes in existing positions and reversal of losses in 2022, partially offset by higher \namortization in 2022 of gas transportation assets at Emera Energy.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFor the\nmillions of dollars\nThree months ended\nDecember 31\nYear ended\nDecember 31\nAdjusted net income\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\n2020\nFlorida Electric Utility\n$\t\n 124\n$\t\n85\n$\t\n 596\n$\t\n 462\n$\t\n 501\nCanadian Electric Utilities\n\t\n46\n \t\n 67\n\t\n 222\n\t\n241\n\t\n 221\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure\n \t\n 72\n\t\n55\n \t\n 221\n \t\n198\n\t\n 162\nOther Electric Utilities\n\t\n 8\n\t\n5\n\t\n 29\n\t\n 20\n\t\n 33\nOther\n\t\n(1)  \t\n(44)\n\t\n(218)  \t\n(198) \t\n(252)\nAdjusted net income\n$\t\n 249\n$\t\n 168\n$\t\n 850\n$\t\n 723\n$\t\n 665\nMTM gain (loss), after-tax\n\t\n307\n156\n\t\n175 \t\n(213) \t\n(10)\nImpairment charges, after-tax\n\t\n(73) \t\n–\n\t\n(73) \t\n– \t\n(26)\nNSPML unrecoverable costs\n\t\n–\n\t\n–\n\t\n(7) \t\n–\n\t\n–\nGain on sale, after tax and transaction costs\n\t\n –\n\t\n –\n\t\n–\n\t\n –\n\t\n309\nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n$\t\n 483\n$\t\n 324\n$\t\n945\n$\t\n 510\n$\t\n 938"

Tampa Electric has $12.1 billion USD of \nassets and approximately 827,000 customers at December 31, 2022. Tampa Electric owns 6,549 megawatts (“MW”) of generating \ncapacity, of which 78 per cent is natural gas-fired, 15 per cent is solar and 7 per cent is coal. Tampa Electric owns 2,171 kilometres \nof transmission facilities and 19,916 kilometres of distribution facilities. Tampa Electric meets the planning criteria for reserve \ncapacity established by the FPSC, which is a 20 per cent reserve margin over firm peak demand.\nTampa Electric’s approved regulated ROE range is 9.25 per cent to 11.25 per cent, based on an allowed equity capital structure of \n54 per cent. An ROE of 10.20 per cent will be used for the calculation of the return on investments for clauses.\nTampa Electric anticipates earning within its ROE range in 2023. New base rates effective January 1, 2023, as a result of the 2021 \nsettlement agreement, will result in higher 2023 USD earnings than in 2022. Normalizing 2022 for weather, Tampa Electric sales \nvolumes in 2023 are projected to be higher than in 2022 due to customer growth. Tampa Electric expects customer growth rates \nin 2023 to be comparable to 2022, reflective of the current expected economic growth in Florida. \nOn January 23, 2023, Tampa Electric requested an adjustment to its fuel charges to recover the 2022 fuel under-recovery of \n$518 million USD over a period of 21 months. The request also included an adjustment to 2023 projected fuel costs to reflect \nthe reduction in natural gas prices since September 2022 for a projected reduction of $170 million USD for the balance of 2023. \nThe proposed changes will be decided by the FPSC in March 2023, and recovery is expected to begin in April 2023."

      "text": "Management’s Discussion & Analysis\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n20\nOn September 28, 2022, Hurricane Ian made landfall in Southwest Florida as a Category 4 hurricane and, as a result, \napproximately 291,000 customers lost power. The majority of Hurricane Ian restoration costs were charged against Tampa \nElectric’s FPSC approved storm reserve, resulting in minimal impact to earnings for 2022. The total cost of restoration was \n$126 million USD, with approximately $119 million USD charged to the storm reserve. Total restoration costs charged to the storm \nreserve have exceeded the reserve balance and have been deferred as a regulatory asset for future recovery. On January 23, \n2023, Tampa Electric petitioned the FPSC for recovery of the storm reserve regulatory asset and the replenishment of the \nbalance in the reserve to the previous approved reserve level of $56 million USD, for a total of approximately $131 million USD. \nThe proposed changes will be decided by the FPSC in March 2023, and recovery is expected to begin in April 2023 through \nMarch 2024.\nThe mid-course fuel adjustment requested by Tampa Electric on January 19, 2022, was approved on March 1, 2022. The rate \nincrease, effective with the first billing cycle in April 2022, covered higher fuel and capacity costs of $169 million USD and was \nspread over customer bills from April 1, 2022 through December 2022.\nIn 2023, capital investment in the Florida Electric Utility segment is expected to be $1.3 billion USD (2022 – $1.1 billion USD), \nincluding allowance for funds used during construction (“AFUDC”). Capital projects include solar investments, grid modernization \nand storm hardening investments. \nCANADIAN ELECTRIC UTILITIES\nCanadian Electric Utilities includes NSPI and ENL. NSPI is a vertically integrated regulated electric utility engaged in the \ngeneration, transmission and distribution of electricity and the primary electricity supplier to customers in Nova Scotia. ENL \nis a holding company with equity investments in NSPML and LIL: two transmission investments related to the development of \nan 824 MW hydroelectric generating facility at Muskrat Falls on the Lower Churchill River in Labrador. \nNSPI\nWith $6.8 billion of assets and approximately 541,000 customers, NSPI owns 2,420 MW of generating capacity, of which \napproximately 44 per cent is coal-fired; 28 per cent is natural gas and/or oil; 19 per cent is hydro and wind; 7 per cent is petcoke \nand 2 per cent is biomass-fueled generation. In addition, NSPI has contracts to purchase renewable energy from independent \npower producers (“IPPs”), which own 546 MW of capacity. NSPI also has rights to 153 MW of Maritime Link capacity, representing \nNalcor Energy’s (“Nalcor”) Nova Scotia Block (“NS Block”) delivery obligations, as discussed below. NSPI owns approximately \n5,000 kilometres of transmission facilities and 28,000 kilometres of distribution facilities.\nNSPI’s approved regulated ROE range is 8.75 per cent to 9.25 per cent, based on an actual five-quarter average regulated \ncommon equity component of up to 40 per cent of approved rate base. \nNSPI anticipates earning near the low end of its allowed ROE range in 2023, and below the allowed range in 2024. NSPI expects \nearnings and sales volumes to be higher in 2023 than 2022. \nNSPI operated under a three-year fuel stability plan which resulted in an average annual overall rate increase of 1.5 per cent to \nrecover fuel costs for the period of 2020 through 2022. These rates include recovery of Maritime Link costs (discussed below in \nthe “ENL, NSPML” section)."

      "text": "Management’s Discussion & Analysis\n21\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\nOn November 9, 2022, the Nova Scotia provincial government enacted Bill 212, “Public Utilities Act (amended)”. The legislation \nlimits non-fuel rate increases in NSPI’s 2022 General Rate Application (“GRA”) to the UARB, excluding increases relating to \ndemand side management (“DSM”) costs, to a total of 1.8 per cent between the effective date of the UARB’s decision and the end \nof 2024. The legislation also: \n•\t requires revenue generated from the non-fuel rate increase to be used only to improve the reliability of service to ratepayers,\n•\t limits NSPI’s return on equity to 9.25 per cent and equity ratio to 40 per cent, and\n•\t limits the rate used to accrue interest on regulatory deferrals to the Bank of Canada policy interest rate plus 1.75 per cent, \nunless otherwise directed by the UARB.\nActions required to address the impact of Bill 212, “Public Utilities Act (amended)”, include a material reduction in NSPI’s planned \ncapital investments and operating costs over the 2023 through 2024 period. Such deferral of capital investment and operating \ncosts may result in higher customer costs in future periods. The legislation will have a direct and negative impact on the financial \nperformance of NSPI and has had a negative impact on NSPI’s credit quality. For more information on this risk, refer to the “Risk \nManagement and Financial Instruments – Regulatory and Political Risk” section.\nOn November 24, 2022, NSPI filed with the UARB a comprehensive settlement agreement between NSPI, key customer \nrepresentatives and participating interest groups (“NSPI Settlement Agreement”) in relation to its GRA filed in January 2022. \nThe NSPI Settlement Agreement was structured to be consistent with the amendments to the Public Utilities Act made under \nBill 212, which included a 1.8 per cent cap on non-fuel rate increases for 2023 and 2024. Bill 212, “Public Utilities Act (amended),” \nis described further above. The NSPI Settlement Agreement also addresses the recovery of fuel costs over the settlement period \nand establishes a DSM rider. This will result in a combined fuel and non-fuel rate increase of 6.9 per cent each year for 2023 \nand 2024 and annualized incremental revenue (fuel and non-fuel) of $105 million in 2023 and $115 million in 2024. In addition, \nany under or over recovery of fuel costs will be addressed through the UARB’s established FAM process. NSPI’s ROE range will \ncontinue to be 8.75 per cent to 9.25 per cent, based on an actual five-quarter average regulated common equity component of \nup to 40 per cent. The NSPI Settlement Agreement also establishes a storm rider for each of 2023, 2024 and 2025, which gives \nNSPI the option to apply to the UARB for recovery of costs if major storm restoration expense exceeds approximately $10 million \nin a given year. On February 2, 2023, NSPI received the UARB’s decision, which substantially approved the NSPI Settlement \nAgreement as filed. Approved rate increases will be effective as of the date of the decision. \nOn September 24, 2022, Nova Scotia was struck by Hurricane Fiona, which made landfall as a post-tropical storm equivalent \nto a Category 2 hurricane. The storm had sustained winds of over 100 kilometres per hour and peak gusts of approximately \n180 kilometres per hour. This historic storm for Nova Scotia caused significant and widespread damage to NSPI’s transmission and \ndistribution system and at the height of the storm approximately 415,000 customers lost power. The total cost of the restoration \nwas approximately $115 million, of which $91 million was capitalized to Property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”) and $24 million \ndeferred to Other long-term assets for future amortization, subject to UARB approval. NSPI intends to submit an application to the \nUARB requesting to defer the recognition of incremental operating costs related to storm restoration. If the deferral is approved, \nthis balance will be reclassified to “Regulatory assets” and amortized over the UARB approved recognition period. \nEnergy from renewable sources has increased with Nalcor’s NS Block delivery obligations from the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric \nproject (“Muskrat Falls”) commencing in 2021. Nalcor is obligated to provide NSPI with approximately 900 GWh of energy \nannually over 35 years. In addition, for the first five years of the NS Block, Nalcor is obligated to provide approximately 240 GWh \nof additional energy from the Supplemental Energy Block transmitted through the Maritime Link. Nalcor’s final commissioning of \nthe LIL has experienced delays and it’s expected that final commissioning of the LIL will be completed in 2023. During these final \nstages of commissioning, there will be interruptions in supply, with any resultant delivery shortfalls being delivered on a timely \nbasis in accordance with the Energy and Capacity Agreement. NSPI has the option of purchasing additional market-priced energy \nfrom Nalcor through the Energy Access Agreement. The Energy Access Agreement enables NSPI to access a market-priced bid \nfrom Nalcor for up to 1.8 Terawatt hours (“TWh”) of energy in any given year and, on average, 1.2 TWh of energy per year through \nAugust 31, 2041.\nCapital investment for 2023, including AFUDC, is expected to be approximately $375 million (2022 – $540 million). NSPI is \nprimarily investing in capital projects required to support power system reliability and reliable service for customers."

      "text": "Management’s Discussion & Analysis\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n22\nEnvironmental Legislation and Regulations\nNSPI is subject to environmental laws and regulations set by both the Government of Canada and the Province of Nova Scotia. \nNSPI continues to work with both levels of government to comply with these laws and regulations to maximize efficiency of \nemission control measures and minimize customer cost. NSPI anticipates that costs prudently incurred to achieve legislated \ncompliance will be recoverable under NSPI’s regulatory framework. NSPI faces risks associated with achieving climate-related \nand environmental legislative requirements, including the risk of non-compliance, which could adversely affect NSPI’s operations \nand financial performance. For further discussion on these risks and environmental legislation and regulations, refer to the \n“Enterprise Risk and Risk Management” section. Recent developments related to provincial and federal environmental laws and \nregulations are outlined below.\nNova Scotia Cap-and-Trade Program Regulations:\nNSPI is a participant in the Nova Scotia Cap-and-Trade Program (“Cap-and-Trade Program”) and is subject to the 2019 through \n2022 compliance period. NSPI received granted emissions allowances under the Cap-and-Trade Program and is permitted to \npurchase up to five per cent of the credits available at provincial auctions. Any remaining allowance shortfall requires the \npurchase of reserve credits directly from the provincial government, which are anticipated to be priced at a premium to provincial \nauction pricing. Compliance is forecast to be achieved through granted emissions allowances and credit purchases under the \nCap-and-Trade Program, including reserve credits. Lower than forecast Muskrat Falls energy received during the compliance \nperiod has resulted in the increased deployment of higher carbon-emitting generation sources. The Province of Nova Scotia has \nagreed to provide approximately $165 million of relief from the 2019 through 2022 compliance costs, which was equal to the \ntotal cost of compliance forecast at the time of the fuel update submitted by NSPI to the UARB in September 2022 as part of the \nGRA. Discussions related to the final amount of relief and how this relief will be provided are ongoing. Further, NSPI’s regulatory \nframework provides for the recovery of costs prudently incurred to comply with the Cap-and-Trade Program Regulations pursuant \nto NSPI’s FAM.\nCarbon Pricing Regulations:\nOn November 9, 2022, the Nova Scotia provincial government enacted Bill 208, “Environment Act (amended)”. The legislation \nprovides the framework for Nova Scotia’s system to comply with the federal government’s 2023 through 2030 carbon pollution \npricing regulations laid out in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. Nova Scotia’s proposed \nsystem utilizes an output-based pricing system that will implement performance standards for large industrial greenhouse \ngas emitters to achieve emission reduction goals. Subsequent regulations will be required to detail how the pricing system \nwill operate. The Province of Nova Scotia’s proposed output-based pricing system is subject to the approval of the federal \ngovernment. If an agreement is not reached between the federal and provincial governments on a Nova Scotia system that \nmeets the federal compliance criteria, Nova Scotia will be subject to the federal carbon pollution pricing backstop which uses \nemissions performances standards that vary by fuel type, and a carbon price that will start at $65 per tonne in 2023 and increase \nby $15 per tonne annually, reaching $170 per tonne by 2030. NSPI’s regulatory framework provides for the recovery of costs \nprudently incurred to comply with carbon pricing programs pursuant to NSPI’s FAM.\nNova Scotia Renewable Energy Regulations:\nUnder the provincially legislated Renewable Energy Regulations, 40 per cent of electric sales must be generated from renewable \nsources. This standard was predicated on receipt of the full NS Block. Due to the delay of the NS Block, the provincial government \nprovided NSPI with an alternative compliance plan that requires NSPI to achieve 40 per cent of electric sales generated from \nrenewable sources over the 2020 through 2022 period. With delivery of the NS Block commencing later than anticipated, as well \nas further interruptions in supply due to delays in the LIL, NSPI did not achieve the requirements of the alternative compliance \nplan. The Renewable Energy Regulations require NSPI to have acted in a duly diligent manner. If NSPI is found not to have acted \nin a duly diligent manner, it could be subject to a maximum penalty of $10 million."

Both the NSPML and LIL \ninvestments are recorded as “Investments subject to significant influence” on Emera’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNSPML\nEquity earnings from the Maritime Link are dependent on the approved ROE and operational performance of NSPML. NSPML’s \napproved regulated ROE range is 8.75 per cent to 9.25 per cent, based on an actual five-quarter average regulated common \nequity component of up to 30 per cent.\nThe Maritime Link assets entered service on January 15, 2018, enabling the transmission of energy between Newfoundland and \nNova Scotia, improved reliability and ancillary benefits, supporting the efficiency and reliability of energy in both provinces. \nNalcor continues to advance towards completion of the LIL, and it’s expected final commissioning will be achieved in 2023. \nNalcor’s NS Block delivery obligations commenced on August 15, 2021, and the NS Block will be delivered over the next 35 years \npursuant to the project agreements. As Nalcor is in the final stages of commissioning the LIL, there will be commissioning related \ninterruptions in supply with any resultant delivery shortfalls being delivered on a timely basis in accordance with the Energy and \nCapacity Agreement.\nIn February 2022, the UARB issued its decision and Board Order approving NSPML’s requested rate base of approximately \n$1.8 billion less $9 million of costs ($7 million after-tax) that would not have otherwise been recoverable if incurred by NSPI. \nNSPML also received approval to collect up to $168 million (2021 – $172 million) from NSPI for the recovery of costs associated \nwith the Maritime Link in 2022. This was subject to a holdback of up to $2 million per month, beginning April 2022, contingent \non receiving at least 90 per cent of NS Block deliveries, including Supplemental Energy deliveries. \nIn December 2022, NSPML received UARB approval to collect up to $164 million from NSPI for the recovery of costs associated \nwith the Maritime Link in 2023. This continues to be subject to a holdback of up to $2 million a month, as discussed above. On \nDecember 22, 2022, the UARB clarified its earlier direction regarding the holdback and NSPI can now release the holdback to \nNSPML when 90 per cent of NS Block deliveries, including Supplemental Energy deliveries, is achieved. This enabled NSPI to pay \nNSPML approximately $4 million of the 2022 holdback. As of December 31, 2022, an additional $14 million in aggregate has been \nheld back by NSPI. Determination of allocation of the $14 million between NSPML and NSPI will be subject to a regulatory process \nthat is expected to commence in early 2023 to review the holdback mechanism. \nNSPML does not anticipate any significant capital investment in 2023.\nLIL\nENL is a limited partner with Nalcor in LIL. Construction of the LIL is complete and Nalcor is forecasting it will achieve final \ncommissioning in 2023.\nEquity earnings from the LIL investment are based upon the book value of the equity investment and the approved ROE. Emera’s \ncurrent equity investment is $740 million, comprised of $410 million in equity contribution and $330 million of accumulated \nequity earnings. Emera’s total equity contribution in the LIL, excluding accumulated equity earnings, is estimated to be \napproximately $650 million after the Lower Churchill projects are completed.\nCash earnings and return of equity will begin after commissioning of the LIL by Nalcor, which is anticipated in 2023, and until that \npoint Emera will continue to record AFUDC earnings.\nGAS UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure includes PGS, NMGC, SeaCoast, Brunswick Pipeline and Emera’s non-consolidated investment in \nM&NP. PGS is a regulated gas distribution utility engaged in the purchase, distribution and sale of natural gas serving customers \nin Florida.

Natural gas throughput (the amount of gas delivered to its customers, including \ntransportation-only service) was 2 billion therms in 2022. \nThe approved ROE range for PGS is 8.9 per cent to 11.0 per cent, based on an allowed equity capital structure of 54.7 per cent. \nAn ROE of 9.9 per cent is used for the calculation of return on investments for clauses.\nNew Mexico Gas Company, Inc.\nWith $2.0 billion USD of assets and approximately 545,000 customers, NMGC’s system includes approximately 2,426 kilometres \nof transmission pipelines and 17,781 kilometres of distribution pipelines. Annual natural gas throughput was approximately \n926 million therms in 2022.\nThe approved ROE for NMGC is 9.375 per cent, on an allowed equity capital structure of 52 per cent. \nGas Utilities and Infrastructure Outlook\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure USD earnings are anticipated to be higher in 2023 than 2022, primarily due to a base rate \nincrease at NMGC, effective January 2023. \nPGS expects 2023 rate base growth and USD earnings to be consistent with 2022 as higher revenues from customer growth \noffset increased interest expenses and the effect of inflation. Increased residential and commercial sales volumes and customer \ngrowth are anticipated in 2023. PGS anticipates earning below its allowed ROE range in 2023 primarily due to rate base growth. \nAs a result, on February 3, 2023, PGS notified the FPSC that it is planning to file a base rate proceeding in April 2023 for new \nrates effective January 2024. \nThe PGS rate case settlement, which was approved in November 2020, provides the ability to reverse a total of $34 million USD \nof accumulated depreciation through 2023. Through December 31, 2022, PGS reversed $14 million USD accumulated depreciation. \nThe reversal of the remaining accumulated depreciation is expected to occur over 2023.\nNMGC expects 2023 rate base and USD earnings to be higher in 2023 than 2022 due to base rate increases effective January \n2023, as discussed below, and rate base growth to expand the distribution system and to continue to reliably serve customers. \nNMGC anticipates earning near its authorized ROE in 2023 and expects customer growth rates to be consistent with historical \ntrends. NMGC’s asset optimization revenues for 2022 were well above the historical average, and may not recur in 2023.\nOn December 13, 2021, NMGC filed a rate case with the NMPRC for new rates to become effective January 2023. On May 20, 2022, \nNMGC filed an unopposed settlement agreement with the NMPRC for an increase of $19 million USD in annual base revenues. \nThe rates reflect the recovery of increased operating costs and capital investments in pipelines and related infrastructure. The \nNMPRC approved the settlement agreement on November 30, 2022.\nIn 2018, SeaCoast executed a 34-year agreement to provide long-term firm gas transportation service via a 21-mile, 30-inch \npipeline lateral. The lease of the pipeline lateral commenced January 1, 2022.\nIn 2023, capital investment in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment is expected to be approximately $475 million USD \n(2022 – $436 million USD), including AFUDC. PGS will make investments to expand its system and support customer growth. \nNMGC will continue to make investments to maintain the reliability of its system and support customer growth. \nOTHER ELECTRIC UTILITIES\nOther Electric Utilities includes Emera (Caribbean) Incorporated (“ECI”), a holding company with regulated electric utilities. ECI’s \nregulated utilities include vertically integrated regulated electric utilities of BLPC on the island of Barbados, GBPC on Grand \nBahama Island, and a 19.5 per cent interest in Lucelec on the island of St. Lucia, which is accounted for on the equity basis.\nOn March 31, 2022, Emera completed the sale of its 51.9 per cent interest in Dominica Electricity Services Ltd.

BLPC owns approximately 188 kilometres of transmission facilities and \n3,789 kilometres of distribution facilities. BLPC’s approved regulated return on rate base for 2022 was 10 per cent.\nGBPC\nWith $338 million USD of assets and approximately 19,000 customers, GBPC owns 98 MW of oil-fired generation, approximately \n90 kilometres of transmission facilities and 670 kilometres of distribution facilities. GBPC’s approved regulatory return on rate \nbase for 2023 is 8.32 per cent (2022 – 8.23 per cent). \nOther Electric Utilities Outlook\nAbsent the impact of the GBPC impairment charge in Q4 2022, Other Electric Utilities’ USD earnings in 2023 are expected to \nincrease over the prior year primarily as a result of higher earnings due to higher base rates at BLPC.\nBLPC currently operates pursuant to a franchise to generate, transmit and distribute electricity on the island of Barbados \nuntil 2028. In 2019, the Government of Barbados passed legislation amending the number of licenses required for the supply \nof electricity from a single integrated license which currently exists, to multiple licenses for Generation, Transmission and \nDistribution, Storage, Dispatch and Sales. In March 2021, BLPC reached commercial agreement with the Government of Barbados \nfor each of the license types, subject to the passage of implementing legislation. The new licenses are expected to take effect \nin 2023 on completion of the legislative process. The Dispatch license will have a term of five years with the remaining licenses \nhaving terms ranging from 25-30 years. BLPC anticipates that any increased costs associated with the implementation of the new \nmulti-licensed structure will be recoverable through BLPC’s regulatory framework. BLPC is awaiting final enactment and will work \ntowards implementation of the licenses once received.\nOn October 4, 2021 BLPC submitted a general rate review application to the FTC. The application seeks a rate adjustment and \nthe implementation of a cost reflective rate structure that will facilitate the changes expected in the newly reformed electricity \nmarket and the country’s transition toward 100 per cent renewable energy generation. The application seeks recovery of capital \ninvestment in plant, equipment and related infrastructure and results in an increase in annual non-fuel revenue of approximately \n$23 million USD upon approval. The application includes a request for an allowed regulatory ROE of 12.50 per cent on an allowed \nequity capital structure of 65 per cent. On September 16, 2022, the FTC granted BLPC interim rate relief, allowing an increase \nin base rates of approximately $3 million USD for the remainder of 2022 and approximately $1 million USD per month for \n2023. Interim rate relief is effective from September 16, 2022 until the implementation of final rates. The hearing concluded in \nOctober 2022. On February 15, 2023, the FTC issued a decision on the BLPC rate review application which included the following \nsignificant items: an allowed regulatory ROE of 11.75 per cent, an equity capital structure of 55 per cent, a directive to update \nthe major components of rate base to September 16, 2022, and a directive to establish regulatory liabilities of approximately \n$70 million USD related to the self-insurance fund, accumulated depreciation, and taxes. The impacts to BLPC’s rate base and \nfinal rates are not yet determinable but management does not expect the decision to have a material impact on Emera’s adjusted \nnet income. BLPC will seek to clarify aspects of the FTC decision in its compliance filing and is also considering filing a submission \nto the FTC for a review of the decision. BLPC expects a decision on final rates from the FTC in 2023.\nOn January 14, 2022, the GBPA issued its decision on GBPC’s rate application. The decision, which became effective April 1, 2022, \nallows for an increase in revenues of $3.5 million USD. The new rates include a regulatory ROE of 12.84 per cent.\nEffective November 1, 2022, GBPC’s fuel pass through charge was increased due to an increase in global oil prices impacting the \nunhedged fuel cost. In 2023, the fuel pass through charge will be adjusted monthly, in-line with actual fuel costs.\nIn 2023, capital investment in the Other Electric Utilities segment is expected to be approximately $65 million USD (2022 – \n$48 million USD), primarily in more efficient and cleaner sources of generation, including renewables and battery storage."

EES is \ngenerally expected to deliver annual adjusted net income within its guidance range of $15 to $30 million USD ($45 to $70 million \nUSD of margin).\nAbsent the TGH award in Q4 2022, the adjusted net loss from the Other segment is expected to be higher in 2023, based on EES \nreturning to its normal earnings range in 2023 and increased interest expense. The increase is expected to be partially offset by \ndecreased taxes due to a higher net loss. \nThe Other segment does not anticipate any significant capital investment in 2023."

Variance explanations of the MTM changes for this quarter and for the year are explained in the \nchart below. \nEmera Energy has a number of asset management agreements (“AMA”) with counterparties, including local gas distribution \nutilities, power utilities and natural gas producers in North America. The AMAs involve Emera Energy buying or selling gas for a \nspecific term, and the corresponding release of the counterparties’ gas transportation/storage capacity to Emera Energy. MTM \nadjustments on these AMAs arise on the price differential between the point where gas is sourced and where it is delivered. At \ninception, the MTM adjustment is offset fully by the value of the corresponding gas transportation asset, which is amortized over \nthe term of the AMA contract."

MTM adjustments may be substantial during the term \nof the contract, especially in the winter months of a contract when delivered volumes and market pricing are usually at peak \nlevels.

Utility \ncustomer bases are diversified by both sales volumes and revenues among customer classes. Emera’s non-regulated businesses \nprovide diverse revenue streams and counterparties to the business. Circumstances that could affect the Company’s ability \nto generate cash include changes to global macro-economic conditions, downturns in markets served by Emera, impact of \nfuel commodity price changes on collateral requirements and timely recoveries of fuel costs from customers, the loss of one \nor more large customers, regulatory decisions affecting customer rates and the recovery of regulatory assets, and changes \nin environmental legislation. Emera’s subsidiaries are generally in a financial position to contribute cash dividends to Emera \nprovided they do not breach their debt covenants, where applicable, after giving effect to the dividend payment, and maintain \ntheir credit metrics.\nEmera’s future liquidity and capital needs will be predominately for working capital requirements, ongoing rate base investment, \nbusiness acquisitions, greenfield development, dividends and debt servicing. Emera has an $8 – 9 billion capital investment plan \nover the 2023-to-2025 period (including a $240 million equity investment in the LIL in 2023), mainly focused in Florida. This plan \nincludes significant rate base investments across the portfolio in renewable and cleaner generation, infrastructure modernization \nand customer-focused technologies. Capital investments at the regulated utilities are subject to regulatory approval.\nEmera plans to use cash from operations and debt raised at the utilities to support normal operations, repayment of existing \ndebt, and capital requirements. Debt raised at certain of the Company’s utilities is subject to applicable regulatory approvals. \nEquity requirements in support of the Company’s capital investment plan are expected to be funded through the issuance of \npreferred equity and the issuance of common equity through Emera’s DRIP and ATM program. \nEmera has credit facilities with varying maturities that cumulatively provide $4.7 billion of credit, with approximately $1.1 billion \nundrawn and available at December 31, 2022. The Company was holding a cash balance of $332 million at December 31, 2022. For \nfurther discussion, refer to the “Debt Management” section below.

This \ndecrease was due to under-recovery of clause-related costs primarily due to higher natural gas prices at Tampa Electric, \nunfavourable changes in Tampa Electric’s storm reserve balance as a result of Hurricane Ian, increased fuel for generation \nand purchased power at NSPI, and decreased long-term payables due to the Nova Scotia Cap-and-Trade accrued emissions \ncompliance charges being reclassified to other current liabilities as the liability is anticipated to be settled in 2023. This was \npartially offset by the 2021 deferral of gas costs at NMGC resulting from the extreme cold weather event, increased revenues at \nTampa Electric and NSPI, favourable changes in regulatory liabilities due to the NMGC gas hedge settlement, TGH award, and \nincreased marketing and trading margin at Emera Energy.\nChanges in working capital decreased operating cash flows by $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease \nwas due to unfavourable changes in accounts receivable at NMGC due to the gas hedge settlement, unfavourable changes \nin accounts receivable at NSPI, unfavourable changes in cash collateral positions on derivative instruments at NSPI, and the \nrequired prepayment of income taxes and related interest at NSPI. This was partially offset by the Nova Scotia Cap-and-Trade \naccrued emissions compliance charges, favourable changes in cash collateral positions at Emera Energy, and favourable changes \nin accounts payable at Tampa Electric and NMGC.\nCash Flow Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $237 million to $2,569 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to \n$2,332 million in 2021. The increase was due to higher capital investment in 2022.\nCapital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2022, including AFUDC, were $2,646 million compared to $2,420 million in \n2021. Details of 2022 capital spending by segment are shown below: \n•\t $1,481 million – Florida Electric Utility (2021 – $1,408 million);\n•\t $518 million – Canadian Electric Utilities (2021 – $374 million);\n•\t $578 million – Gas Utilities and Infrastructure (2021 – $522 million); \n•\t $63 million – Other Electric Utilities (2021 – $111 million); and\n•\t $6 million – Other (2021 – $5 million)."

This increase was due to higher proceeds of short-term debt at Tampa Electric, proceeds \nfrom committed credit facilities at NSPI, and term loan issuance at Emera in 2022.

This reduces volatility in the cash funding requirement as the impact of investment gains and losses are recognized \nover a three-year period. The cash required in 2023 for defined benefit pension plans is expected to be $44 million (2022 – \n$45 million). All pension plan contributions are tax deductible and will be funded with cash from operations.\nEmera’s defined benefit pension plans employ a long-term strategic approach with respect to asset allocation, real return and \nrisk. The underlying objective is to earn an appropriate return, given the Company’s goal of preserving capital with an acceptable \nlevel of risk for the pension fund investments. \nTo achieve the overall long-term asset allocation, pension assets are managed by external investment managers per the pension \nplan’s investment policy and governance framework. The asset allocation includes investments in the assets of Canadian and \nglobal equities, domestic and global bonds and short-term investments. Emera reviews investment manager performance on a \nregular basis and adjusts the plans’ asset mixes as needed in accordance with the pension plans’ investment policy.\nEmera’s projected contributions to defined contribution pension plans are $44 million for 2023 (2022 – $41 million). \nDEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN SUMMARY\nin millions of dollars\nPlans by region\nTECO Energy\nNSPI\nCaribbean\nTotal\nAssets as at December 31, 2022\n$\t\n 880\n$\t  1,273\n$\t\n 10\n$\t\n2,163\nAccounting obligation at December 31, 2022\n$\t\n902\n$\t  1,240\n$\t\n 16\n$\t  2,158\nAccounting expense during fiscal 2022\n$\t\n 10\n$\t\n(3) $\t\n 1\n$\t\n 8\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDEFEASANCE\nUpon privatization in 1992, NSPI became responsible for managing a portfolio of defeasance securities that provide principal and \ninterest streams to match the related defeased debt, which at December 31, 2022 totalled $200 million (2021 – $200 million). The \nsecurities are held in trust for an affiliate of the Province of Nova Scotia. Approximately 66 per cent of the defeasance portfolio \nconsists of investments in the related debt, eliminating all risk associated with this portion of the portfolio; the remaining \ndefeasance portfolio has a market value higher than the related debt, reducing the future risk of this portion of the portfolio.\nGUARANTEES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT\nEmera has guarantees and letters of credit on behalf of third parties outstanding.

Certain \nrisk management activities for Emera are overseen by the ERMC to ensure such risks are appropriately identified, assessed, \nmonitored and subject to appropriate controls. \nThe Board of Directors established a Risk and Sustainability Committee (“RSC”) in September 2021. The mandate of the RSC is \nto assist the Board in carrying out its risk and sustainability oversight responsibilities. The RSC’s mandate includes oversight of \nthe Company’s Enterprise Risk Management framework, including the identification, assessment, monitoring and management \nof enterprise risks. It also includes oversight of the Company’s approach to sustainability and its performance relative to its \nsustainability objectives.\nThe Company’s financial risk management activities are focused on those areas that most significantly impact profitability, \nquality and consistency of income, and cash flow. Emera’s risk management focus extends to key operational risks including \nsafety and environment, which represent core values of Emera. In this section, Emera describes the principal risks that \nmanagement believes could materially affect its business, revenues, operating income, net income, net assets, liquidity or capital \nresources. The nature of risk is such that no list is comprehensive, and other risks may arise or risks not currently considered \nmaterial may become material in the future.\nREGULATORY AND POLITICAL RISK\nThe Company’s rate-regulated subsidiaries and certain investments subject to significant influence are subject to risk of \nthe recovery of costs and investments. Regulatory and political risk can include changes in regulatory frameworks, shifts in \ngovernment policy, legislative changes, and regulatory decisions.\nAs cost-of-service utilities with an obligation to serve customers, Emera’s utilities operate under formal regulatory frameworks, \nand must obtain regulatory approval to change or add rates and/or riders. Emera also holds investments in entities in which it \nhas significant influence, and which are subject to regulatory and political risk including NSPML, LIL, and M&NP. As a regulated \nGroup II pipeline, the tolls of Brunswick Pipeline are regulated by the CER on a complaint basis, as opposed to the regulatory \napproval process described above. In the absence of a complaint, the CER does not normally undertake a detailed examination \nof Brunswick Pipeline’s tolls, which are subject to a firm service agreement, expiring in 2034, with Repsol Energy North America \nCanada Partnership. The agreement provides for a predetermined toll increase in the fifth and fifteenth year of the contract.\nRegulators administer legislation covering material aspects of the utilities’ businesses, including customer rates and/or riders, \nthe underlying allowed ROEs, deemed capital structures, capital investment, the terms and conditions for the provision of service, \nperformance standards, and affiliate transactions. Costs and investments can be recovered upon approval by the respective \nregulator as an adjustment to rates and/or riders, which normally require a public hearing process or may be mandated by other \ngovernmental bodies. During public hearing processes, consultants and customer representatives scrutinize the costs, actions \nand plans of these rate-regulated companies, and their respective regulators determine whether to allow recovery and to adjust \nrates based upon the evidence and any contrary evidence from other parties. In some circumstances, other government bodies \nmay influence the setting of rates. Regulatory decisions, legislative changes, and prolonged delays in the recovery of costs or \nregulatory assets could result in decreased rate affordability for customers and could materially affect Emera and its utilities. \nEmera’s utilities generally manage this risk through transparent regulatory disclosure, ongoing stakeholder and government \nconsultation, and multi-party engagement on aspects such as utility operations, regulatory audits, rate filings and capital \nplans. The subsidiaries employ a collaborative regulatory approach through technical conferences and, where appropriate, \nnegotiated settlements. \nChanges in government and shifts in government policy and legislation can impact the commercial and regulatory frameworks \nunder which Emera and its subsidiaries operate. This includes initiatives regarding deregulation or restructuring of the energy \nindustry. Deregulation or restructuring of the energy industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that \ncould adversely affect operations, net income and cash flows. State and local policies in some United States jurisdictions have \nsought to prevent or limit the ability of utilities to provide customers the choice to use natural gas while in other jurisdictions \npolicies have been adopted to prevent limitations on the use of natural gas. Changes in applicable state or local laws and \nregulations, including electrification legislation, could adversely impact PGS and NMGC."

Government interference in the \nregulatory process can undermine regulatory stability, predictability, and independence, and could have a material adverse effect \non the Company.\nGLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE RISK\nThe Company is subject to risks that may arise from the impacts of climate change. There is increasing public concern about \nclimate change and growing support for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Municipal, state, provincial and federal governments \nhave been setting policies and enacting laws and regulations to deal with climate change impacts in a variety of ways, including \ndecarbonization initiatives and promotion of cleaner energy and renewable energy generation of electricity. Refer to “Changes in \nEnvironmental Legislation” risk below. Insurance companies have begun to limit their exposure to coal-fired electricity generation \nand are evaluating the medium and long-term impacts of climate change which may result in fewer insurers, more restrictive \ncoverage and increased premiums. Refer to the “Markets” section below and “Uninsured Risk”.\nClimate change may lead to increased frequency and intensity of weather events and related impacts such as storms, ice storms, \nhurricanes, cyclones, heavy rainfall, extreme winds, wildfires, flooding and storm surge. The potential impacts of climate change, \nsuch as rising sea levels and larger storm surges from more intense hurricanes, can combine to produce even greater damage \nto coastal generation and other facilities. Climate change is also characterized by rising global temperatures. Increased air \ntemperatures may bring increased frequency and severity of wildfires within the Company’s service territories. Refer to “Weather \nRisk” and “System Operating and Maintenance Risks”.\nThe Company has made significant investments to facilitate the use of renewable and lower-carbon energy including wind \ngeneration, the Maritime Link in Atlantic Canada, and in Florida, solar generation and modernization of the Big Bend Power \nStation. Tampa Electric has taken significant steps to reduce overall emissions at its facilities as a result of its capital investment \nplan which has and will continue to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In 2022, NSPI achieved reductions of carbon dioxide \nemissions of approximately 45 per cent from 2005 levels. NSPI expects to exceed the Canadian target of 40-45 per cent \nreduction by 2030, as set out in the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act. Both the Government of Nova Scotia and \nthe Government of Canada have enacted or introduced legislation that includes goals of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. The \nProvince of Nova Scotia has established targets with respect to the percentage of renewable energy in NSPI’s generation mix, \nreductions in GHG emissions, as well as the goal to phase out coal-fired electricity generation by 2030. Failure to meet such goals \nby 2030 could result in material fines, penalties, other sanctions and adverse reputational impacts. NSPI continues to work with \nboth the provincial and federal governments on measures to seek to address their carbon reduction goals. Future compliance \nwith provincial and federal GHG emission caps, coal phase out requirements and targets, and renewable standards has been \nchallenged as a result of the constraints imposed by the enactment of Bill 212, “Public Utilities Act (amended)”. Within Emera’s \nnatural gas utilities, there are ongoing efforts to reduce methane and carbon dioxide emissions through replacement of aging \ninfrastructure, more efficient operations, operational and supply chain optimization, and support of public policy initiatives that \naddress the effects of climate change.\nThe Company’s long-term capital investment plan includes significant investment across the portfolio in renewable and \ncleaner generation, infrastructure modernization, storm hardening, energy storage and customer-focused technologies. All \nthese initiatives contribute toward mitigating the potential impacts of climate change. The Company continues to engage with \ngovernment, regulators, industry partners and stakeholders to share information and participate in the development of climate \nchange related policies and initiatives. \nPhysical Impacts\nThe Company is subject to physical risks that arise, or may arise, from global climate change, including damage to operating \nassets from more frequent and intense weather events and from wildfires due to warming air temperatures and increasing \ndrought conditions. Substantially all of the Company’s fossil fueled generation assets are located at or near coastal sites and, as \nsuch, are exposed to the separate and combined effects of rising sea levels and increasing storm intensity, including storm surges \nand flooding.

The Company seeks to mitigate these risks \nthrough close monitoring of such developments and adaptive changes to supply chain procurement strategies.\nGiven concerns regarding carbon-emitting generation, those assets and businesses may, over time, become difficult (or \nuneconomic) to insure in commercial insurance markets. In the short term, this may be mitigated through increased investment \nin engineered protection or alternative risk financing (such as funded self-insurance or regulatory structures, including storm \nreserves). Longer-term mitigation may be achieved through infrastructure siting decisions and further engineered protections. \nThis risk may also be mitigated through the continued transition away from high-carbon generation sources to sources with low \nor zero carbon dioxide emissions.\nPolicy\nGovernment and regulatory initiatives, including greenhouse gas emissions standards, air emissions standards and generation \nmix standards, are being proposed and adopted in many jurisdictions in response to concerns regarding the effects of climate \nchange. In some jurisdictions, government policy has included timelines for mandated shutdowns of coal generating facilities, \npercentage of electricity generation from renewables, carbon pricing, emissions limits and cap and trade mechanisms. Over \nthe medium and longer terms, this could potentially lead to a significant portion of hydrocarbon infrastructure assets being \nsubject to additional regulation and limitations in respect of GHG emissions and operations. The Company is subject to climate-\nrelated and environmental legislative and regulatory requirements. Such legislative and regulatory initiatives could adversely \naffect Emera’s operations and financial performance. Refer to “Regulatory and Political Risk” and “Changes in Environmental \nLegislation” risk. The Company seeks to mitigate these risks through active engagement with governments and regulators \nto pursue transition strategies that meet the needs of customers, stakeholders and the Company. This has included NSPI’s \nparticipation in negotiated equivalency agreements in Nova Scotia to provide for an affordable transition to lower-carbon \ngeneration. Equivalency agreements allow NSPI to achieve compliance with federal GHG emissions regulations by meeting \nprovincial legislative and regulatory requirements as they are deemed to be equivalent. There is no guarantee that such \nequivalency agreements will be renewed or remain in force in the future.\nRegulatory\nDepending on the regulatory response to government legislation and regulations, the Company may be exposed to the risk \nof reduced recovery through rates in respect of the affected assets. Valuation impairments could result from such regulatory \noutcomes. Mitigation efforts in respect of these risks include active engagement with policy makers and regulators to find \nmechanisms to avoid such impacts while being responsive to customers’ and stakeholders’ objectives."

The Company addresses these risks through compliance with all relevant laws, emissions \nreduction strategies, and public disclosure of climate change risks.\nWater Resources\nFor thermal plants requiring cooling water, reduced availability of water resulting from climate change could adversely impact \noperations or the costs of operations. The Company seeks ways to reduce and recycle water as it does in its Polk power plant \nin Florida, where recovered and treated wastewater is used in operations to reduce reliance on fresh water supplies in an area \nwhere water is not as abundant as in other markets.\nThe Company operates hydroelectric generation in certain of its markets. Such generation depends on availability of water \nand the hydrological profile of water sources. Changes in precipitation patterns, water temperatures and air temperatures \ncould adversely affect the availability of water and consequently the amount of electricity that may be produced from such \nfacilities. The Company is reinvesting in the efficiency of certain hydroelectric generation facilities to increase generation \ncapacity and continues to monitor changing hydrology patterns. Such issues may also affect the availability of third-party owned \nhydroelectricity purchased power sources.\nWEATHER RISK\nThe Company is subject to risks that arise or may arise from weather including seasonal variations impacting energy sales, more \nfrequent and intense weather events, changing air temperatures, wildfires and extreme weather conditions associated with \nclimate change. Refer to “Global Climate Change Risk”.\nFluctuations in the amount of electricity or natural gas used by customers can vary significantly in response to seasonal changes \nin weather and could impact the operations, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows of the Company’s utilities. \nFor example, Tampa Electric could see lower demand in summer months if temperatures are cooler than expected. Further, \nextreme weather conditions such as hurricanes and other severe weather conditions which may be associated with climate \nchange could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. In the absence of a regulatory recovery mechanism for \nunanticipated costs, such events could influence the Company’s results of operations, financial conditions or cash flows.\nExtreme weather events create a risk of physical damage to the Company’s assets. High winds can impact structures and cause \nwidespread damage to transmission and distribution infrastructure, solar generation, and wind powered generation. Increased \nfrequency and severity of weather events increases the likelihood that the duration of power outages and fuel supply disruptions \ncould increase. Increased frequency and intensity of flooding and storm surge could adversely affect the operations of utilities \nand in particular generation assets. The impact of extreme weather events would be amplified if the same events affect \nmultiple utilities.\nEach of Emera’s regulated electric utilities have programs for storm hardening of transmission and distribution facilities to \nminimize damage, but there can be no assurance that these measures will fully mitigate the risk. This risk to transmission \nand distribution facilities is typically not insured, and as such the restoration cost is generally recovered through regulatory \nprocesses, either in advance through reserves or designated self-insurance funds, or after the fact through the establishment of \nregulatory assets. Recovery is not assured and is subject to prudency review. The risk to generation assets is, in part, mitigated \nthrough the design, siting, construction and maintenance of such facilities, regular risk assessments, engineered mitigation, \nemergency storm response plans, and insurance. \nThe risk of wildfires is addressed primarily through asset management programs for natural gas transmission and distribution \noperations, and vegetation management programs for electric transmission and distribution facilities. If it is found to be \nresponsible for such a fire, the Company could suffer costs, losses and damages, all or some of which may not be recoverable \nthrough insurance, legal, regulatory cost recovery or other processes. If not recovered through these means, they could \nmaterially affect Emera’s business and financial results including its reputation with customers, regulators, governments and \nfinancial markets. Resulting costs could include fire suppression costs, regeneration, timber value, increased insurance costs and \ncosts arising from damages and losses incurred by third parties."

      "text": "Management’s Discussion & Analysis\n51\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\nCHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION \nEmera is subject to regulation by federal, provincial, state, regional and local authorities regarding environmental matters, \nprimarily related to its utility operations. This includes laws setting GHG emissions standards and air emissions standards. Emera \nis also subject to laws regarding waste management, wastewater discharges and aquatic and terrestrial habitats.\nChanges to GHG emissions standards and air emissions standards could adversely affect Emera’s operations and financial \nperformance. Legislative or regulatory changes could influence decisions regarding early retirement of generation facilities \nand may result in stranded costs if the Company is not able to fully recover the costs and investment in the affected generation \nassets. Recovery is not assured and is subject to prudency review. Legislative or regulatory changes may curtail sales of natural \ngas to new customers, which could reduce future customer growth in Emera’s natural gas businesses. Stricter environmental laws \nand enforcement of such laws in the future could increase Emera’s exposure to additional liabilities and costs. These changes \ncould also affect earnings and strategy by changing the nature and timing of capital investments.\nIn addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, there are permit requirements, laws and regulations authorizing \nthe imposition of penalties for non-compliance, including fines, injunctive relief, and other sanctions. The cost of complying \nwith current and future environmental requirements is, and may be, material to Emera. Failure to comply with environmental \nrequirements or to recover environmental costs in a timely manner through rates, could have a material adverse effect on Emera. \nIn addition, Emera’s business could be materially affected by changes in government policy, utility regulation, and environmental \nand other legislation that could occur in response to environmental and climate change concerns. \nEmera manages its environmental risk by operating in a manner that is respectful and protective of the environment and in \ncompliance with applicable legal requirements and Company policy. Emera has implemented this policy through the development \nand application of environmental management systems in its operating subsidiaries. Comprehensive audit programs are in place \nto regularly test compliance. \nCYBERSECURITY RISK\nEmera is exposed to potential risks related to cyberattacks and unauthorized access. The Company increasingly relies on \nIT systems network, and cloud infrastructure to manage its business and safely operate its assets, including controls for \ninterconnected systems of generation, distribution and transmission as well as financial, billing and other business systems. \nEmera also relies on third-party service providers to conduct business. As the Company operates critical infrastructure, it may \nbe at greater risk of cyberattacks by third parties, which could include nation-state-controlled parties. This risk may be further \nelevated by geo-political risks such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\nCyberattacks can reach the Company’s assets and information via their interfaces with third parties or the public internet and \ngain access to critical infrastructures. Cyberattacks can also occur via personnel with direct access to critical assets or trusted \nnetworks. Methods used to attack critical assets could include general purpose or energy-sector-specific malware delivered via \nnetwork transfer, removable media, viruses, attachments, or links in e-mails. The methods used by attackers are continuously \nevolving and can be difficult to predict and detect.\nDespite security measures in place, that are described below, the Company’s systems, assets and information could \nexperience security breaches that could cause system failures, disrupt operations, or adversely affect safety. Such breaches \ncould compromise customer, employee-related or other information systems and could result in loss of service to customers, \nunavailability of critical assets, safety issues, or the release, destruction, or misuse of critical, sensitive or confidential information. \nThese breaches could also delay delivery or result in contamination or degradation of hydrocarbon products the Company \ntransports, stores or distributes. \nCyberattacks or unauthorized accesses may cause costs, losses and damages all, or some of which, may not be recoverable \n(through insurance, legal, regulatory cost recovery or other processes). This could materially adversely affect Emera’s business \nand financial results including its reputation with customers, regulators, governments and financial markets. Resulting costs \ncould include, amongst others, response, recovery and remediation costs, increased protection or insurance costs and costs \narising from damages and losses incurred by third parties. If any such security breaches occur, there is no assurance they can be \nadequately addressed in a timely manner."

With respect to certain of its \nassets, the Company is required to comply with rules and standards relating to cybersecurity and IT including, but not limited to, \nthose mandated by bodies such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, Northeast Power Coordinating Council, \nand the United States Department of Homeland Security. The status of key elements of the Company’s cybersecurity program is \nreported to the RSC.\nPUBLIC HEALTH RISK\nAn outbreak of infectious disease, a pandemic or a similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or a fear of any \nof the foregoing, could adversely impact the Company, including causing operating, supply chain and project development delays \nand disruptions, labour shortages and shutdowns (including as a result of government regulation and prevention measures), \nwhich could have a negative impact on the Company’s operations.\nAny adverse changes in general economic and market conditions arising as a result of a public health threat could negatively \nimpact demand for electricity and natural gas, revenue, operating costs, timing and extent of capital expenditures, results of \nfinancing efforts, or credit risk and counterparty risk; which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. \nThe Company maintains pandemic and business contingency plans in each of its operations to manage and help mitigate the \nimpact of any such public health threat. \nENERGY CONSUMPTION RISK\nEmera’s rate-regulated utilities are affected by demand for energy based on changing customer patterns due to fluctuations in \na number of factors including general economic conditions, weather events, customers’ focus on energy efficiency, changes in \nrates, and advancements in new technologies such as rooftop solar, electric vehicles and battery storage. Government policies \npromoting distributed generation, and new technology developments that enable those policies, have the potential to impact \nhow electricity enters the system and how it is bought and sold. In addition, increases in distributed generation may impact \ndemand resulting in lower load and revenues. These changes could negatively impact Emera’s operations, rate base, net earnings, \nand cash flows. The Company’s rate-regulated utilities are focused on understanding customer demand, energy efficiency, \nand government policy to ensure that the impact of these activities benefit customers, that they do not negatively impact the \nreliability of the energy service and that they are addressed through regulations.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK \nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate changes. Emera operates internationally, with an increasing amount \nof the Company’s net income earned outside of Canada. As such, Emera is exposed to movements in exchange rates between the \nCAD and, particularly, the USD, which could positively or adversely affect results.\nConsistent with the Company’s risk management policies, Emera manages currency risks through matching United States \ndenominated debt to finance its Unites States operations and may use foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge specific \ntransactions and earnings exposure. The Company may enter FX forward and swap contracts to limit exposure on certain foreign \ncurrency transactions such as fuel purchases, revenue streams and capital expenditures, and on net income earned outside of \nCanada. The regulatory framework for the Company’s rate-regulated subsidiaries permits the recovery of prudently incurred \ncosts, including FX.\nThe Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for foreign currency trading or speculative purposes or to hedge \nthe value of its investments in foreign subsidiaries. Exchange gains and losses on net investments in foreign subsidiaries do not \nimpact net income as they are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (“AOCI”) (“AOCL”).\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL MARKET RISK\nLiquidity risk relates to Emera’s ability to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet its financial obligations. Emera manages \nthis risk by forecasting cash requirements on a continuous basis to determine whether sufficient funds are available. Liquidity \nand capital needs could be financed through internally generated cash flows, asset sales, short-term credit facilities, and ongoing \naccess to capital markets. The Company reasonably expects liquidity sources to exceed capital needs."

      "text": "Management’s Discussion & Analysis\n53\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\nEmera’s access to capital and cost of borrowing is subject to several risk factors, including financial market conditions, market \ndisruptions and ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. Disruptions in capital markets could prevent Emera from issuing new \nsecurities or cause the Company to issue securities with less than preferred terms and conditions. Emera’s growth plan requires \nsignificant capital investments in PP&E and the risk associated with changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the \ncost of financing. The Company’s future access to capital and cost of borrowing may be impacted by various market disruptions. \nThe inability to access cost-effective capital could have a material impact on Emera’s ability to fund its growth plan. \nEmera is subject to financial risk associated with changes in its credit ratings. There are a number of factors that rating agencies \nevaluate to determine credit ratings, including the Company’s business, its regulatory framework and legislative environment, \npolitical interference in the regulatory process, the ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification, leverage, liquidity \nand increased exposure to climate change-related impacts, including increased frequency and severity of hurricanes and other \nsevere weather events. A decrease in a credit rating could result in higher interest rates in future financings, increased borrowing \ncosts under certain existing credit facilities, limit access to the commercial paper market, or limit the availability of adequate \ncredit support for subsidiary operations. For certain derivative instruments, if the credit ratings of the Company were reduced \nbelow investment grade, the full value of the net liability of these positions could be required to be posted as collateral. Emera \nmanages these risks by actively monitoring and managing key financial metrics with the objective of sustaining investment grade \ncredit ratings.\nThe Company has exposure to its own common share price through the issuance of various forms of stock-based compensation, \nwhich affect earnings through revaluation of the outstanding units every period. The Company uses equity derivatives to reduce \nthe earnings volatility derived from stock-based compensation.\nGENERAL ECONOMIC RISK\nThe Company has exposure to the macro-economic conditions in North America and in other geographic regions in which Emera \noperates. Like most utilities, economic factors such as consumer income, employment and housing affect demand for electricity \nand natural gas and, in turn, the Company’s financial results. Adverse changes in general economic conditions and inflation \nmay impact the ability of customers to afford rate increases arising from increases to fuel, operating, capital, environmental \ncompliance, and other costs, and therefore could materially affect Emera and its utilities. This may also result in higher credit and \ncounterparty risk, adverse shifts in government policy and legislation, and/or increased risk to full and timely recovery of costs \nand regulatory assets.\nInterest Rate Risk\nEmera utilizes a combination of fixed and floating rate debt financing for operations and capital expenditures, resulting in an \nexposure to interest rate risk. Emera seeks to manage interest rate risk through a portfolio approach that includes the use of \nfixed and floating rate debt with staggered maturities. The Company will, from time to time, issue long-term debt or enter interest \nrate hedging contracts to limit its exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rate debt. \nFor Emera’s regulated subsidiaries, the cost of debt is a component of rates and prudently incurred debt costs are recovered \nfrom customers. Regulatory ROE will generally follow the direction of interest rates, such that regulatory ROEs are likely to fall \nin times of reducing interest rates and rise in times of increasing interest rates, albeit not directly and generally with a lag period \nreflecting the regulatory process. Rising interest rates may also negatively affect the economic viability of project development \nand acquisition initiatives.\nAs with most other utilities and other similar yield-returning investments, Emera’s share price may be affected by changes in \ninterest rates and could underperform the market in an environment of rising interest rates.\nInflation Risk \nThe Company may be exposed to changes in inflation that may result in increased operating and maintenance costs, capital \ninvestment, and fuel costs compared to the revenues provided by customer rates. Emera’s utilities have budgeting and \nforecasting processes to identify inflationary risk factors and measure operating performance, as well as collective bargaining \nagreements that mitigate the short-term impact of inflation on labour costs."

Any projects planned or currently in construction, particularly significant capital projects, may be subject to risks \nincluding, but not limited to, impact on costs from schedule delays, risk of cost overruns, ensuring compliance with operating and \nenvironmental requirements and other events within or beyond the Company’s control. The Company’s projects may also require \napprovals and permits at the federal, provincial, state, regional and local levels. There is no assurance that Emera will be able to \nobtain the necessary project approvals or applicable permits or receive regulatory approval to recover the costs in rates.\nSome of the Company’s assets are located on land owned by third parties, including Indigenous Peoples, and may be subject to \nland claims. Present or future assets may be located on lands that have been used for traditional purposes and therefore subject \nto specific consultations, consents, or conditions for development or operation. If the Company’s rights to locate and operate its \nassets on any such lands are subject to expiry or become invalid, it may incur material costs to renew rights or obtain such rights. \nIf reasonable terms for land-use rights cannot be negotiated, the Company may incur significant costs to remove and relocate its \nassets and restore the land. Additional costs incurred could cause projects to be uneconomical to proceed with.\nEmera manages these project development and land use rights risks by deploying robust project and risk management \napproaches, led by teams with extensive experience in large projects. The Company consults with Indigenous Peoples in \nobtaining approvals, constructing, maintaining and operating such facilities, consistent with laws and public policy frameworks. \nEmera maintains relationships through on-going communications with stakeholders, including Indigenous Peoples, landowners \nand governments.\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK\nEmera is exposed to risk related to its reliance on certain key partners, suppliers, and customers, any of which may endure \nfinancial challenges resulting from commodity price and market volatility, economic instability or adversity, adverse political \nor regulatory changes and other causes which may cause or contribute to such parties’ insolvency, bankruptcy, restructuring \nor default on their contractual obligations to Emera. Emera is also exposed to potential losses related to amounts receivable \nfrom customers, energy marketing collateral deposits and derivative assets due to a counterparty’s non-performance under \nan agreement.\nEmera manages this counterparty risk through due diligence and third-party risk assessment processes prior to signing \ncontracts, contractual rights and remedies, regulatory frameworks, and by monitoring significant developments with its \ncustomers, partners and suppliers. The Company also manages credit risk with policies and procedures for counterparty analysis, \nexposure measurement, and exposure monitoring and mitigation. Credit assessments may be conducted on new customers \nand counterparties, and deposits or collateral may be requested on certain accounts. There is no assurance that management \nstrategies will be effective, and significant counterparty defaults could have a material effect on the Company.\nCOUNTRY RISK\nThe majority of Emera’s earnings are from outside of Canada, mostly concentrated in the United States. Emera’s investments are \ncurrently in regions where political and economic risks are considered by the Company to be acceptable. For more information, \nrefer to the “Regulatory and Political Risk” and “General Economic Risk” sections above. Emera’s operations in some countries \nmay be subject to changes in economic growth, restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital exchange controls, inflation, \nthe effect of global health, safety and environmental matters, including climate change, or economic conditions and market \nconditions, and change in financial policy and availability of credit. The Company mitigates this risk through a rigorous approval \nprocess for investment, and by forecasting cash requirements on a continuous basis to determine whether sufficient funds are \navailable in all affiliates."

      "text": "Management’s Discussion & Analysis\n55\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK\nThe Company’s utility fuel supply is subject to commodity price risk. In addition, Emera Energy is subject to commodity price risk \nthrough its portfolio of commodity contracts and arrangements.\nThe Company manages this risk through established processes and practices to identify, monitor, report and mitigate these risks. \nThese include the Company’s commercial arrangements, such as the combination of supply and purchase agreements, asset \nmanagement agreements, pipeline transportation agreements, and financial hedging instruments. In addition, its credit policies, \ncounterparty credit assessments, market and credit position reporting, and other risk management and reporting practices, are \nalso used to manage and mitigate this risk.\nRegulated Utilities\nThe Company’s utility fuel supply is exposed to broader global conditions, which may include impacts on delivery reliability and \nprice, despite contracted terms. Supply and demand dynamics in fuel markets can be affected by a wide range of factors which \nare difficult to predict and may change rapidly, including but not limited to, currency fluctuations, changes in global economic \nconditions, natural disasters, transportation or production disruptions, and geo-political risks, such as political instability, \nconflicts, changes to international trade agreements, trade sanctions or embargos. The Company seeks to manage this risk using \nfinancial hedging instruments and physical contracts and through contractual protection with counterparties, where applicable. \nThe majority of Emera’s regulated electric and gas utilities have adopted and implemented fuel adjustment mechanisms and \npurchased gas adjustment mechanisms respectively, which further helps manage commodity price risk, as the regulatory \nframework for the Company’s rate-regulated subsidiaries permits the recovery of prudently incurred fuel and gas costs. There \nis no assurance that such mechanisms and regulatory frameworks will continue to exist in the future. Prolonged and substantial \nincreases in fuel prices could result in decreased rate affordability, increased risk of recovery of costs or regulatory assets, and/or \nnegative impacts on customer consumption patterns and sales.\nEmera Energy Marketing and Trading\nEmera Energy has employed further measures to manage commodity risk. The majority of Emera Energy’s portfolio of electricity \nand gas marketing and trading contracts and, in particular, its natural gas asset management arrangements, are contracted on \na back-to-back basis, avoiding any material long or short commodity positions. However, the portfolio is subject to commodity \nprice risk, particularly with respect to basis point differentials between relevant markets in the event of an operational issue or \ncounterparty default. Changes in commodity prices can also result in increased collateral requirements associated with physical \ncontracts and financial hedges, resulting in higher liquidity requirements and increased costs to the business.\nTo measure commodity price risk exposure, Emera Energy employs a number of controls and processes, including an estimated \nVaR analysis of its exposures. The VaR amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from \nchanges in Emera Energy’s portfolio or changes in market factors within a given confidence level, if an instrument or portfolio \nis held for a specified time period. The VaR calculation is used to quantify exposure to market risk associated with physical \ncommodities, primarily natural gas and power positions.\nFUTURE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN PERFORMANCE AND FUNDING RISK\nEmera subsidiaries have both defined benefit and defined contribution employee pension plans that cover their employees and \nretirees. All defined benefit plans are closed to new entrants, except for the TECO Energy Group Retirement Plan. The cost of \nproviding these benefit plans varies depending on plan provisions, interest rates, inflation, investment performance and actuarial \nassumptions concerning the future. Actuarial assumptions include earnings on plan assets, discount rates (interest rates used \nto determine funding levels, contributions to the plans and the pension and post-retirement liabilities) and expectations around \nfuture salary growth, inflation and mortality. Three of the largest drivers of cost are investment performance, interest rates and \ninflation, which are affected by global financial and capital markets. Depending on future interest rates and future inflation and \nactual versus expected investment performance, Emera could be required to make larger contributions in the future to fund \nthese plans, which could adversely affect Emera’s cash flows, financial condition and operations.\nEach of Emera’s employee defined benefit pension plans are managed according to an approved investment policy and \ngovernance framework. Emera employs a long-term approach with respect to asset allocation and each investment policy outlines \nthe level of risk which the Company is prepared to accept with respect to the investment of the pension funds in achieving both \nthe Company’s fiduciary and financial objectives. Studies are routinely undertaken approximately every five years with the \nobjective that the plans’ asset allocations are appropriate for meeting Emera’s long-term pension objectives."

Utilities are faced with demographic challenges related to trades, technical staff and engineers \nwith an increasing number of employees expected to retire over the next several years. Failure to attract, develop and retain \nan appropriately qualified workforce could adversely affect the Company’s operations and financial results. Emera seeks to \nmanage this risk through maintaining competitive compensation programs, a dedicated talent acquisition team, human resources \nprograms and practices, including ethics and diversity training, employee engagement surveys, succession planning for key \npositions and apprenticeship programs.\nApproximately 32 per cent of Emera’s labour force is represented by unions and subject to collective labour agreements. The \ninability to maintain or negotiate future agreements on acceptable terms could result in higher labour costs and work disruptions, \nwhich could adversely affect service to customers and have an adverse effect on the Company’s earnings, cash flow and financial \nposition. Emera seeks to manage this risk through ongoing discussions and working to maintain positive relationships with local \nunions. The Company maintains contingency plans in each of its operations to manage and reduce the effect of any potential \nlabour disruption.\nIT RISK\nEmera relies on various IT systems to manage operations. This subjects Emera to inherent costs and risks associated with \nmaintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems. This includes impairment of its IT, potential disruption of \ninternal control systems, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays, difficulties \nin upgrading existing systems, transitioning to new systems or integrating new systems into its current systems. Emera’s digital \ntransformation strategy, including investment in infrastructure modernization and customer focused technologies, is driving \nincreased investment in IT solutions, resulting in increased project risks associated with the implementation of these solutions. \nEmera manages these risks through IT asset lifecycle planning and management, governance, internal auditing and testing of \nsystems, and executive oversight. Employees with extensive subject matter expertise assist in risk identification and mitigation, \nproject management, implementation, change management and training. System resiliency, formal disaster recovery and \nbackup processes, combined with critical incident response practices, table-top exercises, and simulations, help mitigate \noperational disruptions. \nINCOME TAX RISK\nThe computation of the Company’s provision for income taxes is impacted by changes in tax legislation in Canada, the \nUnited States and the Caribbean. Any such changes could affect the Company’s future earnings, cash flows, and financial \nposition. The value of Emera’s existing deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by existing tax laws and could be \nnegatively impacted by changes in laws. Emera monitors the status of existing tax laws to ensure that changes impacting the \nCompany are appropriately reflected in the Company’s tax compliance filings and financial results.\nSYSTEM OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE RISKS\nThe safe and reliable operation of electric generation and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution systems is \ncritical to Emera’s operations. There are a variety of hazards and operational risks inherent in operating electric utilities and \nnatural gas transmission and distribution pipelines. Electric generation, transmission and distribution operations can be impacted \nby risks such as mechanical failures, supply chain issues impacting timely access to critical equipment, activities of third parties, \nterrorism, cyberattacks, damage to facilities, solar panels and infrastructure caused by hurricanes, storms, falling trees, lightning \nstrikes, floods, fires and other natural disasters. Natural gas pipeline operations can also be impacted by risks such as leaks, \nexplosions, mechanical failures, activities of third parties, terrorism, cyberattacks, and damage to the pipeline facilities and \nequipment caused by hurricanes, storms, floods, fires and other natural disasters. Refer to “Global Climate Change Risk” and \n“Weather Risk”. Electric utility and natural gas transmission and distribution pipeline operation interruption could negatively \naffect revenue, earnings, and cash flows as well as customer and public confidence, and public safety.\nEmera manages these risks by investing in a highly skilled workforce, operating prudently, preventative maintenance, safety and \noperations management systems, third-party risk program, and making effective capital investments. Insurance, warranties, or \nrecovery through regulatory mechanisms may not cover any or all these losses, which could adversely affect the Company’s \nresults of operations and cash flows."

This may also be caused by damage to, \noperational issues with, terrorist or cyberattacks on, third party fuel production, storage, pipeline, and distribution facilities. \nThe risk of fuel supply disruptions is managed through contractual protections, maintaining a diversity of fuel suppliers and \ntransportation contracts, and contracting for access to third-party storage facilities. Significant unanticipated fuel supply \ndisruptions, such as those which arose from Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, could result in increased exposure to commodity \nprice risk for Emera’s regulated electric and gas utilities and Emera Energy, and these could have adverse effects on service to \nutility customers and on the Company’s reputation, earnings, cash flow and financial position. \nUNINSURED RISK\nEmera and its subsidiaries maintain insurance to cover accidental loss suffered to its facilities and to provide indemnity in the \nevent of liability to third parties. This is consistent with Emera’s risk management policies. Certain facilities, in particular coal \nand other thermal generation, may, over time, become more difficult (or uneconomic) to insure as a result of the impact of global \nclimate change. Refer to “Global Climate Change Risk – Markets”. There are certain elements of Emera’s operations which are \nnot insured. These include a significant portion of its electric utilities’ transmission and distribution assets, as is customary in the \nindustry. The cost of this coverage is not economically viable. In addition, Emera accepts deductibles and self-insured retentions \nunder its various insurance policies. Insurance is subject to coverage limits as well as time sensitive claims discovery and \nreporting provisions and there can be no assurance that the types of liabilities or losses that may be incurred by the Company \nand its subsidiaries will be covered by insurance.\nThe occurrence of significant uninsured claims, claims in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by Emera and its \nsubsidiaries, or claims that fall within a significant self-insured retention could have a material adverse effect on Emera’s results \nof operations, cash flows and financial position, if regulatory recovery is not available.\nThe Company mitigates its uninsured risk by ensuring insurance limits align with risk exposures, and for uninsured assets and \noperations, that appropriate risk assessments and mitigation measures are in place. The regulatory framework for the Company’s \nrate-regulated subsidiaries permits the recovery of prudently incurred costs, including uninsured losses. \nRisk Management including Financial Instruments \nEmera’s risk management policies and procedures provide a framework through which management monitors various risk \nexposures. The risk management policies and practices are overseen by the Board of Directors. The Company has established \na number of processes and practices to identify, monitor, report on and mitigate material risks to the Company. This includes \nestablishment of the ERMC, whose responsibilities include preparing an updated risk dashboard and heat map presented at \nregular meetings of the Board’s Risk and Sustainability Committee. Furthermore, a corporate team independent from operations \nis responsible for tracking and reporting on market and credit risks.\nThe Company manages its exposure to normal operating and market risks relating to commodity prices, FX, interest rates and \nshare prices through contractual protections with counterparties where practicable, and by using financial instruments consisting \nmainly of FX forwards and swaps, interest rate options and swaps, equity derivatives, and coal, oil and gas futures, options, \nforwards and swaps. In addition, the Company has contracts for the physical purchase and sale of natural gas. These physical \nand financial contracts are classified as held-for-trading (“HFT”). Collectively, these contracts and financial instruments are \nconsidered derivatives.\nThe Company recognizes the fair value of all its derivatives on its balance sheet, except for non-financial derivatives that meet \nthe normal purchases and normal sales (“NPNS”) exception. Physical contracts that meet the NPNS exception are not recognized \non the balance sheet; these contracts are recognized in income when they settle. A physical contract generally qualifies for the \nNPNS exception if the transaction is reasonable in relation to the Company’s business needs, the counterparty owns or controls \nresources within the proximity to allow for physical delivery, the Company intends to receive physical delivery of the commodity, \nand the Company deems the counterparty creditworthy. The Company continually assesses contracts designated under the NPNS \nexception and will discontinue the treatment of these contracts under this exemption where the criteria are no longer met."

      "text": "Management’s Discussion & Analysis\n59\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\nAs of December 31, 2022, the unrealized gain in AOCI was $16 million, net of tax (2021 – $18 million, net of tax). For the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, unrealized gains of $2 million (2021 – $1 million), have been reclassified into interest expense. \nDisclosure and Internal Controls\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) and \ninternal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”), as defined in National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ \nAnnual and Interim Filings (“NI 52-109”). The Company’s internal control framework is based on the criteria published in the \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), a report issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the \nTreadway Commission. Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the design and \neffectiveness of the Company’s DC&P and ICFR as at December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability \nof financial reporting in accordance with USGAAP.\nManagement recognizes the inherent limitations in internal control systems, no matter how well designed. Control systems \ndetermined to be appropriately designed can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial \nreporting and may not prevent or detect all misstatements.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s ICFR, during the year ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are \nreasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with USGAAP requires management to make estimates and \nassumptions. These may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported \namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant areas requiring use of management estimates \nrelate to rate-regulated assets and liabilities, accumulated reserve for cost of removal, pension and post-retirement benefits, \nunbilled revenue, useful lives for depreciable assets, goodwill and long-lived assets impairment assessments, income taxes, asset \nretirement obligations (“ARO”), and valuation of financial instruments. Management evaluates the Company’s estimates on an \nongoing basis based upon historical experience, current and expected conditions and assumptions believed to be reasonable at \nthe time the assumption is made, with any adjustments recognized in income in the year they arise.\nRATE REGULATION\nThe rate-regulated accounting policies of Emera’s rate-regulated subsidiaries and regulated equity investments are subject \nto examination and approval by their respective regulators and may differ from the accounting policies of non-rate-regulated \ncompanies. Differences occur when regulators render their decisions on rate applications or other matters, and generally involve \na difference in the timing of revenue and expense recognition. The accounting for these items is based on expectations of the \nfuture actions of the regulators. Assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities continue to have an impact on the \nrecovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered. The application of \nregulatory accounting guidance is a critical accounting policy as a change in these assumptions may result in a material impact \non reported assets, liabilities and the results of operations.\nAs at December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded $3,620 million (2021 – $2,566 million) of regulatory assets and \n$2,273 million (2021 – $2,055 million) of regulatory liabilities.\nACCUMULATED RESERVE – COST OF REMOVAL\nTampa Electric, PGS, NMGC and NSPI recognize non-ARO costs of removal (“COR”) as regulatory liabilities. The non-ARO COR \nrepresent estimated funds received from customers through depreciation rates to cover future COR of PP&E upon retirement \nthat are not legally required. The companies accrue for COR over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies \napproved by their respective regulators. The costs are estimated based on historical experience and future expectations, \nincluding expected timing and estimated future cash outlays. As at December 31, 2022, the balance of the Accumulated reserve – \nCOR within regulatory liabilities was $895 million (2021 – $819 million)."

      "text": "Management’s Discussion & Analysis\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n60\nPENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFITS \nThe Company provides post-retirement benefits to employees, including defined benefit pension plans. The cost of providing \nthese benefits is dependent upon many factors that result from actual plan experience and assumptions of future expectations.\nThe accounting related to employee post-retirement benefits is a critical accounting estimate. Changes in the estimated benefit \nobligation, affected by employee demographics, including age, compensation levels, employment periods, contribution levels and \nearnings, could have a material impact on reported assets, liabilities, accumulated other comprehensive income and results of \noperations. Changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and discount rates used \nin determining the accrued benefit obligation and benefit costs, could change annual funding requirements. This could have a \nsignificant impact on the Company’s annual earnings and cash requirements.\nThe pension plan assets are comprised primarily of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market \nreturns and changes in interest rates may result in changes to pension costs in future periods.\nThe Company’s accounting policy is to amortize the net actuarial gain or loss that exceeds 10 per cent of the greater of the \nprojected benefit obligation / accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation (“PBO”) and the market-related value of assets, \nover active plan members’ average remaining service period. For the largest plans this is currently 8.3 years (8.7 years for 2022 \nbenefit cost) for the Canadian plans and a weighted average of 11.4 years for the United States plans). The Company’s use of \nsmoothed asset values reduces volatility related to the amortization of actuarial investment experience. As a result, the main \ncause of volatility in reported pension cost is the discount rate used to determine the PBO. \nThe discount rate used to determine benefit costs is based on the yield of high quality long-term corporate bonds in each \noperating entity’s country and is determined with reference to bonds which have the same duration as the PBO as at January 1 of \nthe fiscal year. The following table shows the discount rate for benefit cost purposes and the expected return on plan assets for \neach plan:\n2022\n2021\nDiscount rate \nfor benefit \ncost purposes\nExpected \nreturn on \nplan assets\nDiscount rate \nfor benefit \ncost purposes\nExpected \nreturn on \nplan assets\nTECO Energy Group Retirement Plan\n2.78%\n6.50%\n2.38%\n6.70%\nTECO Energy Group Supplemental Executive \nRetirement Plan (1)\n2.35/5.33%\nN/A\n1.84%\nN/A\nTECO Energy Group Benefit Restoration Plan (1)\n2.27/4.19/5.48%\nN/A\n1.71%\nN/A\nTECO Energy Post-retirement Health and \nWelfare Plan\n2.84%\nN/A\n2.47%\nN/A\nNew Mexico Gas Company Retiree Medical Plan\n2.85%\n1.50%\n2.49%\n4.00%\nNSPI \n3.25%, 3.48%\n5.75%\n2.59%, 2.85%\n5.25%\nGBPC Salaried\n5.75%\n6.00%\n4.25%\n6.00%\nGBPC Union\n5.75%\n5.35%\n5.65%\n5.65%\n(1) \t The discount rate and expected return on assets for benefit cost purposes is updated throughout the year as special events occur, such as settlements \nand curtailments.\nBased on management’s estimate, the reported benefit cost for defined benefit and defined contribution plans was $64 million in \n2022 (2021 – $85 million). The reported benefit cost is impacted by numerous assumptions, including the discount rate and asset \nreturn assumptions. A 0.25 per cent change in the discount rate and asset return assumptions would have had +/- impact on the \n2022 benefit cost of $0.5 million and $1 million respectively (2021 – $1 million and $3 million). \nUNBILLED REVENUE \nElectric and gas revenues are billed on a systematic basis over a one or two-month period for NSPI and a one-month period for \nother Emera utilities. At the end of each month, the Company must make an estimate of energy delivered to customers since the \ndate their meter was last read and determine related revenues earned but not yet billed. The unbilled revenue is estimated based \non several factors, including current month’s generation, estimated customer usage by class, weather, line losses, inter-period \nchanges to customer classes and applicable customer rates. Based on the extent of estimates included in the determination \nof unbilled revenue, actual results may differ from the estimate. At December 31, 2022, unbilled revenues totalled $424 million \n(2021 – $318 million) on total regulated operating revenues of $7,154 million (2021 – $5,926 million)."

The service lives of regulated PP&E are determined based on depreciation studies and require appropriate \nregulatory approval. Due to the magnitude of the Company’s PP&E, changes in estimated depreciation rates can have a material \nimpact on depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation expense was $927 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (2021 – $877 million).\nGOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the estimated fair values of identifiable \nassets acquired, and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Goodwill is carried at initial cost less any write-down for \nimpairment and is adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. Under the applicable accounting guidance, goodwill is subject \nto assessment for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the \nfair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management \njudgment on significant assumptions and estimates. When assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option of first \nperforming a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. In performing a qualitative \nassessment management considers, among other factors, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations and \noverall financial performance.\nIf the Company performs the qualitative assessment and determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than \nits carrying amount, or if the Company chooses to bypass the qualitative assessment, a quantitative test is performed. The \nquantitative test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount \nof the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair \nvalue include discount and growth rates, rate case assumptions including future cost of capital, valuation of the reporting units’ \nnet operating loss (“NOL”) and projected operating and capital cash flows. Adverse changes in these assumptions could result in \na future material impairment of the goodwill assigned to Emera’s reporting units.\nAs of December 31, 2022, $6,009 million of Emera’s goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition purchase price for TECO \nEnergy (Tampa Electric, PGS and NMGC reporting units) over the fair values assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities \nassumed. In Q4 2022, qualitative assessments were performed for Tampa Electric and PGS given the significant excess of fair \nvalue over carrying amounts calculated during the last quantitative test in Q4 2019. Management concluded it was more likely \nthan not that the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts, including goodwill. As such, no \nquantitative testing was required. For the NMGC reporting unit, Emera elected to bypass a qualitative assessment and performed \na quantitative impairment assessment using a combination of the income and market approach. This assessment estimated that \nthe fair value of the NMGC reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, including goodwill. As a result of this assessment, no \nimpairment charges were recognized.\nIn Q4 2022, the Company elected to bypass a qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative impairment assessment \nfor GBPC, using the income approach, as this reporting unit is sensitive to changes in assumptions due to limited excess of fair \nvalue over the carrying value, including goodwill. Although the cash flows of GBPC have not changed significantly compared to \nprevious periods, it was determined that the carrying value, including goodwill, exceeded the fair value, due to an increase in \ndiscount rates. The discount rate for the reporting unit was negatively impacted by changes in the macro-economic environment, \nincluding the risk-free rate assumption. As a result of this assessment, a goodwill impairment charge of $73 million was recorded \nin 2022, reducing the GBPC goodwill balance to nil as at December 31, 2022. No impairment was recorded in 2021. For further \ndetail, refer to note 22.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had goodwill with a total carrying amount of $6,012 million (December 31, 2021 – \n$5,696 million). The change in the carrying value of goodwill from 2021 to 2022 was a result of the effect of the FX translation \nof Emera’s foreign affiliates, partially offset by the GBPC impairment."

      "text": "Management’s Discussion & Analysis\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n62\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS\nIn accordance with accounting guidance for long-lived assets, the Company assesses whether there has been an impairment of \nlong-lived assets and intangibles when a triggering event occurs, such as a significant market disruption or the sale of a business. \nThe assessment involves comparing the undiscounted expected future cash flows, to the carrying value of the asset. When the \nundiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by \nmeasuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset over its estimated fair value.\nThe Company believes accounting estimates related to asset impairments are critical estimates, as they are highly susceptible \nto change and the impact of an impairment on reported assets and earnings could be material. Management is required to \nmake assumptions based on expectations regarding the results of operations for significant/indefinite future periods and the \ncurrent and expected market conditions in such periods. Markets can experience significant uncertainties. Estimates based on \nthe Company’s assumptions relating to future results of operations or other recoverable amounts are based on a combination of \nhistorical experience, fundamental economic analysis, observable market activity and independent market studies. The Company’s \nexpectations regarding uses and holding periods of assets are based on internal long-term budgets and projections, which consider \nexternal factors and market forces, as of the end of each reporting period. Assumptions made by management are consistent with \ngenerally accepted industry approaches and assumptions used for valuation and pricing activities.\nAs at December 31, 2022, there were no indications of impairment of Emera’s long-lived assets. No impairment charges were \nrecognized in either 2022 or 2021.\nINCOME TAXES \nIncome taxes are determined based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in the consolidated financial \nstatements. In determining income taxes, tax legislation is interpreted in a variety of jurisdictions, the likelihood that deferred tax \nassets will be realized is assessed and assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities \nare made. Uncertainty associated with application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals, \nrequires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Only income \ntax benefits that meet the “more likely than not” threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. Unrecognized tax \nbenefits are evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including issuance of relevant guidance by \nthe courts or tax authorities and developments in examinations of the Company’s tax returns.\nThe Company believes the accounting estimates related to income taxes are critical estimates. The realization of deferred tax \nassets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income, both operating and capital, in future periods. A change \nin the estimated valuation allowance could have a material impact on reported assets and results of operations. Administrative \nactions of the tax authorities, changes in tax law or regulation, and the uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes \nand regulations, could change the Company’s estimate of income taxes, including the potential for elimination or reduction of the \nCompany’s ability to realize tax benefits and to utilize deferred tax assets.\nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nMeasurement of the fair value of AROs requires the Company to make reasonable estimates concerning the method and timing \nof settlement associated with the legally obligated costs. There are uncertainties in estimating future asset-retirement costs \ndue to potential events, such as changing legislation or regulations, and advances in remediation technologies. Emera has AROs \nassociated with the remediation of generation, transmission, distribution and pipeline assets. \nAn ARO represents the fair value of the estimated cash flows necessary to discharge the future obligation using the Company’s \ncredit-adjusted risk-free rate. The amounts are reduced by actual expenditures incurred. Estimated future cash flows are \nbased on completed depreciation studies, remediation reports, prior experience, estimated useful lives, and governmental \nregulatory requirements. The present value of the liability is recorded and the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset \nis correspondingly increased. The amount capitalized at inception is depreciated in the same manner as the related long-lived \nasset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its estimated future value. Accretion expense is included as part of “Depreciation and \namortization expense”. Any accretion expense not yet approved by the regulator is recorded in “PP&E” and included in the next \ndepreciation study. Accordingly, changes to the ARO or cost recognition attributable to changes in the factors discussed above, \nshould not impact the results of operations of the Company."

      "text": "Management’s Discussion & Analysis\n63\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\nSome of the Company’s transmission and distribution assets may have conditional AROs which are not recognized in the \nconsolidated financial statements as the fair value of these obligations could not be reasonably estimated given there is \ninsufficient information to do so. A conditional ARO refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which \nthe timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. \nManagement monitors these obligations and a liability is recognized at fair value when an amount can be determined.\nAs at December 31, 2022, AROs recorded on the balance sheet were $174 million (2021 – $174 million). The Company estimates the \nundiscounted amount of cash flow required to settle the obligations is approximately $429 million (2021 – $422 million), which will \nbe incurred between 2023 and 2061. The majority of these costs will be incurred between 2028 and 2050.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company is required to determine the fair value of all derivatives except those which qualify for the normal purchase, normal \nsale exception. Fair value is the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \narms-length transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are required to reflect \nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best available information, including \nthe risks inherent in a particular valuation technique, such as a pricing model, and the risks inherent in the inputs to the model.\nLEVEL DETERMINATIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS\nThe Company uses Level 1, 2, and 3 classifications in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value measurement of a financial \ninstrument is included in only one of the three levels and is based on the lowest level input significant to the derivation of the fair \nvalue. Fair values are determined, directly or indirectly, using inputs that are observable for the asset or liability. Only in limited \ncircumstances does the Company enter into commodity transactions involving non-standard features where market observable \ndata is not available or have contract terms that extend beyond five years.\nChanges in Accounting Policies and Practices\nThe new USGAAP accounting policy that is applicable to, and adopted by the Company in 2022, is described as follows: \nFACILITATION OF THE EFFECTS OF REFERENCE RATE REFORM ON FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the \nSunset Date of Topic 848 in Q4 2022. The update extends the period of time preparers can utilize the reference rate reform \nrelief guidance issued under ASU 2020-04, which was adopted by the Company in Q4 2020. The guidance in ASU 2022-06 was \neffective as of the date of issuance and entities may elect to apply the guidance prospectively through to December 31, 2024. The \nCompany has applied the guidance permitted by ASU 2020-04 to certain debt agreements that were amended during the current \nperiod. The Company’s transition from reference rates will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nFuture Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). \nASUs issued by FASB, but which are not yet effective, were assessed and determined to be either not applicable to the Company \nor to have an insignificant impact on the consolidated financial statements."

Management \nrepresents that such estimates, which have been properly reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, \nare based on careful judgments and are within reasonable limits of materiality. Management has determined such amounts on \na reasonable basis in order to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects. \nManagement has prepared the financial information presented elsewhere in the annual report and has ensured that it is \nconsistent with that in the consolidated financial statements.\nEmera Incorporated maintains effective systems of internal accounting and administrative controls, consistent with reasonable \ncost. Such systems are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial information is reliable and accurate, and that \nEmera Incorporated’s assets are appropriately accounted for and adequately safeguarded. \nThe Board is responsible for ensuring that management fulfils its responsibilities for financial reporting and is ultimately \nresponsible for reviewing and approving the consolidated financial statements. The Board carries out this responsibility \nprincipally through its Audit Committee.\nThe Audit Committee is appointed by the Board, and its members are directors who are not officers or employees of Emera \nIncorporated. The Audit Committee meets periodically with management, as well as with the internal auditors and with the \nexternal auditors, to discuss internal controls over the financial reporting process, auditing matters and financial reporting issues, \nto satisfy itself that each party is properly discharging its responsibilities, and to review the annual report, the consolidated \nfinancial statements and the external auditors’ report. The Audit Committee reports its findings to the Board for consideration \nwhen approving the consolidated financial statements for issuance to the shareholders. The Audit Committee also considers, for \nreview by the Board and approval by the shareholders, the appointment of the external auditors. \nThe consolidated financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the external auditors, in accordance with \nCanadian Generally Accepted Auditing Standards and with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. \nErnst & Young LLP has full and free access to the Audit Committee.\nFebruary 23, 2023\n“Scott Balfour”\t\n“Gregory Blunden”\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\t\nChief Financial Officer"

      "text": "EMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n66\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Emera Incorporated\nOpinion\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Emera Incorporated (the “Company”), which comprise the Consolidated \nBalance Sheets as at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of \nComprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years \nthen ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated \nfinancial position of the Company as at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and \nits consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting \nprinciples (“USGAAP”).\nBasis for opinion \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Our responsibilities under those \nstandards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of \nour report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of \nthe consolidated financial statements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these \nrequirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. \nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated \nfinancial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of the audit of the consolidated financial \nstatements as a whole, and in forming the auditor’s opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. \nFor each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial \nstatements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance \nof procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial \nstatements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the \nbasis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting for the effects of rate regulation\nKey Audit Matter\nAs disclosed in note 7 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company has $3.6 billion in regulatory \nassets and $2.3 billion in regulatory liabilities. The Company’s rate-regulated subsidiaries are subject to \nregulation by various federal, state and provincial regulatory authorities in the geographic regions in \nwhich they operate. The regulatory rates are designed to recover the prudently incurred costs of providing \nthe regulated products or services and provide a reasonable return on the equity invested or assets, as \napplicable. In addition to regulatory assets and liabilities, rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement \nline items, including, but not limited to, property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”), operating revenues and \nexpenses, income taxes, and depreciation expense.\nAuditing the impact of rate regulation on the Company’s financial statements is complex and highly \njudgmental due to the significant judgments made by the Company to support its accounting and disclosure \nfor regulatory matters when final regulatory decisions or orders have not yet been obtained or when \nregulatory formulas are complex. There is also subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of \nfuture regulatory decisions on the financial statements. Although the Company expects to recover costs \nfrom customers through rates, there is a risk that the regulator will not approve full recovery of the costs \nincurred. The Company’s judgments include making an assessment of the probability of recovery of and \nreturn on costs incurred, of the potential disallowance of part of the cost incurred, or of the probable refund \nto customers through future rates."

For regulatory matters for which regulatory decisions or orders have not yet been \nobtained, we inspected the rate-regulated subsidiaries’ filings for any evidence that might contradict the \nCompany’s assertions, and reviewed other regulatory orders, filings and correspondence for other entities \nwithin the same or similar jurisdictions to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on the \nregulator’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We obtained and evaluated an analysis \nfrom the Company and corroborated that analysis with letters from legal counsel, when appropriate, \nregarding cost recoveries or future changes in rates. We also assessed the methodology, accuracy and \ncompleteness of the Company’s calculations of regulatory asset and liability balances based on provisions \nand formulas outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with the regulators. We evaluated the \nCompany’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation.\nFair value measurement and disclosure of derivative financial instruments\nKey Audit Matter\nHeld-for-trading (“HFT”) derivative assets of $429 million and liabilities of $1,301 million, disclosed in note 15 \nto the consolidated financial statements, are measured at fair value. The Company recognized $64 million in \nrealized and unrealized gains during the year with respect to HFT derivatives.\nAuditing the Company’s valuation of HFT derivatives is complex and highly judgmental due to the complexity \nof the contract terms and valuation models, and the significant estimation required in determining the fair \nvalue of the contracts. In determining the fair value of HFT derivatives, significant assumptions about future \neconomic and market assumptions with uncertain outcomes are used, including third-party sourced forward \ncommodity pricing curves based on illiquid markets, internally developed correlation factors and basis \ndifferentials. These assumptions have a significant impact on the fair value of the HFT derivatives. \nHow Our Audit \nAddressed the Key \nAudit Matter\nWe performed audit procedures that included, amongst others, reviewing executed contracts and \nagreements for the identification of inputs and assumptions impacting the valuation of derivatives. With \nthe support of our valuation specialists, we assessed the methodology and mathematical accuracy of the \nCompany’s valuation models and compared the commodity pricing curves used by the Company to current \nmarket and economic data. For the forward commodity pricing curves, we compared the Company’s pricing \ncurves to independently sourced pricing curves. We also assessed the methodology and mathematical \naccuracy of the Company’s calculations to develop correlation factors and basis differentials. In addition, \nwe assessed whether the fair value hierarchy disclosures in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements \nwere consistent with the source of the significant inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value \nof derivatives. \nOther information \nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises:\n•\t Management’s Discussion and Analysis\n•\t The information, other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s reports thereon, in the Annual Report\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of \nassurance conclusion thereon. \nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, and in \ndoing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our \nknowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated."

If, based on the work we have \nperformed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. \nWe have nothing to report in this regard. \nThe Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of the auditor’s report. If based on the work we will \nperform on this other information, we conclude there is a material misstatement of other information, we are required to report \nthat fact to those charged with governance.\nResponsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements \nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance \nwith USGAAP, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated \nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue \nas a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting \nunless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. \nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements \nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable \nassurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally \naccepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud \nor error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the \neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and \nmaintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n•\t Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud \nor error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and \nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is \nhigher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, \nor the override of internal control. \n•\t Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in \nthe circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. \n•\t Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related \ndisclosures made by management.\n•\t Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the \naudit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant \ndoubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are \nrequired to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if \nsuch disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to \nthe date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern. \n•\t Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, \nand whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n•\t Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities \nwithin the Company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, \nsupervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion."

Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, \nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on \na test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included \nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall \npresentation of the consolidated financial statements.

Emera uses the equity method of accounting to \nrecord investments in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, and for VIEs in which Emera is not the \nprimary beneficiary.\nThe Company performs ongoing analysis to assess whether it holds any VIEs or whether any reconsideration events have arisen \nwith respect to existing VIEs. To identify potential VIEs, management reviews contractual and ownership arrangements such as \nleases, long-term purchase power agreements, tolling contracts, guarantees, jointly owned facilities and equity investments. VIEs \nof which the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary must be consolidated. The primary beneficiary of a VIE has both the \npower to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts its economic performance and the obligation to absorb \nlosses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity. In circumstances where Emera has an investment in a VIE \nbut is not deemed the primary beneficiary, the VIE is accounted for using the equity method. For further details on VIEs, refer to \nnote 32.\nIntercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation, except for the net profit on certain transactions \nbetween certain non-regulated and regulated entities in accordance with accounting standards for rate-regulated entities. \nThe net profit on these transactions, which would be eliminated in the absence of the accounting standards for rate-regulated \nentities, is recorded in non-regulated operating revenues. An offset is recorded to PP&E, regulatory assets, regulated fuel for \ngeneration and purchased power, or OM&G, depending on the nature of the transaction.\nUSE OF MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with USGAAP requires management to make estimates and \nassumptions. These may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported \namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant areas requiring use of management estimates \nrelate to rate-regulated assets and liabilities, accumulated reserve for cost of removal, pension and post-retirement benefits, \nunbilled revenue, useful lives for depreciable assets, goodwill and long-lived assets impairment assessments, income taxes, asset \nretirement obligations (“ARO”), and valuation of financial instruments. Management evaluates the Company’s estimates on an \nongoing basis based upon historical experience, current and expected conditions and assumptions believed to be reasonable at \nthe time the assumption is made, with any adjustments recognized in income in the year they arise."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n81\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nRegulatory accounting applies where rates are established by, or subject to approval by, an independent third-party regulator. \nThe rates are designed to recover prudently incurred costs of providing the regulated products or services and provide an \nopportunity for a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, as applicable. For further detail, refer to note 7.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION \nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted to CAD at the rates of exchange prevailing at the \nbalance sheet date. The resulting differences between the translation at the original transaction date and the balance sheet date \nare included in income.\nAssets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currency is not the Canadian dollar are translated using exchange \nrates in effect at the balance sheet date and the results of operations at the average exchange rate in effect for the period. \nThe resulting exchange gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are deferred on the balance sheet in AOCI.\nThe Company designates certain USD denominated debt held in CAD functional currency companies as hedges of net \ninvestments in USD denominated foreign operations. The change in the carrying amount of these investments, measured at the \nexchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date is recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”).\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nRegulated Electric and Gas Revenue:\nElectric and gas revenues, including energy charges, demand charges, basic facilities charges and clauses and riders, are \nrecognized when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which is when electricity and gas are delivered to \ncustomers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits. Electric and gas revenues are \nrecognized on an accrual basis and include billed and unbilled revenues. Revenues related to the sale of electricity and gas are \nrecognized at rates approved by the respective regulator and recorded based on metered usage, which occurs on a periodic, \nsystematic basis, generally monthly or bi-monthly. At the end of each reporting period, the electricity and gas delivered to \ncustomers, but not billed, is estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of \nunbilled revenue at the end of the reporting period is calculated by estimating the number of megawatt hours (“MWh”) or \ntherms delivered to customers at the established rates expected to prevail in the upcoming billing cycle. This estimate includes \nassumptions as to the pattern of energy demand, weather, line losses and inter-period changes to customer classes.\nNon-regulated Revenue:\nMarketing and trading margins are comprised of Emera Energy’s corresponding purchases and sales of natural gas and \nelectricity, pipeline capacity costs and energy asset management revenues. Revenues are recorded when obligations under the \nterms of the contract are satisfied and are presented on a net basis, reflecting the nature of the contractual relationships with \ncustomers and suppliers.\nEnergy sales are recognized when obligations under the terms of the contracts are satisfied, which is when electricity is delivered \nto customers over time. \nOther non-regulated revenues are recorded when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied.\nOther:\nSales, value add, and other taxes, except for gross receipts taxes discussed below, collected by the Company concurrent with \nrevenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.\nLEASES\nThe Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at inception by evaluating if the contract conveys the right to \ncontrol the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. \nEmera has leases with independent power producers (“IPP”) and other utilities with annual requirements to purchase wind \nand hydro energy over varying contract lengths that are classified as finance leases. These finance leases are not recorded on \nthe Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, as payments associated with the leases are variable in nature and there are no \nminimum fixed lease payments. Lease expense associated with these leases is recorded as “Regulated fuel for generation and \npurchased power” on the Consolidated Statements of Income."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n82\nOperating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the present value \nof the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of Emera’s leases do not provide \nan implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate at commencement of the lease is used in determining the present value of \nfuture lease payments. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded as “Operating, \nmaintenance and general” on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWhere the Company is the lessor, a lease is a sales-type lease if certain criteria are met and the arrangement transfers control \nof the underlying asset to the lessee. For arrangements where the criteria are met due to the presence of a third-party residual \nvalue guarantee, the lease is a direct financing lease. \nFor direct finance leases, a net investment in the lease is recorded that consists of the sum of the minimum lease payments and \nresidual value, net of estimated executory costs and unearned income. The difference between the gross investment and the cost \nof the leased item is recorded as unearned income at the inception of the lease. Unearned income is recognized in income over \nthe life of the lease using a constant rate of interest equal to the internal rate of return on the lease. \nFor sales-type leases, the accounting is similar to the accounting for direct finance leases, however the difference between the \nfair value and the carrying value of the leased item is recorded at lease commencement rather than deferred over the term of \nthe lease. \nEmera has certain contractual agreements that include lease and non-lease components, which management has elected to \naccount for as a single lease component.\nFRANCHISE FEES AND GROSS RECEIPTS\nTampa Electric and PGS recover from customers certain costs incurred, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, through prices approved by \nthe Florida Public Service Commission (“FPSC”). The amounts included in customers’ bills for franchise fees and gross receipt \ntaxes are included as “Regulated electric” and “Regulated gas” revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Franchise \nfees and gross receipt taxes payable by Tampa Electric and PGS are included as an expense on the Consolidated Statements of \nIncome in “Provincial, state and municipal taxes”.\nNMGC is an agent in the collection and payment of franchise fees and gross receipt taxes and is not required by a tariff to present \nthe amounts on a gross basis. Therefore, NMGC’s franchise fees and gross receipt taxes are presented net with no line item \nimpact on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT \nPP&E are recorded at original cost, including AFUDC or capitalized interest, net of contributions received in aid of construction.\nThe cost of additions, including betterments and replacements of units are included in “Property, plant and equipment”. When \nunits of regulated PP&E are replaced, renewed or retired, their cost, plus removal or disposal costs, less salvage proceeds, is \ncharged to accumulated depreciation, with no gain or loss reflected in income. Where a disposition of non-regulated PP&E occurs, \ngains and losses are included in income as the dispositions occur.\nThe cost of PP&E represents the original cost of materials, contracted services, direct labour, AFUDC for regulated property or \ninterest for non-regulated property, ARO, and overhead attributable to the capital project. Overhead includes corporate costs \nsuch as finance, information technology and labour costs, along with other costs related to support functions, employee benefits, \ninsurance, procurement, and fleet operating and maintenance. Expenditures for project development are capitalized if they are \nexpected to have a future economic benefit.\nNormal maintenance projects and major maintenance projects that do not increase the overall life of the related assets are \nexpensed as incurred. When a major maintenance project increases the life or value of the underlying asset, the cost is capitalized. \nDepreciation is determined by the straight-line method, based on the estimated remaining service lives of the depreciable assets \nin each functional class of depreciable property. For some of Emera’s rate-regulated subsidiaries, depreciation is calculated \nusing the group remaining life method, which is applied to the average investment, adjusted for anticipated costs of removal less \nsalvage, in functional classes of depreciable property. The service lives of regulated assets require regulatory approval."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n83\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\nIntangible assets, which are included in “Property, plant and equipment,” consist primarily of computer software and land rights. \nAmortization is determined by the straight-line method, based on the estimated remaining service lives of the asset in each \ncategory. For some of Emera’s rate-regulated subsidiaries, amortization is calculated using the amortizable life method which \nis applied to the net book value to date over the remaining life of those assets. The service lives of regulated intangible assets \nrequire regulatory approval.\nGOODWILL\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the estimated fair values of identifiable assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Goodwill is carried at initial cost less any write-down for impairment \nand is adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. Under the applicable accounting guidance, goodwill is subject to assessment \nfor impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a \nreporting unit may be below its carrying value. When assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option of first \nperforming a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. In performing a qualitative \nassessment management considers, among other factors, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations and \noverall financial performance.\nIf the Company performs the qualitative assessment and determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less \nthan its carrying amount, or if the Company chooses to bypass the qualitative assessment, a quantitative test is performed. \nThe quantitative test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying \namount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. Management estimates the fair value of \nthe reporting unit by using the income approach, or a combination of the income and market approach. The income approach \nis applied using a discounted cash flow analysis which relies on management’s best estimate of the reporting units’ projected \ncash flows. The analysis includes an estimate of terminal values based on these expected cash flows using a methodology which \nderives a valuation using an assumed perpetual annuity based on the reporting unit’s residual cash flows. The discount rate \nused is a market participant rate based on a peer group of publicly traded comparable companies and represents the weighted \naverage cost of capital of comparable companies. When using the market approach, management estimates fair value based \non comparable companies and transactions within the utility industry. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value \ninclude discount and growth rates, rate case assumptions including future cost of capital, valuation of the reporting units’ net \noperating loss (“NOL”) and projected operating and capital cash flows. Adverse changes in these assumptions could result in a \nfuture material impairment of the goodwill assigned to Emera’s reporting units. \nAs of December 31, 2022, $6,009 million of Emera’s goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition purchase price for TECO \nEnergy (Tampa Electric, PGS and NMGC reporting units) over the fair values assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities \nassumed. In Q4 2022, qualitative assessments were performed for Tampa Electric and PGS given the significant excess of fair \nvalue over carrying amounts calculated during the last quantitative test in Q4 2019. Management concluded it was more likely \nthan not that the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts, including goodwill. As such, no \nquantitative testing was required. For the NMGC reporting unit, Emera elected to bypass a qualitative assessment and performed \na quantitative impairment assessment using a combination of the income and market approach. This assessment estimated that \nthe fair value of the NMGC reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, including goodwill. As a result of this assessment, no \nimpairment charges were recognized.\nIn Q4 2022, the Company elected to bypass a qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative impairment assessment for \nGBPC, using the income approach, as this reporting unit is sensitive to changes in assumptions due to limited excess of fair value \nover the carrying value, including goodwill. Although the cash flows of GBPC have not changed significantly compared to previous \nperiods, it was determined that the carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeded the fair value, due to an increase in discount \nrates. The discount rate for the reporting unit was negatively impacted by changes in the macro-economic environment, including \nthe risk-free rate assumption. As a result of this assessment, a goodwill impairment charge of $73 million was recorded in 2022, \nreducing the GBPC goodwill balance to nil as at December 31, 2022. No impairment was recorded in 2021. For further detail, refer \nto note 22."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n84\nINCOME TAXES AND INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS\nEmera recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been included in \nthe financial statements or income tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference \nbetween the carrying value of assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and their respective tax bases using \nenacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in income tax \nrates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in earnings in the period when the change is enacted, unless \nrequired to be offset to a regulatory asset or liability by law or by order of the regulator. Emera recognizes the effect of income \ntax positions only when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. Management reviews all readily available current and \nhistorical information, including forward-looking information, and the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from \nfuture taxable income is assessed and assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities \nare made. If management subsequently determines that it is likely that some or all of a deferred income tax asset will not be \nrealized, then a valuation allowance is recorded to reflect the amount of deferred income tax asset expected to be realized. \nGenerally, investment tax credits are recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the current or future periods to the \nextent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Investment tax credits earned by Tampa Electric, PGS and NMGC \non regulated assets are deferred and amortized over the estimated service lives of the related properties, as required by \nregulatory practices.\nTampa Electric, PGS, NMGC and BLPC collect income taxes from customers based on current and deferred income taxes. NSPI, \nENL and Brunswick Pipeline collect income taxes from customers based on income tax that is currently payable except for \nthe deferred income taxes on certain regulatory balances specifically prescribed by the regulator. For the balance of regulated \ndeferred income taxes, NSPI, ENL and Brunswick Pipeline recognize regulatory assets or liabilities where the deferred income \ntaxes are expected to be recovered from or returned to customers in future years. These regulated assets or liabilities are \ngrossed up using the respective income tax rate to reflect the income tax associated with future revenues that are required \nto fund these deferred income tax liabilities, and the income tax benefits associated with reduced revenues resulting from the \nrealization of deferred income tax assets. GBPC is not subject to income taxes.\nEmera classifies interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits as interest and operating expense, respectively. \nFor further detail, refer to note 10.\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company manages its exposure to normal operating and market risks relating to commodity prices, foreign exchange, \ninterest rates and share prices through contractual protections with counterparties where practicable, and by using financial \ninstruments consisting mainly of foreign exchange forwards and swaps, interest rate options and swaps, equity derivatives, and \ncoal, oil and gas futures, options, forwards and swaps. In addition, the Company has contracts for the physical purchase and sale \nof natural gas. These physical and financial contracts are classified as held-for-trading (“HFT”). Collectively, these contracts and \nfinancial instruments are considered derivatives.\nThe Company recognizes the fair value of all its derivatives on its balance sheet, except for non-financial derivatives that meet \nthe normal purchases and normal sales (“NPNS”) exception. Physical contracts that meet the NPNS exception are not recognized \non the balance sheet; these contracts are recognized in income when they settle. A physical contract generally qualifies for the \nNPNS exception if the transaction is reasonable in relation to the Company’s business needs, the counterparty owns or controls \nresources within the proximity to allow for physical delivery, the Company intends to receive physical delivery of the commodity, \nand the Company deems the counterparty creditworthy. The Company continually assesses contracts designated under the NPNS \nexception and will discontinue the treatment of these contracts under this exemption where the criteria are no longer met. \nDerivatives qualify for hedge accounting if they meet stringent documentation requirements and can be proven to effectively \nhedge the identified risk both at the inception and over the term of the instrument. Specifically, for cash flow hedges, the change \nin the fair value of derivatives is deferred to AOCI and recognized in income in the same period the related hedged item is \nrealized. Where the documentation or effectiveness requirements are not met, the derivatives are recognized at fair value with \nany changes in fair value recognized in net income in the reporting period, unless deferred as a result of regulatory accounting."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n85\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\nDerivatives entered into by NSPI, NMGC and GBPC that are documented as economic hedges or for which the NPNS exception \nhas not been taken, are subject to regulatory accounting treatment. The change in fair value of the derivatives is deferred to \na regulatory asset or liability. The gain or loss is recognized in the hedged item when the hedged item is settled. Management \nbelieves any gains or losses resulting from settlement of these derivatives related to fuel for generation and purchased power \nwill be refunded to or collected from customers in future rates. Tampa Electric has no derivatives related to hedging as a result of \na FPSC approved five-year moratorium on hedging of natural gas purchases which ends on December 31, 2022. Tampa Electric’s \nmoratorium on hedging of natural gas purchases will continue through December 31, 2024, as a result of Tampa Electric’s 2021 \nrate case settlement agreement.\nDerivatives that do not meet any of the above criteria are designated as HFT, with changes in fair value normally recorded in \nnet income of the period. The Company has not elected to designate any derivatives to be included in the HFT category where \nanother accounting treatment would apply.\nEmera classifies gains and losses on derivatives as a component of fuel for generation and purchased power, other expenses, \ninventory, OM&G and PP&E, depending on the nature of the item being economically hedged. Transportation capacity arising as \na result of marketing and trading derivative transactions is recognized as an asset in “Receivables and other current assets” and \namortized over the period of the transportation contract term. Cash flows from derivative activities are presented in the same \ncategory as the item being hedged within operating or investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \nNon-hedged derivatives are included in operating cash flows on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nDerivatives, as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are not offset by the fair value amounts of cash collateral with the \nsame counterparty. Rights to reclaim cash collateral are recognized in “Receivables and other current assets” and obligations to \nreturn cash collateral are recognized in “Accounts payable”.\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less at acquisition.\nRECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nUtility customer receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Standard payment terms for \nelectricity and gas sales are approximately 30 days. A late payment fee may be assessed on account balances after the due date. \nThe Company recognizes allowances for credit losses to reduce accounts receivable for amounts expected to be uncollectable. \nManagement estimates credit losses related to accounts receivable by considering historical loss experience, customer deposits, \ncurrent events, the characteristics of existing accounts and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability \nof the reported amount. Provisions for credit losses on receivables are expensed to maintain the allowance at a level considered \nadequate to cover expected losses. Receivables are written off against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\nINVENTORY\nFuel and materials inventories are valued at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value, unless evidence indicates \nthat the weighted-average cost will be recovered in future customer rates. \nASSET IMPAIRMENT\nLong-Lived Assets:\nEmera assesses whether there has been an impairment of long-lived assets and intangibles when a triggering event occurs, such \nas a significant market disruption or sale of a business. \nThe assessment involves comparing the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset. When the \nundiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined \nby measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset over its estimated fair value. The Company’s assumptions \nrelating to future results of operations or other recoverable amounts, are based on a combination of historical experience, \nfundamental economic analysis, observable market activity and independent market studies. The Company’s expectations \nregarding uses and holding periods of assets are based on internal long-term budgets and projections, which consider external \nfactors and market forces, as of the end of each reporting period. The assumptions made are consistent with generally accepted \nindustry approaches and assumptions used for valuation and pricing activities.\nAs at December 31, 2022, there are no indications of impairment of Emera’s long-lived assets. No impairment charges related to \nlong-lived assets were recognized in 2022 or 2021."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n86\nEquity Method Investments:\nThe carrying value of investments accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment by comparing the fair \nvalue of these investments to their carrying values, if a fair value assessment was completed, or by reviewing for the presence \nof impairment indicators. If an impairment exists, and it is determined to be other-than-temporary, a charge is recognized \nin earnings equal to the amount the carrying value exceeds the investment’s fair value. No impairment of equity method \ninvestments was required in either 2022 or 2021.\nFinancial Assets:\nEquity investments, other than those accounted for under the equity method, are measured at fair value, with changes in fair \nvalue recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair \nvalues are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly \ntransactions for the identical or similar investments. No impairment of financial assets was required in either 2022 or 2021. \nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nAn ARO is recognized if a legal obligation exists in connection with the future disposal or removal costs resulting from the \npermanent retirement, abandonment or sale of a long-lived asset. A legal obligation may exist under an existing or enacted law \nor statute, written or oral contract, or by legal construction under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.\nAn ARO represents the fair value of the estimated cash flows necessary to discharge the future obligation, using the Company’s \ncredit adjusted risk-free rate. The amounts are reduced by actual expenditures incurred. Estimated future cash flows are \nbased on completed depreciation studies, remediation reports, prior experience, estimated useful lives, and governmental \nregulatory requirements. The present value of the liability is recorded and the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset \nis correspondingly increased. The amount capitalized at inception is depreciated in the same manner as the related long-lived \nasset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its estimated future value. AROs are included in “Other long-term liabilities” and \naccretion expense is included as part of “Depreciation and amortization”. Any regulated accretion expense not yet approved by \nthe regulator is recorded in “Property, plant and equipment” and included in the next depreciation study.\nSome of the Company’s transmission and distribution assets may have conditional AROs which are not recognized in the \nconsolidated financial statements, as the fair value of these obligations could not be reasonably estimated, given there is \ninsufficient information to do so. A conditional ARO refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which \nthe timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the \nentity. Management monitors these obligations and a liability is recognized at fair value in the period in which an amount can \nbe determined.\nCOST OF REMOVAL\nTampa Electric, PGS, NMGC and NSPI recognize non-ARO costs of removal (“COR”) as regulatory liabilities. The non-ARO COR \nrepresent funds received from customers through depreciation rates to cover estimated future non-legally required COR of PP&E \nupon retirement. The companies accrue for COR over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by \ntheir respective regulators. The costs are estimated based on historical experience and future expectations, including expected \ntiming and estimated future cash outlays."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n87\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company has several stock-based compensation plans: a common share option plan for senior management; an employee \ncommon share purchase plan; a deferred share unit (“DSU”) plan; a performance share unit (“PSU”) plan; and a restricted \nshare unit (“RSU”) plan. The Company accounts for its plans in accordance with the fair value-based method of accounting for \nstock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of \nthe award, and is recognized as an expense over the employee’s or director’s requisite service period using the graded vesting \nmethod. Stock-based compensation plans recognized as liabilities are initially measured at fair value and re-measured at fair \nvalue at each reporting date, with the change in liability recognized in income.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nThe costs of the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefit programs for employees are expensed over the periods \nduring which employees render service. The Company recognizes the funded status of its defined-benefit and other post-\nretirement plans on the balance sheet and recognizes changes in funded status in the year the change occurs. The Company \nrecognizes the unamortized gains and losses and past service costs in AOCI or regulatory assets. The components of net periodic \nbenefit cost other than the service cost component are included in “Other income, net” on the Consolidated Statements of \nIncome. For further detail, refer to note 21.\n2. Change in Accounting Policy\nThe new USGAAP accounting policy that is applicable to, and adopted by the Company in 2022, is described as follows: \nFACILITATION OF THE EFFECTS OF REFERENCE RATE REFORM ON FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset \nDate of Topic 848 in Q4 2022. The update extends the period of time preparers can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance \nissued under ASU 2020-04, which was adopted by the Company in Q4 2020. The guidance in ASU 2022-06 was effective as of \nthe date of issuance and entities may elect to apply the guidance prospectively through to December 31, 2024. The Company has \napplied the guidance permitted by ASU 2020-04 to certain debt agreements that were amended during the current period. The \nCompany’s transition from reference rates will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n3. Future Accounting Pronouncements \nThe Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). \nASUs issued by FASB, but which are not yet effective, were assessed and determined to be either not applicable to the Company \nor to have an insignificant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n4. Dispositions\nOn March 31, 2022, Emera completed the sale of its 51.9 per cent interest in Domlec for proceeds which approximated its carrying \nvalue. Domlec was included in the Company’s Other Electric reportable segment up to its date of sale. The sale did not have a \nmaterial impact on earnings."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n92\nTampa Electric Capital Cost Recovery for Early Retired Assets\nThis regulatory asset is related to the remaining net book value of Big Bend Power Station Units 1 through 3 and smart meter \nassets that were retired. The balance earns a rate of return as permitted by the FPSC and will be recovered as a separate line \nitem on customer bills for a period of 15 years. This recovery mechanism is authorized by and survives the term of the settlement \nagreement approved by the FPSC in 2021. For further information, refer to “Big Bend Modernization Project” in the Tampa \nElectric section below.\nPension and Post-Retirement Medical Plan \nThis asset is primarily related to the deferred costs of pension and post-retirement benefits at Tampa Electric, PGS and NMGC. \nIt is included in rate base and earns a rate of return as permitted by the FPSC and NMPRC as applicable. It is amortized over the \nremaining service life of plan participants.\nFAM\nThis regulated asset is the difference between actual fuel costs and amounts recovered from NSPI customers through electricity \nrates in a given year and deferred to a FAM regulatory asset or liability and recovered from or returned to customers in \nsubsequent periods. For the years 2020 through 2022, differences between actual fuel costs and fuel revenues recovered from \ncustomers will be recovered from customers in future periods. The Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board’s (“UARB”) decision to \napprove the fuel stability plan directed that any annual non-fuel revenues above NSPI’s approved range of ROE are to be applied \nto the FAM.\nStorm Reserve\nThe storm reserve is for hurricanes and other named storms that cause significant damage to Tampa Electric and PGS systems. \nAs allowed by the FPSC, if the charges to the storm reserve exceed the storm liability, the excess is to be carried as a regulatory \nasset. Tampa Electric and PGS can petition the FPSC to seek recovery of restoration costs over a 12-month period, or longer, \nas determined by the FPSC, as well as replenish the reserve. In September 2022, Tampa Electric and PGS were impacted by \nHurricane Ian. For further information, refer to “Storm Reserve – Hurricane Ian” in both Tampa Electric and PGS sections below.\nNMGC Winter Event Gas Cost Recovery\nIn February 2021, the State of New Mexico experienced an extreme cold weather event that resulted in an incremental \n$108 million USD for gas costs above what it would normally have paid during this period. NMGC normally recovers gas supply \nand related costs through a purchased gas adjustment clause (“PGAC”). On April 16, 2021, NMGC filed a Motion for Extraordinary \nRelief, as permitted by the NMPRC rules, to extend the terms of the repayment of the incremental gas costs and to recover \na carrying charge. On June 15, 2021, the NMPRC approved the recovery of $108 million USD and related borrowing costs over \na period of 30 months beginning July 1, 2021. \nStorm Restoration\nThis asset represents storm restoration costs incurred by GBPC. GBPC maintains insurance for its generation facilities and, as \nwith most utilities, its transmission and distribution networks are not covered by commercial insurance. \nIn January 2020, the Grand Bahama Port Authority (“GBPA”) approved the recovery of $15 million USD of costs related to \nHurricane Dorian in 2019, over a five-year period. The recovery was implemented through rates on January 1, 2021.\nRestoration costs associated with Hurricane Matthew in 2016 are being recovered through an approved fuel charge. For further \ninformation, refer to “Storm Restoration Costs – Hurricane Matthew” in the GBPC section below. \nDeferrals Related to Derivative Instruments\nThis asset is primarily related to NSPI deferring changes in fair value of derivatives that are documented as economic hedges or \nthat do not qualify for NPNS exemption, as a regulatory asset or liability as approved by its regulator. The realized gain or loss is \nrecognized when the hedged item settles in regulated fuel for generation and purchased power, inventory, other income, OM&G \nor PP&E, depending on the nature of the item being economically hedged."

The \nbalance is included in rate base, partially offsetting the related liability, and earns a rate of return as permitted by the FPSC. \nThe timing of recovery is based on a settlement agreement approved by the FPSC.\nStranded Cost Recovery\nDue to the decommissioning of a GBPC steam turbine in 2012, the GBPA approved the recovery of a $21 million USD stranded cost \nthrough electricity rates; it is included in rate base and is expected to be included in rates in future years. \nAccumulated Reserve – Cost of Removal (“COR”)\nThis regulatory liability represents the non-ARO COR reserve in Tampa Electric, PGS, NMGC and NSPI. AROs represent the \nfair value of estimated cash flows associated with the Company’s legal obligation to retire its PP&E. Non-ARO COR represent \nestimated funds received from customers through depreciation rates to cover future COR of PP&E value upon retirement that are \nnot legally required. This reduces rate base for ratemaking purposes. This liability is reduced as COR are incurred and increased \nas depreciation is recorded for existing assets and as new assets are put into service.\nNMGC Gas Hedge Settlements\nThis regulatory liability represents the regulatory deferral of gas options exercised above strike price but will settle in cash in \nQ1 2023. The value from the cash settlement of this options will flow through to customers via the PGAC.\nREGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND UPDATES\nFlorida Electric Utility\nTampa Electric is regulated by the FPSC and is also subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). \nThe FPSC sets rates at a level that allows utilities such as Tampa Electric to collect total revenues or revenue requirements equal \nto their cost of providing service, plus an appropriate return on invested capital. Base rates are determined in FPSC rate setting \nhearings which can occur at the initiative of Tampa Electric, the FPSC or other interested parties.\nTampa Electric’s approved regulated return on equity (“ROE”) range for 2022 and 2021 was 9.25 per cent to 11.25 per cent based \non an allowed equity capital structure of 54 per cent. An ROE of 10.20 per cent (2021 – 10.25 per cent) is used for the calculation \nof the return on investments for clauses.\nFuel Recovery and Other Cost Recovery Clauses:\nTampa Electric has a fuel recovery clause approved by the FPSC, allowing the opportunity to recover fluctuating fuel expenses \nfrom customers through annual fuel rate adjustments. The FPSC annually approves cost-recovery rates for purchased power, \ncapacity, environmental and conservation costs, including a return on capital invested. Differences between the prudently \nincurred fuel costs and the cost-recovery rates and amounts recovered from customers through electricity rates in a year are \ndeferred to a regulatory asset or liability and recovered from or returned to customers in subsequent periods. \nOn January 23, 2023, Tampa Electric requested an adjustment to its fuel charges to recover the 2022 fuel under-recovery of \n$518 million USD over a period of 21 months. The request also included an adjustment to 2023 projected fuel costs to reflect \nthe reduction in natural gas prices since September 2022 for a projected reduction of $170 million USD for the balance of 2023. \nThe proposed changes will be decided by the FPSC in March 2023, and recovery is expected to begin in April 2023. \nThe mid-course fuel adjustment requested by Tampa Electric on January 19, 2022, was approved on March 1, 2022. The rate \nincrease, effective with the first billing cycle in April 2022, covered higher fuel and capacity costs of $169 million USD, and was \nspread over customer bills from April 1, 2022 through December 2022."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n94\nBase Rates:\nOn October 21, 2021, the FPSC approved a settlement agreement filed by Tampa Electric. The settlement agreement allows for \nan increase to rates of $191 million USD annually effective January 2022. This increase consisted of $123 million USD in base rate \ncharges and $68 million USD to recover the costs of retiring assets including, Big Bend coal generation assets Units 1 through \n3 and meter assets. The settlement agreement further includes two subsequent year adjustments of $90 million USD and \n$21 million USD, effective January 2023 and January 2024, respectively related to the recovery of future investments in the Big \nBend Modernization project and solar generation. The allowed equity in the capital structure will continue to be 54 per cent from \ninvestor sources of capital. The settlement agreement includes an allowed regulated ROE range of 9.0 per cent to 11.0 per cent \nwith a 9.95 per cent midpoint. It also provides for a 25 basis point increase in the allowed ROE range and mid-point, and \n$10 million USD of additional revenue, if United States Treasury Bond yields exceed a specific threshold set on the date the FPSC \napproved the agreement. Under the agreement base rates are frozen from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024, unless Tampa \nElectric’s earned ROE were to fall below the bottom of the range during that time. The settlement agreement provides for the \ndeferral of income taxes as a result of changes in tax laws. The changes would be reflected as a regulatory asset or liability and \neither result in an increase or a decrease in customer rates through a subsequent regulatory process. The settlement agreement \nfurther creates a mechanism to recover the costs of retiring coal generation units and meter assets over a period of 15 years \nwhich survives the term of that agreement. The settlement agreement sets new depreciation and dismantlement rates effective \nJanuary 1, 2022 and contains the provisions that Tampa Electric will not have to file another depreciation study during the term \nof the agreement but will file a new depreciation study no more than one year, nor less than 90 days, before the filing of its next \ngeneral base rate proceeding. Tampa Electric agreed not to hedge natural gas through the period ending on December 31, 2024.\nOn August 16, 2022, the FPSC approved Tampa Electric’s request to increase revenue and ROE due to increases in the 30-year \nUnited States Treasury bond yield rate. Effective July 1, 2022, the new mid-point ROE is 10.20 per cent, and the range is \n9.25 per cent to 11.25 per cent.\nStorm Reserve – Hurricane Ian:\nIn September 2022, Tampa Electric was impacted by Hurricane Ian. Total restoration costs were $126 million USD, with \n$119 million USD of restoration costs charged against Tampa Electric’s FPSC approved storm reserve. Total restoration costs \ncharged to the storm reserve have exceeded the reserve balance and have been deferred as a regulatory asset for future \nrecovery. On January 23, 2023, Tampa Electric petitioned the FPSC for recovery of the storm reserve regulatory asset and \nthe replenishment of the balance in the reserve to the previous approved reserve level of $56 million USD, for a total of \napproximately $131 million USD. The proposed changes will be decided by the FPSC in March 2023 and recovery is expected to \nbegin in April 2023 through March 2024.\nSolar Base Rate Adjustments Included in Base Rates:\nDuring 2017 to 2021, Tampa Electric invested $850 million USD in 600 MW of utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects, which \nis recoverable through FPSC-approved solar base rate adjustments (“SoBRAs”). AFUDC was earned on these projects during \nconstruction. The FPSC has approved SoBRAs representing a total of 600 MW or $104 million USD annually in estimated revenue \nrequirements for in-service projects. \nOn October 12, 2021, the FPSC approved the true-up filing for SoBRA tranche 3, included in base rates as of January 2020. \nA $4 million USD true-up was returned to customers during 2021. No true-up for SoBRA tranche 4 was required.\nStorm Protection Cost Recovery Clause and Settlement Agreement:\nOn October 3, 2019, the FPSC issued a rule to implement a Storm Protection Plan (“SPP”) Cost Recovery Clause. This clause \nprovides a process for Florida investor-owned utilities, including Tampa Electric, to recover transmission and distribution storm \nhardening costs for incremental activities not already included in base rates. Differences between prudently incurred clause-\nrecoverable costs and amounts recovered from customers through electricity rates in a year are deferred and recovered from or \nreturned to customers in a subsequent year. A settlement agreement was approved on August 10, 2020, and Tampa Electric’s cost \nrecovery began in January 2021. The current approved plan addressed the years 2020 through 2022, and in April 2022 Tampa \nElectric submitted a new plan to determine cost recovery in 2023, 2024 and 2025. On October 4, 2022, the FPSC approved \nTampa Electric’s SPP."

The modernization project repowered Big Bend Unit 1 with natural gas combined-cycle technology and \neliminated coal as this unit’s fuel. As part of the modernization project, Tampa Electric retired the Unit 1 components that will not \nbe used in the modernized plant in 2020 and Big Bend Unit 2 in 2021. Tampa Electric plans to retire Big Bend Unit 3 in 2023 as it \nis in the best interest of the customers from an economic, environmental risk and operational perspective. \nAt December 31, 2021, the balance sheet included $636 million USD in electric utility plant and $267 million USD in accumulated \ndepreciation related to Unit 1 components and Unit 2 and Unit 3 assets. In accordance with Tampa Electric’s 2017 settlement \nagreement approved by the FPSC, Tampa Electric continued to account for its existing investment in Unit 1, 2 and 3 in electric \nutility plant and depreciated the assets using the current depreciation rates until December 31, 2021, at which point they were \nreclassified to a regulatory asset on the balance sheet. \nTampa Electric’s 2021 settlement agreement provides recovery for the Big Bend Modernization project in two phases. The first \nphase was a revenue increase to cover the costs of the assets in service during 2022, among other items. The remainder of the \nproject costs will be recovered as part of the 2023 subsequent year adjustment. The settlement agreement also includes a new \ncharge to recover the remaining costs of the retiring Big Bend coal generation assets, Units 1 through 3, which will be spread \nover 15 years and will survive the termination of the settlement agreement. The special capital recovery schedule for all three \nunits was applied beginning January 1, 2022. This recovery mechanism is authorized by and survives the term of the settlement \nagreement approved by the FPSC in 2021.\nCanadian Electric Utilities\nNSPI\nNSPI is a public utility as defined in the Public Utilities Act of Nova Scotia (“Public Utilities Act”) and is subject to regulation \nunder the Public Utilities Act by the UARB. The Public Utilities Act gives the UARB supervisory powers over NSPI’s operations and \nexpenditures. Electricity rates for NSPI’s customers are also subject to UARB approval. NSPI is not subject to a general annual \nrate review process, but rather participates in hearings held from time to time at NSPI’s or the UARB’s request. \nNSPI is regulated under a cost-of-service model, with rates set to recover prudently incurred costs of providing electricity \nservice to customers and provide a reasonable return to investors. NSPI’s approved regulated ROE range for 2022 and 2021 was \n8.75 per cent to 9.25 per cent based on an actual five quarter average regulated common equity component of up to 40 per cent \nof approved rate base.\nNSPI has a FAM, approved by the UARB, allowing NSPI to recover fluctuating fuel costs from customers through regularly \nscheduled fuel rate adjustments. Differences between prudently incurred fuel costs and amounts recovered from customers \nthrough electricity rates in a year are deferred to a FAM regulatory asset or liability and recovered from or returned to customers \nin subsequent periods. \nFor the period of 2020 through 2022, NSPI operated under a three-year fuel stability plan which resulted in an average annual \noverall rate increase of 1.5 per cent to recover fuel costs. These rates included recovery of Maritime Link costs.\nGeneral Rate Application (“GRA”):\nOn November 9, 2022, the Nova Scotia provincial government enacted Bill 212, “Public Utilities Act (amended)”. The legislation \nlimits non-fuel rate increases in NSPI’s 2022 GRA to the UARB, excluding increases relating to demand side management (“DSM”) \ncosts, to a total of 1.8 per cent between the effective date of the UARB’s decision and the end of 2024. The legislation also: \n•\t requires revenue generated from the non-fuel rate increase to be used only to improve the reliability of service to ratepayers,\n•\t limits NSPI’s return on equity to 9.25 per cent and equity ratio to 40 per cent, and\n•\t limits the rate used to accrue interest on regulatory deferrals to the Bank of Canada policy interest rate plus 1.75 per cent, \nunless otherwise directed by the UARB."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n96\nOn November 24, 2022, NSPI filed with the UARB a comprehensive settlement agreement between NSPI, key customer \nrepresentatives and participating interest groups (“NSPI Settlement Agreement”) in relation to its GRA filed in January 2022. The \nNSPI Settlement Agreement was structured to be consistent with the amendments to the Public Utilities Act made under Bill 212, \nincluding the 1.8 per cent cap on non-fuel rate increases for 2023 and 2024. The NSPI Settlement Agreement also addresses the \nrecovery of fuel costs over the settlement period and establishes a DSM rider. This will result in a combined fuel and non-fuel rate \nincrease of 6.9 per cent each year for 2023 and 2024, and annualised incremental revenue (fuel and non-fuel) of $105 million \nin 2023 and $115 million in 2024. In addition, any under or over recovery of fuel costs will be addressed through the UARB’s \nestablished FAM process. NSPI’s ROE range will continue to be 8.75 per cent to 9.25 per cent, based on an actual five-quarter \naverage regulated common equity component of up to 40 per cent. The NSPI Settlement Agreement also establishes a storm rider \nfor each of 2023, 2024 and 2025, which gives NSPI the option to apply to the UARB for recovery of costs if major storm restoration \nexpense exceeds approximately $10 million in a given year. On February 2, 2023, NSPI received the UARB’s decision, which \nsubstantially approved the Settlement Agreement as filed. Approved rate increases will be effective as of the date of the decision.\nMaritime Link:\nThe Maritime Link is a $1.8 billion (including AFUDC) transmission project including two 170-kilometre sub-sea cables, connecting \nthe island of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. The Maritime Link entered service on January 15, 2018 and NSPI started interim \nassessment payments to NSPML at that time. As part of a three-year fuel stability plan, electricity rates were set to include \namounts of $164 million and $162 million for 2021 and 2022, respectively. Any difference between the amounts included in the \nfuel stability plan and those approved by the UARB through the NSPML interim assessment application will be addressed through \nthe FAM. \nNova Scotia Cap-and-Trade (“Cap-and-Trade”) Program:\nAs at December 31, 2022, the FAM includes a recovery of $172 million (December 31, 2021 – $38 million) non-cash accrual \nrepresenting the estimated future cost of acquiring emissions credits for the 2019 through 2022 Cap-and-Trade compliance \nperiod. Emissions for the compliance period will not be finalized until the completion of the environmental audit which begins \nin March 2023. Emissions are currently based upon audited actual emissions from 2019 through 2021 and unaudited actuals for \n2022. The total cost of compliance with the Cap-and-Trade program compliance period could change depending on the price paid \nfor both credits at remaining provincial auctions and reserve credits purchased from the provincial government, and the results \nof the 2022 environmental emissions audit.\nLower than forecast Muskrat Falls energy received during the compliance period has resulted in the increased deployment of \nhigher carbon-emitting generation sources. The Province of Nova Scotia has agreed to provide approximately $165 million of \nrelief from the 2019 through 2022 compliance costs, which was equal to the total cost of compliance forecast at the time of the \nfuel update submitted by NSPI to the UARB in September 2022 as part of the GRA. Discussions related to the final amount of \nrelief and how this relief will be provided are ongoing. Further, NSPI’s regulatory framework provides for the recovery of costs \nprudently incurred to comply with the Cap-and-Trade Program Regulations pursuant to NSPI’s FAM.\nNSPML\nEquity earnings from the Maritime Link are dependent on the approved ROE and operational performance of NSPML. NSPML’s \napproved regulated ROE range is 8.75 per cent to 9.25 per cent, based on an actual five-quarter average regulated common \nequity component of up to 30 per cent. \nNalcor’s Nova Scotia Block (“NS Block”) delivery obligations commenced on August 15, 2021 and delivery will continue over the \nnext 35 years pursuant to the agreements. \nIn February 2022, the UARB issued its decision and Board Order approving NSPML’s requested rate base of approximately \n$1.8 billion less $9 million of costs ($7 million after-tax) that would not have otherwise been recoverable if incurred by NSPI. \nNSPML also received approval to collect up to $168 million (2021 – $172 million) from NSPI for the recovery of costs associated \nwith the Maritime Link in 2022. This was subject to a holdback of up to $2 million a month, beginning April 2022, contingent on \nreceiving at least 90 per cent of NS Block deliveries, including Supplemental Energy deliveries."

This continues to be subject to a holdback of up to $2 million a month, as discussed above. On \nDecember 22, 2022, the UARB clarified its earlier direction regarding the holdback and NSPI can now release the holdback to \nNSPML when 90 per cent of NS Block deliveries, including Supplemental Energy deliveries, is achieved. This enabled NSPI to pay \nNSPML approximately $4 million of the 2022 holdback. As of December 31, 2022, an additional $14 million in aggregate has been \nheld-back by NSPI. Determination of the allocation of the $14 million between NSPML and NSPI will be subject to a regulatory \nprocess that is expected to commence in early 2023 to review the holdback mechanism. \nGas Utilities and Infrastructure\nPGS\nPGS is regulated by the FPSC. The FPSC sets rates at a level that allows utilities such as PGS to collect total revenues or revenue \nrequirements equal to their cost of providing service, plus an appropriate return on invested capital.\nPGS’s approved ROE range for 2022 and 2021 was 8.9 per cent to 11.0 per cent with a 9.9 per cent midpoint, based on an allowed \nequity capital structure of 54.7 per cent. \nFuel Recovery:\nPGS recovers the costs it pays for gas supply and interstate transportation for system supply through its PGAC. This clause is \ndesigned to recover actual costs incurred by PGS for purchased gas, gas storage services, interstate pipeline capacity, and other \nrelated items associated with the purchase, distribution, and sale of natural gas to its customers. These charges may be adjusted \nmonthly based on a cap approved annually by the FPSC.\nRecovery of Energy Conservation and Pipeline Replacement Programs:\nThe FPSC annually approves a conservation charge that is intended to permit PGS to recover prudently incurred expenditures \nin developing and implementing cost effective energy conservation programs which are required by Florida law and approved \nand monitored by the FPSC. PGS also has a Cast Iron/Bare Steel Pipe Replacement clause to recover the cost of accelerating the \nreplacement of cast iron and bare steel distribution lines in the PGS system. In February 2017, the FPSC approved expansion of \nthe Cast Iron/Bare Steel clause to allow recovery of accelerated replacement of certain obsolete plastic pipe. The majority of cast \niron and bare steel pipe has been removed from its system, with replacement of obsolete plastic pipe continuing until 2028 under \nthe rider. \nStorm Reserve – Hurricane Ian:\nIn September 2022, Hurricane Ian impacted PGS’s operations in Fort Myers and Sarasota. The restoration costs were \napproximately $2 million USD and $1 million was charged against PGS’s FPSC-approved storm reserve. \nBase Rates:\nOn November 19, 2020, the FPSC approved a settlement agreement filed by PGS. The settlement agreement allows for an \nincrease to base rates by $58 million USD annually, effective January 1 2021, which is a $34 million USD increase in revenue and \n$24 million USD increase of revenues previously recovered through the cast iron and bare steel replacement rider. It provides \nPGS the ability to reverse a total of $34 million USD of accumulated depreciation through 2023. During 2022, PGS reversed \n$14 million USD of the $34 million USD accumulated depreciation. No amounts were reversed prior to 2022. In addition, the \nagreement sets new depreciation rates effective January 1, 2021. Under the agreement base rates are frozen from January 1, 2021 \nto December 31, 2023, unless its earned ROE were to fall below 8.9 per cent before that time with an allowed equity in the capital \nstructure of 54.7 per cent from investor sources of capital. The settlement agreement provides for the deferral of income taxes \nas a result of changes in tax laws. The changes would be reflected as a regulatory asset or liability and either result in an increase \nor a decrease in customer rates through a subsequent regulatory process.\nNMGC\nNMGC is subject to regulation by the NMPRC. The NMPRC sets rates at a level that allows NMGC to collect total revenues equal to \nits cost of providing service, plus an appropriate return on invested capital. \nNMGC’s approved ROE for 2022 and 2021 was 9.375 per cent on an allowed equity capital structure of 52 per cent."

In December 2020, NMGC received approval of its PGAC Continuation Filing for the \nfour-year period ending December 2024.\nBase Rates:\nOn December 13, 2021, NMGC filed a rate case with the NMPRC for new rates to become effective January 2023. On May 20, 2022, \nNMGC filed an unopposed settlement agreement with the NMPRC for an increase of $19 million USD in annual base revenues. \nThe rates reflect the recovery of increased operating costs and capital investments in pipelines and related infrastructure. The \nNMPRC approved the settlement agreement on November 30, 2022.\nWeather Normalization Mechanism: \nIn July 2019, the NMPRC approved changes to the company’s rate design to include a five-year pilot of Weather Normalization \nMechanism. This clause is designed to lower the variability of weather impacts during the October through April heating seasons. \nThe Weather Normalization Mechanism allows customer rates and company revenue to be more predictable by partially removing \nthe impact of warmer than usual or colder than usual weather. Weather-related revenue increases or decreases experienced from \nOctober to April are adjusted annually in October of the following heating season. \nIntegrity Management Programs (“IMP”) Regulatory Asset:\nA portion of NMGC’s annual spending on infrastructure is for IMP, or the replacement and update of legacy systems. These programs \nare driven both by NMGC integrity management plans and federal and state mandates. In December 2020, NMGC received approval \nthrough its rate case to defer costs through an IMP regulatory asset for certain of its IMP capital investments occurring between \nJanuary 1, 2022 and December 31, 2023 and petitioned recovery of the regulatory asset in its rate case filed on December 13, 2021. \nOn November 30, 2022, the NMPRC issued a Final Order that included approval of recovery of the IMP regulatory asset. \nBrunswick Pipeline \nBrunswick Pipeline is a 145-kilometre pipeline delivering natural gas from the Saint John LNG import terminal near Saint John, \nNew Brunswick to markets in the northeastern United States. Brunswick Pipeline entered into a 25-year firm service agreement \ncommencing in July 2009 with Repsol Energy North America Canada Partnership. The agreement provides for a predetermined \ntoll increase in the fifth and fifteenth year of the contract. The pipeline is considered a Group II pipeline regulated by the Canada \nEnergy Regulator (“CER”). The CER Gas Transportation Tariff is filed by Brunswick Pipeline in compliance with the requirements \nof the CER Act and sets forth the terms and conditions of the transportation rendered by Brunswick Pipeline.\nOther Electric Utilities\nBLPC\nBLPC is regulated by the Fair Trading Commission (“FTC”), an independent regulator, under the Utilities Regulation (Procedural) \nRules 2003. BLPC is regulated under a cost-of-service model, with rates set to recover prudently incurred costs of providing \nelectricity service to customers plus an appropriate return on capital invested. BLPC’s approved regulated return on rate base \nwas 10 per cent for 2022 and 2021.\nLicenses:\nThe Government of Barbados has granted BLPC a franchise to generate, transmit and distribute electricity on the island \nuntil 2028. In 2019, the Government of Barbados passed legislation amending the number of licenses required for the supply \nof electricity from a single integrated license which currently exists to multiple licenses for Generation, Transmission and \nDistribution, Storage, Dispatch and Sales. In March 2021, BLPC reached commercial agreement with the Government of Barbados \nfor each of the license types, subject to the passage of implementing legislation. The new licenses are expected to take effect \nin 2023 on completion of the legislative process. The Dispatch license will have a term of 5 years with the remaining licenses \nhaving terms ranging from 25-30 years. BLPC anticipates that any increased costs associated with the implementation of the new \nmulti-licensed structure will be recoverable through BLPC’s regulatory framework. BLPC is awaiting final enactment and will work \ntowards implementation of the licenses once received."

The calculation of the fuel charge is adjusted on a monthly basis and reported to the \nFTC for approval.\nOn October 4, 2021 BLPC submitted a general rate review application to the FTC. The application seeks a rate adjustment and \nthe implementation of a cost reflective rate structure that will facilitate the changes expected in the newly reformed electricity \nmarket and the country’s transition towards 100 per cent renewable energy generation. The application seeks recovery of capital \ninvestment in plant, equipment and related infrastructure and results in an increase in annual non-fuel revenue of approximately \n$23 million USD upon approval. The application includes a request for allowed regulatory ROE of 12.50 per cent on an allowed \nequity capital structure of 65 per cent. On September 16, 2022, the FTC granted BLPC interim rate relief, allowing an increase \nin base rates of approximately $3 million USD for the remainder of 2022 and approximately $1 million USD per month for \n2023. Interim rate relief is effective from September 16, 2022 until the implementation of final rates. The hearing concluded in \nOctober 2022. On February 15, 2023, the FTC issued a decision on the BLPC rate review application which included the following \nsignificant items: an allowed regulatory ROE of 11.75 per cent, an equity capital structure of 55 per cent, a directive to update \nthe major components of rate base to September 16, 2022, and a directive to establish regulatory liabilities of approximately \n$70 million USD related to the self-insurance fund, accumulated depreciation, and taxes. The impacts to BLPC’s rate base and \nfinal rates are not yet determinable. BLPC will seek to clarify aspects of the FTC decision in its compliance filing and is also \nconsidering filing a submission to the FTC for a review of the decision. BLPC expects a decision on final rates from the FTC \nin 2023. \nFuel Hedging:\nOn October 21, 2021, the FTC approved BLPC’s application to implement a fuel hedging program which will be incorporated into \nthe calculation of the fuel clause adjustment. On November 10, 2021, BLPC requested the FTC review the required 50/50 cost \nsharing arrangement between BLPC and customers in relation to the hedging administrative costs, or any gains and losses \nassociated with the hedging program. A decision is expected from the FTC in 2023.\nGBPC\nGBPC is regulated by the GBPA. The GBPA has granted GBPC a licensed, regulated and exclusive franchise to produce, transmit \nand distribute electricity on the island until 2054. Rates are set to recover prudently incurred costs of providing electricity \nservice to customers plus an appropriate return on rate base. GBPC’s approved regulated return on rate base was 8.23 per cent \nfor 2022 (2021 – 8.37 per cent).\nFuel Recovery:\nGBPC’s fuel costs flow through a fuel pass-through mechanism which provides the opportunity to recover all prudently incurred \nfuel costs from customers in a timely manner.\nEffective November 1, 2022, GBPC’s fuel pass through charge was increased due to an increase in global oil prices impacting the \nunhedged fuel cost. In 2023, the fuel pass through charge will be adjusted monthly, in-line with actual fuel costs.\nBase Rates:\nThere is a fuel pass-through mechanism and tariff review policy with new rates submitted every three years. On January 14, \n2022, the GBPA issued its decision on GBPC’s application for rate review that was filed with the GBPA on September 23, 2021. \nThe decision, which became effective April 1, 2022, allows for an increase in revenues of $3.5 million USD. The new rates include a \nregulatory ROE of 12.84 per cent.\nStorm Restoration Costs – Hurricane Matthew:\nIn 2017, as part of the recovery of costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Matthew, the GBPA approved a fixed per kWh fuel \ncharge and allowed the difference between this and the actual cost of fuel to be applied to the Hurricane Matthew regulatory \nasset. As part of its decision on GBPC’s application for rate review, issued January 14, 2022, and effective April 1, 2022, the GBPA \napproved the continued amortization of the remaining regulatory asset over the three year period ending December 31, 2024."

Credit risk is the potential loss from a counterparty’s non-performance under an agreement. The Company \nmanages credit risk with policies and procedures for counterparty analysis, exposure measurement, and exposure monitoring and \nmitigation. Credit assessments are conducted on all new customers and counterparties, and deposits or collateral are requested \non any high-risk accounts. \nThe Company assesses the potential for credit losses on a regular basis and, where appropriate, maintains provisions. With \nrespect to counterparties, the Company has implemented procedures to monitor the creditworthiness and credit exposure of \ncounterparties and to consider default probability in valuing the counterparty positions. The Company monitors counterparties’ \ncredit standing, including those that are experiencing financial problems, have significant swings in default probability rates, have \ncredit rating changes by external rating agencies, or have changes in ownership. Net liability positions are adjusted based on the \nCompany’s current default probability. Net asset positions are adjusted based on the counterparty’s current default probability. \nThe Company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated.\nAs at December 31, 2022, the maximum exposure the Company had to credit risk was $1.9 billion (2021 – $1.3 billion), which \nincludes accounts receivable net of collateral/deposits and assets related to derivatives. \nIt is possible that volatility in commodity prices could cause the Company to have material credit risk exposures with one or \nmore counterparties. If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, the Company could \nsuffer a material financial loss. The Company transacts with counterparties as part of its risk management strategy for managing \ncommodity price, FX and interest rate risk. Counterparties that exceed established credit limits can provide a cash deposit or \nletter of credit to the Company for the value in excess of the credit limit where contractually required. The total cash deposits/\ncollateral on hand as at December 31, 2022 was $386 million (2021 – $341 million), which mitigates the Company’s maximum \ncredit risk exposure. The Company uses the cash as payment for the amount receivable or returns the deposit/collateral to the \ncustomer/counterparty where it is no longer required by the Company.\nThe Company enters into commodity master arrangements with its counterparties to manage certain risks, including credit risk \nto these counterparties. The Company generally enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements, North \nAmerican Energy Standards Board agreements and, or Edison Electric Institute agreements. The Company believes entering \ninto such agreements offers protection by creating contractual rights relating to creditworthiness, collateral, non-performance \nand default.\nAs at December 31, 2022, the Company had $131 million (2021 – $114 million) in financial assets, considered to be past due, which \nhave been outstanding for an average 60 days. The fair value of these financial assets is $114 million (2021 – $93 million), the \ndifference of which is included in the allowance for credit losses. These assets primarily relate to accounts receivable from \nelectric and gas revenue."

Certain derivatives contain financial assurance provisions \nthat require collateral to be posted if a material adverse credit-related event occurs. If a material adverse event resulted \nin the senior unsecured debt falling below investment grade, the counterparties to such derivatives could request ongoing \nfull collateralization.\nAs at December 31, 2022, the total fair value of derivatives in a liability position was $1,078 million (December 31, 2021 – \n$682 million). If the credit ratings of the Company were reduced below investment grade, the full value of the net liability \nposition could be required to be posted as collateral for these derivatives.\n16. Fair Value Measurements \nThe Company is required to determine the fair value of all derivatives except those which qualify for the NPNS exemption \n(see note 1) and uses a market approach to do so. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\nLevel 1 – Where possible, the Company bases the fair valuation of its financial assets and liabilities on quoted prices in active \nmarkets (“quoted prices”) for identical assets and liabilities. \nLevel 2 – Where quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities are not available, the valuation of certain contracts must \nbe based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities with an adjustment related to location differences. Also, certain \nderivatives are valued using quotes from over-the-counter clearing houses."

Central to the policy is the target asset allocation by major asset categories. The objective of the target asset allocation is \nto diversify risk and to achieve asset returns that meet or exceed the plan’s actuarial assumptions. The diversification of assets \nreduces the inherent risk in financial markets by requiring that assets be spread out amongst various asset classes. Within each \nasset class, a further diversification is undertaken through the investment in a broad range of investment and non-investment \ngrade securities. Emera’s target asset allocation is as follows:\nCanadian Pension Plans\nAsset class\nTarget Range at Market\nShort-term securities\n0% to 5%\nFixed income\n35% to 50%\nEquities:\n    Canadian\n7% to 17%\n    Non-Canadian\n36% to 60%"

The goodwill on Emera’s Consolidated \nBalance Sheets at December 31, 2022, primarily relates to TECO Energy. Emera’s reporting units with goodwill are Tampa Electric, \nPGS, NMGC, and GBPC. \nIn 2022, Emera performed a qualitative impairment assessment for Tampa Electric and PGS, concluding that the fair value of \nthe reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts, and as such, no quantitative assessments were performed \nand no impairment charges were recognized. For the NMGC reporting unit, Emera elected to bypass a qualitative assessment \nand performed a quantitative impairment assessment using a combination of the income approach and market approach. This \nassessment estimated that the fair value of the NMGC reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, including goodwill. As a result \nof this assessment, no impairment charges were recognized.\nIn 2022, the Company elected to bypass a qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative impairment assessment for \nGBPC, using the income approach, as this reporting unit is sensitive to changes in assumptions due to limited excess of fair \nvalue over carrying amount, including goodwill. Although the cash flows of GBPC have not changed significantly compared to \nprevious periods, it was determined that the fair value did not exceed its carrying amount, including goodwill, primarily due to an \nincrease in discount rates. The discount rate for the reporting unit was negatively impacted by changes in the macro-economic \nenvironment, including the risk-free rate assumption. As a result of this assessment, a goodwill impairment charge of $73 million \nwas recorded in 2022, reducing the GBPC goodwill balance to nil as at December 31, 2022. This non-cash charge is included in \n“Impairment charge” on the Consolidated Statements of Income."

In February 2022, the UARB issued its decision and Board Order approving NSPML’s requested rate base of \napproximately $1.8 billion.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nTECO Guatemala Holdings (“TGH”)\nPrior to Emera’s acquisition of TECO Energy in 2016, TGH, a wholly owned subsidiary of TECO Energy, divested of its indirect \ninvestment in the Guatemala electricity sector, but retained certain claims against the Republic of Guatemala (“Guatemala”). \nIn 2013, TGH asserted an arbitration claim against Guatemala with the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment \nDisputes (“ICSID”) under the Dominican Republic Central America – United States Free Trade Agreement. The arbitration \nconcerned TGH’s allegation that Guatemala unfairly set the distribution tariff for a local distribution company which harmed \nTGH’s investment in that company. A tribunal established by the ICSID ruled in favour of TGH (the “First Award”) and, in \nNovember 2020, Guatemala made a payment of approximately $38 million USD in full and final satisfaction of the First Award. \nOn September 23, 2016, TGH had filed a request for resubmission to arbitration seeking damages in addition to those awarded \nin the First Award. On May 13, 2020, an ICSID tribunal awarded TGH additional damages and costs against Guatemala of \nmore than $35 million USD plus interest (the “Second Award”). TGH subsequently requested a reconsideration of the interest \nquantum awarded in connection with the Second Award. On October 16, 2020, the tribunal granted TGH’s request for additional \ninterest. The additional amount was approximately $2 million USD. On February 12, 2021, Guatemala filed an application with \nICSID for annulment of the Second Award. On March 31, 2021, ICSID constituted an ad hoc Committee to oversee the annulment \nproceeding. A three-day hearing was held before the ad hoc Committee beginning on July 27, 2022.\nOn November 28, 2022, TGH and Guatemala entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the Second Award. Pursuant \nto the settlement agreement, on December 15, 2022, Guatemala paid TGH $46 million USD and the parties agreed to settle all \noutstanding disputes, concluding this matter. This amount was recognized in “Other Income, net” on the Consolidated Statements \nof Income."

This estimate assumes that other involved PRPs are credit-worthy entities. \nThis amount has been accrued and is primarily reflected in the long-term liability section under “Other long-term liabilities” on \nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets. The environmental remediation costs associated with these sites are expected to be paid over \nmany years. \nThe estimated amounts represent only the portion of the cleanup costs attributable to TEC. The estimates to perform \nthe work are based on TEC’s experience with similar work, adjusted for site-specific conditions and agreements with the \nrespective governmental agencies. The estimates are made in current dollars, are not discounted and do not assume any \ninsurance recoveries. \nIn instances where other PRPs are involved, most of those PRPs are believed to be currently credit-worthy and are likely to \ncontinue to be credit-worthy for the duration of the remediation work. However, in those instances that they are not, TEC could \nbe liable for more than TEC’s actual percentage of the remediation costs. Other factors that could impact these estimates include \nadditional testing and investigation which could expand the scope of the cleanup activities, additional liability that might arise \nfrom the cleanup activities themselves or changes in laws or regulations that could require additional remediation. Under current \nregulations, these costs are recoverable through customer rates established in base rate proceedings.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nEmera and its subsidiaries may, from time to time, be involved in other legal proceedings, claims and litigation that arise in the \nordinary course of business which the Company believes would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on \nthe financial condition of the Company.\nC. PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nEmera believes the following principal financial risks could materially affect the Company in the normal course of business. \nRisks associated with derivative instruments and fair value measurements are discussed in note 15 and note 16. \nSound risk management is an essential discipline for running the business efficiently and pursuing the Company’s strategy \nsuccessfully. Emera has an enterprise-wide risk management process, overseen by its Enterprise Risk Management Committee \n(“ERMC”) and monitored by the Board of Directors, to ensure an effective, consistent and coherent approach to risk management. \nThe Board of Directors established a Risk and Sustainability Committee (’RSC”) in September 2021. The RSC’s mandate includes \noversight of the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management framework, including the identification, assessment, monitoring and \nmanagement of enterprise risks. It also includes oversight of the Company’s approach to sustainability and its performance \nrelative to its sustainability objectives.\nRegulatory and Political Risk\nThe Company’s rate-regulated subsidiaries and certain investments subject to significant influence are subject to risk of \nthe recovery of costs and investments. Regulatory and political risk can include changes in regulatory frameworks, shifts in \ngovernment policy, legislative changes, and regulatory decisions.\nAs cost-of-service utilities with an obligation to serve customers, Emera’s utilities operate under formal regulatory frameworks, \nand must obtain regulatory approval to change or add rates and/or riders. Emera also holds investments in entities in which it \nhas significant influence, and which are subject to regulatory and political risk including NSPML, LIL, and M&NP. As a regulated \nGroup II pipeline, the tolls of Brunswick Pipeline are regulated by the CER on a complaint basis, as opposed to the regulatory \napproval process described above. In the absence of a complaint, the CER does not normally undertake a detailed examination \nof Brunswick Pipeline’s tolls, which are subject to a firm service agreement expiring in 2034, with Repsol Energy North America \nCanada Partnership. The agreement provides for a predetermined toll increase in the fifth and fifteenth year of the contract."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n129\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\nRegulators administer legislation covering material aspects of the utilities’ businesses, including customer rates and/or riders, \nthe underlying allowed ROEs, deemed capital structures, capital investment, the terms and conditions for the provision of service, \nperformance standards, and affiliate transactions. Costs and investments can be recovered upon approval by the respective \nregulator as an adjustment to rates and/or riders, which normally requires a public hearing process or may be mandated by other \ngovernmental bodies. During public hearing processes, consultants and customer representatives scrutinize the costs, actions \nand plans of these rate-regulated companies, and their respective regulators determine whether to allow recovery and to adjust \nrates based upon the evidence and any contrary evidence from other parties. In some circumstances, other government bodies \nmay influence the setting of rates. Regulatory decisions, legislative changes, and prolonged delays in the recovery of costs or \nregulatory assets could result in decreased rate affordability for customers and could materially affect Emera and its utilities. \nEmera’s utilities generally manage this risk through transparent regulatory disclosure, ongoing stakeholder and government \nconsultation and multi-party engagement on aspects such as utility operations, regulatory audits, rate filings and capital \nplans. The subsidiaries employ a collaborative regulatory approach through technical conferences and, where appropriate, \nnegotiated settlements. \nChanges in government and shifts in government policy and legislation can impact the commercial and regulatory frameworks \nunder which Emera and its subsidiaries operate. This includes initiatives regarding deregulation or restructuring of the energy \nindustry. Deregulation or restructuring of the energy industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that \ncould adversely affect operations, net income and cash flows. State and local policies in some United States jurisdictions have \nsought to prevent or limit the ability of utilities to provide customers the choice to use natural gas while in other jurisdictions \npolicies have been adopted to prevent limitations on the use of natural gas. Changes in applicable state or local laws and \nregulations, including electrification legislation, could adversely impact PGS and NMGC.\nEmera cannot predict future legislative, policy, or regulatory changes, whether caused by economic, political or other factors, \nor its ability to respond in an effective and timely manner or the resulting compliance costs. Government interference in the \nregulatory process can undermine regulatory stability, predictability, and independence, and could have a material adverse effect \non the Company.\nForeign Exchange Risk \nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate changes. Emera operates internationally, with an increasing amount \nof the Company’s net income earned outside of Canada. As such, Emera is exposed to movements in exchange rates between the \nCAD and, particularly, the USD, which could positively or adversely affect results. \nConsistent with the Company’s risk management policies, Emera manages currency risks through matching United States \ndenominated debt to finance its United States operations and may use foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge specific \ntransactions and earnings exposure. The Company may enter FX forward and swap contracts to limit exposure on certain foreign \ncurrency transactions such as fuel purchases, revenue streams and capital expenditures, and on net income earned outside of \nCanada. The regulatory framework for the Company’s rate-regulated subsidiaries permits the recovery of prudently incurred \ncosts, including FX.\nThe Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for foreign currency trading or speculative purposes or to hedge \nthe value of its investments in foreign subsidiaries. Exchange gains and losses on net investments in foreign subsidiaries do not \nimpact net income as they are reported in AOCI.\nLiquidity and Capital Market Risk\nLiquidity risk relates to Emera’s ability to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet its financial obligations. Emera manages \nthis risk by forecasting cash requirements on a continuous basis to determine whether sufficient funds are available. Liquidity \nand capital needs could be financed through internally generated cash flows, asset sales, short-term credit facilities, and ongoing \naccess to capital markets. \nEmera’s access to capital and cost of borrowing is subject to several risk factors, including financial market conditions, market \ndisruptions, and ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. Disruptions in capital markets could prevent Emera from issuing new \nsecurities or cause the Company to issue securities with less than preferred terms and conditions. Emera’s growth plan requires \nsignificant capital investments in PP&E and the risk associated with changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the \ncost of financing. The Company’s future access to capital and cost of borrowing may be impacted by various market disruptions. \nThe inability to access cost-effective capital could have a material impact on Emera’s ability to fund its growth plan."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n130\nEmera is subject to financial risk associated with changes in its credit ratings. There are a number of factors that rating agencies \nevaluate to determine credit ratings, including the Company’s business, its regulatory framework and the legislative environment, \npolitical interference in the regulatory process, the ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification, leverage, liquidity \nand increased exposure to climate change-related impacts, including increased frequency and severity of hurricanes and other \nsevere weather events. A decrease in a credit rating could result in higher interest rates in future financings, increased borrowing \ncosts under certain existing credit facilities, limit access to the commercial paper market or limit the availability of adequate \ncredit support for subsidiary operations. For certain derivative instruments, if the credit ratings of the Company were reduced \nbelow investment grade, the full value of the net liability of these positions could be required to be posted as collateral. Emera \nmanages these risks by actively monitoring and managing key financial metrics with the objective of sustaining investment grade \ncredit ratings.\nThe Company has exposure to its own common share price through the issuance of various forms of stock-based compensation, \nwhich affect earnings through revaluation of the outstanding units every period. The Company uses equity derivatives to reduce \nthe earnings volatility derived from stock-based compensation.\nGeneral Economic Risk\nThe Company has exposure to the macro-economic conditions in North America and in other geographic regions in which Emera \noperates. Like most utilities, economic factors such as consumer income, employment and housing affect demand for electricity \nand natural gas, and in turn the Company’s financial results. Adverse changes in general economic conditions and inflation \nmay impact the ability of customers to afford rate increases arising from increases to fuel, operating, capital, environmental \ncompliance, and other costs, and therefore could materially affect Emera and its utilities. This may also result in higher credit and \ncounterparty risk, adverse shifts in government policy and legislation, and/or increased risk to full and timely recovery of costs \nand regulatory assets.\nInterest Rate Risk\nEmera utilizes a combination of fixed and floating rate debt financing for operations and capital expenditures, resulting in an \nexposure to interest rate risk. Emera seeks to manage interest rate risk through a portfolio approach that includes the use of \nfixed and floating rate debt with staggered maturities. The Company will, from time to time, issue long-term debt or enter interest \nrate hedging contracts to limit its exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rate debt. \nFor Emera’s regulated subsidiaries, the cost of debt is a component of rates and prudently incurred debt costs are recovered \nfrom customers. Regulatory ROE will generally follow the direction of interest rates, such that regulatory ROE’s are likely to fall \nin times of reducing interest rates and rise in times of increasing interest rates, albeit not directly and generally with a lag period \nreflecting the regulatory process. Rising interest rates may also negatively affect the economic viability of project development \nand acquisition initiatives.\nAs with most other utilities and other similar yield-returning investments, Emera’s share price may be affected by changes in \ninterest rates and could underperform the market in an environment of rising interest rates.\nInflation Risk \nThe Company may be exposed to changes in inflation that may result in increased operating and maintenance costs, capital \ninvestment, and fuel costs compared to the revenues provided by customer rates. Emera’s utilities have budgeting and \nforecasting processes to identify inflationary risk factors and measure operating performance, as well as collective bargaining \nagreements that mitigate the short-term impact of inflation on labour costs.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe Company’s utility fuel supply is subject to commodity price risk. In addition, Emera Energy is subject to commodity price risk \nthrough its portfolio of commodity contracts and arrangements.\nThe Company manages this risk through established processes and practices to identify, monitor, report and mitigate these risks. \nThese include the Company’s commercial arrangements, such as the combination of supply and purchase agreements, asset \nmanagement agreements, pipeline transportation agreements and financial hedging instruments. In addition, its credit policies, \ncounterparty credit assessments, market and credit position reporting, and other risk management and reporting practices, are \nalso used to manage and mitigate this risk."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n131\nEMERA 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\nRegulated Utilities\nThe Company’s utility fuel supply is exposed to broader global conditions, which may include impacts on delivery reliability and \nprice, despite contracted terms. Supply and demand dynamics in fuel markets can be affected by a wide range of factors which \nare difficult to predict and may change rapidly, including but not limited to currency fluctuations, changes in global economic \nconditions, natural disasters, transportation or production disruptions, and geo-political risks such as political instability, conflicts, \nchanges to international trade agreements, trade sanctions or embargos. The Company seeks to manage this risk using financial \nhedging instruments and physical contracts and through contractual protection with counterparties, where applicable. \nThe majority of Emera’s regulated electric and gas utilities have adopted and implemented fuel adjustment mechanisms and \npurchased gas adjustment mechanisms respectively, which has further helped manage commodity price risk, as the regulatory \nframework for the Company’s rate-regulated subsidiaries permits the recovery of prudently incurred fuel and gas costs. There \nis no assurance that such mechanisms and regulatory frameworks will continue to exist in the future. Prolonged and substantial \nincreases in fuel prices could result in decreased rate affordability, increased risk of recovery of costs or regulatory assets, and/or \nnegative impacts on customer consumption patterns and sales.\nEmera Energy Marketing and Trading\nEmera Energy has employed further measures to manage commodity risk. The majority of Emera Energy’s portfolio of electricity \nand gas marketing and trading contracts and, in particular, its natural gas asset management arrangements, are contracted on \na back-to-back basis, avoiding any material long or short commodity positions. However, the portfolio is subject to commodity \nprice risk, particularly with respect to basis point differentials between relevant markets in the event of an operational issue or \ncounterparty default. Changes in commodity prices can also result in increased collateral requirements associated with physical \ncontracts and financial hedges, resulting in higher liquidity requirements and increased costs to the business.\nTo measure commodity price risk exposure, Emera Energy employs a number of controls and processes, including an estimated \nVaR analysis of its exposures. The VaR amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from \nchanges in Emera Energy’s portfolio or changes in market factors within a given confidence level, if an instrument or portfolio \nis held for a specified time period. The VaR calculation is used to quantify exposure to market risk associated with physical \ncommodities, primarily natural gas and power positions.\nIncome Tax Risk\nThe computation of the Company’s provision for income taxes is impacted by changes in tax legislation in Canada, the United \nStates and the Caribbean. Any such changes could affect the Company’s future earnings, cash flows, and financial position. \nThe value of Emera’s existing deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by existing tax laws and could be negatively \nimpacted by changes in laws. Emera monitors the status of existing tax laws to ensure that changes impacting the Company are \nappropriately reflected in the Company’s tax compliance filings and financial results. \nD. GUARANTEES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT\nEmera has guarantees and letters of credit on behalf of third parties outstanding. The following significant guarantees and letters \nof credit are not included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as at December 31, 2022:\nTECO Energy has issued a guarantee in connection with SeaCoast’s performance of obligations under a gas transportation \nprecedent agreement. The guarantee is for a maximum potential amount of $45 million USD if SeaCoast fails to pay or perform \nunder the contract. The guarantee expires five years after the gas transportation precedent agreement termination date, which \nwas terminated on January 1, 2022. In the event that TECO Energy’s and Emera’s long-term senior unsecured credit ratings are \ndowngraded below investment grade by Moody’s Investor Services (“Moody’s”) or S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”). TECO Energy \nwould be required to provide its counterparty a letter of credit or cash deposit of $27 million USD.\nTECO Energy issued a guarantee in connection with SeaCoast’s performance obligations under a firm service agreement, which \nexpires on December 31, 2055, subject to two extension terms at the option of the counterparty with a final expiration date of \nDecember 31, 2071. The guarantee is for a maximum potential amount of $13 million USD if SeaCoast fails to pay or perform \nunder the firm service agreement. In the event that TECO Energy’s long-term senior unsecured credit ratings are downgraded \nbelow investment grade by Moody’s or S&P, TECO Energy would need to provide either a substitute guarantee from an affiliate \nwith an investment grade credit rating or a letter of credit or cash deposit of $13 million USD.\nEmera Inc. has issued a guarantee of up to $35 million USD relating to outstanding notes of GBPC. The guarantee for the notes \nwill expire in May 2023."

The discount was 2 per cent in 2022.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\nStock Option Plan\nThe Company has a stock option plan that grants options to senior management of the Company for a maximum term of \n10 years. The option price of the stock options is the closing price of the Company’s common shares on the Toronto Stock \nExchange on the last business day on which such shares were traded before the date on which the option is granted. The \nmaximum aggregate number of shares issuable under this plan is 14.7 million shares. As at December 31, 2022, Emera is in \ncompliance with this requirement.\nStock options granted in 2021 and prior vest in 25 per cent increments on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of \nthe date of the grant. Stock options granted in 2022 vest in 20 per cent increments on the first, second, third, fourth and fifth \nanniversaries of the date of the grant. If an option is not exercised within 10 years, it expires and the optionee loses all rights \nthereunder. The holder of the option has no rights as a shareholder until the option is exercised and shares have been issued. \nThe total number of stocks to be optioned to any optionee shall not exceed five per cent of the issued and outstanding common \nstocks on the date the option is granted.\nFor stock options granted in 2021 and prior, unless a stock option has expired, vested options may be exercised within the \n27 months following the option holders date of retirement, six months following a termination without just cause or death, and \nwithin sixty days following the date of termination for just cause or resignation. Commencing with the 2022 stock option grant, \nvested options may be exercised during the full term of the option following the option holders date of retirement, six months \nfollowing a termination without just cause or death, and within sixty days following the date of termination for just cause or \nresignation. If stock options are not exercised within such time, they expire.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the compensation expense related to its stock-based \ncompensation and recognizes the expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\nThe following table shows the weighted average fair values per stock option along with the assumptions incorporated into the \nvaluation models for options granted, for the year-ended December 31:\n2022\n2021\nWeighted average fair value per option\n$\t\n5.35\n$\t\n3.63\nExpected term (1)\n5 years\n5 years\nRisk-free interest rate (2)\n 1.79%\n0.60% \nExpected dividend yield (3)\n 4.55%\n 5.00%\nExpected volatility (4)\n 18.87%\n19.14%\n(1)\t The expected term of the option awards is calculated based on historical exercise behaviour and represents the period of time that the options are expected \nto be outstanding.\n(2) \t Based on the Bank of Canada five-year government bond yields.\n(3) \t Incorporates current dividend rates and historical dividend increase patterns.\n(4) \t Estimated using the five-year historical volatility."

The range of exercise prices for the \noptions outstanding as at December 31, 2022 was $32.35 to $60.03 (2021 – $32.35 to $60.03).\nSHARE UNIT PLANS\nThe Company has DSU, PSU and RSU plans. The plans and the liabilities are marked-to-market at the end of each period based on \nan average common share price at the end of the period.\nDeferred Share Unit Plans \nUnder the Directors’ DSU plan, Directors of the Company may elect to receive all or any portion of their compensation in DSUs \nin lieu of cash compensation, subject to requirements to receive a minimum portion of their annual retainer in DSUs. Directors’ \nfees are paid on a quarterly basis and, at the time of each payment of fees, the applicable amount is converted to DSUs. A DSU \nhas a value equal to one Emera common share. When a dividend is paid on Emera’s common shares, the Director’s DSU account \nis credited with additional DSUs. DSUs cannot be redeemed for cash until the Director retires, resigns or otherwise leaves the \nBoard. The cash redemption value of a DSU equals the market value of a common share at the time of redemption, pursuant \nto the plan. Following retirement or resignation from the Board, the value of the DSUs credited to the participant’s account is \ncalculated by multiplying the number of DSUs in the participant’s account by Emera’s closing common share price on the date \nDSUs are redeemed.\nUnder the executive and senior management DSU plan, each participant may elect to defer all or a percentage of their annual \nincentive award in the form of DSUs with the understanding, for participants who are subject to executive share ownership \nguidelines, a minimum of 50 per cent of the value of their actual annual incentive award (25 per cent in the first year of the \nprogram) will be payable in DSUs until the applicable guidelines are met.\nWhen short-term incentive awards are determined, the amount elected is converted to DSUs, which have a value equal to the \nmarket price of an Emera common share. When a dividend is paid on Emera’s common shares, each participant’s DSU account \nis allocated additional DSUs equal in value to the dividends paid on an equivalent number of Emera common shares. Following \ntermination of employment or retirement, and by December 15 of the calendar year after termination or retirement, the value of \nthe DSUs credited to the participant’s account is calculated by multiplying the number of DSUs in the participant’s account by the \naverage of Emera’s stock closing price for the fifty trading days prior to a given calculation date. Payments are made in cash. \nIn addition, special DSU awards may be made from time to time by the Management Resources and Compensation Committee \n(“MRCC”), to selected executives and senior management to recognize singular achievements or by achieving certain \ncorporate objectives."

Variable Interest Entities\nEmera holds a variable interest in NSPML, a VIE for which it was determined that Emera is not the primary beneficiary since it \ndoes not have the controlling financial interest of NSPML. When the critical milestones were achieved, Nalcor Energy was deemed \nthe primary beneficiary of the asset for financial reporting purposes as it has authority over the majority of the direct activities \nthat are expected to most significantly impact the economic performance of the Maritime Link. Thus, Emera began recording the \nMaritime Link as an equity investment.\nBLPC has established a Self-Insurance Fund (“SIF”), primarily for the purpose of building a fund to cover risk against damage and \nconsequential loss to certain generating, transmission and distribution systems. ECI holds a variable interest in the SIF for which \nit was determined that ECI was the primary beneficiary and, accordingly, the SIF must be consolidated by ECI. In its determination \nthat ECI controls the SIF, management considered that, in substance, the activities of the SIF are being conducted on behalf of \nECI’s subsidiary BLPC and BLPC, alone, obtains the benefits from the SIF’s operations. Additionally, because ECI, through BLPC, \nhas rights to all the benefits of the SIF, it is also exposed to the risks related to the activities of the SIF. Any withdrawal of SIF fund \nassets by the Company would be subject to existing regulations. Emera’s consolidated VIE in the SIF is recorded as “Other long-\nterm assets”, “Restricted cash” and “Regulatory liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts included in restricted \ncash represent the cash portion of funds required to be set aside for the BLPC SIF.\nThe Company has identified certain long-term purchase power agreements that meet the definition of variable interests as \nthe Company has to purchase all or a majority of the electricity generation at a fixed price. However, it was determined that the \nCompany was not the primary beneficiary since it lacked the power to direct the activities of the entity, including the ability to \noperate the generating facilities and make management decisions.\nThe following table provides information about Emera’s portion of material unconsolidated VIEs:\nAs at\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021 \nmillions of dollars\nTotal Assets\nMaximum\nExposure to \nLoss\nTotal Assets\nMaximum\nExposure to \nLoss\nUnconsolidated VIEs in which Emera has variable interests\nNSPML (equity accounted)\n$\t\n501\n$\t\n6\n$\t\n533\n$\t\n 11\n33.
